TI PRECOCIOUS ADULT BEHAVIOUR IN YOUNG CHICK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Chicks of the domestic fowl, excited by thrusts from a solid object, will usually attempt to leap on top. If allowed to mount, 20-30% of males copulate, as do a much smaller percentage of females. A diet used to control for possible exogenous steroids had no effect on incidence of copulation, and comb size (index of androgen level) showed no correlation with copulation. Copulation was also demonstrated in chicks of a second strain of fowl (gamecock) and 2 species of pheasant. The absence of early experience with a moving object (up to 8 days isolation) did not decrease the percentage of copulators, as compared to chicks exposed briefly to moving objects; 48 hr. continuous exposure to other chicks did increase this percentage significantly. Testosterone greatly increased percentage of male copulators but not of female. Early experience of an imprinting object may affect the adult choice of a sexual partner because the early experience involves activation of the neural substrate for copulation.

TI EFFECT ON GROWTH AND BEHAVIOUR OF REHABILITATING FIRST AND 2ND
   GENERATION LOW PROTEIN RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two experiments are described in which Albino rats fed on a low protein diet were rehabilitated on a laboratory diet containing a higher percentage of protein. In the one experiment, rehabilitation commenced at weaning with rats whose mothers had been fed the low protein diet. In the second experiment, female rats were fed the low protein diet for 2 successive generations and the rehabilitation diet for one generation. Hall''s open field test, the Hebb-Williams test and a number of infant developmental tests were used. The results show that retardation in growth and development became more marked as successive generations were reared on the low protein diet. Feeding first generation low protein rats the rehabilitation diet from weaning facilitated their growth, but their problem solving was poorer than that of normal rats. Feeding second generation low protein rats the rehabilitation diet from weaning and retaining both them and their offspring on the rehabilitation diet did not eliminate all the effects of the low protein diet. The rats remained retarded in growth, development and intelligence. It is concluded that a low protein diet fed to one generation of rats affected the growth and development of the next generation. In rehabilitating low protein rats more than one generation may have to be fed on a high plane of nutrition before all the effects are overcome.

Copulation is initiated on the ground or some other surface with the male first assuming a position on the back of the female facing the same direction, and after inserting his genitalia dismounting and then facing in the opposite direction. Mating pairs may then fly, the female pulling the generally smaller male behind her. Such flight may be elicited by interference by humans or by the pounc-ings of conspecific males. The copulatory flight probably evolved as an escape mechanism from predators and secondarily from conspecific males. Unlike the alternative solution of rapid separation of the pair, this flight favors the existence of genitalia which cannot be dislodged by rival males which frequently pounce on copulating pairs.

TI PARAMETERS AFFECTING ADAPTATION TO AND RETENTION OF OPEN-FIELD
   ELIMINATION IN RAT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB CBE rats (Carworth) of 23, 40 and 70 days of age were tested weekly or twice daily in an open field. Masses tests (twice daily) required more trials to adapt that distributed (weekly) trials, although distributed subjects required longer in total time. The younger the subjects, the more trials they required. Retention tests 150 and 225 days following adaptation suggest that subjects which adapt most rapidly show greater emotionality as measured by number of boluses. Accordingly, Experiment 2 used rats of either 23, 40 or 70 days of age and gave subjects either 20, 40 or 60 open-field tests. Retention was again measured after 150 and 225 days. The results show that the fewer the number of trials, the more emotional the subjects were at retention. It is suggested that retention of emotional behavior is a function of both constitutional and experiential factors. (Totaln = 244.).

AB The visual cliff apparatus was used to investigate depth perception in 5 strains of mice. Positive responses indicative of visual depth discrimination were obtained in 4 strains, the 5th strain, with retinal degeneration, gave almost equal negative and positive reactions and showed no avoidance of the visual cliff or side preference. Depth perception was therefore absent in this strain. No significant differences between strains with pigmented and non-pigmented retinas were obtained with the apparatus and techniques employed.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two groups of frogs (Rana pipiens) were stimulated 100 times daily for 12 days with a No. 10 von Frey bristle. In one group, the locus of stimulation was maintained within the general area which elicits the wiping reflex of the ipsilateral hind foot. In the other group, the same reflex movement was elicited from a carefully delimited spot within the reflexogenous zone which was maintained from day to day on the basis of skin markings. In the former group the rate of responding increased from day to day, while in the latter group, habituation to the repeated stimulation occurred. These results were interpreted to mean that habituation depends upon not only eliciting the same response with a series of repeated, nonreinforced stimuli, but that it is necessary as well to insure that the nature and location of the stimulus is repeated as closely as possible.

TI EFFECT OF MANIPULATORY INCENTIVE ON SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OF RHESUS
   MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A manipulatory object (piece of rope) was introduced into the home cages of 5 pairs of adolescent rhesus monkeys to determine the change in the form and frequency of social responses from that of the normal social activity shown by the pairs. The length of the rope was varied (10 inches and 36 inches) to determine the effect of this variable on competitive interactions. The following results were obtained: competition significantly reduced social contact between animals: during competition threat and aggression replaced huddling and grooming; below 70s F, huddling was inversely related to temperature during noncompetitive testing; there was greater sharing with the longer rope and greater aggression with the shorter rope (there was little difference in the frequency of threat behavior as a function of rope length; dominant S''s showed significantly more threat and aggression under both rope conditions than did subordinate S''s. This study suggests that manipulatory incentives, which are not con-subable, may be more advantageous than food incentives for studying the continuous, competitive social interactions of young rhesus monkeys.

AB In species expressing parental care, juveniles often utilize cues from their parents to distinguish between safe and dangerous situations. For example, nestling songbirds beg in response to parental feeding cues but stop vocalizing in response to parental alarm calls. Previous studies have shown that nestling birds discriminate between calls of their own and other species. However, it is unknown whether and how nestlings discriminate call variation across populations within their own species. Adult pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, produce acoustically identical calls at a fast rate when a predator is nearby, and slowly during feeding visits, potentially signalling the level of danger near the nest. Taking advantage of this functional duality, our study examines whether nestling discrimination of call variation across populations depends on the context in which they are produced. In response to rapidly repeated predator-associated calls, we found that nestlings reduced begging activity similarly, whether calls were from local or foreign populations. Conversely, in response to slowly repeated feeding-associated calls, nestlings begged more in response to local than foreign conspecific calls. Our results show that nestlings discriminate within-species call variation but adjust their response threshold depending on the call context, which we argue may optimize their begging activity in order to get fed, while simultaneously avoiding predation. This study underscores the importance of studying the effects of within-species variation in nonmating signals, such as calls, on songbird behaviour. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

AB Alarm calling is an important antipredator behaviour by which individuals alert conspecifics and heterospecifics of possible danger and/or ward off potential predators. The propensity to utter calls may reflect the amount of risk an individual experiences and a variety of other internal and environmental factors that may be context and species specific. However, whether the propensity to utter alarm calls is heritable has not been studied. Using a quantitative genetic animal model, we estimated the heritability of alarm calling in yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. We found significant heritability in the propensity to utter naturally elicited alarm calls (0.06) and trap-elicited alarm calls when marmots were trapped (0.21). There was a small but significant genetic correlation between these traits (0.338). Together, these results show that the propensity to utter alarm calls is individually variable and context dependent and can evolve in response to natural selection. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

AB Olfaction and vision can play important roles in optimizing foraging decisions of birds, enabling them to maximize their net rate of energy intake while searching for, handling and consuming food. Parrots have been used extensively in avian cognition research, and some species use olfactory cues to find food. Here we used machine-learning analysis and pose estimation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to elucidate the relative importance of visual and olfactory cues for informing foraging decisions in the rosy-faced lovebird, Agapornis roseicollis, as a nontypical model species. In a binary choice experiment, we used markerless body pose tracking to analyse bird response behaviours. Rosy-faced lovebirds quickly learnt to discriminate the feeder provisioned with food by forming an association with visual (red/green papers) but not olfactory (banana/almond odour) cues. When visual cues indicated the provisioned and empty feeders, feeder choice was more successful, hesitation time shorter and interest in the empty feeder significantly lower. Our findings reveal that lovebirds can rapidly learn novel visual cues but not olfactory cues, indicating that vision plays a more important role in their learning and foraging decisions than olfaction.

AB Vocal communication is broadly distributed in a wide range of nonhuman animal species and is hypothesized to play an important role in mate attraction, territory defence, predator avoidance and parental care. Understanding the ecological and social drivers of vocal communication is key to enhancing our understanding of the evolution of social structures, mating systems and group dynamics. We reviewed 130 studies investigating vocal communication in the family of corvids. As oscine passerines, living in complex and flexible social systems and a wide range of ecological systems (e.g. different habitats, trophic niches), corvids present a key model group in advancing our understanding of evolutionary drivers of vocal communication. Here, we outline empirical evidence for vocal learning, ecological adaptation (e.g. calls encoding information about predator type) and social adaptation (e.g. vocalizations for group cohesion and coordination) in corvid vocalizations and behavioural responses of receivers to calls. Only 35 out of 128 (27%) of corvid species have been studied with regards to their vocal communication. While some species, like American crows, common ravens and Eurasian magpies, are well studied, and supporting evidence for vocal learning and ecological as well as social adaptations is available, most corvid species remain poorly studied. We hope our review will inspire future work on previously underinvestigated corvid species, as well as replications of previous research with standardized observational and experimental paradigms, to allow for direct comparison between different corvid species. More broadly, further research systematically investigating social and ecological factors driving variation in vocal communication systems is necessary to further advance our general understanding of animal vocal communication.

AB An animal's behavioural traits can influence the outcomes of ecological interactions within their food web, including what they eat, their vulnerability to predation and who they compete with. Despite this, few studies have directly measured links between among-individual behavioural and trophic variation. Invasive species like the round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, are often found to have consistent amongindividual differences in behaviour within and between populations across their invasion front. Therefore, an individualized approach to invasive populations and their ecological interactions may be valuable to understanding their impacts on recipient ecosystems. Using nonlethal methods to measure trophic variation (i.e. stable isotope analysis via fin clips) and passive individual tagging, we analysed behavioural trait/personality variation and trophic variation to explore links between the two. Focusing on an established population of round gobies in the Guldborgsund strait in the southwest Baltic Sea, we found significant among-individual variation in bold-exploratory traits in novel environment and refuge emergence assays. We also found strong intraspecific trophic variation, with particularly high variation in carbon-12 - carbon-13 (d13C), suggesting that individual round gobies differ in what they are feeding on and/or where they forage. Diet reconstruction results support previous studies showing that gastropods and bivalves are major contributors to their diet, but the large differences in isotope values suggest that individual variation influences how they interact with prey communities. There were few links between behavioural and trophic variation; nevertheless, this study shows that measuring behavioural-trophic links is a viable approach for exploring whether and how behavioural traits may influence individual level ecological variation.

AB In primates, it is proposed that social play assists in maintaining social relationships as well as developing motor and cognitive skills. The structure and functions of social play vary greatly by species, but such variation does not strongly follow a phylogenetic pattern, suggesting that socioecological factors must also be examined. Using 3 years of data collected across three troops of wild vervet monkeys in South Africa, we explored play partner preferences and examined their relationship with relevant socioecological factors and vervet natural history to test the motor-training hypothesis and social skills hypotheses. Following the motor-training hypothesis, we hypothesized that we would find similar play frequencies across sexes, given that this species is characterized by high levels of aggression in both males and females. We did not find support for this hypothesis, as male-male dyads played at a higher frequency than female-female and mixed-sex dyads. As predicted by social skills hypotheses, individuals were more likely to play with others of similar dominance rank and with kin over nonkin, indicating that social play may serve social functions, such as testing or establishing dominance relationships, navigating rank trajectory and affiliation maintenance among kin. However, contrary to social skills hypotheses, our study did not consistently support all proposed affiliative aspects, as we found no evidence that vervets play preferentially with grooming partners or individuals of close proximity. Overall, our study contributes insights into the functions and patterns of social play in this specific primate species and underscores the broader importance of considering social and ecological factors in understanding the complexities of social play behaviour. We address critical gaps in our knowledge and provide potential directions for future research that would contribute to a more holistic understanding of primate social dynamics. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB In species exhibiting egg attendance, parents remain with their eggs, protecting them against harsh abiotic conditions, such as dehydration or drowning, and biotic conditions, such as predation, parasitism and diseases. This form of postoviposition parental care is widely observed in animals, including amphibians. Long -term egg attendance (spanning several days) is common among glass frogs, and removal experiments have demonstrated the critical role of the parent, whether male or female, in increasing egg survival. However, in a few glass frog species, females stay close to their eggs for less than 3 h after oviposition. Previous studies have found that maternal presence reduces dehydration and predation despite the short duration of this attendance behaviour. In the emerald glass frog, Espadarana prosoblepon , females remain close to their eggs for less than 1.5 h after oviposition. Given that the embryonic development period in this species spans an average of 25 days, our main question was whether remaining with the clutch for only 0.15% of this time is suf ficient to increase egg survival. To address this question, we conducted a female removal experiment in semicaptivity and found no evidence that female presence improved egg hydration after oviposition. In a maternal commitment behavioural assay, most females promptly abandoned their clutches when subjected to a gentle disturbance and did not return to them. Lastly, a female removal experiment under field conditions revealed that clutches with and without mothers experienced similar levels of mortality, primarily caused by invertebrate predators. Through a series of experimental assays, we demonstrate that the short -term female presence in E. prosoblepon did not increase egg survival. Therefore, we argue that the postoviposition behaviour observed in this species cannot be considered parental care behaviour. Our findings challenge the assumption that the proximity of parents and their eggs is an unequivocal indicator of parental care. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal personality should be highly relevant to recovery of species following habitat restoration, but empirical evaluations remain scarce. In the Chihuahuan Desert of the southwestern United States and globally, grasslands are threatened with shrub encroachment, prompting landscape-scale restoration efforts to remove shrubs and improve habitat for grassland species. We examined the behavioural response of a keystone rodent of grasslands, banner-tailed kangaroo rats, Dipodomys spectabilis, to extensive shrub removal efforts in New Mexico, U.S.A. We captured individuals from replicated restoration and remnant grassland habitats and used standardized behavioural assays to determine whether D. spectabilis exhibits personality and whether it varies between restoration and remnant habitats. We also conducted a movement experiment using artificial shrubs to test whether personality mediates movement choices through shrub cover, which could be a mechanism contributing to the colonization dynamics of restoration sites. We found repeatable differences among individuals for multiple behaviours, including movements, providing evidence of personality. We also documented a syndrome in which bolder and more active individuals moved through movement trials quicker, indicating personality-dependent movement. Dipodomys spectabilis also exhibited personality-dependent movement through artificial shrub cover, suggesting the choice to move through shrublands may depend on personality. This result could have consequences for colonization dynamics of restoration sites if a subset of individuals is more likely to traverse low-quality shrublands and settle in habitats treated for shrub removal. Surprisingly, there was weak divergence in behavioural traits at the population level between restoration sites and remnant grasslands. This outcome could reflect personality-dependent colonization early in the restoration trajectory being eroded by subsequent gene flow and facilitation of alternative behavioural types. We hope our study will stimulate future research integrating animal personality with habitat restoration to benefit biodiversity in degraded ecosystems. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB The process of organizing and interpreting sensory information, known as perceptual processing, is a key feature of adaptation allowing animals to integrate, assess and cope with challenges in their environments. Here, we examined the durations of vigilance bouts and stares in bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, as an indicator of time spent vigilant and perceptual processing, respectively. We tested the extent to which vigilance was shaped by relevant ecological factors, focusing on predation risk. Specifically, we tested whether stare duration increased when sheep were younger, part of smaller groups, further from others, further from escape terrain or closer to obstructive cover, all of which are expected to affect individual predation risk. Perceptual processing in bighorn sheep conformed to the 1-4 s perceptual window found in other mammals, consistent with the idea of a phylogenetically conserved mechanism across mammalian species but was variable within individuals, indicating that perceptual processing is plastic to relevant ecological contexts. As expected, stare duration was much shorter than vigilance bout duration. Stare duration increased with decreasing distance to obstructive cover, which could indicate perceptual processing costs of searching for cryptic predators. We also found a significant difference in vigilance bout duration between the sexes: age was positively correlated with vigilance bout duration in males but not in females. Vigilance bout durations were longer when animals were further from escape terrain. Neither group size nor distance to other individuals was associated with stare or bout durations.

AB The ability to manage aggression in social animals is crucial for maintaining stable group dynamics. Triadic postconflict contacts (TC) are widespread behavioural strategies across mammal species consisting of affiliative contacts provided spontaneously by a third party or bystander towards the victim or the aggressor of a previous conflict (unsolicited triadic contacts, UTC) or upon request by one of them (solicited, STC). Depending on the target, the social context and the relationship quality shared by the interacting agents, TC's functions can range from bystander self-protection to victim comfort with the ultimate outcome of maintaining group cohesion. Evidence suggests that TCs are strongly affected by social styles, with despotic species engaging less frequently in such behaviours. Here, we tested hypotheses on the presence, modulation and possible functions of UTC and STC in a group of rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, a highly despotic species. For the first time, we found that bystanders spontaneously provided affiliation to both victims and aggressors. In contrast, we did not find any significant evidence for STC. Macaques seem to be sensitive to potential risks implied in providing post- conflict affiliation to victims and aggressors (e.g. age, arousal). To some extent, UTC decreased the probability of bystanders being the target of redirection. UTC coincides with consolation when bystanders direct affiliation mainly towards 'friend' victims, when they perceive the negative affective state of the victim (measured by screaming), and when affiliation reduces the victim's distress (measured by self-scratching). Our data support the first two criteria but not the last one. Bystanders' spontaneous motivation to offer affiliation to victims of aggression in M. mulatta goes beyond the social constraints associated with the species' despotic style suggesting that several factors can affect the emergence of prosocial behaviours also in despotic-intolerant species.<br /> (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Animals exist in a world that is replete with sensory information. Not all of this sensory information is relevant to the organism at a given time, though. Understanding how animals are able to pick out 'the signal from the noise' has been of interest to behaviour and neuroscience researchers for decades. This problem may be especially challenging when the conflicting sensory 'noise' is also a conspecific signal, given that organisms often show heightened sensitivity to conspecific cues. We challenged nurse honey bees who were performing larval caretaking behaviours with honey bee alarm pheromone, a conspecific cue that they are able to detect but show low behavioural sensitivity to compared with other honey bee workers like guards and soldiers. We found that nurse bees that originated from high-aggression colonies decreased their larval caretaking behaviours in the presence of alarm pheromone, while nurses from low-aggression colonies did not show this change. Our work highlights the importance of considering social context when examining how organisms respond in the face of a sensory-rich world.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB An animal's capacity for innovation or solving novel problems likely has important implications for how quickly they can adapt to environmental change. Asian elephants, Elephas maximus, living in zoos have previously demonstrated a capacity to innovate, but problem solving has never been studied experimentally in a wild elephant population. We installed puzzle boxes with multiple possible solutions inside a protected area in western Thailand to determine individual variation in innovation, as well as other behavioural traits associated with elephants' problem solving, including persistence, exploratory diversity and neophilia. We recorded 77 elephants approaching the puzzle box, with 44 interacting with the box in their first exposure. Individuals varied widely in their success opening the doors of the puzzle box. Such success was influenced by persistence and exploratory diversity in both the first interaction as well as across multiple interactions. However, when considering each individual's overall innovation scores, which represented how many different doors elephants were able to open across all of their interactions with the puzzle box, only greater persistence and interaction number were associated with reaching a higher innovation score. We observed that elephants who interacted with the box multiple times learned to open a door of any type more quickly as their interactions increased, but we did not see evidence of learning to open specific door types over time. Overall, this study about how innovation and its associated behaviours vary in wild elephants not only informs our understanding of how a capacity for problem solving is expressed, but also how well elephants may be able to adapt to, overcome or avoid increasingly frequent interactions with humans within their natural habitat.

AB Across human and animal societies, punishment is used as a means of responding to cheating and modifying the behaviour of others. A growing body of work shows that human punishment decisions involve representing both the outcomes of transgressions as well as whether a transgressor chose to do wrong. An important question in comparative cognition is whether nonhuman animals demonstrate a similar sensitivity to choice when punishing. Understanding whether and to what extent animals inte-grate information about choice into their punishment decisions can shed light on the selective pressures and cognitive mechanisms that shape punishment. Here we explore this question by comparing pun-ishment in cooperative pairs of reef-dwelling cleaner wrasses, Labroides dimidiatus, and humans, Homo sapiens. In study 1, we investigate whether punishment in adult male cleaners is influenced by whether females had a choice to cheat. In study 2, we ask the same question of human adults, using a novel task inspired by the cooperative interactions between pairs of cleaners and their client fish. Our results support previous work finding that punishment of cheating in humans is sensitive to whether trans-gressors chose to cheat: they punished more when the alternative option was cooperation. However, we did not find a similar sensitivity to alternative options in cleaners. Our results provide a direct com-parison of the role of alternative options in punishment decisions in humans and a distantly related cooperative species. We suggest that important cognitive constraints may be in place that limit cleaners' ability to simultaneously represent both the choice a transgressor makes as well as the choices they could have made.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Boldness, defined as the behavioural response of individuals when facing a risky situation, is a major personality trait and often phenotypically correlates with other behavioural traits, in particular aggres-siveness, exploration behaviour and neophobia. Yet, whether such links result from among-individual correlations, i.e. form behavioural syndromes sensu stricto, is often ignored and whether such syn-dromes may yield individual fitness benefits, and thus be selected for, remains poorly explored. We measured boldness as the nest defence behaviour against a dummy nest predator in a natural population of a small passerine bird, the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, and investigated the existence of a behavioural syndrome between boldness and two other behavioural traits, aggressiveness (measured as the agonistic response to competitors) and neophobia (measured as the behavioural response to a novel object in a known environment). Then we assessed the links between this potential syndrome and reproductive success, measured as fledging and recruitment success. Boldness score differed between the sexes and depended on whether the partner was present during the test. Nevertheless, it was repeatable, showing that boldness can be considered as a personality trait in our population. We found a positive among-individual correlation between boldness and aggressiveness, showing the existence of a behav-ioural syndrome between both personality traits. This syndrome was related to reproductive success: the number of fledged young (but not recruitment probability) increased with one integrative value of the boldness-aggressiveness syndrome. Conversely, boldness score was not correlated with neophobia. Our results thus clearly reveal a behavioural syndrome between boldness and aggressiveness with possible consequences for reproductive success in the study population, and therefore raise the question of the evolutionary implications of such a behavioural syndrome.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal personality results from a complex interplay between consistent individual differences in behaviour and behavioural plasticity in response to environmental variation and can have significant impacts on intraspecific interactions. Littoraria irrorata, the marsh periwinkle, is an important consumer in salt marsh ecosystems and can directly influence marsh health, primarily through its interaction with its main predator, the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Here we examine the roles of behavioural type, plasticity and predictability in shaping the antipredator responses of L. irrorata across environmental contexts (i.e. with and without a predator cue). Specifically, we examine changes in measures of boldness: climbing height and time out of refuge, as well as their association with shell morphology. We found that snails exhibited different behavioural types along a bold-shy continuum and that they were correlated across traits. Snails also differed in the shape of their reaction norm and their degree of predictability, both of which were correlated with behavioural type: shy snails climbed higher, spent more time in the refuge and were less plastic and more predictable. Although shell length and size class did not influence snail behaviour, aperture size was strongly linked to key aspects of snail personality, as snails with larger apertures were less bold, less plastic and more predictable. Personality thus appears to be related to certain features of shell morphology and is consistent with phenotypic compensation, where individuals invest in more pronounced morphological defences to compensate for a riskier lifestyle. Given that personality can often determine an individual's growth, development and probability of predation, understanding its role in various ecological contexts, such as population dynamics and predator-prey relationships, is critical.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The benefits of parental care are often seen as a cornerstone of family life evolution. However, recent studies show that sibling interactions can also confer substantial benefits to juveniles. Here, we tested a new hypothesis suggesting that the need for juveniles to access sibling interactions may encourage ju-veniles to remain in a family group, thereby consolidating the early stages of family life evolution when parental care is facultative. We set up juveniles of the European earwig, Forficula auricularia (a family-living insect in which maternal care is facultative and juveniles can forage for themselves and coop-erate with siblings) either alone, with siblings, or with siblings and their mother, and then quantified effects on the development, morphology and four fitness-related behaviours of the resulting adults. We found that isolated juveniles reached adulthood more quickly and that these adults were overall larger but showed impaired aggregation behaviour when compared with juveniles raised together with siblings or with siblings and their mother. By contrast, sibling deprivation did not affect offspring survival, male forceps length (an ornament involved in reproductive success) and three other behaviours in adults (boldness, general activity and exploration). All these results were independent of adult sex, although females overall reached adulthood earlier and were larger than males. Altogether, our findings suggest that the potential benefits of sibling interactions measured in this study play a minor role in the maintenance of earwig family life. They also emphasize the need to study the evolutionary drivers of family life in species where all members can switch from family to solitary life, a scenario that probably prevailed in the early evolution of sociality.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB According to the sperm competition risk (SCR) model, males should increase their investment in ejac-ulates when there is a high chance that their sperm will compete for fertilization with those from another male. However, as ejaculates are energetically costly to produce, the extent to which males can adjust ejaculate investment may depend on the availability of metabolic resources. We tested these ideas using the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a livebearing fish known to exhibit strong condition dependence in ejaculate traits and among the highest recorded polyandry rates in any vertebrate. Specifically, we manipulated SCR by visually exposing mature males to females either in the presence (high SCR) or absence (low SCR) of a rival male over 1 month, which comprises a full spermatogenic cycle. To test for condition dependence in male response to SCR, both groups were further subdivided into two diet quantity treatments (high and low), enabling us to test fixed and interactive effects of SCR and diet treatment on ejaculate expenditure (sperm production, sperm length and sperm velocity). Contrary to our predictions, we found no evidence that males increase ejaculate expenditure under high SCR, and indeed report the opposite pattern (higher expenditure under low SCR) for sperm velocity. Furthermore, we found no evidence that dietary restriction (when administered to mature adult males over 1 month) affected any ejaculate traits, leading us to suspect that ejaculates may only be susceptible to dietary restriction effects during a critical ontogenetic stage of development. We discuss these unexpected findings in the context of guppy biology, which may render the species less likely to exhibit long-term adjustments in ejaculates when perceiving short-term changes in SCR. Moreover, the high polyandry rates in this species may mean that the visual presence of a rival is a cue of altered sperm competition intensity, rather than risk.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Biparental care occurs when males and females cooperate to care for their joint offspring. It is associated with sexual conflict because the benefits stem from the combined effort of both parents, while any costs depend on each parent's own effort. Thus, biparental care involves a delicate balance between cooper-ation and conflict. Shifts in this balance are likely to be driven by environmental conditions that alter the costs and benefits to males and females. Here, we used the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides to investigate whether the presence of conspecific intruders shifts the balance towards cooperation (detected as an increase in the duration of biparental care relative to uniparental care) or alters the magnitude of sex differences in care, and whether any such effects are dependent on resources available for breeding. We found that the presence or absence of conspecific intruders had no effect on the duration of biparental care relative to uniparental care. Thus, there was no evidence that the presence of intruders caused a shift towards more cooperation. Females, but not males, responded to the presence of conspecific intruders by increasing their time spent providing one form of care, but only when breeding on larger resources. Thus, there was some evidence that the presence of intruders altered the magnitude of sex differences in care and that this was conditional upon the amount of resources available for breeding. Overall, our results show that threats from conspecific intruders alters sex differences in parental care, while not changing the balance between cooperation and conflict.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Maternal strategies reflect the trade-off between offspring needs and maternal ability to invest, a concept described by the evolutionary theory of parent-offspring conflict. In mammals this conflict has often been investigated by studying weaning, the transition from maternal milk consumption to dietary independence. An investigation of individual variation in weaning can provide information on the adaptive significance of maternal strategies in relation to social and biological variables. We analysed stable nitrogen isotopes of hair samples collected from 22 mother-infant dyads in a wild population of chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, in conjunction with behavioural data on suckling, to explore the temporal dynamics of weaning, as well as the extent and determinants of individual variation in these dynamics. The weaning pattern suggested by isotope values and behavioural data were congruent. The difference between infant and mother stable nitrogen isotope values decreased faster with age in infants of low-ranking mothers, which suggests a faster progression towards weaning, perhaps due to subordinate females experiencing lower resource availability and so being less able to bear the costs of lactation over prolonged periods. Additionally, within-infant variation in stable nitrogen isotope values showed an increase with age (which was not detectable between infants), potentially highlighting the nutritional costs that weaning imposes on offspring. Our combination of isotope analysis and behavioural data from a wild population provides insight into the evolution of maternal strategies. In particular, it suggests that the quantity of care a mother can provide is affected by her rank, with subordinate females possibly not able to lactate for as long and perhaps benefiting from weaning earlier.

AB Divorce among serially monogamous birds can lead to increased reproductive success if an individual obtains a higher-quality mate or nest site, or it can lead to lower reproductive success due to lack of pair experience or reduced breeding opportunities. Identifying the drivers and consequences of mate retention and divorce are necessary then to understand population dynamics, particularly as animals may alter behaviours in response to climate-induced environmental changes. We used a 33-year data set from a declining Magellanic penguin, Spheniscus magellanicus, colony to identify drivers of mate reten-tion and divorce and test whether the nature of those drivers differed between first-year and long-term pairs. In a pair's first year, breeding outcome was the most important predictor of whether mates would reunite: failure rates were high and 71% of first-year pairs divorced on the whole, but only 47% of pairs that fledged a chick divorced. For long-term pairs, both breeding outcome and between-season changes to nest quality were the most important predictors of whether a pair stayed together: pairs that had a chick hatch or fledge divorced at lower rates than those that failed at the egg stage, and pairs whose nest quality declined were more likely to divorce. We also examined the fitness consequences of divorce by comparing the rates at which females and males obtained new mates and fledged chicks in the following year. Although females were more likely than males to secure a new mate, both sexes experienced similarly increased reproductive success with their new mates compared to their old mates, showing that divorce is adaptive.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Space is a limited resource in which many animals need to perform basic functions such as feeding and reproducing. Competition over access to space can induce a variety of behaviours that may result in differential access to crucial resources related to survival and fitness. The Aegean wall lizard, Podarcis erhardii, is a colour-polymorphic lizard that inhabits dry stone walls where they access food, safely thermoregulate, shelter from predators and interact with other lizards. Many colour-polymorphic species have morphs with distinct behavioural strategies, which may play a role in morph evolution and maintenance. Here, we conducted the first behavioural experiments on P. erhardii colour morphs. Our goal was to compare morph competitive ability and characterize morph differences in social behaviours using laboratory contest experiments over limited heated space on a stone wall in a neutral arena. Contest experiments revealed that colour morph, not size, predicted intermorph contest outcomes. White and yellow morphs were associated with winning and the orange morph was associated with losing contests. Male colour morphs exhibited different levels of aggressive, boldness, chemical signalling and visual signalling behaviours depending on which morph they were in contest with. White morphs always performed aggressive and scent-marking behaviours more frequently during contests with other morphs. Yellow morphs performed aggressive, bold, chemical signalling and visual signalling behaviours at intermediate frequencies relative to other morphs. Orange morphs performed aggressive behaviours equally often when in contest with yellow morphs but performed all other behaviours less frequently against yellow and white morphs. Considering these results, behavioural variation among P. erhardii colour morphs may promote morph maintenance.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Fission-fusion (FF) societies are characterized by frequent changes in group cohesion, composition or size. While the ecological and social drivers of group size are well acknowledged, their effect on FF dynamics is largely unknown, partly due to lack of suitable data sets spanning multiple individuals and spatiotemporal scales. Theory predicts that constraints imposed by local resource availability on group size can yield FF dynamics; yet it has not been applied in contexts other than foraging. In addition, FF dynamics are relatively understudied in nonmammalian vertebrates, although prevalent across taxa. To fill these conceptual and taxonomic gaps we tested predictions arising from current FF theory by tracking multiple Eurasian jackdaws, Coloeus monedula, for two seasons. Using active RFID (radio frequency identification) tags we monitored individual presence/absence over several temporal scales in sites of different ecological functions (nesting, foraging and roosting), and simultaneously quantified local resource availability in these sites. Group size was correlated with resource limitations operating at different ecological contexts and times. Social network analysis revealed remarkably consistent FF pat-terns which occurred on a diel cycle and changed between seasons, involving changes in group size and composition. Social preferences had a significant influence on FF patterns only during the breeding season and only in nesting and foraging contexts, mainly due to male-female bonds. Our results highlight the importance of ecological context, temporal scale and social preference in avian FF societies and broaden the scope of current theory.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social animals often coordinate behavioural activities for the gathering, maintenance and protection of resources. In eusocial insects, morphological and/or behavioural heterogeneity among worker caste allows division of labour and, in some instances, the specialization of individuals in specific tasks. In leafcutting ants (genus Atta), the division of labour is based on body size differences (alloethism), meaning that differently sized workers will likely perform different tasks. Although alloethism is now well understood during foraging and processing of food resources in Atta, the relationship between body size and aggressive response has been poorly investigated, and, so far, it is not well understood how different morphological subcastes are integrated into the defensive strategy. Here, we quantified conspecifc and heterospecific aggression, in a within-colony social context (inside the nest), aiming to test which worker size class (subcaste) exhibits the most aggressive response against non-nestmates (NNMs). Workers were divided into three distinct subcastes, minors, majors and soldiers, and reared in subcolonies containing two individuals of each subcaste, as well as brood and the symbiotic fungus. We found a low probability of aggression towards conspecific NNMs and a high probability towards heterospecific NNMs. Quantification of aggression across subcastes showed that minors directed the most overt physical attacks towards heterospecific NNMs. We suggest that the nest, where minors perform most of their tasks, might constitute a strong social contextual stimulus for them, lowering their response threshold and increasing their aggression towards foreign ants. We also suggest that possible signals (i.e. chemical or mechanical) emitted during interactions involving minors stimulate larger workers to engage in fights, a mechanism that has been demonstrated in other ant species. The integration of size-specific behavioural traits might constitute a very efficient defensive mechanism.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Costa's hummingbird has an extended sensitive phase of vocal learning
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID SONG; ACQUISITION; AGE
AB Vocal learning is an experience-dependent behaviour that requires exposure to appropriate vocalizations for learning to take place. The timing of this exposure potentially matters: early in life, the brain may have a sensitive phase in which it is plastic and can be altered by experience. Birds tutored during the sensitive phase should learn to sing the tutor song, while those tutored too early or too late should not. Hummingbirds have independently evolved vocal learning relative to parrots and passerines, but their sensitive phase has not been characterized. Here we tested whether Costa's hummingbirds, Calypte costae, have a sensitive phase. Sixteen males were raised in individual isolation and exposed to song under one of three different tutoring periods: 35-65 days posthatch, 75-105 days posthatch, or 115-145 days posthatch. Each bird received 20 h of tutoring with approximately 4000 song exposures over 30 days. As an adult, none of these birds produced isolate song (i.e. they all showed signs of learning), but none of the birds were a particularly good match to the tutor song either; many of the birds sang songs that were longer and more variable than the tutor song. There was no effect of tutoring period on the match between the experimental birds' songs to Costa's song. These results suggest that the sensitive phase begins before day 35 and continues until after age 115 days and that ~4000 songs over 20 h of tutoring is not sufficient for learning to be completed in Costa's hummingbird.

AB Play fighting, the most iconic form of social play, is often punctuated by specific signals, such as the relaxed open mouth (ROM) display, limiting the risk of misunderstanding between playmates. Although there is general consensus that the ROM of dogs is a ritualized version of play biting, the empirical demonstration of the actual ritualization of ROM has been lacking. We videorecorded and analysed 118 playful sessions involving 24 Czechoslovakian wolfdogs (12 females; 12 males), which is a breed of domestic dog, Canis lupus familiaris, showing wolf-like behavioural traits. By using an integrated approach of different techniques (dog facial action coding system, an unsupervised cluster analysis and the Levenshtein distance), we empirically demonstrate that the ROM is intrinsically different from the play biting action in this breed of dog. Contrary to the play bite, during ROM, the recruitment of muscular action units for each facial display was more consistent, conspicuous and intra- and interindividually stereotyped. Moreover, a sequential analysis revealed that the ROM usually preceded playful offensive patterns, thus underlining the real metacommunicative function of the signal. Finally, by running a linear mixed model, we found that the most balanced sessions were punctuated by the most prolonged performance of ROM, thus revealing the efficiency of the facial signal in maintaining a balanced session. In conclusion, through the processes of formalization, simplification and emphasis, an ordinary precursor behaviour (i.e. play biting) has been taken out of context and transformed into an extraordinary, derived behaviour (i.e. ROM) specifically designed to attract receivers' attention and modulate playful social interactions in dogs.

AB We used three years of house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus, song recordings spanning four decades in the introduced eastern range to assess how individual level cultural transmission mechanisms drive population level changes in birdsong. First, we developed an agent-based model (available as a new R package called ???TransmissionBias???) that simulates the cultural transmission of house finch song given different parameters related to transmission biases, or biases in social learning that modify the probability of adoption of particular cultural variants. Next, we used approximate Bayesian computation and machine learning to estimate what parameter values likely generated the temporal changes in diversity in our observed data. We found evidence that strong content bias, likely targeted towards syllable complexity, plays a central role in the cultural evolution of house finch song in the New York metropolitan area. Frequency and demonstrator biases appear to be neutral or absent. Additionally, we estimated that house finch song is transmitted with extremely high fidelity. Future studies can use our simulation framework to better understand how cultural transmission and population declines influence song diversity in wild populations. ?? 2021 The Author(s).

AB Sexual communication in mate choice scenarios involves nonmutually exclusive functions: species recognition, mate location and mate assessment. Most studies on sexual communication in mate choice have focused on female assessment of conspicuous male traits, such as visual and acoustic signals. Only a few studies have addressed male assessment of female traits, especially those that are inconspicuous to the human sensory system, such as chemical signals. Although chemical signals are important in sexual communication of many arachnids, there is a gap in our knowledge about how male scorpions use these signals to evaluate potential partners. Here we studied sexual communication functions in two scorpion species (Urophonius brachycentrus and Urophonius achalensis) with sympatric populations and synchronic reproduction, where males are under a scramble competition mating system. We addressed the volatile pheromones role in each of the sexual communication functions. We used Y-mazes to test volatile pheromones, exposing males to different female stimulus arrays in single-signal (conspecific only) and mixed-signal (conspecific and heterospecific) contexts. Males located conspecific females through volatile pheromones, and the time spent in proximity to the female was proportional to males' perception of the female's quality, reinforcing the pheromones' function in mate location and assessment in single-signal environments. However, these sexually selected functions were overridden in mixed signal contexts, in which males could not differentiate conspecific from heterospecific females, suggesting that pheromones do not allow species recognition. This interaction between sexual communication functions can lead to reproductive interference in this sympatric zone. Male indiscriminateness mediated by scramble competition could attenuate pheromones' species recognition function during mate choice. We provide a comprehensive study of the pheromones' role for mate and species recognition in different social contexts in scorpions. We found support for nonindependent and interacting functions of sexual communication, indicating that mate choice is a complex process in scorpions.

AB The transition from nestling to fledgling is a key moment in the development of altricial birds. Mortality immediately after fledging is typically high and selection should favour fledging strategies that maximize the chance of survival. While several studies have examined the influence of ecological conditions or nestling development on the timing of fledging, the question whether nestlings influence each other's behaviour has received little attention. We tested how fledging decisions of blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, nestlings depend on the behaviour of their nestmates. First, we show that in unmanipulated broods, fledging events within a nest were highly clustered and nestlings fledged closer in time to a sibling than expected if fledging events were independent of one another. We then experimentally tested whether nestlings adjust their timing of nest departure to the behaviour of their nestmates, by translocating nestlings to a brood that differed in age by 2 days. Nestlings that were 2 days younger than their adoptive brood advanced their fledging time such that they fledged close in time to a nestmate. Nestlings that were 2 days older than their adoptive brood significantly delayed their fledging time, but they were often the first to fledge and were not always followed close in time by a nestmate. We conclude that nestling blue tits have a strong propensity to leave the nest close in time to nestmates. The adaptive significance of this behaviour warrants further study. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB Animals create diverse structures, both individually and cooperatively, using materials from their envi-ronment. One striking example is the nests birds build for reproduction, which protect the offspring from external stressors such as predators and temperature, promoting reproductive success. To construct a nest successfully, birds need to make various decisions, for example regarding the nest material and their time budgets. Research has focused mainly on species where one sex is primarily responsible for building the nest. In contrast, the cooperative strategies of monogamous species in which both sexes contribute to nest building are poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of both sexes in nest building and fitness correlates of behaviour in wild, monogamous jackdaw pairs, Corvus monedula. We show that both partners contributed to nest building and behaved similarly, with females and males present in the nestbox for a comparable duration and transporting material to the nest equally often. However, while females spent more time constructing the nest, males tended to invest more time in vigilance, potentially as a means of coping with competition for nest cavities. These findings suggest a moderate degree of division of labour, which may facilitate cooperation. Moreover, some aspects of behaviour were related to proxies of reproductive success (lay date and egg volume). Females that contributed relatively more to bringing material laid earlier clutches and pairs that spent less time together in the nestbox had larger eggs. Thus, selection pressures may act on how nest-building pairs spend their time and cooperatively divide the labour. We conclude that cooperative nest building in birds could be associated with monogamy and obligate biparental care and provides a vital but relatively untapped context through which to study the evolution of cooperation.

AB Signals often covary with physiological and behavioural traits to form an axis of integrated phenotypic variation associated with reproductive performance. This pattern of phenotypic integration could result from intrinsic between-individual differences that are causally related to signal production, physiology and behaviour. Alternatively, signal expression itself might generate feedback between physiology, behaviour and the experienced social environment, resulting in an integrated phenotype. We manipulated the plumage of female tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, to decouple the expression of a social signal from any pre-existing behavioural or physiological differences. We collected a time series of physiological samples, monitored nestbox visiting patterns with a sensor network and tracked reproductive performance. Relative to sham controls, dulled females' nests were visited more by conspecific females and less by males. Dulled females subsequently made fewer trips to other nestboxes and increased nestling provisioning. However, these changes in nestbox visiting patterns depended on both the focal female's pretreatment plumage and on the breeding stage. These differences resulted in an altered internal microbiome and glucose levels and, ultimately, dulled females produced more offspring. Moreover, dulled females produced larger clutches than control females in the year after the manipulation. Thus, signal variation alone - independent from any pre-existing differences - had a sustained causal effect on a suite of integrated traits. This finding suggests that dynamic feedback may play a role in coordinating an integrated signalling phenotype. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Male ornamentation, such as conspicuous male coloration, can evolve through female mate choice. Alternatively, in species without overt female mate preference, conspicuous male coloration can evolve as a badge of status via intrasexual selection to avoid costly fights or prevent mating attempts with other males. Here, we investigated the drivers of conspicuous male coloration in an ontogenetic colourchanging damselfly, Xanthagrion erythroneurum, where the juvenile males are yellow and change colour to red upon sexual maturity. We first showed that red males were chromatically and achromatically more conspicuous than the yellow males. We then quantified the condition of the males: red males were larger and in better condition than yellow males. We tested female preference in a choice experiment where we artificially manipulated male colour and found that females did not choose mates based on male coloration. We further tested whether the male coloration affected male-male interactions. We presented red and yellow males at the breeding site and measured behavioural responses from conspecific males and heterospecific (Ischnura heterosticta) males. Red males received less aggression from conspecifics and heterospecifics than yellow males. Our study experimentally showed that male conspicuousness is not a target of female mate choice in damselflies. Instead, intra- and interspecific male-male interactions appear to be the driver of its evolution.

AB We review the concepts of correlation and repeatability, as they are key components to studies of consistent individual differences in behaviour, commonly termed personality. These two concepts are widely used in an interchangeable way, which is sensible when studying consistency of behaviour within a single context. However, their quantitative values and qualitative meaning can diverge greatly when they are applied to understanding consistency of behaviour across contexts. Some scenarios exist where one is defined, and the other is not. Importantly, in scenarios where they are both defined, they need not be of the same sign. We provide an explicit mathematical analysis of the two concepts to disambiguate their meanings. Finally, we use an explicit, but simple, mathematical analysis to address the meaning of negative correlations across contexts, an issue that has been widely and conspicuously avoided to date in discussions of behavioural correlations. We hope that our mathematical investigation of the different aspects of consistent individual differences in behaviour encapsulated by correlations and repeatabilities can facilitate the application of these quantities in empirical studies of animal personality.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

   sentinel
ID BEHAVIOR; SAFE
AB In many cooperatively breeding species, one of the group members (called a sentinel) flies or climbs up occasionally to a high position, looks around and utters alarm calls if a predator approaches, while other group members are foraging. Bednekon (1997, American Naturalist, 150, 373-392; 2001, Annales Zoologici Fennici, 38, 5-14) game-theoretic model assumes that group members trade the need to forage against the advantages of earlier risk detection when sentinelling. The model predicts that in the presence of another sentinel which may provide timely alerts, a sentinel will terminate its sentinel bout earlier when its energy level drops below a threshold that is higher than the depletion threshold that would incentivize it to resume foraging if it were sentinelling alone. We propose a complementary hypothesis, that this effect of shortened sentinel duration in the presence of another sentinel will be more pronounced for subordinate group members, for whom the fierce competition they suffer while foraging gets attenuated when a groupmate sentinels. We tested these hypotheses in Arabian babbler, Argya squamiceps, groups by comparing sentinel activity under natural conditions vis-a-vis sentinel activity in a feeding experiment in which one or two individuals were fed. In natural conditions, dominant males not only acted as sentinels longer and more often, but they also initiated a larger share of their sentinel bouts when another group member was already on guard. Following experimental feeding ad libitum, in line with the game-theoretic predictions (1) the probability of starting a sentinel bout was not affected by the presence of another sentinel, nor by its sex or rank, and (2) sentinel bouts that terminated in the presence of another sentinel were significantly shorter than sentinel bouts ending alone. Our findings suggest that the seemingly systematic exchange of sentinels may be a consequence of differential needs and incentives rather than active coordination.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article

AB Animals often compete for resources and territory. Differences in size and body condition often play a crucial role in determining the outcome of these competitions. Web spiders not only create very costly semipermanent territories in the forms of their webs but have been shown able to gather myriad information from chemical cues present on silk. Furthermore, some web spiders are known to invade the webs of conspecifics in lieu of creating their own. We examined whether two pholcid spiders, Pholcus manueli and Pholcus phalangioides, use chemical information about the size and body condition of the web owner to inform their decisions when invading a foreign web. Specifically, we examined whether spiders could gather information about the size and hunger level of a conspecific and whether this information influenced their web-invading behaviour. We also examined whether washing webs with ethanol could remove these effects. We introduced spiders to webs built by conspecifics and recorded their latency to invade the webs. Pholcus manueli invaded webs built by larger conspecifics more slowly while P. phalangioides did not alter invasion latency to larger spiders' webs. Washing webs with ethanol removed this effect. Neither species' behaviour was affected by the hunger level of the web builder. Our results show that P. manueli can determine the size of a conspecific from chemical cues attached to silk and adjust their web invasion behaviour accordingly, but that P. phalangioides does not adjust its behaviour in response to such cues. Importantly, our web-washing results support that chemical cues and not web structure influenced invasion behaviour of P. manueli, giving us a powerful tool for future research. The species level differences suggest separate behavioural strategies between the two similar species and that these strategies may influence the outcome of competitions between the two.

AB Prey detection and selection by birds can be influenced by prey coloration. Whereas certain colours can indicate to predators the unpalatability of prey (i.e. aposematism), other colours can render prey cryptic against the background. However, there are discrepancies in the response of birds to prey coloration reported in different studies. Such discrepancies can be the result of geographical or temporal (e.g. seasonal) differences between studies if birds in different regions respond differently to coloration or if responses vary seasonally due to changes in bird composition. Experimental studies aiming to understand bird responses to prey colour should consider the effect of geographical variation while accounting for seasonal as well as interannual variability. We investigated the effects of colour on attack rates by exposing plasticine caterpillars of different colours to bird communities in 13 Mediterranean forests in central Spain for a period from 17 weeks to 7 months. Overall, yellow and green dummy caterpillars suffered the lowest attack rates. We also observed a bimodal pattern of bird attack rates through time, with highest predation occurring in late winter and summer (June to September). Low attack rates on yellow dummies are probably a consequence of aposematism, while low attack rates on green dummies probably resulted from crypsis. Rapid decreases in attack rates over time are probably a result of avoidance learning, whereas the increase in attacks in summer could be explained by the increase in fledglings and migrant birds.

AB Insect species display a large range of inter- and intraspecific variation in learning and memory retention. Variation in associative learning ability has also been reported for three species in the parasitoid wasp genus Nasonia, most notably between Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti, for which inbred isogenic strains have been established and studied intensively. We addressed the question how learning and memory of such isogenic strains compare to the phenotypes found in genetically diverse strains of these species. We recorded memory retention of both isogenic and genetically diverse strains of two species at 4-120 h after either olfactory or visual conditioning. Memory retention typically declined over time, but the pattern of decline differed consistently between strains. The isogenic N. vitripennis strain formed long-lasting (>5 days) memory, whereas the isogenic N. giraulti strain lost its memory after 48 h. Yet, genetically diverse strains of both species formed long-lasting memory. Memory retention patterns of strains were independent of sensory modality of the conditioned stimulus for all strains. These results show that there is variation for associative learning and memory within the two species, but not clear interspecies differences in memory retention. Without a better overview of the natural variation in learning abilities within a species, individual strains, especially isogenic strains with low genetic variability, are not necessarily representative of the species in general.

AB Social learning is widespread across the animal kingdom and used by individuals to acquire adaptive behaviour across a range of contexts, from mate choice to migration. However, while multiple studies have demonstrated the presence of social learning in different species across several taxa, less attention has been paid to explaining variation in this phenomenon between populations or individuals. Theoretical modelling has suggested age should be important, with social learning most adaptive during the juvenile phase. Yet, empirical studies testing the interaction between age and social learning are equivocal and scattered in the literature. Accordingly, we present here what we believe to be the first meta-analytical review of this body of work. Collating 57 experimental studies that tested social learning in a foraging context, we conducted a two-fold analysis. First, we examined whether learning success or rates were correlated with five possible variables: phylogeny, dispersal system, age at first reproduction (a conservative measure of extended juvenile periods), type of task or testing condition (captive individuals, wild individuals or wild individuals brought into captivity for testing). Second, we tested for interactions between age and these variables (28 studies). Our results did not support a clear direct relationship between age and social learning abilities. However, life history factors indirectly related to age (age at first reproduction and dispersal system) affected social learning propensity. Finally, social learning success was also correlated with factors related to the experiment itself (captive or wild origin of the animals and the type of task used to assess social learning).

AB Avian brood parasites are expected to select host nests according to characteristics that maximize offspring fitness, such as reduced probability of ectoparasitism. Spotless starlings, Sturnus unicolor, lay immaculate blue eggs that sometimes become brownish-spotted due to the activity of the ectoparasitic fly Carnus hemapterus on incubating birds. Therefore, conspecific parasitic females should adaptively avoid parasitizing nests with spotted eggshells. Here, we manipulated perceived risk of ectoparasitism by painting the eggs with either brown spots (similar to those due to ectoparasite activity) or blue spots. A third group of nests was maintained with immaculate eggshells. Nests with nonspotted eggshells showed the highest rate of brood parasitism, while nests with brownish or bluish spots on the eggshells were parasitized at a similar lower rate. These results suggest that brood-parasitic females use the presence of spots on the eggshells in their selection of host nests. This study adds to the scarce evidence showing that brood-parasitic birds select host nests with a low risk of ectoparasitism and demonstrates that colour patterns of the eggshell (i.e. spottiness) of their potential hosts represent a major cue employed to appraise the risk of ectoparasitism.

AB Mating preferences vary among individuals in response to a number of factors, such as the age and phenotype of the choosing individual. However, studies addressing variation in mating preferences generally focus on female preferences and usually are limited to choice within a species. Variation in preferences likely also exists at the species boundary, affecting an individual's propensity to mate with heterospecific individuals. In darters (Percidae: Etheostoma), male mating preferences are thought to prevent interbreeding between species, with male preferences for conspecifics sometimes as strong as, or stronger than, females'. In the current study, we tested whether male size and coloration predicts preference for conspecific females in Etheostoma barrenense. Previous studies have shown that males of this species strongly prefer conspecific females relative to females of the sympatric congener, the banded darter, Etheostoma zonale; however, those studies did not consider whether variation in male size or coloration affected preferences. Comparing large and small males of E. barrenense in dichotomous choice assays, we found that larger males exhibited stronger preferences for conspecific females and had proportionally more red coloration than smaller males. The proportion of red coloration did not significantly predict male preferences, suggesting that male size rather than male coloration predicts variation in male mating preferences for conspecific females in E. barrenense. Male size is often considered an indicator of individual quality. Alternatively, size might better reflect age in the focal species, suggesting that experience and learning may shape male preferences for conspecific females.

AB Nest construction is a widespread behaviour that is a critical fitness investment in many taxa. Nests provide stable environments for offspring production, development and at times adult survival. Avian nest structure and composition has been linked to insulative properties and the reduction of energetic requirements for incubating females. However, it is unclear how and why nest structure varies across landscapes within and between species, especially in cavity-nesting species. Here we examined nest size in a secondary cavity nester, the mountain chickadee, Poecile gambeli. Nests were measured across two years at two elevations varying in ambient temperature to test whether variation in nest size was associated with local ambient temperatures and internal nest cavity microclimate. Despite both elevations having high variation in ambient temperature during nest building in both years, there were no significant relationships between multiple nest measurements and temperature. Nest size was highly consistent between years within females, suggesting that individual females are the best predictor of nest size. Large variation in nest size, internal nest cavity microclimate temperature and ambient temperature during development in one year was not associated with significant differences in reproduction; but fluctuating asymmetry, a measure of developmental stress, was significantly lower in fledglings at the higher-elevation site independent of temperature. However, there were no significant differences between elevations in the second year for any reproductive parameter. Overall, our results suggest that chickadees do not adjust nest size in response to large differences in ambient or microclimate temperature and that large variation in nest size, both across and within sites, is a result of consistent individual preferences, which do not seem to have clear fitness consequences.

AB Males sometimes engage in fights over contested resources such as access to mates; in this case, fighting behaviour may be adjusted based on the value they place on the females. Resource value (RV) can have two components. First, males can assess the quality of females, which constitutes an objective assessment of RV. Second, internal state such as previous mating experience can also influence motivation to fight thus constituting a subjective assessment of RV. If mating opportunities are scarce and available females have a major impact on the lifetime reproductive success of males, then fighting can be fatal; in this situation it is uncertain whether males would adjust fighting behaviour based on RV. We found that both female quality, that is, virginity (objective component of RV) and male mating status (subjective component of RV) influenced fighting intensity between males of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema longicaudum which engage in lethal fights. Male nematodes were more likely to engage in fighting and fought longer and more frequently in the presence of virgin (high-quality) females than in the presence of mated (lower-quality) females. Male mating status was also found to influence fighting behaviour: mated males were the winners in staged fights between mated and virgin males. Mated males may have superior fighting ability (greater resource-holding potential), but RV asymmetries between mated and virgin males cannot be excluded. Males were more likely to win when they were resident, but we did not find a significant interaction effect between male mating and residency status.

AB For many animals, group living mitigates predation risk and ensures survival. However, in yellow-bellied marmots, increased sociality is associated with lower female reproductive success, decreased female longevity and increased overwinter mortality for both males and females, which raises questions about the adaptive value of sociality in this facultatively social mammal. Here we used social network analysis to examine the relationship between sociality and summer survival, which is almost always attributable to predation. Yearling females had enhanced survival when they had stronger social relationships and were more central in their network. Adult female survival was not associated with social network traits, but females were more likely to survive the summer if they lived in larger groups. Survival of yearling and adult males was not associated with either social network trait variation or variation in group size. These findings identify a potential benefit for marmot sociality and an explanation for marmot colony social structuring. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Oxybenzones like benzophenone-3 (BP3) are ultraviolet (UV) filters widely used in personal care products such as sunscreens. BP3 is currently receiving a great deal of attention because many of its properties, including high water solubility and potential to bioaccumulate, enable it to have damaging effects on aquatic ecosystems. One of these effects, the induction of coral bleaching, has led Hawaii to ban all sunscreens containing BP3. BP3 also appears to have endocrine-disrupting properties and has been found to affect animal physiology. However, behavioural consequences of BP3 exposure have yet to be thoroughly characterized. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BP3 on boldness, courtship and aggression in male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, as little is known about the effects that BP3 has on fish social behaviour. To accomplish this, we assigned males to a treatment group (control, low, medium or high BP3 concentration) and completed individual (empty tank, novel environment and shoal) and social (courtship and aggression) behavioural assays before and after a 28-day exposure period. BP3 influenced the expression of social behaviours, with individual boldness generally unaffected. Changes in shoaling occurred regardless of BP3 concentration, while BP3-associated decreases in courtship and aggression were concentration dependent. Abnormal social behaviour may impede successful mating and alter territorial dynamics, with potentially heightened effects in species already experiencing other anthropogenic stressors.

AB Anthropogenic factors, such as artificial light at night (ALAN), are increasingly linked to significant modifications in animal behaviours, such as foraging or migration. However, few studies have investigated directly whether the presence of ALAN affects the ability to find a mate (mate location). One direct effect of the presence of ALAN is that it can create a light barrier in an otherwise dark environment. This may have significant behavioural implications for nocturnally active species if it affects their ability to respond to potential mates. Our study, using the acoustically orienting Australian black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, determined experimentally whether the presence of a fragmented light environment influenced movement patterns of virgin females and males. Moreover, given the importance of male song for reproductive outcomes in this species, we assessed simultaneously whether such behaviours were modified by the presence of a male attraction call. We found that while initiation of movement was slower in the presence of ALAN, the behavioural shifts associated with its presence were relatively small compared to the influence of a broadcast male attraction call. The response to the male attraction call was typically stronger for females than for males, but both males and females modified aspects of behaviour when it was present regardless of whether their immediate environment was fragmented by artificial light at night or not. Artificial light at night may alter subtle aspects of movement and mating behaviour in this species, but ultimately does not provide a barrier to movement or mate location.

AB Coalitionary recruitment offers a window into animal social cognition. However, naturally observed coalitionary conflicts are challenging to analyse because the researcher has no control over the context in which they occurred, and observed behaviour patterns are typically consistent with multiple explanations. In this paper we analyse observational data of coalitionary solicitations during conflicts in wild capuchin monkeys, Cebus capucinus. We build upon previous work that focuses on identifying the cues that animals use to solicit allies in agonistic encounters. In contrast to previous studies, we applied a statistical technique that allows us to simultaneously compare different hypotheses regarding which cues animals use and how these cues interact. Our analysis shows that capuchin monkeys use information about both relationship quality and dominance when recruiting allies during conflicts. Monkeys primarily use rank when recruiting an ally, but will also use relationship quality, particularly when the potential ally has low rank. This study provides evidence that nonhuman primates are able to classify other group members using multiple criteria simultaneously. In addition, this paper presents a statistical technique that animal researchers can use to infer decision rules from observational data. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Personality traits and their correlations have been shown to be linked with life history strategies and fitness in various species. Among-individual correlations (i.e. behavioural syndromes) between personality traits can affect the evolutionary responses of these traits to environmental variation. Understanding the genetic and ecological determinants of personality traits and their interactions as behavioural syndromes in the wild is thus needed to shed light on the mechanisms shaping their evolution. Partitioning the observed (co)variance in these traits, however, requires large numbers of repeated behavioural measures on many individuals of known relatedness level. In the absence of such data, it is thus often assumed that phenotypic (co)variances inform about (i) underlying among-individual (co)variances (i.e. ignoring within-individual (co)variances) and (2) underlying genetic (co) variances. We tested these assumptions using three personality traits collected during 3 years on a long-term monitored breeding population of collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis. We partitioned the observed phenotypic (co)variance of aggressiveness, boldness and neophobia into genetic, permanent environment and parental components, and we estimated the repeatability, and heritability of these traits and their among-individual correlations. All three traits were repeatable between years (at least on the latent scale) but none were heritable. Permanent environment effects explained 15% of the phenotypic variance in aggressiveness, and parental effects explained 25% of the phenotypic variance in neophobia, in line with previous studies in wild populations. The three traits showed phenotypic correlations but no among-individual correlations and no additive genetic covariance. Thus, our results did not support the assumptions that phenotypic covariance reflects behavioural syndromes and genetic covariance. We discuss the reasons for the absence of heritability and among-individual and genetic covariance between these three personality traits in light of the possible selective pressures acting on this population.

AB An animal's perception of predation risk varies across a heterogeneous landscape. Animals rely on indirect cues in the environment, including availability of protective cover, openness of sightlines and distance to refuge to evaluate potential predation risk. Interactions between the indirect cues that influence an animal's perception of predation risk are poorly understood, especially for prey at risk of avian and terrestrial predation. We conducted a giving-up density (GUD) study to examine how interactions between terrestrial predator presence, ceiling (canopy) cover, wall (shrub/grass) cover and distance to nearest tree influence fox squirrel, Sciurus niger, risk perception. The GUD indicates an animal's perceived predation risk, such that increased GUD (decreased foraging) corresponds to greater perceived risk. We found that fox squirrels perceived cues of predation risk in response to a synergistic interaction between ceiling and wall cover. In open canopy areas, fox squirrels increased GUD where there was also increased wall cover. However, fox squirrels reduced GUD in closed canopy areas where there was also increased wall cover. We attribute the differential effects of wall cover depending on ceiling cover to the effectiveness of open sightlines in decreasing predation risk from avian or terrestrial predators. Our study shows that the effect of vegetation structure on prey risk perception and antipredator behaviour depends on the relative risk posed by avian and terrestrial predators that use different hunting strategies.

AB In a variety of taxa, individuals behave in consistently different ways. However, there are relatively few studies that empirically test the potential mechanisms underlying the causes and maintenance of these personality differences. Several hypotheses for the causes and maintenance of risky personality traits have been suggested but all have received mixed support. Both the pace-of-life hypothesis and state-dependent safety hypothesis propose that differences in internal state cause and maintain personality traits. Formally, the pace-of-life hypothesis states that differences in life-history traits including productivity (growth) and residual reproductive value (age) create initial differences in individual behaviour that is later maintained by positive feedback, while the state-dependent safety hypothesis suggests that body condition (mass) is responsible for causing and maintaining behavioural differences. We tested and evaluated whether either of these two hypotheses explained the causes or maintenance of variation in risk-related personality traits -defensive aggression, activity and exploration- in yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. We found little support overall for these hypotheses in explaining maintenance in activity or exploration. However, for defensive aggression, we found positive feedback for both mass and age.

AB Kin recognition can be important in species where inbreeding avoidance or nepotism (favouritism towards kin) rely on identifying kin, particularly in species with alloparental care. The mechanisms that facilitate kin discrimination, where recognition is determined through cues that correlate with relatedness, usually include either prior association (familiarity) or phenotype matching or both. Odour is an important cue used in a number of mammalian species to discern kin, particularly the ground-dwelling squirrels. Cape ground squirrels, Xerus inauris, are a cooperative-breeding species, living in tight-knit family groups. However, group fission, promiscuity and the large home ranges of breeding males result in a high variance in relatedness both within and among social groups, making them a good species to investigate kin discrimination. We examined whether females are capable of discriminating between the odours of familiar versus unfamiliar females that varied in their relatedness to the focal female using odour experiments. Overall, the average duration of sniffing of the odours of familiar and unfamiliar females did not differ. Similarly, females did not adjust their sniff duration relative to the degree of relatedness of familiar females. However, females appeared to discriminate by the degree of relatedness of unfamiliar (stranger) females, spending longer sniffing odours from females that were not related to them. Thus, females were capable of discriminating the degree of relatedness from odour but they did not do so within their family group. We conclude that Cape ground squirrels are able to discriminate kin. However, whether females in this facultative cooperative breeder use the degree of relatedness in direct social interactions and nepotistic behaviours remains to be investigated.

AB Theories of the evolution of low voice pitch in men are based on the idea that voice pitch is an honest indicator of physical dominance, but relationships among pitch, physical body size and strength among same-sex adults' voices are weak and unstable. Nevertheless, judgements of body size based on voice pitch are the result of perceptual bias that low frequencies sound large. If dominance judgements are based in part on perception of size, then dominance perception could also be the result of perceptual bias. Thus, we tested whether the relationship between voice pitch and judgements of height mediate the relationship between voice pitch and dominance judgements. The relationship between voice pitch and perceived height fully mediated the relationship between voice pitch and dominance. This was driven by the portion of variance that was inaccurate in height perception (i.e. residual error), and not conditional upon actual height, or perceptions thereof. Collectively our results demonstrate that the relationship between voice pitch and perceived dominance is not based on observation of real-world relationships between physical size and voice pitch, but rather based on a bias to perceive low-pitched voices as large people. Hence, the relationship between dominance and voice pitch is coincidental rather than causal. Thus, since the relationship between physical dominance and voice pitch is conditional upon the relationship between a biased perception of body size, voice pitch is not an honest indicator of physical dominance. Consequently, the evolution of low pitch in men's voices cannot be explained by selection for accurate dominance cues. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The sensory drive hypothesis proposes that natural selection on certain behaviours will alter sensory system properties and result in correlated evolution of unrelated behaviours reliant on that sensory system. Here, we used artificially selected populations to demonstrate that selection on colour-based foraging behaviour is associated with divergence of male sexual display behaviour. In a previous experiment, populations of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, were selected for increased chase behaviour towards a red or a blue prey item. In this study, we conducted behavioural trials using these artificially selected populations to show that male mating behaviour diverged after artificial selection on foraging behaviour. The behavioural trials showed that the number of courtship displays and total mating activity were reduced in populations selected to chase a red prey item compared to control populations and populations selected to chase a blue prey item. These results show that artificial selection for a given behaviour can result in changes in unrelated behaviours. Our study has shown that selection on a nonmating behaviour may have consequences for sexual behaviour and the evolution of sexual signalling that has previously not been considered.

AB Flexible compensatory parental care takes place when one parent increases its parental effort in response to its mate's reduction or absence. Although this behavioural response is well known in species with biparental care, the few cases attributed to species with uniparental care are usually based on descriptive observations of apparent compensation without a proper examination of its effects on offspring fitness. In the harvestman Serracutisoma proximum, a species with female uniparental care, harem-owning males stand on unattended clutches when the egg-tending females desert or die. Here, we experimentally investigated under field conditions whether this behaviour constitutes an example of true parental compensation. We evaluated the effects of ecological and life history factors on males' proximity to unattended clutches. We also presented egg predators to the harem-owning males and parental females when they were standing on their clutches and compared their aggressive responses. Finally, we compared egg survival between three manipulation groups: in the absence of both adults; in the presence of only the harem-owning males; and in the presence of the parental females. We observed that males spent considerably less time standing on clutches than parental females, rarely attacked potential egg predators (in contrast to parental females which commonly exhibited aggressive behaviours) and, ultimately, had no effect on offspring survival. Our results do not support the existence of paternal compensation in S. proximum. Instead, we hypothesize that males' behaviour comprises a tactic that increases: (1) fertilization success of unfertilized eggs retained by egg-tending females that temporarily abandon the clutch; and/or (2) mating success with newcomer mates that trade copulations for the opportunity to cannibalize the unattended offspring. This study demonstrates that it is imperative to formally test adaptive assumptions before deriving conclusions on the evolution of complex traits and their implications, as an apparently adaptive behaviour is not always what it seems.

AB Animals employ a diverse array of colorations to avoid being consumed by predators. While much research has focused on patterns that work when the animal remains stationary, studies examining the role of colour patterns that function when it moves to avoid predation remain scarce. Here, I propose and test the hypothesis that striking colorations that change dynamically through time, for example bright colours on the dorsal wing surface in combination with cryptic/contrasting ventral coloration (or vice versa) as seen in many insects and birds, serve to protect the moving animal from predation. This idea is analogous to a well-known visual illusion termed the flash lag effect which occurs because of the constraints in estimating the instantaneous position of a moving object due to the inherent neural processing delay. I performed a virtual predation experiment using a touch screen where human participants were asked to capture a moving stimulus that changed colour dynamically through time or remained constant. I found stimuli with dynamic colour change were caught less often and less accurately than a colour-static white or background-matching stimulus but were equally difficult to capture as a colour-static average grey under certain conditions. These results suggest that dynamic colour change is effective in lowering the probability of capture, but this benefit is not unique, as the colourstatic average grey stimulus had a similar advantage. Overall, the study thus presents the first clear evidence that animals that change colours during movement could gain significant protection against predation, probably by misrepresenting the prey's location.

AB Regulation of mass in small birds is based on simultaneously minimizing starvation and predation risk, but the mechanisms birds use to assess starvation risk are still debated. While we know that birds anticipate periods of unpredictable food availability/energy expenditure (e.g. the winter and night) by increasing their fat reserves, we do not know whether this anticipation involves learning. This study investigated whether birds could learn to use a light cue that predicted a period of food unavailability, to adaptively regulate their foraging and/or body weight. Sixteen captive starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were subjected to 42 days of an irregular schedule of food deprivation that involved depriving them of food for 5 h on 20 pseudorandomly chosen days. Birds were randomly allocated to two treatment groups for which a 30 min period of reduced ambient light either provided perfect information (Predictable) or no information (Unpredictable) about upcoming food deprivation. Both groups of birds increased their dawn body mass over the period of the experiment, consistent with a response to unpredictable food deprivation. However, no differences in either foraging behaviour or dawn body mass emerged between the groups, suggesting that the Predictable birds were unable to learn to use the light cue to initiate anticipatory foraging ahead of food deprivation. Furthermore, both groups immediately decreased their foraging behaviour in response to the onset of the light cue, suggesting that starlings do not have an evolved anticipatory foraging response to low light levels. Further work is needed to test alternative cues and designs before any general conclusions can be drawn regarding the flexibility of anticipatory foraging.

AB Extragroup paternity (EGP) is found across a wide range of species and may entail reproductive benefits, but may also entail costs to both sexes. While population and group parameters affecting the degree of EGPs are relatively well established, less is known about the individual characteristics that make males and females engage in alternative reproductive tactics such as EGP. Applying a combination of long-term demographic and genetic data from the rhesus macaque population of Cayo Santiago (Puerto Rico, U.S.A.), we investigate which male and female characteristics influence the probability of EGP to better understand the circumstances that shape the distribution and occurrence of EGP. Our results show that, against our expectations, higher-ranking females were more likely to produce EGP offspring than lower-ranking females. The probability of producing extragroup offspring was not significantly related to female or male age, male tenure or previous reproductive success. Furthermore, genetic relatedness between the parents did not affect the production of extragroup offspring, but extragroup offspring were more frequently produced early rather than late in a given mating season. Altogether, our analysis suggests that individual attributes and seasonal aspects create different opportunities and preferences for engaging in EGP as an alternative reproductive tactic. The observed patterns of EGP in rhesus macaques appear to be consistent with female mate choice for genetic benefits, which needs to be confirmed in future studies.

AB Structures built by animals, such as nests, often can be considered extended phenotypes that facilitate the study of animal behaviour. For rodents, nest building is both an important form of behavioural thermoregulation and a critical component of parental care. Changes in nest structure or the prioritization of nesting behaviour are therefore likely to have consequences for survival and reproduction, and both biotic and abiotic environmental factors are likely to influence the adaptive value of such differences. Here we first develop a novel assay to investigate interspecific variation in the nesting behaviour of deer mice (genus Peromyscus). Using this assay, we find that, while there is some variation in the complexity of the nests built by Peromyscus mice, differences in the latency to begin nest construction are more striking. Four of the seven taxa examined here build nests within an hour of being given nesting material, but this latency to nest is not related to ultimate differences in nest structure, suggesting that the ability to nest is relatively conserved within the genus, but species differ in their prioritization of nesting behaviour. We also find that latency to nest is not correlated with body size, climate or the construction of burrows that create microclimates. However, the four taxa with short nesting latencies all have monogamous mating systems, suggesting that differences in nesting latency may be related to social environment. This detailed characterization of nesting behaviour within the genus provides an important foundation for future studies of the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of behaviour.

AB The outcomes of sexual selection often differ when mating success is determined by male contest rather than female choice. Many studies, however, inferred sexual selection driven by female choice without carefully assessing the role of subtle male aggression. Relying on close-up video analyses, we documented novel courtship interference between male fruit flies, a key model system in research on sexual selection, sexual conflict and speciation. In experiments comparing male mating success under choice (2 males thorn 1 female) and no-choice (1 male thorn 1 female) conditions, we found that, in some cases, courtship interference altered male mating success. Both choice and no-choice protocols have known weaknesses. Choice protocols do not control for male-male interactions while no-choice protocols do not allow females to compare and choose between males. To overcome these weaknesses, we developed a new protocol (true-choice), which allows females to freely visit and assess each of two males while preventing direct male-male interactions. Results from the true-choice protocol suggest that traits enhancing male aggression have a greater role in determining mating success in fruit flies. Furthermore, it is possible that the mating system of scramble competition observed in many species should be reclassified as subtle male contest, which can drive sexual selection for aggressive male features.

AB Network dynamics can reveal information about the adaptive function of social behaviour and the extent to which social relationships can flexibly respond to extrinsic pressures. Changes in social networks occur following changes to the social and physical environment. By contrast, we have limited understanding of whether changes in social networks precede major group events. Permanent evictions can be important determinants of gene flow and population structure and are a clear example of an event that might be preceded by social network dynamics. Here we examined the social networks of a group of rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, in the 2 years leading up to the eviction of 22% of adult females, which are the philopatric sex. We found that females engaged in the same amount of aggression and grooming in the 2 years leading up to the eviction but that there were clear changes in their choice of social partners. Females that would eventually be evicted received more aggression from lower-ranking females as the eviction approached. Evicted females also became more discriminating in their grooming relationships in the year nearer the split, showing a greater preference for one another and becoming more cliquish. Put simply, the females that would later be evicted continued to travel with the rest of the group as the eviction approached but were less likely to interact with other group members in an affiliative manner. These results have potential implications for understanding group cohesion and the balance between cooperation and competition that mediates social groups.

AB Long-term relationships that underlie many stable mammalian groups often occur between philopatric kin. Although stable groups of nonrelatives appear to be less common, there is increasing evidence that social bonds between nonkin may confer sufficient intrinsic fitness benefits for these groups to persist. Here we evaluate whether social stability occurs in a bisexually dispersing species where social bonds have been shown to have reproductive benefits: the feral horse, Equus caballus. First, we quantified female social stability by applying a three-level framework to a 3-year data set of associations in semiferal ponies; this tested for stability at the individual, dyadic and subpopulation levels. Despite the relative weakness of these female bonds, we found significant social stability across all levels, as shown by stable association preferences, social networks and individual network positions. Second, we investigated how seasonality impacts on social bond strength and grouping patterns. We found seasonal fluctuations in female gregariousness, with a peak during the mating season. We therefore propose that significant social stability in female horses is coupled with a degree of flexibility that allows for effects of ecological fluctuations. Although social network analysis is widely used in behavioural ecological research, this is one of only a handful of studies to assess the temporal dynamics of networks over a significant timescale. Temporal stability in female relationships suggests that equid social structures are multifaceted: although bonds between stallions and mares are clearly strong, long-term relationships between mares underpin the social network structure. We suggest this framework could be used to assess social stability in other group-living species in order to improve our understanding of the nature of social bonds.

AB Recent research has drawn attention to the link between lateral bias and cerebral functional asymmetry in animals. Most studies of animal laterality have focused on limb use arising from forced experimental challenges as opposed to spontaneous behaviours. This study explored, for the first time, the expression of lateralized spontaneous behaviour in the domestic cat, a species that exhibits motor bias in the form of paw preferences. The side used by 44 pet cats to perform three spontaneous behaviours (lying side, stepping down a flight of stairs, stepping over a raised object) was recorded. Paw preferences were also assessed using a more traditional forced food reaching challenge. Cats showed a significant lateral bias for food reaching, stepping down and stepping over. Those with a paw preference, however, did not differ significantly in their tendency towards left or right sidedness. The direction of the cats' side preferences was significantly correlated for most measures, whether forced or spontaneous. The strength of the cats' motor bias was significantly related to the task; animals displayed a weaker lateral bias for lying side than any other measure. The study revealed a sex split in the direction, although not the strength, of the cats' lateral bias for food reaching, stepping down and stepping over. Males showed a significant preference for using their left paw on these measures, while females were more inclined to use the right one. The study provides the first evidence that the domestic cat displays motor laterality on specific spontaneous behaviours, and that the direction, although not the strength, of these lateral biases is largely consistent with that of an experimental task. The results suggest that the more forced food-reaching test traditionally used to assess motor bias in the cat offers a biologically valid measure of limb use in this species.

AB The notion that social complexity may drive communicative complexity has invigorated the research interest in the question of how to assess the structural features of a species' communication system. This applies to both the level of the signal repertoire and the level of potential rules governing the succession of elements. This review first provides an overview of some of the most influential studies in the realm of acoustic communication, before turning to a key problem at the foundation of many analyses. Many biological signal repertoires reveal intermediate forms between specific signal types as well as variation within signal types. Therefore, it is often difficult to identify the specific number of signal types (and consequently, their sequential relationships). Nevertheless, subjective classification or 'hard clustering' approaches force items into specific categories. Yet, given the graded nature of many repertoires, it may be more appropriate to measure the degree of differentiation within a repertoire, instead of the number of call types, which may also be strongly affected by sampling artefacts. 'Fuzzy clustering' provides measures to capture the overall structural variability of a repertoire, i.e. whether they are rather graded or discrete. Because with fuzzy clustering it may also be difficult to identify a single best cluster solution, methods are needed that transcend the number of clusters identified with the cluster analysis. One such approach is the assessment of the distribution of typicality coefficients, which are derived from fuzzy clustering. For the time being, these provide an alternative route to quantitatively test hypotheses regarding the evolution of signal repertoires. Future research should aim to establish a solid mathematical foundation to link the properties of graded repertoires to measures derived from complexity theory. Until then, the notion of complexity to describe the structure of a repertoire should be used with caution. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Long-term monitoring of individually marked animals is usually required for reliable estimation of numerous life history parameters. However, capture, marking and manipulation can dramatically alter the animals' behaviour after capture, and thus affect subsequent recapture success. Here, we used a pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, population as an example to illustrate the sampling bias resulting from the repeated capture of free-ranging individuals. By using repeated measures of the same individuals obtained during our long-term survey, we specifically evaluated the interannual response of breeding adults to capture-related stress, measured as latency to enter nestboxes equipped with a swing-trap. Moreover, we examined changes in the mean and variance of bird age with varying trapping effort using subsamples of the data set. Birds without any previous trapping experience entered nests more quickly than experienced ones, after controlling for other factors affecting latency, such as the sex, offspring quality and the order of capture relative to the other pair member. Birds' reluctance to enter the nest furthermore increased as the number of captures in previous years accumulated, implying that individual pied flycatchers became progressively more difficult to capture over the course of the study. Our results indicate that repeated exposure to capture stress over an animal's lifetime may induce long-lasting behavioural modifications that may influence trappability of the older segments of the population. We also provide evidence that this may ultimately lead to sampling bias towards younger ages, especially when effort is limited. We conclude that systematic age bias due to trapping experience can have important implications for the estimation of variation in a range of traits and should therefore be carefully checked in longitudinal studies.

We dissected the visual signal of male Xiphophorus nigrensis swordtails, a species in which males vary by both size and degree of courtship, to test (1) how the identity of males in a given choice influences female mating preferences and (2) how females perceptually integrate a male's multicomponent signal. We used validated male animations that generate repeatable female responses to test mating preferences for size and courtship vigour, separately and together, using dichotomous choice tests. When keeping courtship vigour constant, females discriminated between males only when there was a large size difference between them. When keeping size constant, the identity of males in a choice reversed a preference for a vigorously courting male. We found no evidence that females perceptually bind the separate components of a male's signal additively. However, females were faster to approach males when the males varied in both size and courtship than when the males only varied in size, perhaps favouring the evolution of multicomponent signals in males.

AB Chemical communication in aquatic species can affect many key life history traits, such as prey and predator detection and mate searching. However, changes in the environment can disrupt the effectiveness of signals and the ability of individuals to detect these signals. Many studies have examined the effect of secondary compounds from exotic plants on the ecology and physiology of a range of taxa, but whether the replacement of natural forests with exotic trees influences the behavioural responses of animals by disrupting chemical communication has rarely been investigated. We experimentally tested how eucalypt tree chemicals influenced three key aspects of chemical communication in adult male palmate newts. We tested for effects of both exposure to eucalypt water (i.e. extracts obtained by soaking leaves in mineral water) and the origin of newts (eucalypt plantations and natural oak forests). We examined whether exposure to eucalypt water altered the chemosensory ability of males to detect pools containing females or conspecific alarm cues and to find food. We found that eucalypt leachates had different effects on each behavioural trait. Fewer males detected female chemicals when exposed to the eucalypt than the oak water treatment, independent of the males' habitat of origin. Newts from oak forest were less able to detect conspecific alarm cues signalling predatory events when exposed to eucalypt water than when exposed to oak water, or than newts from eucalypt plantations for either water treatment. The ability of males to find food using chemical cues was similar in oak and eucalypt treatments. Our results suggest that chemical compounds not previously encountered during the evolutionary history of the species can influence the ability to respond to predators and locate mates. Future studies should explore the fitness costs associated with a reduced ability to respond to predators or detect mates. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The social environment early in life is a key determinant of developmental, physiological and behavioural trajectories across vertebrate and invertebrate animals. One crucial variable is the presence/absence of conspecifics. For animals usually reared in groups, social isolation after birth or hatching can be a highly stressful circumstance, with potentially long-lasting consequences. Here, we assessed the effects of social deprivation (isolation) early in life, that is, absence of conspecifics, versus social enrichment, that is, presence of conspecifics, on developmental time, body size at maturity, mating behaviour and groupliving in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. Socially deprived protonymphs developed more slowly and were less socially competent in grouping behaviour than socially enriched protonymphs. Compromised social competence in grouping behaviour was evident in decreased activity, fewer mutual encounters and larger interindividual distances, all of which may entail severe fitness costs. In female choice/male competition, socially deprived males mated earlier than socially enriched males; in male choice/female competition, socially deprived females were more likely to mate than socially enriched females. In neither mate choice situation did mating duration or body size at maturity differ between socially deprived and enriched mating opponents. Social isolation-induced shifts in mating behaviour may be interpreted as increased attractiveness or competitiveness or, more likely, as hastiness and reduced ability to assess mate quality. Overall, many of the social isolation-induced behavioural changes in P. persimilis are analogous to those observed in other animals such as cockroaches, fruit flies, fishes or rodents. We argue that, due to their profound and persistent effects, early social deprivation or enrichment may be important determinants in shaping animal personalities. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB Most songbirds depart from stopover sites after sunset and migrate during the night. Several recent studies have reported larger variation in departure time than previously thought; yet, it is still unclear which factors govern departure timing. We investigated the departure timing of four species of nocturnally migrating songbirds using an automated radiotelemetry system at Falsterbo peninsula in southwest Sweden. We made a comprehensive analysis to test a range of factors that have been hypothesized to affect departure timing of nocturnal migrants, such as night duration, season, sun elevation and the birds' intrinsic and environmental conditions. We hypothesized that birds in good condition (large fuel reserves) and under advantageous flight conditions would depart sooner after sunset, in the expected migratory direction. Our analyses showed that the birds departed sooner after sunset during spring than autumn, and different species departed at different times in relation to sunset. In addition, birds departed earlier when nights were shorter, suggesting that night duration is an important factor that may drive much of the observed timing differences between seasons and species. Lean birds delayed their departures compared to fat individuals. When birds experienced favourable wind conditions (tail wind or weak winds) at sunset, they departed earlier. Thus, it appears that the decision to take off for a long-distance flight depends on both body condition and wind conditions. Timing of departure was not correlated with sun elevation, which would have been expected if availability of specific orientation cues (sun, skylight polarization pattern, stars) acted as triggers for departures. These results stress high flexibility and adaptive responses to a complex of ecological factors as the determinants for timing of nocturnal flights in songbirds.

AB Peter Marler's fascination with richness of birdsong included the notion that birds attended to some acoustic features of birdsong, likely in the time domain, which were inaccessible to human listeners. While a considerable amount is known about hearing and vocal communication in birds, how exactly birds perceive their auditory world still remains somewhat of a mystery. For sure, field and laboratory studies suggest that birds hear the spectral, gross temporal features (i. e. envelope) and perhaps syntax of birdsong much like we do. However, there is also ample anecdotal evidence that birds are consistently more sensitive than humans to at least some aspects of their song. Here we review several psychophysical studies supporting Marler's intuitions that birds have both an exquisite sensitivity to temporal fine structure and may be able to focus their auditory attention on critical acoustic details of their vocalizations. Zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, particularly, seem to be extremely sensitive to temporal fine structure in both synthetic stimuli and natural vocalizations. This finding, together with recent research highlighting the complexity of zebra finch vocalizations across contexts, raises interesting questions about what information zebra finches may be communicating in temporal fine structure. Together these findings show there is an acoustic richness in bird vocalizations that is available to birds but likely out of reach for human listeners. Depending on the universality of these findings, it raises questions about how we approach the study of birdsong and whether potentially significant information is routinely being encoded in the temporal fine structure of avian vocal signals.

AB Complex signals that convey diverse forms of information may face conflicting pressures on their structure. Certain messages, such as species identification or 'alerting' receivers may require a relatively invariant signal structure, while messages about dialect or individual identity and motivation require structural diversity within and among individuals of a species. A resolution to this conflict is to encode different messages in different parts of the signal. When the signal is learned, as in birdsong, parts of the signal may develop along differing developmental pathways in order to produce the necessary signal variation. I tested the hypothesis that three phrases in the song of the Puget Sound white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys pugetensis, that are inferred to convey different messages will vary in their patterns of geographical variation along a 560 km long transect of the Pacific northwest coast of North America. I measured acoustic features of the songs of 267 males and tested for geographical structure using Mantel tests and Mantel correlograms. As predicted, the introductory whistle phrase, inferred to have an 'alerting' function, was geographically invariant. In contrast, the note complex and trill phrases, which convey information about individual identity and geographical origin, both decreased in similarity between males as distance increased. The two phrases have somewhat independent patterns of geographical variation. I suggest that differences in how these phrases develop, as measured in laboratory song-learning experiments, coupled with dispersal may contribute to the differing distributions.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

   coloration; target tracking
ID MOTION DAZZLE; PREDATORS
AB The formation of groups is a common strategy to avoid predation in animals, and recent research has indicated that there may be interactions between some forms of defensive coloration, notably high-contrast 'dazzle camouflage', and one of the proposed benefits of grouping: the confusion effect. However, research into the benefits of dazzle camouflage has largely used targets moving with constant speed. This simplification may not generalize well to real animal systems, where a number of factors influence both within-and between-individual variation in speed. Departure from the speed of your neighbours in a group may be predicted to undermine the confusion effect. This is because individual speed may become a parameter through which the observer can individuate otherwise similar targets: an 'oddity effect'. However, dazzle camouflage patterns are thought to interfere with predator perception of speed and trajectory. The current experiment investigated the possibility that such patterns could ameliorate the oddity effect caused by within-group differences in prey speed. We found that variation in speed increased the ease with which participants could track targets in all conditions. However, we found no evidence that motion dazzle camouflage patterns reduced oddity effects based on this variation in speed, a result that may be informative about the mechanisms behind this form of defensive coloration. In addition, results from those conditions most similar to those of published studies replicated previous results, indicating that targets with stripes parallel to the direction of motion are harder to track, and that this pattern interacts with the confusion effect to a greater degree than background matching or orthogonal-to-motion striped patterns.

AB Behavioural responses of animals to environmental cues are often governed by general 'rules of thumb'. Animals that face novel conditions as a result of global environmental change may alter these behavioural rules to persist. However, adaptation of generalized rules to novel pressures may cause a species to be maladapted to original conditions (e.g. predators) that remain in its environment. Invasive red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, are novel predators of eastern fence lizards, Sceloporus undulatus. Lizards from fire ant-invaded sites break crypsis to flee from fire ants at higher frequencies than fire ant-naive lizards. This shift promotes survival of attacks by these invasive ants but could result in attacks by native visual predators. Generalization of this increase in antipredator behaviour to native species could further increase this cost. We tested whether lizards' increased propensity to flee from fire ants is generalized to native ants and a predatory bird. We found that increased behavioural responsiveness to fire ants was generalized to two native ants but not to a perceived avian predator. We also found that lizards from populations invaded by fire ants had higher prevalence of injuries in the field, likely indicating greater attempted predation. We propose that generalized anti-ant behaviour may improve survival in the presence of fire ants but increase attacks by native visual predators. This study suggests that generalized rules can be maladaptive under novel conditions and highlights the challenges of assessing the costs and benefits of adaptations to rapid environmental change.

AB Sharing resources with conspecifics or heterospecifics can involve costs like increased competition or higher pathogen infection risks as well as benefits such as information on the location, quality and availability of resources. Depending on the consequences of sharing resources, the responses of individuals towards resources used by conspecifics and heterospecifics can range from ignoring them through avoidance to attraction. Within bats it is well known that colony members share information about day roosts and roost switching is often coordinated within the colony. However, little is known about roosting interactions between distinct colonies of conspecifics or heterospecifics. In this study, we investigated roosting interactions between five co-occurring bat colonies that belong to three forestliving species (Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis nattereri, Plecotus auritus). Occupied roosts were continuously monitored with an automatic RFID system over three maternity seasons. Furthermore, we used simulations to test whether colonies preferentially occupied recently used roosts of other colonies. We found no evidence that the roosting behaviour of the M. bechsteinii colony was influenced by the co-occurring heterospecific colonies. In contrast, P. auritus and M. nattereri frequently explored roosts of conspecific and heterospecific colonies, respectively. Nevertheless, with largely separated roosting ranges, the three P. auritus colonies avoided occupying roosts that had been inhabited by conspecific colonies. In contrast, M. nattereri specifically occupied recent roosts of all three P. auritus colonies. Our results give evidence that co-occurring colonies of conspecific and heterospecific bats can influence each other's roost usage. Our findings have implications for both our understanding of inter-and intraspecific resource sharing among distinct social groups and the management of forest-living bats that are of conservation concern.

AB Animals make trade-offs between predation risk and pursuit of opportunities such as foraging and reproduction. Trade-offs between antipredator behaviours and foraging are well suited to manipulation in laboratory and field settings and have generated a vast compendium of knowledge. However, much less is known about how animals manage trade-offs between predation risk and pursuit of reproductive opportunities in the absence of the confounding effects of foraging. In the present study, we investigated how the nonfeeding migratory life stage of sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, responds to odour from dead conspecifics (a cue that induces avoidance behaviours in laboratory and field studies). We released groups of PIT-tagged sea lamprey 65 m from the shore of Lake Michigan or 287 m upstream in Carp Lake River and used antennas to detect their movements in the river. As the breeding season progressed, sea lamprey initiated upstream movement earlier and were more likely to enter the river. Sea lamprey that began the night in Lake Michigan entered Carp Lake River at higher rates and accelerated upstream when exposed to high concentrations of alarm cue, consistent with animals attempting to minimize time spent in risky areas. Sea lampreys that began the night in the river delayed upstream movement when exposed to alarm cue, consistent with animals sheltering and gathering information about a source of risk. We attribute this context-specific reaction to alarm cue to differences in perceived vulnerability to predation in sheltered positions in the river versus exposed positions in the lake. Once in the river, the vast majority of sea lamprey moved upstream independent of alarm cue or Julian date. Although life-history-induced time and energy budgets place rigid constraints on the direction of migration, sea lamprey attend to predation risk by modifying movement timing and speed.

AB Indirect fitness benefits hypotheses suggest that offspring of preferred mates should exhibit greater survival or reproductive success. For example, good genes hypotheses propose that female mating preferences are mediated by secondary sexual traits because they honestly reflect the ability to pass on genes that will enhance offspring survival or reproduction. Conversely, complementary genes hypotheses propose that mating preferences are mediated by complementary genes because they enhance offspring viability. While these two research traditions are not strict alternatives and both may operate simultaneously, they have never been tested together. Here we explore the multiple potential underlying factors influencing mating preference evolution in Jamaican field crickets, Gryllus assimilis. After evaluating female preferences for randomly selected males, we tested whether preferred males differed from nonpreferred males in their body size, relative mass or mate attraction signals. We then mated females to their preferred or nonpreferred partners and tested offspring viability. Results revealed: (1) females preferred larger males, (2) larger females oviposited more eggs, (3) neither morphology nor mate attraction signalling explained variation in offspring viability, and (4) mating with a preferred partner did not enhance offspring viability. Overall, in our current study population, cricket mate preferences were inconsistent with complementary genes and good genes hypotheses for indirect fitness benefits. Our current research explores whether male secondary sexual traits honestly reflect the ability to pass on genes that enhance offspring reproduction.

AB Uncertainty about risk is a pervasive problem for prey that must continuously manage risk in an ever-changing world. Prey can, however, minimize this uncertainty by learning from the information they sample in their environment. How uncertainty affects learning about risk has been the subject of recent attention, but no studies have examined how uncertainty affects learning about risk (or safety) via social information. Here, we sought to assess whether uncertainty would make social information about risk and safety more persuasive. We induced uncertainty in minnows, Pimephales promelas, by exposing them to a background regime of incomplete information about predation risk in the form of conspecific alarm cues without any information about a specific predator. For other fish, we paired the alarm cues with a novel odour to give minnows the opportunity to be certain about the predator's chemical signature. Then, uncertain and certain minnows were given an opportunity to use social information from live conspecifics (models) that were experienced with the odour as being either risky or safe. Compared to control fish (no background risk), minnows that were both certain and uncertain developed a high-risk phenotype. These individuals spent less time moving and foraging, were more likely to develop a behavioural stereotypy (rapid-loop swimming) and displayed neophobic responses, regardless of their social conditioning. Control fish also developed neophobic responses after interacting with risk-experienced models, presumably because the models' high level of background risk triggered high-risk behaviour that indicated the environment was risky. Thus, whether these observers learned specific information from risk-experienced models or only learned generalized fright remains unknown. In contrast, we found weak evidence that interacting with safe-experienced models can reduce fright in observers to a previously known threat. Alternative approaches to safety conditioning may be more influential. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antipredator responses are a key determinant of the successful persistence of prey, and behavioural modifications are a frequent antipredator strategy. However, conspecific populations often inhabit heterogeneous environments. This can determine local adaptations, and might also induce variation in antipredator responses. Nevertheless, there is limited information on whether heterogeneity of predation risk among populations determines variation in antipredator response. Here we studied the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, a species that can breed in both surface streams and caves, habitats that are predator-rich and predator-free, respectively, and measured differences in antipredator responses across populations with different predation risk. We combined field surveys and laboratory experiments to understand the role of predation risk on the activity patterns of larvae, while measuring behavioural differences between populations. We reared larvae from different habitats in safe and risky conditions and tested their response to predator cues before and after rearing. In the field, predation risk was much higher in surface streams than in caves; larvae moved more in the absence of predators and when the light intensity was low. During laboratory experiments, larvae were less active if reared in risky conditions, but cave larvae showed a stronger response to risk than stream larvae. Therefore, larvae from sites without predators showed higher antipredator responses than those from risky habitats. This response fits the predictions of the risk allocation model, in which prey from habitats with a high background level of risk need to be active even when predators are present, to satisfy their energetic demands. Our findings show that antipredator behaviour may differ strongly between populations and stress the importance of integrating this variability in studies on predatory responses.

AB Many large-scale animal groups have the ability to react in a rapid and coordinated manner to environmental perturbations or predators. Information transfer among organisms during such events is thought to confer important antipredator advantages. However, it remains unknown whether individuals in large aggregations can change the structural properties of their collective in response to higher predation risk, and if so whether such adjustments promote responsiveness and information transfer. We examined the role of risk perception on the schooling dynamics and collective evasions of a large herring, Clupea harengus, school (ca. 60 000 fish) during simulated-predator encounters in a sea cage. Using an echosounder, high-resolution imaging sonar and acoustic video analysis, we quantified swimming dynamics, collective reactions and the speed of the propagating waves of evasion induced by a mobile predator model. In the higher risk condition, fish swam faster, exhibited a stronger circular swimming pattern, and we found an increased correlation strength indicating that the school had a greater ability to collectively respond to a perturbation. When exposed to a simulated threat, collective evasions were stronger and behavioural change (evasion manoeuvres) propagated more quickly within the school under environmental conditions perceived as being more risky. Our results demonstrate that large schools make structural and behavioural adjustments in response to perceived risk in a way that improves collective information transfer, and thus responsiveness, during predator attacks.

AB Males of several species have been shown to alter their mate preference in the presence of an eavesdropping rival. This evasive tactic has been interpreted as an attempt by the courting male to drive the attention of the rival away from the preferred female. The fitness return of this deceptive strategy will depend on the costs of cheating for the actor (the displayer) and the benefits for the rival (the bystander) of copying the choice of the displayer. We developed a two-person nonzero sum game between two males that compete for mating with one of two receptive females. Males could assess female quality with a varying level of uncertainty, which was modelled using a Bayesian statistical decision theory approach. We explored the actor and bystander payoffs under different levels of uncertainty in mate assessment and difference in quality between females. We found that when being eavesdropped on is costly (i.e. when females differ largely in quality), males are expected to cheat to reduce the amount of public information that is available to the unintended audience. However, under these circumstances, the value of the public information is low and the bystander is not expected to copy the choice of the actor. Our model suggests that deceptive male choice may evolve only under relatively restricted conditions and suggest that other explanations, such as, for example, a reduction in the risk of precopulatory male-male competition may be more likely. Future theoretical and empirical work will be necessary to test alternative interpretations of the audience effects in male mate choice. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Decomposition of vertebrate carrion is partially due to microbes, which release a series of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at various concentrations. These VOCs are part of ecologically relevant public information that serve as cues attracting blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae), such as Lucilia sericata, to remains as a resource both for themselves and for their offspring. However, these responses are partially governed by sex and physiological state (e.g. gravid and nongravid) of the fly and concentration of the VOCs. We examined the responses of 7-9-day-old L. sericata adults to dimethyldisulphide, indole, isobutylamine and phenylacetic acid in a Y-tube olfactometer. These VOCs are associated with vertebrate decomposition, carrion-mimicking flowers as well as fly-attracting bacteria. Our results demonstrate a relationship between sex and physiological state with regard to dose-dependent attraction to VOCs that occur during decomposition, suggesting that specific decomposition molecules provide distinct types of information to the flies with differing foraging interests. Understanding this dynamic relationship provides insight into the mechanisms regulating arthropod colonization, competition and resulting succession in association with such ephemeral resources.

AB Cooperation among individuals depends, in large part, on a sense of fairness. Many cooperating nonhuman primates show inequity aversion (i.e. negative responses to unequal outcomes), and these responses towards inequity probably evolved as a means to preserve the advantages of cooperative relationships. However, marmosets (Callithrix spp.) tend to show little or no inequity aversion, despite the high occurrence of prosociality and cooperative breeding in callitrichid monkeys. Oxytocin (OXT) has been implicated in a wide variety of social processes, but little is known about whether OXT modulates inequity aversion towards others. We used a tray-pulling task to evaluate whether marmosets would donate superior rewards to their long-term pair mate or an opposite-sex stranger following OXT, OXT antagonist and saline treatments. We found that marmosets show inequity aversion, and that this inequity aversion is socially and sex specific. Male marmosets showed inequity aversion towards their pair mates but not towards strangers, and female marmosets did not show inequity aversion. OXT treatments did not significantly influence inequity aversion in marmosets. While OXT may modulate prosocial preferences, the motivations underlying cooperative relationships, such as inequity aversion, are multifaceted. More research is needed to evaluate the evolutionary origins, biological processes and social contexts that influence complex phenotypes like inequity aversion. Inequity aversion can differ within species in important and distinct ways, including between individuals who do and do not share a cooperative relationship. Overall, these findings support the view that inequity aversion is an important behavioural strategy for the maintenance of cooperative relationships.

AB Predation risk can strongly constrain how individuals use time and space. Grouping is known to reduce an individual's time investment in costly antipredator behaviours. Whether grouping might similarly provide a spatial release from antipredator behaviour and allow individuals to use risky habitat more and, thus, improve their access to resources is poorly known. We used mosquito larvae, Aedes aegypti, to test the hypothesis that grouping facilitates the use of high-risk habitat. We provided two habitats, one darker, low-risk and one lighter, high-risk, and measured the relative time spent in the latter by solitary larvae versus larvae in small groups. We tested larvae reared under different resource levels, and thus presumed to vary in body condition, because condition is known to influence risk taking. We also varied the degree of contrast in habitat structure. We predicted that individuals in groups should use high-risk habitat more than solitary individuals allowing for influences of body condition and contrast in habitat structure. Grouping strongly influenced the time spent in the high-risk habitat, but, contrary to our expectation, individuals in groups spent less time in the high-risk habitat than solitary individuals. Furthermore, solitary individuals considerably increased the proportion of time spent in the high-risk habitat over time, whereas individuals in groups did not. Both solitary individuals and those in groups showed a small increase over time in their use of riskier locations within each habitat. The differences between solitary individuals and those in groups held across all resource and contrast conditions. Grouping may, thus, carry a poorly understood cost of constraining habitat use. This cost may arise because movement traits important for maintaining group cohesion (a result of strong selection on grouping) can act to exaggerate an individual preference for low-risk habitat. Further research is needed to examine the interplay between grouping, individual movement and habitat use traits in environments heterogeneous in risk and resources.

AB Sexually selected traits can signal an individual's ability to contribute offspring care. Differential allocation theory posits that when these same traits also influence brood value, it may be adaptive for partners to adjust care in response to their mates' traits. Evaluating the strength and direction of parental quality signalling and differential allocation is thus essential to understand selection on ornamental traits. We examined relationships between plumage colour and parental care in tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, a mutually ornamented species in which plumage colour is related to male and female reproductive performance. Using a model of avian vision to quantify parental colour trait variation, we found that male and female tree swallows that were paired to partners with greener, more saturated plumage colour fed offspring at higher rates. Among tree swallow pairs where both partners were in their second year of breeding or older, individuals with greener, more saturated plumage colour also fed their offspring at higher rates. We show that offspring of males that provisioned more often tended to achieve greater body mass independent of the colour traits of their parents. Our results suggest a role for partner parental care in selection on female ornamentation in this species. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   paradox; mutagenesis; ornaments; sexual displays
AB According to the genic capture hypothesis, genetic variance in costly sexual traits is maintained because their expression depends on many genes that affect resource acquisition ability. Hence, such traits should constitute a large mutational target and thus show high sensitivity to deleterious mutations. To test this, we exposed male guppies to a chemical mutagen that induces point mutations, and measured sexual display and ornamental traits in the progeny of the mutagenized fish. For comparison, we measured several life history and morphological traits. Compared with progeny of control males, sons of the mutants took a longer time to mature, and daughters of mutants gave birth to fewer offspring than daughters of control males. No significant effect of mutations on body size, eye size or offspring mortality was detected. Consistent with the genic capture hypothesis, induced mutations negatively affected the courtship display rate. However, the area and spectral characteristics of sexually selected orange spots were not significantly affected. Our results demonstrate that energetically costly courtship display, but not orange coloration, is a reliable indicator of mutation load. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The risk-sensitive foraging theory formulated in terms of the (daily) energy budget rule has been influential in behavioural ecology as well as other disciplines. Predicting risk aversion on positive budgets and risk proneness on negative budgets, however, the budget rule has recently been challenged both empirically and theoretically. In this paper, we critically review these challenges as well as the original derivation of the budget rule and propose a 'gradual' budget rule, which is normatively derived from a gradual nature of risk sensitivity and encompasses the conventional budget rule as a special case. The gradual budget rule shows that the conventional budget rule holds when the expected reserve is close enough to a threshold for overnight survival, selection pressure being significant. The gradual view also reveals that the conventional budget rule does not need to hold when the expected reserve is not close enough to the threshold, selection pressure being insignificant. The proposed gradual budget rule better fits the empirical findings including those that used to challenge the conventional budget rule. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Biological Market Theory (BMT) has provided an elegant framework to study how commodities are exchanged among individuals. In primates, BMT predicts that individuals exchange grooming with other commodities based on the law of supply and demand. However, BMT still suffers some theoretical and methodological limitations. Our aim in this paper is to discuss some of these limitations, including the lack of consensus over the time frame in which exchanges take place, and over the commodities involved, the cognitive challenges imposed by biological markets (BMs), and the heterogeneity of methods used to test BMT across studies. In particular, we discuss (1) the importance of predetermining both the time frame over which exchanges take place and (2) the commodities that are exchanged in primate BMs, (3) the cognitive skills that primates need to navigate in a BM, and (4) other methodological issues arising when testing BMT. For each of these points, we propose an agenda with possible solutions and we show how the issues raised also apply to BMs in species other than primates.

AB Sperm competition has been demonstrated to be a strong selective force shaping male mating behaviours and ejaculate traits, particularly in highly polyandrous species. Its effect, however, is expected to be limited in lek mating systems, where female mating decisions appear relatively unconstrained and thus female remating rate is generally low. Hence, testing for male adaptations to sperm competition in lek mating species is of particular importance in order to understand whether and how sperm competition, as a selective force, may also have shaped male phenotype in such systems. Here, we investigated copulation behaviour and strategic sperm allocation in the lekking lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella, a well-established model for studying precopulatory sexual selection as males produce elaborate ultrasonic courtship songs targeted by female choice. Recent evidence suggests that females do sometimes remate, thus creating a selective potential for sperm competition. To test the hypothesis that sperm competition also selects for male adaptations in ejaculate traits in lek mating systems, we staged experimental matings after males had experienced either a competitive (one competitor present) or a noncompetitive (no competitor present) social environment during early adulthood. Males increased sperm transfer rate and thereby allocated higher proportions of available sperm reserves during virgin copulations when experiencing the elevated sperm competition risk environment. Our study provides the first evidence of strategic sperm allocation in relation to sperm competition risk in a lekking insect, demonstrating that sperm competition might represent an important selective force in such mating systems.

AB Despite growing interest in animal social networks, surprisingly little is known about whether individuals are consistent in their social network characteristics. Networks are rarely repeatedly sampled; yet an assumption of individual consistency in social behaviour is often made when drawing conclusions about the consequences of social processes and structure. A characterization of such social phenotypes is therefore vital to understanding the significance of social network structure for individual fitness outcomes, and for understanding the evolution and ecology of individual variation in social behaviour more broadly. Here, we measured foraging associations over three winters in a large PIT-tagged population of great tits, and used a range of social network metrics to quantify individual variation in social behaviour. We then examined repeatability in social behaviour over both short (week to week) and long (year to year) timescales, and investigated variation in repeatability across age and sex classes. Social behaviours were significantly repeatable across all timescales, with the highest repeatability observed in group size choice and unweighted degree, a measure of gregariousness. By conducting randomizations to control for the spatial and temporal distribution of individuals, we further show that differences in social phenotypes were not solely explained by within-population variation in local densities, but also reflected fine-scale variation in social decision making. Our results provide rare evidence of stable social phenotypes in a wild population of animals. Such stable social phenotypes can be targets of selection and may have important fitness consequences, both for individuals and for their social-foraging associates. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Predator recognition is a prerequisite for antipredator behaviour. Although species level predator recognition is well documented, there is emerging evidence that some birds, including corvids, can differentiate between individual humans that pose different levels of threat. Other predator cues such as gaze direction may offer additional important information regarding the likelihood of an attack, but it is unknown whether wild animals can integrate information about the individual identity and gaze direction of a predator when perceiving threat levels. Here we measured wild jackdaws' responses to human head orientation, directed towards or away from their nestbox containing chicks. To test whether aversive responses to gaze direction were integrated with information about human identity, the human presenting gaze cues wore one of two masks: a 'threatening' mask that had previously been worn when handling the jackdaws' chicks and a 'neutral mask' that had previously been worn when walking by, but not disturbing the nest. Latency to return to the nestbox was significantly higher when the threatening mask rather than the neutral mask was worn, but it was not influenced by head direction. However, once a jackdaw landed outside the nestbox, there was a nonsignificant trend for it to be quicker to enter the box when the human was gazing towards, rather than away from the box. These results indicate that wild jackdaws can recognize different individual humans and thus differentiate between those wearing a threatening and a neutral mask, and respond defensively by guarding their chicks from potential threat. Jackdaws may integrate both predator identity and gaze cues; however, predation risk is primarily perceived through individual human recognition.

AB Animals communicate through the exchange of signals. However, third-party individuals can detect and intercept signals not directly sent to them, a phenomenon known as eavesdropping, and the presence of bystanders can influence the signalling behaviour of interacting conspecifics, a phenomenon named the audience effect. So far, research done on audience effects and eavesdropping has been mainly focused on their function, rather than on their proximate mechanisms. For this reason, we were interested in testing the occurrence of audience effects on male zebrafish, a genetically tractable model organism that is emerging as a major candidate for the study of the neural basis of social behaviour. Here, pairs of males were exposed to a mixed-sex shoal, which was used as an audience, at two different times: (1) during a contest between them, to test for an audience effect and (2) before the contest, to test whether this prior exposure influences subsequent agonistic behaviour (i.e. aggressive priming). We analysed the pairs' aggressive signalling during the contest by measuring variables that characterize both the individuals' behaviour and the interaction, and found that pre-exposure to an audience induced a shorter latency to display, an increase in the time dominants spent chasing subordinates and a shorter time to resolve the agonistic interaction. Also, exposure to the audience during the interaction led to a higher number of interactions in which displays occurred, a higher number of resolved interactions with displays and a decrease in the escalation of aggression for resolved interactions. These results add zebrafish to the literature on the audience effect and, most importantly, open the way for the study of the neural mechanisms involved in the processing of social information in a model organism.

AB The study of low-amplitude or 'soft' songs and calls has largely been limited to organisms that produce multiple call types that fall neatly into a bimodal distribution with respect to amplitude. The soft vocalizations of many of these animals, including birds and mammals, have proven to be extremely difficult to collect data on due to difficulty in hearing and recording such songs in the wild, the lack of production of these sounds in captivity, and the difficulty in standardizing measurements of the amplitude produced by free-moving animals. Here I suggest we consistently expand the working definition of soft song to allow for the inclusion of insects and other organisms whose calls do not easily fit into a 'high-amplitude' versus 'low-amplitude' signal paradigm. For instance, some species of moths produce extremely quiet ultrasonic courtship songs without also producing a high-amplitude song, and field crickets sing courtship songs that contain both relatively loud and quiet elements within the same song. Soft-singing moths and crickets may not only prove more practical to work with, but may also provide answers to heretofore untestable hypotheses about the function and evolution of soft song.

AB When a reward is downgraded in quantity or quality from that which is expected, one of two possible outcomes can result. Acquisition responses may decline gradually, owing to a strong stimulus-response reinforcement history, and thus follow the Thorndikian law of effect. Alternatively, there may be an exaggerated reaction to a downgraded reward when it is initially altered, compared to the behaviour of individuals that have always been trained to receive the lower magnitude reward; this is known as successive negative contrast (SNC). While behavioural SNC effects have been commonly demonstrated in mammals, evidence that they occur in other taxa is more equivocal. Additionally, studies demonstrating immediate physiological reactions during reward downshifts are limited. We investigated the reaction of chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, to a downshift in the quality of a food reward that they had been trained to expect in a runway apparatus. During a preshift phase, 16 chickens (control) were given food that was flavoured to make it less preferred, while the other 16 (contrast) were fed the same food but without flavouring. During trial 7, unflavoured food was substituted by flavoured food for contrast hens and all birds were fed the flavoured food during a postshift phase. In the contrast group, food consumption immediately decreased and heart rate increased when the reward was downshifted from unflavoured to flavoured food, but there was no evidence of SNC effects, which could stem from methodological or taxonomic differences from previous studies. The latency to reach the food appeared to follow the Thorndikian law of effect, gradually increasing following the downshift. We suggest that the disparity between the pattern shown by the latency results and other measures could relate to the time period in which measures were taken, as acquisition responses are more likely to follow the law of effect.

AB Sexual selection is increasingly recognized to depend upon, and to fluctuate with, major ecological factors in natural environments. The operational sex ratio (OSR) and population density can affect the opportunity for, and strength of, sexual selection but their effects are rarely taken into account in laboratory behavioural studies. In Bicyclus anynana, a model butterfly for mate choice studies, the experimental set-up widely used in laboratories often involves very high densities compared to the field, male-biased sex ratios and small cage volumes. We hypothesized that these conditions impede the proper expression of female mating preference by promoting male competition and sexual harassment of females. Using various cage volumes, we separately manipulated OSR and density to cover the range of values used in B. anynana laboratory mating experiments and to approach field values. Male competition, quantified by the number and duration of courtships aborted by males, became stronger with increasing densities, specifically under more male-biased sex ratios, and decreasing cage volumes. Thus, male eagerness to mate was essentially due to the use of small cage volumes and very high experimental densities. Concomitantly, female choosiness, quantified by the proportion of rejections of male mating attempts, decreased with increasing densities under a male-biased sex ratio. Females also accepted more matings with decreasing cage volume, and mated more rapidly with increasing density. We conclude that the laboratory social environments frequently used to test mate choice in B. anynana, with unnaturally high densities and male-biased sex ratios, exacerbate male-male competition and strongly hinder female choice, biasing the estimates of the strength and direction of sexual selection that were shaped under very different natural environments in the wild. We propose a set-up for B. anynana mate choice studies that allows the assessment of female choosiness in statistically robust mating experiments.

AB Dominance hierarchies are ubiquitous in social species. Social status is established initially through physical conflict between individuals and then communicated directly by a variety of signals. Social interactions depend critically on the relative social status of those interacting. But how do individuals acquire the information they need to modulate their behaviour and how do they use that information to decide what to do? What brain mechanisms might underlie such animal cognition? Using a particularly suitable fish model system that depends on complex social interactions, we report how the social context of behaviour shapes the brain and, in turn, alters the behaviour of animals as they interact. Animals observe social interactions carefully to gather information vicariously that then guides their future behaviour. Social opportunities produce rapid changes in gene expression in key nuclei in the brain and these genomic responses may prepare the individual to modify its behaviour to move into a different social niche. Both social success and failure produce changes in neuronal cell size and connectivity in key nuclei. Understanding mechanisms through which social information is transduced into cellular and molecular changes will provide a deeper understanding of the brain systems responsible for animal cognition.

AB Males often exercise mate choice when mating frequency is constrained, costs of choice are low and variation in female quality and/or expected paternity can be reliably detected. Across invertebrates, males use sex pheromones to discern female mating status, but there are few demonstrations that information about expected fecundity ('quality') is encoded in pheromones alone. Here we examine whether females' sex pheromones allow males to detect differences in female food intake and mass in two species of widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus and Latrodectus hasselti) in which chemicals are deposited by females in silk. Recent work shows that male L. hesperus prefer well-fed females, and that these females produce more silk than hungry females. Thus, changes in diet could be mechanistically linked to changes in silk-bound pheromonal signals. We show that unmated females of both species lose more than half of their mass when food is withheld, and silk production is reduced by 48% (L. hesperus) to 67% (L. hasselti). Males had a significant sexual response to pheromones extracted from the females' silk in both species, although this response was not directly correlated with silk or female mass. In L. hesperus, but not in L. hasselti, males were less responsive to sex pheromones from food-deprived females compared to well-fed females. While females on good diets provide the benefit of higher fecundity in both species, the risk of being cannibalized by hungry females during courtship exists only in L. hesperus. We conclude that sex pheromones alone can provide information about recent female feeding history, possibly reducing the costs of males expressing choice in the field. The species difference in male response also suggests that male preferences in these spiders may depend less on the benefit of seeking a highly fecund female and more on avoiding the cost of risky mating attempts with a likely cannibal.

AB Pollinators provide a key ecosystem service that can be influenced by predation and predator avoidance. However, it was unclear whether pollinators can avoid predators by eavesdropping, intercepting predator signals. Using a natural species assemblage, we show that a bee can eavesdrop on and avoid the trail pheromone of a sympatric ant, while foraging on a native plant. The giant Asian honeybee, Apis dorsata, avoided Calliandra haematocephala inflorescences with live weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina. Although few foraging bees were attacked, ants killed the bee in almost a third of attacks. Ant presence alone significantly reduced bee floral visits. Bees showed nearly equal avoidance of live ants and trail pheromone extracts, demonstrating that olfactory eavesdropping alone can elicit full avoidance. We then used GC-MS to analyse compounds deposited by ants walking and laying trail pheromone. The most abundant compounds were all trail pheromone components. However, bees did not avoid the most abundant and conspicuous trail pheromone compound, heneicosane. Foragers may instead detect a mixture of different trail pheromone compounds. Our results contribute to a growing understanding of how public information about predators and competitors can shape food webs, and show that pollinators can tap into the private signals of predators and use this information to their advantage.

AB Ultimate hypotheses to explain sexual size dimorphism (SSD) generally focus on differences in reproductive roles between males and females. For example, intrasexual competition for mates can favour larger males in some taxa, and fecundity selection can favour larger females in other taxa. However, SSD is not simply due to one selection pressure on males or females, but is the outcome of numerous conflicting pressures on both sexes. Despite this, few studies have tested multiple hypotheses to explain the factors underlying SSD. Horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus, have female-biased SSD in all populations, and are an interesting species for the study of SSD because of their unusual evolutionary history and life-history strategy. We used the hypothetico-deductive method to evaluate multiple predictions from six hypotheses to understand the evolution and maintenance of SSD in horseshoe crabs. We examined these hypotheses using field studies and data from the literature. We found little support for four hypotheses. However, predictions for the fecundity advantage hypothesis were supported (e. g. larger females lay more eggs than smaller females). Our results predict that, for every centimetre increase in size, females will lay 1672 +/- 285 more eggs per spawning bout. Thus, selection is likely to favour the future compounded gain in fecundity from one extra year of growth over the gain from one additional mating opportunity if females mature earlier. Predictions for the protandry hypothesis were also supported. The costs for males maturing at smaller sizes (i.e. a large-size advantage for competing males, and increased ejaculate volume) appear to be minimal. Therefore, males that mature and reproduce earlier will likely be selected for, given the demographic advantage of their offspring hatching and reproducing earlier. Our study illustrates the importance of investigating multiple hypotheses for both males and females in the study of SSD. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Plant-manipulating herbivores can modify their host nutrients and defensive compounds to their own advantage. This generally results in enhanced performance of herbivores on modified tissues, but the anatomical and biochemical modifications undergone by host tissues could also modify the herbivores' behaviour. Phloeomyzus passerinii induces a reaction tissue in the bark of its susceptible poplar hosts, suggesting a host-plant manipulation by the aphid. We investigated whether the formation of this reaction tissue, confirmed by histological sections, affected the performance and feeding behaviour of the aphid. In addition we studied how host resistance affected these parameters by comparing two host genotypes of different susceptibility. Aphids developed faster on the preinfested susceptible host genotype, whereas no effect was detected on the resistant one, confirming an improvement in the host's nutritional value due to the preinfestation, in agreement with the nutrition hypothesis. The DC-EPG technique indicated that in both host genotypes, preinfestation shortened the delay until the first probe and increased both the rate and duration of sustained ingestion, and consequently host acceptance. This suggests that host manipulation can adjust not only the nutritional value of plant tissues at an optimal level for development but also host acceptance by the herbivores. In the resistant host genotype though, the number of probes and the duration of parenchyma exploration increased in the galled tissue, which was congruent with extensive cell wall modifications indicated by more extended induced lignification. The adaptive consequences of this modified feeding behaviour are discussed. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB How animals decide to withdraw from a contest has puzzled researchers for years. Currently, four models try to explain how this decision is made: war of attrition (WOA); cumulative assessment (CAM); opponent-only assessment (OOA); and sequential mutual assessment (SAM). Although their predictions differ, they must be simultaneously tested to infer which model best describes contests. Herein, we identified the traits related to the resource-holding potential (RHP) in the decapod Aegla longirostri, and used these traits to test the predictions of each model. We identified which morphological/performance traits affect contest outcome, related these traits to the contest duration of male dyads, and tested the differences in aggressive acts (claw grabs). We tested the models using pairs of random and RHP-matched opponents. Additionally, we performed contests where RHP-matched opponents could communicate before the contest ('previewed'), and contests where the focal animal would only communicate with one individual and fight another unseen individual afterwards ('unseen'). In comparing these groups we tested whether information was being exchanged. The best predictor of contest outcome included a combination of cephalothorax length and claw height, and claw grabs increased with opponent similarity. Contest duration increased with loser's cephalothorax length and decreased with winner's cephalothorax length in random pairs, and winners spent more time in claw grab than losers. These findings refute WOA and OOA. In RHP-matched pairs, no relation was found and contests with previewed opponents were shorter than contests with unseen opponents, both results suggest SAM. However, the time spent in claw grab did not differ between previewed and unseen opponents. We argue that SAM is cognitively complex, and mutual assessment without comparison of RHP could be a better explanation. Furthermore, claw grab is important in contest resolution. Thus, the costs inflicted may suggest a mixed assessment strategy for A. longirostri's contests. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We examined the relative importance of individual differences in personality (activity and aggressiveness), social skill and the social environment (average activity and aggressiveness of the group, presence of hyperaggressive males) in determining the behaviour and mating success of males of the stream water strider, Aquarius remigis. Males that had a consistently more active-aggressive behavioural type had, on average, higher mating success largely because they spent more time active in microhabitats associated with acquiring mates. Some active-aggressive males, however, showed hyperaggressive behaviour, apparently attempting to mate forcibly with other males, or forcibly separate pairs, which was rarely successful. A higher tendency to be hyperaggressive was associated with reduced mating success (i.e. being hyperaggressive represents low social skill). The overall effect was thus stabilizing sexual selection on male activity and aggression. The social environment also had large effects on male behaviour and mating success. In particular, the presence of a keystone hyperaggressive male had strong negative effects on the mating success and general activity of other males in the pool. Notably, males with a more active-aggressive behavioural type maintained higher mating success than less active-aggressive males in the presence of a hyperaggressive male. Social plasticity (change in behaviour in response to changing social conditions) also depended on the male's behavioural type; males with a more active-aggressive behavioural type were more plastic.

AB Visually hunting predators forage on prey possessing a range of different defence strategies. The two most commonly studied defence strategies are camouflage (in which palatable and undefended prey have colour patterns to minimize detection) and aposematism (in which toxic prey advertise their defences using conspicuous warning signals). Typically, these two defence strategies are studied in isolation, but when multiple prey species are eaten by the same predators, changes in the defence strategy of one species could affect the selection pressures acting on the defensive strategy of another. In this experiment, we tested this idea by investigating whether predators increased their foraging behaviour on prey that they knew to be toxic when undefended prey were better concealed. European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were allowed to forage freely for undefended (water- injected) and defended (quinineinjected and coated) mealworms, Tenebrio molitor, in bowls containing woodchip (prey type was signalled by bowl colour). Toxic prey were always covered with 30 ml of woodchip, while undefended prey were covered with either 30 ml or 150 ml of woodchip (all birds received both woodchip depths). Increasing the amount of woodchip covering the undefended prey made them harder to find, but did not affect birds' propensity to search for toxic prey. However, birds did attack and eat more toxic prey, but only when they received the 150 ml treatment before the 30 ml treatment. Our experiment shows that better concealed palatable prey can increase predation of toxic prey, with implications for the study of prey defences.

AB Many animals move in groups, but the mechanisms by which a group of animals form a consensus about where to move are not well understood. In honeybees group movement generally falls into two behavioural categories: reproductive swarming and colony migration. In both contexts the bees use the dance language to decide on a location to move to. During reproductive swarming bees choose between and dance for multiple discrete locations before departing towards one of them. In contrast, during migration bees select a single direction in which to fly, but information with respect to distance is highly variable. In this study we show that swarms of the giant Asian honeybee, Apis dorsata, when placed in a novel environment rapidly reach a general consensus on a single patch within the environment in a fashion similar to relocating swarms of the red dwarf honeybee, Apis florea. In the three swarms used in this study the patches for which bees danced prior to the swarm departing corresponded to a stand of trees. One of our swarms showed a dance pattern consistent with long-distance migration: dances during the final 15 min preceding swarm departure indicated a wide range of distances but a uniform direction. Unlike previous descriptions of migrating swarm behaviour, the direction indicated by dances on this swarm changed throughout the decision-making process. Our other two swarms landed within the canopy of the trees in the patches for which they danced in the last 15 min and then presumably searched the surrounding area for a specific location in which to construct their new comb.

AB Most animals use vocalizations to attract mates and defend territories. Many species alter these signals in the presence of anthropogenic noise, such as rush-hour traffic. Yet, little is known about how intended receivers (territorial rivals, potential mates) respond to these altered signals. Here we investigated responses of free-living male northern cardinals, Cardinalis cardinalis, to computer-generated songs that mimicked (1) the population's average minimum-frequency song ('average frequency' song) and (2) songs that had been shifted to have a higher minimum frequency ('shifted-frequency' song), as occurs in the presence of loud anthropogenic noise. Males gave stronger responses to songs of average frequency than to songs with a shifted frequency. At low levels of background noise, differences in responses to two song types were greatest, but as the amplitude of anthropogenic noise increased, differences in responses to the two song types diminished, and at the highest amplitudes, males had almost equal responses to the two song types. Since the shifted-frequency songs received weaker responses than the average-frequency songs, the shifted-frequency songs do not seem advantageous in terms of communication efficacy, especially at low levels of background noise. Songs with a higher minimum frequency are not necessarily beneficial for signal efficiency and might not be adaptive despite potential benefits of masking avoidance, which could have important consequences for mate selection and resource defence among populations in urban areas.

AB Self-control, that is, overcoming impulsivity towards immediate gratification in favour of a greater but delayed reward, is seen as a valuable skill when making future-oriented decisions. Experimental studies in nonhuman primates revealed that individuals of some species are willing to tolerate delays of up to several minutes in order to gain food of a higher quantity or quality. Recently, birds (carrion crows, Corvus corone, common ravens, Corvus corax, Goffin cockatoos, Cacatua goffiniana) performed comparably to primates in an exchange task, contradicting previous notions that birds may lack any impulse control. However, performance differed strikingly with the currency of exchange: individuals of all three species performed better when asked to wait for a higher food quality, rather than quantity. Here, we built on this work and tested whether the apparent difference in levels of self-control expressed in quality versus quantity tasks reflects cognitive constraints or is merely due to methodological limitations. In addition to the exchange paradigm, we applied another established delay maintenance methodology: the accumulation task. In this latter task, food items accumulated to a maximum of four pieces, whereas in the exchange task, an initial item could be exchanged for a reward item after a certain time delay elapsed. In both tasks, birds (seven crows, five ravens) were asked to wait in order to optimize either the quality or the quantity of food. We found that corvids were willing to delay gratification when it led to a food reward of higher quality, but not when waiting was rewarded with a higher quantity, independent of the experimental paradigm. This study is the first to test crows and ravens with two different paradigms, the accumulation and the exchange of food, within the same experiment, allowing for fair comparisons between methods and species.

AB The mating system of European wool-carder bees, Anthidium manicatum, differs from that of most bees in three important aspects: females (1) are polyandrous and (2) mate continuously over the course of their reproductive life, while males (3) exhibit resource defence polygyny, that is, defend patches of food plants where copulations occur. To shed light on the evolution of this mating system we investigated male paternity using a combination of cage experiments and microsatellite genotyping of brood. We found that, although females possess a spermatheca for long-term sperm storage, most brood was fathered by males that had very recently mated with the breeding female, indicating pronounced last (or at least 'late') male sperm precedence. In the absence of males (male exclusion experiment) a large proportion of eggs remained unfertilized (resulting in haploid male offspring), but some diploid daughters arose from fathers that had been removed at least 11 days prior to egg laying. It appears that most A. manicatum eggs are fertilized with sperm from the bursa copulatrix, while the spermatheca serves only as a backup reservoir. This is the first demonstration of last male sperm precedence in aculeate Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants). We suggest that it has coevolved with 'resource defence' or 'patrolling'-like male mating strategies in Hymenoptera, and with polyandry in anthidiine bees.

AB Increasing levels of anthropogenic noise represent a challenge for animals living in urban areas and birds, especially, may suffer from noisy conditions as they use singing to attract mates. Most anthropogenic noise is low in frequency and singing at high frequencies under noisy urban conditions may avoid masking and thus be a good strategy for breeding success in cities. Despite comparative, correlational and some experimental studies supporting this hypothesis, empirical studies on the impact of noise on sexual behaviour are largely lacking. Domestic canaries, Serinus canaria, provide an excellent model system to test unequivocal sexual responsiveness as receptive females perform copulation solicitation displays (CSD) to male song. We have previously shown that CSD rate was higher for low-than for high-frequency songs. In the current study, we tested whether a typical urban noise spectrum, with a bias towards low frequencies, could undermine sexual preferences. Using overlapping and alternating noise exposure regimes while broadcasting male songs we found that masking by urban noise reduced female responsiveness to low-frequency attractive songs. Under the same conditions the responsiveness to high-frequency songs remained unaffected and, consequently, the sexual preference for low-over high-frequency songs had faded because of the urban noise. We discuss to what extent our results can be extrapolated to other wild bird species and speculate about the adaptive value of the typical upward shift in frequency found in many city birds.

AB Care provided by females of many mammal species varies naturally between individuals; these differences in turn influence the phenotypic development of their offspring. When individual maternal behavioural traits are consistent over a number of breeding periods, maternal styles can be defined. These styles have been studied in a large range of mammalian species. Nevertheless, mammals rarely offer the possibility to dissociate mothers' behavioural influence from their genetic influence or their physiological influence via lactation. Here, we provide, for the first time, evidence of the existence of a precocial bird species' maternal styles. By using an adoption procedure we evaluated how maternal style affected the behaviour of Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica, chicks, via exclusively nongenomic mechanisms. As well as evidence for the existence of maternal styles in this species, we also found correlations between females' temperaments, maternal styles and their fostered chicks' development. Our findings indicate that maternal styles are key features that help understand nongenomic transmission of behavioural characteristics whose vectors have remained poorly understood.

AB In the present study, we sought to determine the influence of stress and temperament on working memory for disappearing food in horses. After assessment of five dimensions of temperament, we tested working memory of horses using a delayed-response task requiring a choice between two food locations. Delays ranging from 0 to 20 s were tested. The duration of working memory for disappearing food was first characterized without stressors (N = 26). The horses were then divided into two groups and their performance was assessed under stressful (exposure to acute stressors prior to testing, N = 12) or control conditions (N = 12). Results showed that the duration of working memory for disappearing food lasted at least 20 s under nonstressful conditions, and that under stressful conditions this duration lasted less than 12 s. This stress-induced impairment confirms in a nonrodent species that working memory performance is very sensitive to exposure to stressors. In addition, working memory performance in horses is influenced by the temperamental dimension of fearfulness according to the state of stress: fearful horses showed better performance under control conditions and worse performance under stressful conditions than nonfearful horses. These findings are discussed in the context of the Yerkes-Dodson law of stress and performance. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mating theory (Hubbell & Johnson 1987, American Naturalist, 130, 91-112; Gowaty & Hubbell 2009, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 106, 10017-10024) says that reproductive decisions of individuals are flexibly expressed and adaptive. It also makes the following five predictions about polyandry. (1) Demography determines within-population, between-female variation in mating rates. That is, (a) an individual's encounters with potential mates, (b) an individual's risk of death, (c) the number of potential mates in the population, (d) the distribution of fitness under random mating, and (e) for nonvirgins, the duration of any postcopulation period of nonreceptivity together determine within-population, between-female variation in mating rate. (2) When demography is dynamic, there is unlikely to be an optimal female mating rate. That is, when potential mates enter or leave the pool of potential mates or when decision makers face survival risks from conspecifics, predators, parasites or pathogens, females who adaptively adjust their reproductive decisions in real-time outcompete females whose behaviour is fixed. (3) Female multiple mating often increases production of adult offspring through enhanced offspring viability (indirect fitness) and between-generation lineage success. (4) Polyandry will increase female exposure to pathogens and thus decrease female survival (direct fitness cost) unless females use environmental or intrinsic resources or opportunities to reduce survival risks. (5) Under many circumstances, female remating may enhance female survival (direct fitness benefit). Future research attention will focus on how intrinsic, ecological and social opportunities/constraints affect the likelihood of polyandry and its fitness effects for particular females. Future researchers may also consider that polyandrous mating is sometimes sexually collaborative and cooperative, rather than always sexually antagonistic.

AB Aposematic prey warn predators of their toxicity using conspicuous signals. However, predators regularly include aposematic prey in their diets, particularly when they are in a poor energetic state and in need of nutrients. We investigated whether or not an environmental factor, ambient temperature, could change the energetic state of predators and lead to an increased intake of prey that they know to contain toxins. We found that European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, increased their consumption of mealworm, Tenebrio molitor, prey containing quinine (a mild toxin) when the ambient temperature was reduced below their thermoneutral zone from 20 degrees C to 6 degrees C. The birds differed in their sensitivity to changes in ambient temperature, with heavier birds increasing the number of toxic prey they ate more rapidly with decreasing temperature compared to birds with lower body mass. This could have been the result of their requiring more nutrients at lower temperatures or being better able to detoxify quinine. Taken together, our results suggest that conspicuous coloration may be more costly at lower temperatures, and that aposematic prey may need to invest more in chemical defences as temperatures decline. Our study also provides novel insights into what factors affect birds' decisions to eat toxic prey, and demonstrates that selection pressures acting on prey defences can vary with changing temperature across days, seasons, climes, and potentially in response to climate change.

AB Ethologists have often reported preferences for novel signals, especially if they are more extravagant than normal signals. Such preferences presumably reflect sensory biases that may promote the evolution of both novel and complex signals. We tested behavioural responses of female grey treefrogs, Hyla versicolor, to novel complex calls in relation to the response properties of previously described temporally selective neurons in the auditory midbrain. As predicted by the selectivity of interval-counting neurons, females discriminated against synthetic advertisement calls containing a gap, a missed pulse or a pulse of abnormally short duration. The addition of a novel tonal appendage to such defective calls often resulted in partial restoration of the attractiveness of the signal. The restorative effect occurred only when an appendage with a higher amplitude followed (rather than led) the defective call. Our results show how the consideration of proximate mechanisms can provide insights about the evolution of complex signals; the behavioural results, in turn, suggest new ways of assessing the response properties of the auditory system.

AB Status signals are thought to reduce costs of overt conflict over resources by advertising social status or an individual's ability to win contests. While most studies have focused on single badges of status, recent empirical work has shown that multiple status signals may exist. To provide robust evidence for multiple badges of status, an experimental manipulation is required to decouple signals from one another and from other traits linked to fighting ability. Such experimental evidence is lacking for most studies of multiple status signals to date. We previously found that two plumage traits in golden-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia atricapilla, were correlated with social dominance in encounters between unfamiliar individuals. To confirm that each plumage patch functions as an independent status signal, we experimentally augmented the sizes of the gold crown patch and the black crown patch during encounters between unfamiliar individuals with similar premanipulation crown sizes. In nearly all cases, the individual with the artificially augmented gold or black crown was dominant during the trial and manipulations of each colour were equally successful in conferring dominance. The relative differences in crown sizes between manipulated and unmanipulated individuals in a dyad and mismatches in crown sizes of the manipulated bird led to escalation in gold trials, but these same factors were not significant for black trials. This study provides unequivocal evidence for multiple status signals: both black and gold crown patches influence social status per se and they do so independently of the other crown patch.

AB Variation in life history arises when individuals adopt alternative strategies for allocating finite resources to different traits to maximize fitness. Optimal strategies can vary not only between, but also within, species, and in particular between males and females. Variation in life histories can therefore affect the relative importance and impact of sexual selection, and this will itself feed back into how life histories evolve. Previous work has revealed that female mate choice tends to decline with age. However, similar measures of life history variation in male mate choice are lacking. We addressed this in an investigation of male mate choice in Drosophila melanogaster. We gave males the opportunity to choose a mate every day of their lives then measured variation in reproductive output. Males that were given the opportunity to choose their mates showed a subtle but significant benefit of choice during their early reproductive lives. This was negated during their late reproductive lives, however, when it was males that were given a randomly selected mate each day that fared progressively better in terms of number of offspring gained. This evidence suggests that a life history trade-off between early and late reproduction can arise in males given a regular choice of mate. We therefore identified novel age-dependent variation in the benefits of male mate choice. Our study shows the importance of considering choice in the context of life history, to gain more accurate estimates of the fitness benefits of choice.

AB It is well known that the environment a group inhabits influences the frequency at which its members use information gained from one another, that is, social information. However, the potential link between internal state (i.e. individual and social physiology) and use of social information has received little attention. This is surprising as it is known that internal state has profound effects on group behaviour in many group-living animals and especially eusocial insects. Energy reserves are a particularly important determinant of internal state and have been predicted to affect the use of social information. However, empirical studies on foraging dynamics of ants subjected to different durations of food deprivation supply conflicting evidence. We investigated how information is gained by the tandem-running ant, Temnothorax albipennis, when the colony had been fed compared to when it had been deprived of food. Our results indicate that both individual and social information gathering occurred significantly more when the colony had been deprived of food and that both were fine-tuned to internal state. We found no strong evidence that social information gathering increased more quickly with an increased perceived level of starvation. We suggest that differences between colonies in their internal state can be an explanation for the inconsistencies among previous studies regarding whether low food availability increases or decreases the benefit of acquiring social information.

AB Brood care can improve with experience, and experience under natural conditions increases with age. We aimed to evaluate the relative effect of experience by comparing experienced and inexperienced females of the same age under controlled conditions. Using 18 experienced (XP) and 22 inexperienced (NXP) female Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica. of the same age, we monitored maternal behaviour towards foster chicks. We evaluated the social and emotional reactivity of these females before the breeding period and of the fostered chicks after separation from their mothers. Thus, we determined both how maternal experience affects adult females' nonmaternal behaviour and how potential differences in their maternal behaviour affect chicks' behavioural development. We found that although previous breeding experience per se did not influence either their general fearfulness or their sociality, it did influence the way females coped with novelty. Although most of the maternal care variables did not differ significantly between XP and NXP females, we found several differences, mainly concerning first-time female breeders' more abusive behaviour during the first few days of the breeding period. We suggest that these differences in care are related more to inexperienced females' higher neophobia than to an improvement in the quality of care with experience. In tests, chicks showed differences similar to those of their mothers: chicks brooded by inexperienced females reacted more to novelty than chicks brooded by experienced females. We consider this result to be a case of nongenomic maternal transmission. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two common challenges faced by signallers, which can affect signal efficacy and are intrinsic to the communication process, are (1) that intended receivers are often inattentive and (2) that the spacing of animals in a habitat is relatively fluid. Signal modulation has been proposed to be an effective strategy to cope with these challenges by providing a mechanism to maintain signal efficacy. We evaluated this hypothesis by testing the use of modulation in the tropical lizard Anolis gundlachi. We characterized the motion properties of the sensory system and measured the physical properties of movement-based headbob displays given during staged social encounters under natural conditions. We found a significant positive association between the maximum amplitude of headbob displays and the distance to intended receivers. Modulation occurred in response to small-scale changes in signallr-receiver distance, and signallers gave displays that fell within a range of amplitudes predicted to optimally stimulate the visual system of A. gundlachi. Our findings strongly suggest that modulation of the physical properties of motion-based signals can be an effective mechanism to tune signals to the combined effects of characteristics of receiver sensory systems and receiver distance, and can serve as a behavioural strategy to cope with relatively frequent changes in the spacing of individuals.

AB Mating status is one of the most important predictors of the mating propensity of an individual. This is because mating lowers the amount of sperm cells and seminal fluids available to donate for males and increases the amount of ejaculate received by females, which may both have an effect on the mating propensity. In simultaneous hermaphrodites with reciprocal copulation, the mating status is expected to affect the mating propensity in both the male and the female sex function within a single individual, but empirical evidence is scarce. We experimentally tested the effect of the mating status of an individual and its partner on copulatory and postcopulatory behaviour in the free-living flatworm Macrostomum lignano, an outcrossing simultaneous hermaphrodite. These worms have frequent reciprocal copulations and often display a postcopulatory suck behaviour, potentially involved in removing ejaculate components from their own sperm-receiving organ. Virgin pairs copulated more, earlier and for longer than sexually experienced pairs. Moreover, we observed fewer sucks in virgin than sexually experienced pairs, all consistent with a higher willingness both to donate and to receive sperm in virgins. We investigated whether the lower suck frequency in virgin pairs depends on the mating status of the focal individual or on that of its partner. Surprisingly, the results suggested that the suck frequency depends on the mating status of the partner. We discuss these results in the context of potential sexual conflicts over the performance of the suck behaviour. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although testosterone (T) has well known organizational and activational effects on aggression, the relationship between the two is not always clear. The challenge hypothesis addresses this problem by proposing that T will affect aggression only in fitness-enhancing situations. One way to test the challenge hypothesis is to examine the relationship between T and different types of aggression. Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, show aggressive behaviours in several contexts and provide an opportunity for such a test. Here we show that urinary T influences a form of male chimpanzee reproductive aggression, territorial boundary patrols. In contrast, T does not affect predatory behaviour, a form of aggression that has no immediate link to male reproduction. While these results are consistent with the challenge hypothesis, our results indicate that male chimpanzees experience a significant drop in urinary T during hunts. Additional analyses reveal that males who share meat with others display this decrease. The reason for this decrement is unclear, but we hypothesize that the relative lack of aggression that results from voluntary sharing episodes and the tolerance engendered by such acts may be contributory factors.

AB When competing over parental resources, young animals may be typically selfish to the point of siblicide. This suggests that limited parental resources promote the evolution of sibling competition rather than altruistic or cooperative behaviours. In striking contrast, we show here that in 71% of experimental three-chick broods, nestling barn owls, Tyto alba, gave food to their siblings on average twice per night. This behaviour prevailed in the first-born dominant nestlings rather than the last-born subordinate nestlings. It was also more prevalent in individuals displaying a heritable dark phaeomelanin-based coloration, a typical female-specific plumage trait (owls vary from dark reddish to white, females being on average darker reddish than males). Stealing food items from siblings, which occurred in 81% of the nests, was more frequent in light than dark phaeomelanic dominant nestlings. We suggest that food sharing has evolved in the barn owl because parents store prey items in their nest that can be used by the offspring to feed their nestmates to derive indirect (kin selection) or direct benefits (pseudoreciprocity or by-product mutualism). The cost of feeding siblings may be relatively low for dominant individuals while the indirect genetic benefits could be high given that extrapair paternity is infrequent in this species. Thus, in situations in which young animals have access to more food resources than they currently need, they can altruistically share them with their siblings.

AB In many species, condition-dependent secondary sexual traits are important for female choice. In the spider Pisaura mirabilis, males offer females a nuptial gift (prey wrapped in silk) during courtship. Gift construction may involve high costs for males, and those in low condition invest less time and silk in wrapping the prey. We investigated how male condition and gift wrapping affect male reproductive success and whether females use the wrapped gift as an honest indicator of male condition. We experimentally manipulated male condition (satiated and starved males) and gift wrapping (well- and poorly wrapped gifts) and carried out experiments in a fully factorial design. We found that males in good condition were more successful in obtaining matings and obtained longer copulations than males in poor condition. In contrast, gift wrapping did not affect female mate choice. Only good-condition males obtained offspring. Gift wrapping is an honest indicator of male condition, but in spite of this females did not use this information in mate choice. We argue that because gift wrapping mainly functions to promote male interests, good-condition males would also be better at cheating the female, for example using wrapping to hide a worthless gift. Females should therefore evolve to ignore the wrapping information and instead base their mate choice decision on male traits that unequivocally benefit their own reproductive success. Our results are consistent with this prediction, as females discriminated males based only on their actual feeding condition, and this choice provided them with direct reproductive benefits.

AB Parental provisioning strategies are central to life history theory, as one of the main components that adults can adjust to maximize their fitness. In altricial species, newly born young rely entirely on parents for food. Provisioning strategies are thus crucial for offspring survival and growth, but they may also have major consequences for parental lifetime reproductive success, especially in long-lived species. We investigated provisioning strategies in an offshore seabird, the king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, through the number of times parents return to the colony to feed their chick, using a pluriannual database on more than 800 microtagged penguins. King penguin chick rearing can be divided into three periods: (1) from thermal emancipation to the onset of winter, (2) winter and (3) from the end of winter to fledging. Overall, we found that the number of feeding visits was larger for males, as well as for older and larger individuals. The timing of the winter low-provisioning period (15 May-1 September; shorter than previously described) did not vary according to sex, age or breeding timing. We found four different parental strategies during the winter period, from complete absence to regular foraging trips, which led to different breeding success rates. These four strategies were observed in the 6 study years, and in both sexes, although in different proportions. They were not explained by individuals' age, and individuals were not consistent across years, the decision to follow a strategy probably reflecting the trade-off between the bird's current condition and its environment.

AB In many social species, competition between groups is a major factor proximately affecting group-level movement patterns and space use and ultimately shaping the evolution of group living and complex sociality. Here we evaluated the factors influencing group-level dominance among five social groups of wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus), in particular focusing on the spatial determinants of dominance and the consequences of defeat. When direct conflict occurred between conspecific baboon groups, the winning group was predicted by differences in the number of adult males in each group and/or groups that had used the areas surrounding the encounter location more intensively than their opponent in the preceding 9 or 12 months. Relative intensity of space use over shorter timescales (3 and 6 months) was a poor predictor of the interaction's outcome. Losing groups, but not winning groups, experienced clear short-term costs. Losing groups used the area surrounding the interaction less following an agonistic encounter (relative to their intensity of use of the area prior to the interaction). These findings offer insight into the influences and consequences of intergroup competition on group-level patterns of space use. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Web-building spiders are formidable predators of insects, and their venom and silk also afford them powerful defence. Nevertheless, some insects specialize on hunting web-building spiders. Stenolemus giraffa is a very large araneophagic assassin bug with an unusually elongated pronotum ('neck'). This araneophage routinely stalks web-building spiders either by walking onto the web or by leaning into the web to grasp spiders from vantage points on adjacent surfaces. Silk transmits even minute vibrations to resident spiders, and we investigated how S. giraffa circumvents this highly sensitive early warning system to approach spiders undetected. To investigate hunting decisions, and their relation to detection risk, we manipulated the predatory routes available to S. giraffa in pursuits of two spider species that build very different webs. For each prey spider species, S. giraffa tended to take routes that minimized contact with the web and its support lines. Stenolemus giraffa usually resorted to stepping onto the web to pursue spiders only once alternative routes had been explored and probably found inadequate, but even then they avoided the web capture area. For both prey spider species, route preferences of S. giraffa closely reflected risks of detection, indicating a predatory strategy that is finely linked to the perceptual world of the prey. Together with its subtle predatory strategy, S. giraffa's unusually elongated morphology probably functions to increase its ability to reach spiders from vantage points close to the web without stepping onto the web itself.

AB Research on predator-prey interactions often focuses largely on prey behaviour, treating predators as static danger, rather than as active behavioural participants that can respond adaptively to prey choices. A complete understanding of the functional significance of both predator attack behaviours and prey escape behaviours can only come from examining the interaction between both parties. For example, although the predatory strike of venomous snakes has been studied extensively in the laboratory, we have little understanding of the proximate factors influencing snake strike behaviour under natural conditions. Here, we report details of the analysis of predatory strikes of free-ranging rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) towards their natural prey. We found that over half of strike attempts were unsuccessful, and the most significant factor influencing strike success was the ability of prey animals to initiate a rapid evasive dodge manoeuvre in the fraction of a second after snakes initiated strikes, but before snake strikes contacted them. Snakes, in turn, initiated strikes most frequently towards the flank of laterally moving prey, which is probably an attempt to counter the ability of prey to dodge strikes.

AB In social species, individual and group fitness and social dynamics in groups often depend on group size and on the group's social composition (e.g. the mix of personality types within groups). In turn, the size and social composition of groups is an emergent outcome of the grouping tendencies of individuals. While grouping behaviour has often been studied at a species level, within-species variation in grouping tendency has rarely been studied. We examined the role of personality type in shoaling preferences in a social fish, the western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. After scoring individuals for their social personality types (sociability), we gave individuals the choice to associate with shoals that differed in size and in the average sociability of individuals in the shoal. Shoal preferences depended on both the individual's sociability and on shoal size and composition in sociability types, and on the interaction between the individual's sociability and shoal size and composition. On average, fish preferred large to small shoals and groups made up of social individuals to groups made of asocial individuals at least when shoal size was small. Individual sociability types were linked to the time individuals spent far from any shoal and to consistent differences in choosiness about social contexts. Asocial individuals shoaled less and swam more between shoals than social ones, but preferred large shoals during the short time that they shoaled. These results can help explain patterns of group size and composition and individual and population-level personality-dependent dispersal. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The behavioural lateralization observed in several invertebrate species appears to parallel the phenomenon seen in vertebrates. However, it is not yet clear whether lateralization in invertebrates varies within an individual across development as it does in vertebrates. We examined when during postembryonic development juvenile cuttlefish begin to show side-turning preferences in a T-shaped apparatus. We also determined whether or not the direction of turning was stimulus dependent by providing, or not providing, shelters in the two choice arms of the apparatus. We found that as the animals aged from 3 to 45 days posthatch they progressively developed a left-turning bias but only when shelters were provided in the apparatus. We suggest that left-turning biases in cuttlefish result from an eye use preference. Emergence of visual lateralization at the time of dispersal may afford juveniles greater behavioural efficiency by enabling them to look out for escape routes while hunting. The left visual field may be associated with rapid responses as in many species of vertebrates. Determining the role of the right visual field of cuttlefish when looking for prey may provide evidence for homology between lateralization in invertebrates and vertebrates.

AB We examined factors affecting the virulence of Metaphycus flavus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), a facultatively gregarious endoparasitoid of Coccus hesperidum (Hemiptera: Coccidae). Clutch size significantly negatively influenced encapsulation rates of the parasitoid's eggs by the host (in some cases encapsulation rates increased two-fold in incomplete clutches of eggs). Clutches were smaller when individuals sequentially parasitized two hosts in a patch. This resulted in increased egg encapsulation rates in the second parasitized host. Our results suggest that increased encapsulation rates in second hosts are due not entirely to clutch size, but also possibly to the depletion of chemicals with immunosuppressive properties that individual wasps inject inside hosts during oviposition. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that 4 h after the first oviposition experience wasp virulence decreased, whereas 48 h after oviposition experience virulence was regained. Our results suggest that parasitoid virulence is dynamic because it is directly linked with clutch size decisions. However, clutch size in synovigenic, egg-limited parasitoids such as M. flavus is influenced by several parameters such as egg load, experience, host availability and physiological state. This study has implications for understanding how constraints on the evolution of solitary to gregarious larval development have been overcome: the allocation of multiple eggs to suppress host immune defences could serve as the first step in the transition from solitary to gregarious development. We also discuss how larval immobility within a host and other life history characteristics of this species further facilitate this transition.

AB Timing is crucial for animals for optimizing foraging, travelling and breeding behaviours in spatiotemporally heterogeneous environments. Some seabirds, commuting between land-based nesting colonies and widely dispersed foraging areas at sea, return to their colonies within several hours after sunset. This temporal pattern raises the question of how they manage to time arrivals over largely variable homeward distances. However, no study has investigated their at-sea behavioural patterns associated with arrival times. To explore this question, we tracked breeding streaked shearwaters, Calonectris leucomelas, with GPS data loggers, which continuously recorded fine-scale movement paths during their trips. Shearwaters adjusted the onset of their homeward journeys according to wide-ranging distances between their chosen foraging areas and breeding colonies, leaving earlier from further locations. The start time of homing was pushed forward correlating with the increased travel time expected from their homeward distance and average movement speed. This resulted in arrivals at the colony concentrated within a few hours after sunset independent of the distances. To our knowledge, similar temporal tuning of homing trips has not been reported previously. The strong correlation between the timing and distance of homeward journeys implies this behaviour is ecologically important. Further experiments will help clarify its generality in the animal kingdom as well as proximate mechanism(s) and ultimate function( s). (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In battles between rival groups, aggression levels, and ultimately the outcome, may be influenced by the number of individuals and the resource-holding potential (RHP) of the individuals in each group. Since fighting in social animals can involve intragroup cooperation, the distribution of individual RHPs within the group could influence overall group ability. Thus, the total group fighting prowess might not simply equate to the sum of individual RHPs. We investigated the effects of within-group variance in individual RHP during battles in wood ants, Formica rufa. Rival groups were matched in number of individuals and mean body size of individuals but differed in the variance among body sizes. Larger individuals were most aggressive and small individuals were least aggressive. Overall, small individuals had the highest attrition rate and large individuals the lowest, with medium-sized individuals experiencing moderate attrition rates. Consequently, aggression and attrition rates in low-variance groups did not differ significantly from rates in high-variance groups, indicating that when group size and mean body mass are equal, the distribution of individual RHPs does not influence the overall fighting ability of the group. Rather, it appears that large individuals are able to compensate for poor performance by weaker group members. Crown Copyright (C) 2011.

AB It has been suggested that time selection and precedence in arrival order are more important during spring than autumn migration. Migrating birds are expected to fly at faster airspeeds if they minimize duration rather than energy costs of migration, and they are furthermore expected to complete their journeys by final sprint flights if it is particularly important to arrive at the destination before competitors. We tested these hypotheses by tracking-radar studies of nocturnal passerine migrants during several spring and autumn seasons at Lund (56 degrees N) and Abisko (68 degrees N) at the southern and northern ends of the Scandinavian Peninsula, respectively. The samples from these two sites represent migrants that are mostly rather far from (Lund) or close to (Abisko) their breeding destinations. We found that the birds were flying at clearly faster airspeeds in spring than in autumn at both study sites, with spring speeds exceeding autumn speeds by, on average, 16%, after taking effects of wind conditions and vertical flight speeds into account. This difference in speeds could not be explained by seasonal differences in body mass or wing morphology and thus supports the hypothesis of time-selected spring migration. There was also a significantly larger seasonal difference in airspeed at Abisko than at Lund, suggesting that the birds may have shown an inclination to sprint on their final spring flights to the breeding destinations, although this possible extra sprint effort was modest.

AB Polyandry may provide females with benefits that directly affect their condition and fecundity and/or that enhance the quality of their offspring through receiving better or more compatible paternal genes. In polyandrous species with sexual cannibalism, females may gain considerable nutritional benefits through consuming a mating partner. However, in many spiders with high rates of sexual cannibalism, males are very small compared to the females and nutritional gains through sexual cannibalism are considered small or absent. While this is widely accepted, no study has tested for effects of multiple mating with and without sexual cannibalism on female and offspring fitness. We designed an experiment that simultaneously investigated direct and indirect benefits of polyandry and sexual cannibalism in the orb-web spider Argiope bruennichi. We used monandrous and polyandrous females that were either allowed to consume their mating partner or not and recorded fecundity traits and offspring survival under simulated overwintering conditions. We found that female mating rate did not affect fecundity or offspring survival. But independent of female mating rate and the number of males consumed, cannibalistic females produced bigger clutches with heavier eggs. Cannibalistic females produced offspring with a prolonged survival time compared to the offspring of females that were prevented from eating males. This prolonged offspring survival was independent of female mating rate and the number of males consumed. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent mirror studies with two corvid species have reported contrasting findings. Jungle crows, Corvus macrorhynchos, showed no self-contingent behaviour when confronted with mirrors, whereas Eurasian magpies, Pica pica, reportedly passed the 'mark' test for self-recognition. We investigated mirror-induced behaviour in wild-caught New Caledonian crows, Corvus moneduloides. We first documented the response of 10 naive crows to a 50 x 40 cm vertical mirror. The crows responded to their mirror image with social displays and engaged in search and mirror-directed exploratory behaviour. Their agonistic social displays towards the mirror did not decrease in frequency over time. We then gave two of these crows and two naive ones a mirror-mediated spatial location task with a horizontal mirror. All four crows successfully used the horizontal mirror to locate hidden food. Therefore, they were able to exploit the correlation between an object's mirror reflection and its location in the real world. This suggests that New Caledonian crows may also have the ability to develop an understanding of how mirrors represent objects in the environment, despite the lack of self-directed behaviour in front of mirrors. Our study fills an important gap in mirror studies on corvids, which are considered to be the primate equivalents of the avian world. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The convict cichlid Amatitlania nigrofasciata is a monogamous, biparental teleost species. Convict cichlids form pairs to provide parental care and share in territory defence. In order for pairs to be successful there must be coordination of behaviour between the sexes. Although pair dynamics have been studied in the laboratory, few field experiments have investigated male and female responses to mate removal. We examined how convict cichlids modulate their parental defence behaviour in response to mate removal at Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Costa Rica. We presented convict cichlid pairs with a conspecific intruder and observed the parental defence behaviour of both individuals. One member of the pair was then removed and the remaining individual was presented with the intruder. Both males and females significantly increased aggression towards the intruder after the removal of the mate; however, males were able to fully compensate for the loss of the female, whereas females were not. These results suggest that both male and female convict cichlids may modulate their behaviour in response to changing stimuli. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Migrant birds face a choice where to spend the winter. Presumably there is a trade-off between migration distance (costs) and the quality of the wintering site (benefits). Wintering site fidelity is often high and increases with age. Hypotheses to explain such a pattern assume that wintering site choice maximizes fitness. We compared wintering site choice and age-dependent site fidelity in Eurasian spoonbills, Platalea leucorodia leucorodia, for the period 1992-2010. During their first southward migration, most spoonbills migrated to the southernmost wintering region (Mauritania and Senegal). Other birds were likely to move there from their first to their second winter, whereas hardly any birds moved to a more northerly wintering area. For the rest of their life, spoonbills remained highly site faithful. This resulted in most birds wintering in Mauritania and Senegal with smaller numbers in France and Iberia. We judged suitability of sites on the basis of annual survival probabilities in these three wintering areas. Surprisingly, survival was lowest in Mauritania and Senegal. None of the existing fitness maximization hypotheses explain this pattern and we discuss potential alternatives. Wintering site choice could still be optimal for individual birds if birds wintering in Mauritania and Senegal are competitively inferior to the European winterers or more susceptible to severe winter weather. Alternatively, wintering site choice of spoonbills is suboptimal and, assuming that spoonbills can assess differences in suitability, limited flexibility may prevent them from switching to more suitable sites.

AB The choices made by ovipositing female butterflies play a key role in the survival of their offspring and consequently in the persistence of butterfly populations. These choices are even more crucial in the case of obligate myrmecophilous organisms such as Maculinea butterflies with larvae that, after a phytophagous period, need to be adopted by Myrmica ants to complete their life cycle. Because the worker ants' foraging range is limited, selecting an 'ideal' oviposition site requires that both the phenological stage of the larval food plant (short-term larval fitness) and the presence of suitable host ants (long-term larval fitness) are taken into account. Whether the female's selection of a valuable oviposition plant is influenced by the closeness of a Myrmica nest is unclear. We studied the oviposition behaviour of a Maculinea arion population exploiting Origanum vulgare as a host plant. By following females, we collected phenological data on the visited plants that were either 'chosen' for oviposition or 'avoided' (flowers were visited and evaluated, but received no eggs), and we assessed the presence of Myrmica ants in the vicinity of each plant. Results suggest that plants are selected by M. arion females on the basis of their bud phenology and the presence of host ants and not of other environmental features. We thus hypothesize the evolution of an adaptive mechanism that affords females of this strictly myrmecophilous butterfly the ability to ensure the long-term survival of their brood by selecting host plants growing near a Myrmica nest.

AB In group-living species, individuals gain significant advantages from establishing an extensive network of social relationships. This results in complex organizations that are difficult to quantify in a comprehensive manner. In this respect, network analyses are an ideal means to pinpoint the overall properties of social structures, and the place of each individual within these structures. We used network measurements to investigate cross-species variations in the social style of macaques, and studied 12 groups from four species. Two species (Macaca mulatta, Macaca fuscata) were characterized by a relatively weak social tolerance, a steep gradient of dominance and a strong preference for kin. The other two species (Macaca nigra, Macaca tonkeana) were known to display higher levels of tolerance, relaxed dominance and low kinship bias. We used a centrality index based on eigenvector centrality to show that in a comparison of intolerant and tolerant species, top-ranking individuals were more central than other group members in the former species than the latter. We also found that networks had higher modularity in intolerant species, indicating that kin-related partners interacted more frequently in subgroups of these species than in those of tolerant species. Consistently, the matrix of body contacts was more strongly correlated with the kinship matrix in intolerant species. This study demonstrates the efficiency of network methodology in detecting fine and overall contrasts in social structures, and also reveals novel dimensions in the social style of macaques.

AB Predation cues influence the strength of byssal attachment in bivalves. In zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, anchorage increases in response to nonforaging roach, Rutilus rutilus, but decreases in response to artificially crushed conspecifics, and it remains unaltered by nonforaging crayfish. Given that anchorage to hard substrata protects against dislodgement by predators, the defensive value of its weakening under predation threat is unclear. Our first experiment examined changes in the byssal attachment of zebra mussels in response to active predation by the spinycheek crayfish, Orconectes limosus. We found that zebra mussels decreased their attachment strength when exposed to cues released as crayfish foraged on conspecific mussels. Our second experiment tested whether crayfish have a capacity for chemosensory detection of live zebra mussels. We exposed hungry crayfish resting in shelters to water with or without cues from live mussels. The cues stimulated abandonment of shelters. Our results agree with recent findings that zebra mussels reduce filter feeding in response to predation cues that contain odours of crushed conspecifics. We suggest that this response helps zebra mussels to evade odour-navigating predators (e.g. crayfish) by suppressing the emission of disclosing metabolites, and that a consequence of this physiological suppression is a predator-mediated decrease in byssal attachment.

AB Mate searching often involves chemical cues and is a key process in determining fitness in most sexually reproducing animals. Effective mate-searching strategies are, therefore, essential for individuals to avoid wasting resources as a result of misrecognition of mating partners. Marine snails in the genus Littoraria are among the most successful molluscan groups that live closely associated with mangroves. Their population densities are often low, and finding a mate within the complex three-dimensional habitat of tree leaves, branches and trunks requires an effective searching strategy. We tested whether males of L. ardouiniana and L. melanostoma located females by following their mucus trails. In the laboratory, male tracker snails followed mucus trails laid by conspecific female marker snails at a higher intensity compared with other marker-tracker sex combinations in the mating season, but not in the nonmating season, and this was more pronounced in L. ardouiniana. Male trackers did not move faster when following the trails of conspecific female markers compared with other sex combinations; however, tracker snails moved faster in the mating than in the nonmating season, although this might be related to temperature. In both species, males tracked females regardless of trail complexity, and the majority of male trackers were able to detect the direction (polarity) of the trails of conspecific females. Together with previous studies on rocky shore Littorina species, these findings suggest that sex pheromones are incorporated into mucus trails to facilitate the reproductive success of these snails. Mucus trail following is, therefore, an adaptive mate-searching strategy in intertidal gastropod molluscs, and potentially in other gastropod groups in which trail-following behaviour is prevalent.

AB Mate choice in mammals is often influenced by the presence or absence of familiarity with the potential mates. While females of many social species prefer to mate with unfamiliar males, many solitary female rodents exhibit a preference for familiar males. The harvest mouse is such a solitary species, with no intersexual size dimorphism, and in which the females are possibly dominant to the males. This leaves the females' choice of mate relatively unhindered by direct male coercion or male-male competition. To isolate the role of familiarity in female preference in the harvest mouse, we conducted a two-stage controlled choice experiment, in which the female had a choice between the scent of two males, one familiar and one unfamiliar to her, and, in the second stage, two tethered males. When only olfactory cues were available to the females, no preferences were observed. The results of the live test, however, showed that female harvest mice preferred familiar males over unfamiliar ones when they were in oestrus. Furthermore, females spent more time in proximity to unfamiliar males when they were not in oestrus; and the difference in the weights of the males affected the strength of the female's response, which was opposite for oestrous and dioestrous females. These results support the hypothesis that female harvest mice prefer mating with a familiar male, point to an interaction between familiarity and male size in female preference and highlight the importance of the female's reproductive state during mate preference tests.

AB Social and intrasexual competition for access to food, territory and reproduction is a major selection force acting on male phenotypes. In contrast, its evolutionary consequences for female phenotypes, especially female ornamentation, have been overlooked. Because fighting is costly for individuals, physical indicators of status that are correlated with aggressiveness or fighting ability are predicted to evolve. Under the badge of status hypothesis, individuals are predicted to attack unknown rivals that present signals of similar size or intensity more vigorously than dissimilar rivals. We used blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, to test whether UV/blue and yellow coloration mediates female aggression. We exposed territorial birds to two female blue tit decoys during nest building: one had a UV/blue crown with an enhanced UV signal (UV+) and the other had a reduced UV signal (UV-). We found that resident females with higher UV signal more often landed on the cage containing the UV- decoys whereas females with a lower UV signal more often landed on the cage containing the UV- decoys. This result suggests that UV/blue crown coloration is a badge of status and supports the hypothesis that female-female competition can generate or maintain female ornamentation. Resident females with darker yellow chests also attacked the decoys with greater intensity. Previous studies suggest that brighter yellow females invest more in reproduction and consequently could be more sexually attractive. So, this last result may be explained by a higher motivation of darker yellow females or a trade-off between aggressiveness and female investment in reproduction.

AB Lateralization in dogs, Canis familiaris, has been reported for paw usage and response to visual and acoustic stimuli. Surprisingly, however, no investigation of possible lateralization for the most relevant sensory domain of dogs, namely olfaction, has been carried out. Here we investigated left and right nostril use in dogs freely sniffing different emotive stimuli in unrestrained conditions. When sniffing novel nonaversive stimuli (food, lemon, vaginal secretion and cotton swab odours), dogs showed initial preferential use of the right nostril and then a shift towards use of the left nostril with repeated stimulus presentation. When sniffing arousal stimuli such as adrenaline and veterinary sweat odorants, dogs showed a consistent right nostril bias all over the series of stimulus presentations. Results suggest initial involvement of the right hemisphere in processing of novel stimuli followed by the left hemisphere taking charge of control of routine behaviour. Sustained right nostril response to arousal stimuli appears to be consistent with the idea that the sympathetic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is mainly under the control of the right hemisphere. The implications of these findings for animal welfare are discussed. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Personality traits are becoming increasingly important in explaining adaptive individual differences in animal behaviour and probably represent a leading edge of the evolutionary process. Despite the new-found interest in animal personality among behavioural ecologists, few studies have investigated the link between personality traits and fitness measures. We examined this link using male rainbowfish, Melanotaenia duboulayi, as a model species and found that a range of personality traits (aggression, activity and boldness) covaried with a male's position in a hierarchy, which is directly related to reproductive success in this and many other species. Dominant fish were more aggressive, active, bold and also significantly larger than subordinate fish. Moreover, we found strong correlations between activity levels and boldness suggesting that selection may act on a suite of traits in concert (sensu behavioural syndromes). When taken together with previous research, our results suggest that the activity-boldness syndrome is likely to be domain specific. We suggest that multiple trait correlations may be generated by high levels of competition (e. g. sexual selection) in addition to predation pressure as identified by previous studies.

AB Despite rapidly accumulating evidence for the existence of consistent individual differences in suites of correlated behaviours (i.e. 'animal personalities'), little is known about proximate mechanisms causing such variation. Individual variation in circulating levels of testosterone (T) is often hypothesized to underpin personality traits such as aggressiveness and exploratory behaviour. Here we provide a comprehensive test of this hypothesis. We quantified variation in exploratory behaviour of a novel environment in a captive population of wild-caught male house sparrows, Passer domesticus. We then investigated the relationship between the observed behaviours and circulating levels of T, using two approaches. First, we tested whether measures of exploratory behaviour correlated with (1) point-sampled plasma T levels and (2) T-dependent ornamentation (bill coloration) in 114 males. Neither direct nor indirect estimates of individual variation in T levels were correlated with the assayed behaviours. Second, we experimentally increased plasma T levels of 21 males with T implants, using 21 placebo-implanted males as a control group. Experimentally induced between-individual variation in T levels did not increase the amount of between-individual variation in exploratory behaviour. Our results thus strongly suggest that, in house sparrows, between-individual variation in circulating levels of T cannot serve as a causal explanation for the existence of individual variation in exploratory behaviour.

AB New Caledonian (NC) crows, Corvus moneduloides, have impressive tool-manufacturing and tool-using skills in the wild, and captive birds have displayed exceptional cognitive abilities in experimental situations. However, their social system is largely unknown. In this study we investigated whether the social structure of NC crows might have had a role in the development of their cognitive skills. We observed crows in their natural habitat on the island of Mare, New Caledonia, and estimated their social network size based on tolerance to family and nonfamily crows at feeding tables. Our findings suggest that NC crows are not a highly social corvid species. Their core unit was the immediate family consisting of a pair and juveniles from up to two consecutive breeding years. Pairs stayed together year round, and were closely accompanied by juveniles during their first year of life. Parents were highly tolerant of juveniles and sometimes continued to feed them well into their second year. NC crows predominantly shared feeding tables with immediate family. Of the nonfamily crows tolerated, juveniles were overrepresented. The main mechanism for any social transmission of foraging skills is likely to be vertical (from parents to offspring), with only limited opportunity for horizontal transmission. The social organization we found on Mare is consistent with the idea that NC crows' multiple pandanus tool designs on mainland Grande Terre are an example of cumulative technological evolution.

AB Theory suggests that secondary sexual traits should honestly reflect males' immunocompetence. We tested whether the activation of a male's immune system has an effect on the female's mate choice in Tenebrio molitor. We found that after a single parasite-like activation of their immune system by a nylon monofilament, males did not suffer from increased mortality but their ability to attract a mate was reduced. However, after a repeated immune challenge, the females more often chose the treatment males, although these males later suffered a high mortality rate, suggesting terminal investment in sexual signalling. The reduced encapsulation response against the nylon implant and reduced survival of these males suggest they did not invest in recovery of their immune system. Our results suggest that under terminal investment males preferred by females may signal their condition dishonestly. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Individuals confronted with novel environments, for instance recently modified environments such as towns or recently occupied habitats such as colonization fronts, have to cope with a lack of information about the location of resources. We hypothesized that, under these conditions, individuals of a social species such as European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, would be more responsive to social cues indicating food presence than individuals belonging to populations already established in a well-known habitat. To test this hypothesis, we displayed starling decoys with various age, group size and interindividual distance characteristics in feeding postures to evaluate their attractiveness to starlings from towns and colonization fronts and noted whether attracted individuals joined particular decoy groups. Our results supported our hypothesis that sensitivity to social cues varied according to the population's history, and we suggest that these cues enhance the success of starlings in occupying new habitats.

AB Homosexual behaviour occurs in over 130 species of birds, yet explaining its maintenance in evolutionary terms appears problematic at face value, as such sexual behaviours do not seem in immediate pursuit of reproductive goals. Parental care sexual conflict theory predicts that release from parental care translates to an increased propensity towards polygamous sexual behaviour. We hypothesized that homosexual behaviour(s) may be expected to increase in frequency for the sex that invests less in parental care and potentially enjoys increased mating opportunities. Consistent with our predictions, lower relative contribution to parental care for a particular sex is related to increased frequency of occurrence of homosexual behaviour. For males, highly polygynous species with minimal male parental investment exhibit higher frequencies of male homosexual behaviour, including male-male mounting and especially courtship. In socially monogamous species, male parental investment is greater, and the expression of male homosexual behaviour is lower. Similarly, among pair-bonding species, frequencies of male-male pair bonding increase with decreases in male contribution to care relative to females. When females of socially monogamous species provide less care than males, they exhibit higher frequencies of homosexual behaviour, namely pair bonding and courtship activities. Conversely, when females of polygynous species provide the bulk of parental care, female-female sexual behaviour is infrequently expressed. Homosexual behaviour in birds is more likely to occur under scenarios of enhanced mating opportunity without necessarily influencing reproductive success and thus may exist neutrally, or alternatively provide a behavioural template co-opted for adaptive design.

AB Animal behaviour is often a function of the animal's physiological state. Groups of animals will often contain individuals with a range of physiological states and the grazing behaviour of herbivores is affected by their physiological state. This study compared the grazing decisions of animals in groups of single and mixed physiological states. Using a grazing model that simulated individual herbivore behaviour in relation to environmental distributions of forage resource (grass) and parasites (faeces), we tested the hypothesis that an animal's level of parasite exposure via the faecal-oral route is affected by the composition of physiological states in the group. Four physiological states were considered: parasite-naive, parasitized, lactating and parasite-immune animals. Baseline parasite exposure levels for each state were generated by simulating single-state groups and were compared to simulations of each of the six two-state combinations. In single-state groups parasitized animals had the least and lactating animals had the greatest levels of parasite exposure. When co-grazing with lactating animals, parasitized, immune and naive animals increased their parasite exposure, relative to single-state groups. When co-grazing with parasitized animals, lactating, immune and naive animals reduced their parasite exposure, relative to single-state groups. There was no difference in parasite exposure of the immune or naive animals co-grazing together when compared to the single-state groups. These results highlight the need to recognize the impact of the individual when studying group-living animals. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The concept of information plays a central role in studies of animal communication. Animals' responses to the calls of different individuals, to food calls, alarm calls, and to signals that predict behaviour, all suggest that recipients acquire information from signals and that this information affects their response. Some scientists, however, want to replace the concept of information with one based on the 'manipulation' of recipients by signallers through the induction of nervous-system responses. Here we review both theory and data that argue against hypotheses based exclusively on manipulation or on a fixed, obligatory link between a signal's physical features and the responses it elicits. Results from dozens of studies indicate that calls with 'arousing' or 'aversive' features may also contain information that affects receivers' responses; that acoustically similar calls can elicit different responses; acoustically different calls can elicit similar responses; and 'eavesdropping' animals respond to the relationship instantiated by signal sequences. Animal signals encode a surprisingly rich amount of information. The content of this information can be studied scientifically. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ability to acquire knowledge and skills from others is widespread in animals and is commonly thought to be responsible for the behavioural traditions observed in many species. However, in spite of the extensive literature on theoretical analyses and empirical studies of social learning, little attention has been given to whether individuals acquire knowledge from a single individual or multiple models. Researchers commonly refer to instances of sons learning from fathers, or daughters from mothers, while theoreticians have constructed models of uniparental transmission, with little consideration of whether such restricted modes of transmission are actually feasible. We used mathematical models to demonstrate that the conditions under which learning from a single cultural parent can lead to stable culture are surprisingly restricted ( the same reasoning applies to a single social-learning event). Conversely, we demonstrate how learning from more than one cultural parent can establish culture, and find that cultural traits will reach a nonzero equilibrium in the population provided the product of the fidelity of social learning and the number of cultural parents exceeds 1. We discuss the implications of the analysis for interpreting various findings in the animal social-learning literature, as well as the unique features of human culture.

AB Alarm calling is a classic problem in evolutionary biology. Although a signaller may increase the likelihood of survival for group members, which typically include kin and mates, there are inherent risks associated with any behaviour that increases conspicuousness to predators. Callers can increase their indirect benefits by calling only in the presence of an appropriate audience and manage concomitant costs by judicious investment. Possible tactics for controlling costs include facultative variation in call structure and timing, as well as sensitivity to the environmental and social factors that predict personal vulnerability. We examined individual variation in the alarm-calling behaviour of male fowl in naturalistic social groups. Previous studies of cost management have focused on variation at the level of alarm call rate. We took advantage of recent advances in wireless sound recording and remote video monitoring to test for more subtle variation in signal structure and timing. These were then mapped onto individual mating success and moment-to-moment changes in environmental and social context. Results replicate the previous finding that alarm calling is sensitive to both social rank and recent mating success. In addition, we detected systematic variation in call structure as a function of personal vulnerability and proximity to a rival male. The frequency bandwidth of alarms was reliably influenced by degree of vigilance prior to calling, suggesting that this acoustic dimension reflects motivational state. Taken together, these results reveal several novel tactics for risk management, complementing those previously described at the level of gross variation in alarm-calling behaviour.

AB Individual recognition is expected to enhance fitness by allowing animals to direct appropriate behaviours to specific individuals during interactions with conspecifics. Reduced aggression towards territorial neighbours ('dear enemy phenomenon') is based on the assumption that strangers lacking territories pose a greater threat than territory-holding neighbours. Based on the ability of the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum (tuco-tuco) to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar conspecific odours, I assessed whether males, the more aggressive sex, show dear enemy relationships and whether social experience with odour donors affects the memory of conspecific odours. Male-male contests in the laboratory were used to compare the aggressive behaviour of pairs of males. Familiar male tuco-tucos responded less aggressively during contests than unfamiliar males, providing evidence of the dear enemy relationship in C. talarum. Memory for familiar odours was affected by social experience since discrimination of known from novel odours lasted longer when males encountered each other in dyadic contests following familiarization with odours. Familiarity by odour cues would represent an important mechanism mediating neighbour recognition and territorial behaviour for tuco-tucos in the wild; intruders may represent a threat of great consequence for territory-holding individuals since they represent the potential loss of their burrow system and their priority of access to neighbouring females.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
DE acoustic adaptation; urban noise; vocalization frequency
ID VOCAL CONVERGENCE; PLASTICITY; COMMUNICATION; IMPACT
AB Urban environments present an opportunity to study the evolution of animal communication in acoustically novel habitats. Several species of birds raise the minimum frequency of vocalizations in urban noise, which is louder at lower frequencies. We recorded 12 species of birds in urban and nonurban environments, and tested whether the extent to which different species raise their minimum frequency is related to the frequency range they use. We found that raising the minimum frequency is common in urban birds and is not restricted to passerine song, but also occurs in other vocalizations of passerines and parrots. There was a strong curvilinear relation between the extent to which urban birds raise the minimum frequency and the typical minimum frequency of the species: species with intermediate minimum frequencies (around 1-1.5 kHz) raised the frequency more than species with either higher or lower minimum frequency. This suggests that high-frequency species, which are less affected by urban noise, do not need to adjust the frequency of vocalizations as much. It also suggests that for species with very low frequencies, in a frequency range where urban noise augments exponentially, increasing frequency may not overcome masking by noise efficiently, and these species may use different adaptations. This indicates that frequency differences between species influence the way in which they respond to the same communication problem (masking by low-frequency noise), and possibly also the subsequent evolution of acoustic signals.

AB The ability to distinguish between members of a social group and unfamiliar individuals is a critical element of social behaviour. Social insects can differentiate between nestmates and non-nestmates via recognition cues, which in most species are cuticular hydrocarbons. Cuticular hydrocarbon patterns are altered by genotype and environmental conditions, but it is unclear whether colony social conditions can also affect nestmate interactions. Honeybee queens produce pheromones that regulate many aspects of worker behaviour, physiology and colony organization. A five-component blend, queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), produces many of the effects of a live queen. We found that QMP treatment alters how resident bees interact with intruder bees, based on standard nestmate recognition assays. However, QMP does not appear to alter the ability of bees to distinguish between nestmates and non-nestmates, or general aggression levels. Rather, QMP exposure significantly alters cuticular hydrocarbon patterns of worker bees, suggesting that QMP-treated nestmates are no longer recognized as nestmates by untreated bees, and vice versa. Thus, queen pheromone can have significant effects on nestmate recognition and interactions in honeybees, which may be important for colony cohesion.

AB Comparative and longitudinal studies have shown that stone-handling (SH) behaviour, defined as the noninstrumental manipulation of stones by performing various behavioural patterns, is socially transmitted across generations as a cultural behaviour in Japanese macaques. We investigated experimentally how stimulus/local enhancement, a form of indirect social influence through the physical traces typically left in the environment by previous stone handlers, might trigger SH behaviour at the individual level, and thus could contribute to the maintenance of the SH tradition at the group level. Through the semicontrolled conditions of field experiments, conducted in the free-ranging provisioned Arashiyama E troop, in which the SH tradition has been well established for nearly three decades, our results supported the stimulus/local enhancement hypothesis. Most group members preferentially directed their SH behaviour towards typical physical traces of SH activity (piles of stones) over randomly scattered stones. Encountering SH artefacts enhanced the use of these particular stones for performing SH in that particular part of the environment. The common occurrence of such 'play stations' may favour the frequent reuse of the same stones over time and explain the transport of stones between and around SH artefacts. We provided evidence for the role of indirect social inputs on the long-term persistence of the SH tradition in Japanese macaques, through SH by-products, the stimulating effect of which can be delayed in time and separate in space from others. We discuss our findings from the perspective of socially mediated behaviours, conformity-enforcing responses and niche construction. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Under sexual conflict, males evolve traits to increase their mating and reproductive success that impose costs on females. Females evolve counteradaptations to resist males and reduce those costs. Sexual harassment is a form of sexual conflict in which males make repeated, costly attempts to mate. Costs to female foraging or predation risk have been measured in several species, but quantitative measurements of direct fitness costs are rare. In the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius; Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), males harass females, and females resist all mating attempts. We placed bees in large, outdoor cages with various male-biased sex ratios. Harassment rate, nest progression, offspring production, temperature, and food availability were measured daily for 7 days. Harassment rates were highest at intermediate sex ratios. Harassment reduced the number of foraging trips and increased the duration of foraging trips made by females. Females produced offspring at a slower rate when subjected to higher rates of harassment. This shows a direct link from sex ratio to harassment to female fitness under natural conditions. We also discuss an alternative explanation that female resistance is a mechanism for mate choice for high-quality males, which would require that indirect benefits accrue through either daughters or grandsons, because all sons in haplodiploid species arise from unfertilized eggs.

AB According to the good genes model of sexual selection, females choose males of good heritable genetic quality to obtain offspring with high fitness. However, better mating success of high-quality males can also be brought about by direct interference competition between males, or simply through elevated activity of high-quality males. We examined the roles of different processes leading to sexual selection for genetic quality in Drosophila montana. We manipulated genetic quality of male flies by inducing mutations with ionizing radiation. We then recorded the effects of inherited heterozygous mutations on several aspects of mating behaviour of males and females in two experiments. We found that mutations reduced the probability of courtship and extended the latency to courtship of the males, suggesting male activity plays a role in selection for genetic quality. However, the effects of mutations on mating success and mating behaviour of the flies were in general weak. No evidence for female mate choice or interference competition between males acting against heritable mutations was found. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Offspring discrimination, the differential treatment of offspring and unrelated young, functions in numerous animal taxa to ensure that vital and costly parental care behaviours are appropriately directed. Discrimination can be facilitated either by direct (phenotypic) recognition of offspring or by indirect (nonphenotypic) recognition of offspring location. Offspring discrimination and recognition mechanisms have not been identified in an amphibian. In the strawberry poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, a dendrobatid frog with obligatory maternal provisioning behaviour, I tested whether mothers discriminate between offspring and unrelated young, whether they use direct or indirect recognition cues, and whether prior parental investment plays a contextual role in the differential treatment of young. Mother frogs utilized tadpole-rearing cups attached to tree trunks in wet tropical forest. After manipulating the identity, location and/or age of tadpoles in cups, I determined whether maternal provisioning behaviour was maintained by measuring tadpole growth and development. Mothers provisioned young regardless of tadpole identity, but were sensitive to location and did not provision tadpoles that were moved 2 cm to an adjacent cup. When given a choice between related and unrelated tadpoles in originally chosen or adjacent cups, mothers discriminated by location, but not by relatedness. Maternal provisioning behaviour persisted when a tadpole provisioned for 10 days was replaced with either an age-matched or newly hatched unrelated tadpole, so direct offspring recognition does not appear to be dependent on prior parental investment. Together, these results provide strong evidence that mother O. pumilio use indirect recognition cues to discriminate between offspring and unrelated offspring.

AB North American red squirrels are a small-bodied, solitary territorial species that faces a diversity of predators. One report suggested that red squirrels produce two distinct vocalizations to aerial and ground predators: a tonal 'seet' and a broadband 'bark', respectively. This categorical mapping between alarm call variants and predator classes suggested that red squirrels might manifest a system of predatorspecific, referential alarm calls. To test this hypothesis, we undertook a multi-year study of red squirrels in southern Alberta, Canada. We report details of alarm call production by red squirrels during natural predator encounters, in response to a series of predator simulation experiments, and during encounters with nonpredatory species, including conspecific territorial intruders. The pattern of alarm call production was consistent across these conditions and involved two main call types, the tonal seet call and a more broadband 'seet-bark' call, which corresponded closely to the bark call identified previously. However, there was little evidence that call production was specific to particular predator classes. Instead, the two call types were produced together in mixed bouts to predators of all types as well as to nonpredatory species and conspecific intruders. These outcomes contradict the hypothesis that alarm calls in red squirrels are referentially specific. We suggest instead that calls might be directed primarily at the intruders themselves and function to announce their detection and possibly aid in deterring or repelling them. This possibility is consistent with a variety of other important features of the behaviour and life history of red squirrels. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In primates, authors have reported the specific organization of individuals during collective movements. Some authors have suggested that intentional mechanisms underlie this particular organization because primates have high cognitive abilities that can allow them to use this kind of behaviour. However, mechanisms underlying the emergence of complex systems are not necessarily complex and can be based on local rules. We investigated the joining processes observed during collective movements in one semifree-ranging group of Tonkean macaques, using an individualized agent-based model. The complex patterns observed, such as departure latencies, associations and order of individuals at departure of a collective movement, could be explained using a rule based on affiliative relationships. The decision an individual took to join the movement depended on the departure of its strongly affiliated individuals. Thus even in primates, complex collective behaviour may emerge from interactions between individuals following local behavioural rules. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Alarm calling is a widespread antipredator behaviour. Although the function and evolution of alarm call behaviour have long been studied in detail, only in the last decade has there been an upsurge in research into its development. Here, we review the literature on the development of alarm call production (the delivery of calls with a specific set of acoustic features), alarm call usage (the use of calls in particular contexts) and alarm call responses (the responses to calls produced by others). We detail the mechanistic processes that may underlie the development of each aspect, consider the selection pressures most likely to explain the relative importance of these processes, and discuss the substantial variation in developmental rates found both between and within species. Throughout, we interpret existing findings about age-related differences in alarm call behaviour from two major communicatory viewpoints: the idea that signals carry information from sender to receiver, with young taking time to acquire adult-like skills; and the possibility that signals are used to manage the behaviour of receivers, with young behaving adaptively for their age. We conclude that a broader use of various techniques (e. g. cross-fostering and temporary removals), the formation of stronger collaborative links with other disciplines (e. g. physiology and neurobiology) and the initiation of new research avenues (e. g. kleptoparasitism) will ensure that studies on the development of alarm call behaviour continue to enhance our understanding of such topics as the evolution of communication and language, kin selection and cognitive processing.

AB When the potential contributions that offspring can make to parental fitness vary, parents benefit by diverting resources towards the offspring offering the highest return on investment. In birds, nestling begging has been hypothesized to allow parental assessment of the relative contribution that each offspring can make to parental fitness. Although begging is often interpreted as a signal of need, studies of nestling morphology, specifically carotenoid-based mouth colours, suggest that these traits signal not the need, but the quality of the nestlings. Here, I manipulated flange colour in a free-living population of house sparrows with experimental paints that did not feature a UV reflectance peak, but otherwise approximated carotenoid-based colours within the range of natural variation. I presented parents with one nestling that appeared to have the carotenoid-rich rictal flanges associated with high condition and one that appeared to have the carotenoid-poor flange colour associated with poor condition. Parents delivered more food items to the nestling that appeared to have carotenoid-rich flanges, a pattern driven by a strong female bias and a similar, but nonsignificant, trend in males. This study shows that parents attend to these visual signals rather than correlated features of nestling physiology associated with carotenoids. Broadly, this result suggests that at least some components of begging are used by parents to bias resource allocation towards their most promising, rather than most needy, offspring.

AB Food begging is common in nutritionally dependent young of many animals, but structurally homologous calls recur in adult signal repertoires of many species. We propose eight functional hypotheses for begging in adults; these stem from observations in birds but apply broadly to other taxa in which begging occurs. Adult cooperatively breeding white-throated magpie-jays, Calocitta formosa, use loud begging vocalizations, particularly near the nest site during reproduction. We analysed the social context and behavioural phenology of loud calling and allofeeding in this species and compared these with predictions from each functional hypothesis. We found that reproductive females were the primary producers of beg calls, and their begging peaked during the fertile period when reproductive conflict among males and females was highest. Loud begging rates correlated positively with provisioning rates, but females called more in the pre-incubation fertile period than they did after they had initiated incubation. Based on the context, phenology and active space of the signal, we conclude that female loud begging vocalizations function to signal nutritional need to group members, but also have been evolutionarily co-opted to advertise fertility to potential extrapair partners. The location of calling is probably a consequence of nest guarding by breeding females to prevent intraspecific brood parasitism. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated community structure and association patterns for a small population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, inhabiting the Port Stephens embayment in southeastern Australia. Association data for 120 regularly sighted individuals were obtained from seasonal photo-identification surveys collected over 7 years (1998-2007). Using a combined cluster and social network analysis approach, we found association patterns between dolphins were hierarchically structured, where two mixed-sex communities were subdivided into smaller, temporarily dynamic social groups. Community membership corresponded to differences in individual ranging patterns and habitat occupation. The larger eastern community inhabits a typically marine environment, while individuals of the western community range over a larger area that is dominated by estuarine processes. Both communities were composed of long-term preferred companions; however, the degree of social cohesion differed considerably between the two communities. Associations between individuals were considerably stronger and temporally more stable in the western community. Western individuals also had significantly fewer preferred associates despite living in similar-sized schools. Finally, in direct contrast to associations within each community, intercommunity associations were highly variable and resulted primarily from aggregative behaviour. We propose the segregation of communities resulted from individual adaptation to local environmental conditions, facilitated by individual variability in association preferences. The disparity in association patterns between communities may have resulted from a combination of ecological, population density, kinship and anthropogenic factors.

AB Predators that feed on clustered prey tend to have an 'area-restricted search' (ARS), characterized by a combination of a slow and tortuous movement in prey-rich areas, and a fast and straight movement in poorer areas. Waders that forage in intertidal areas usually prey upon buried macroinvertebrates, whose distribution is often clustered. However, wader species differ in the strategy used to find their prey: some rely mainly on visual cues, some rely on tactile cues, and others follow a more generalist method, simply sweeping the sediment surface with the bill. We hypothesized that these strategies influence the adoption of an ARS by waders. We analysed this hypothesis by comparing the fine-scale movement of a 'tactile' predator (black-tailed godwit, Limosa limosa), with that of a 'visual' predator (redshank, Tringa totanus) and a 'sweeper' (avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta). We filmed 190 individuals of the three species and, using GIS facilities, obtained more than 12 000 spatial positions, along with detailed records of feeding activity. We analysed several parameters of fine-scale movement of waders, such as foraging and searching speeds, tortuosity, and the relationship between these parameters and foraging success. Only the tactile predator, the black-tailed godwit, followed an ARS, reducing searching speed and increasing spatial turning rate whenever the prey intake was higher. Furthermore, its foraging strategy involved short-term adjustments of movement that maximized the likelihood of finding subsequent prey, suggesting a prior knowledge or an ability to perceive rapidly the distribution pattern of its prey.

AB Results of three previous experiments conducted in our laboratory (Galef & Whiskin 2006, Animal Behaviour, 72, 1169-1176) failed to provide support for the prediction from formal theory that increasing the potential cost of engaging in individual learning increases reliance on socially acquired information. However, weaknesses in the data of each of the three experiment reported in Galef & Whiskin (2006) complicated interpretation of results. Here, we repeated the three experiments using procedures that we modified to improve the quality of the data. Despite success in removing the problems with Galef & Whiskin's (2006) methods, we again found no evidence that exposure to either direct or indirect cues of predation risk increased Norway rats', Rattus norvegicus, reliance on socially acquired information. We discuss implications of our repeated failures to confirm a logically consistent prediction from formal theory. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Studies of ape tool use have been conducted in captivity since the early 1900s and in the wild since the 1960s. Chimpanzees are the most prolific tool users among the apes, and are known to use more tools than any other nonhuman animal. In contrast, reports of gorilla tool use are rare both in wild and captive settings. Studies of the processes involved in tool use learning have been limited in the wild by the lack of ability to control several unpredictable variables, and in captivity by tool use opportunities that are often presented in non-naturalistic contexts. We attempted to address both of these limitations by providing naive subjects with a naturalistic tool use device (built to simulate a termite mound) while housed in a more natural social setting to approximate how learning would occur in the wild. Both gorillas and chimpanzees participated in the experiment to allow comparative analyses of acquisition of tool behaviour and the factors that may affect acquisition. Both species showed low frequencies of interaction with the mound in the baseline condition, before baiting with a food reward. Once baited, chimpanzees both attempted and succeeded to extract the reward more quickly than did gorillas. The number of social group members at the mound was significantly higher for chimpanzees than for gorillas and may have affected skill acquisition. We advocate that comparative approaches to skill acquisition and learning are valuable, but that researchers need to be cognizant of species differences in social structure that may affect results.

AB We examined demographic and behavioural influences on the dispersal decisions of 31 male mountain gorillas living in mixed-sex groups. Approximately half (45%) of silverback males dispersed from the groups in which they matured. Mean dispersal age corresponded with the age of physical maturity. For two-thirds (64%) of males, dispersal was a one time decision. The remaining individuals made repeated visits to their natal groups before permanently dispersing. Of dispersing males, 43% left with females. The remaining individuals dispersed alone, despite the presence of similar-aged male dispersal partners in their group. Dispersal decisions appeared voluntary; there was no evidence of increased aggression by the dominant silverback or peripheralization in the months prior to dispersal. Instead, dispersal decisions were influenced by limited opportunities to copulate within the group and the absence of a male's mother. Dispersing did not provide increased access to females, at least in the short term; only three dispersing males were observed to form groups whereas the remaining eight for whom data were available remained solitary (range 1-112 months) at the end of the study. The question remains why males choose to disperse rather than remain philopatric. Inbreeding avoidance seems unlikely, as all groups contained unrelated females. It may be that dispersal decisions are the result of several factors acting in combination, and thus dispersal is a more appropriate option for some males. Alternatively, dispersal decisions may actually be disadvantageous and reflect an incomplete adaptation to the ecological extremes of the Virunga region.

TI Effects of domestication on food deprivation-induced behaviour in red

AB Domestication and selection for high production have selected animals with less energy-demanding behaviour. In the natural environment of the ancestors, fitness (reproductive success) is often favoured by an ability to locate and remember food sites, whereas in captivity, fitness may be more related to the ability to grow and reproduce efficiently under stable food conditions. We hypothesized that domestication and selection for production traits have caused animals to react less actively to food shortage. In this experiment, 26 red junglefowl (RJF) and 27 White Leghorn layers (WL), the latter selected for high egg production, were exposed to 0, 3 and 24 h of food deprivation while housed in furnished cages. After food deprivation, we quantified the bird's behaviour, in a series of tests. Birds of both breeds performed more foraging-exploring, less preening behaviour and less perching with increasing length of food deprivation. However, when tested in a group, RJF showed a more active response than WL to food shortage by reducing perching time and increasing the foraging and exploration time on the ground, which may be interpreted as a more risk-prone behaviour. Furthermore, when tested individually, there was a breed effect on response in the open field and the novel object tests, where RJF were more cautious than WL. The results may reflect different feeding strategies: the behaviour of RJF would probably be more adaptive in a natural environment, while the behaviour shown by WL may allow more investment in production traits in a more predictable environment.

AB The size of a male's reproductive investment may have profound consequences for female mating frequency and male fitness. Male ejaculate size may affect female fecundity and fertility, while large ejaculates may confer an advantage for males in both avoiding and engaging in sperm competition. We explored experimentally the effect of male ejaculate size on female receptivity and male fertilization success, in the largely monandrous almond moth. Females received either a large or small first spermatophore, and were then given the opportunity to remate with another male that also provided a large or small ejaculate. We examined the effect of spermatophore size on female postmating receptivity, likelihood of remating and reproductive output. For males, we examined the effect that spermatophore size and mating order had on subsequent paternity success. Females that received a small first ejaculate were both more likely to remate (with mated males) and remated sooner than females that received a large first ejaculate. Furthermore, females that remated were also more likely to commence calling behaviour following their first mating, but there were no effects of spermatophore size on female reproductive output. For a male, however, if his female remated, the size of the spermatophore he transferred had important fitness consequences. Second-mating males suffered a paternity cost when competing against a rival that provided a large spermatophore. We propose that the enlarged spermatophore transferred by virgin males explains the low remating rate in this species, and may suggest a more polyandrous past for the almond moth, potentially shaped by sexual conflict.

AB Many animals repeat standardized displays multiple times while attracting a mate or deterring a rival. In such contexts the ability to perform each display or signal type in a consistent fashion may be under direct selection. Studies on sexual selection on song learning in birds have focused on differences in repertoire size with less attention paid to the potential importance of being able to perform each song/syllable type with high consistency. We investigated whether syllable type consistency is related to age, social dominance and reproductive success in tropical mockingbirds, Mimus gilvus. The variation between renditions of each syllable type decreased as the birds grew older (i.e. they became more consistent). In addition, more consistent males tended to have higher dominance status and reproductive success. These findings stress the importance of consistency in the performance of sexual displays and suggest that this parameter may be very relevant even in species that are selected for high vocal diversity (i.e. large repertoires). We hypothesize that, in addition to signalling dominance status and age, syllable type consistency may also indicate the integrity of brain function in birds analogous to the tests used for neuropsychological assessment in humans.

AB Crickets have traditional sex roles, where males compete aggressively for access to selective polyandrous females. However, in a laboratory experiment, we found that normally nonaggressive female Gryllus campestris fought each other vigorously in the presence of a courting male, resulting in a dominant female that gained a greater probability of receiving the spermatophore. Female-female fights included the same series of characteristic actions known from male-male fights, which demonstrates that the females can perform the full repertoire of agonistic actions except for the production of the aggressive rival song. Since females remained nonaggressive towards each other in the vicinity of a muted male, but were induced to fight each other in the complete absence of a male by the auditory experience of the courtship song, this song is both sufficient and necessary to induce female competition for males. Calling song was as effective as courtship song at inducing female aggression, whereas rival song was least effective. We therefore speculate that the calling and courtship songs may signal a male's resource value. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many herbivores and omnivores can balance their intake of macronutrients when faced with nutritionally variable environments. Carnivores, however, are widely believed to optimize their rates of prey capture and energy intake rather than balancing nutrients. We tested nutrient balancing in captive mink and found a pronounced ability to balance and regulate intake of protein and lipid. When faced with one of several different pairings of complementary foods varying in protein to lipid composition, mink apportioned intake between the two foods to defend a near constant ratio and amount (intake target) of the two macronutrients. When given only one food of fixed nutrient composition, mink balanced macronutrient intake relative to the intake target, without showing the excessive energy intake on diets with a low percentage of protein and energy deficit on diets with a high percentage of protein previously reported for herbivores and omnivores, including humans. This demonstration of nutrient balancing in a carnivorous mammal indicates that the capacity for nutrient balancing is a more general phenomenon across trophic levels than was hitherto believed to be the case.

AB The evolution of movement-based signals is constrained by the successful segmentation of relevant movements from motion noise by the visual system of receivers. We tested five Jacky dragons, Amphibolurus muricatus, a species characterized by stereotyped movement-based social signals, for their ability to discriminate the direction of drifting dots against simulated background motion noise of varying angular speeds. Results from trials with artificial (dot) backgrounds suggested that Jacky dragons are most sensitive to high-speed movement, while background movement of similar angular speeds to target stimuli reduced performance. We also found differences in accuracy between natural backgrounds comprising footage of plant motion at two independent sites. We argue that detecting salient movement depends on the particular characteristics of the surrounding motion noise, and discuss its implications for movement-based signal design.

AB Group size is a core trait de. ning social systems, social complexity and social structure, so understanding group-size evolution is critical to understanding the evolution of sociality. Traditional views of group-size evolution focus on ecological factors such as predation risk and physical resources, but the additional factor of time has remained largely unexplored. Time is a valuable limited resource for all animals, and its partitioning both is influenced by sociality and may constrain sociality. Time allocation may in fact be an important mechanism through which predation risk, resource needs and other factors influence the evolution of group size. Classic group-size and time-use hypotheses make no consistent evolutionary predictions, so comparative analyses are necessary to determine which of the predicted processes are active on broad evolutionary scales. To evaluate these predictions, we conducted a comparative study using 50 species of diurnal primates as a model taxon for cohesive group-living animals. The evolution of group size was correlated with time spent resting, even after controlling for life-history variables such as body mass and diet type. We suggest that constraints on time allocation should be better integrated into models of the causes and consequences of sociality and that these constraints may have implications for conservation.

AB The grey treefrog species complex (Hyla chrysoscelis and H. versicolor) comprises a single allotetraploid species (H. versicolor) that arose multiple times from hybrid matings between an extant diploid species (H. chrysoscelis) and at least two other extinct diploid treefrogs. While previous studies have investigated female preferences for call duration in the tetraploid, we know little about these preferences in its putative diploid ancestors. Here, I report results from two-choice phonotaxis experiments investigating call duration preferences in H. chrysoscelis. Females preferred an average-length call over shorter-than-average calls (0.5-2.0 standard deviations below average), and they preferred longer-than-average calls over average or shorter-than-average calls when the difference in pulse number was at least 2.0 SD. When the amplitude of the longer alternative was attenuated by 6 dB, females still preferred an average-length call over a shorter-than-average call, but there was no preference for longer-than-average calls over an average call. In the presence of chorus noise, female preferences for both average and longer-than-average calls over shorter alternatives were weakened or reversed. Together, the results from this study reveal patterns of female preferences for call duration that are strikingly similar among two members of a species complex with a novel evolutionary history. In both species, female preferences are directional, nonlinear, and limited by environmental noise. Furthermore, these results also highlight the need for caution in studies of sexual selection when extrapolating from patterns of female preference obtained under ideal laboratory conditions to conclusions about how those preferences are expressed in the real world.

AB Animals differ in their behaviour comparable to how humans differ in personality: individuals consistently differ in suites of correlated traits. Relationships between 'personality traits' and fitness imply that personality traits can evolve by means of natural selection. We studied whether animal personality is also involved in sexual selection. We investigated whether exploratory behaviour (an aspect of animal personality, ranging from 'slow' to 'fast') correlated with the occurrence of extrapair paternity (EPP) in broods of wild great tits. We expected that EPP rates should be highest for females mated with social partners of the same personality type (i. e. for slowe-slow or fast-fast pairs, but not other pair combinations). We found that the likelihood of EPP was highest for these pairs. Disassortative extrapair mating with respect to personality can be the consequence of several non-mutually exclusive processes. It might be caused by adaptive mate choice, which allows assortatively paired females to produce offspring with either more variable or more intermediate phenotypes, but it could also be the consequence of behavioural incompatibility between extreme behavioural phenotypes. Our findings indicate that personality differences play a role in the mechanism behind extrapair behaviours and we therefore conclude that it is now plausible that partner preference is based not only on morphological characteristics, but also on consistent behavioural traits or personality.

AB Nest choice in the ant Temnothorax albipennis is a model system for investigating collective decision making. Previous research has demonstrated the sophistication of this decentralized system, yet such studies have focused on binary choices in which alternative nest sites are equidistant from the colony's original nest. In nature, for example, a poor nest might be closer than a better one. Hence, to investigate the collective decision-making system of these ants further, we challenged colonies with a choice between a distant high-quality nest and a much closer and collinear poorer one. Colonies successfully emigrated to the better nest when it was two, three or even nine times further away than the collinear poorer one. Most often, colonies started emigrating simultaneously to both nests, and then they redirected all traffic exclusively to the better, more distant one. We show that this is a good strategy for minimizing exposure and risk. In principle these ants might compensate for distance effects by increasing recruitment latencies and quorum thresholds at nearby poor nests so that they are better able to find and use distant better ones. However, the simplest explanation is that scouts are more likely to begin to look elsewhere, at all stages of the decision-making and emigration process, whenever and wherever they have initially found a low-quality nest.

AB Recent evidence suggests that the quality ( i. e. nutritional content) of food can have important effects on life history and behaviour. Yet few studies have considered the role of food quality for mating. We tested the effects of diet quality of prey fed to males and females on mating behaviours, sexual cannibalism and egg production in the wolf spider, Pardosa milvina. Diet quality was manipulated through supplementation of the substrate on which Drosophila melanogaster were reared on and prey quantity was held constant. There was no effect of diet quality on the occurrence of mating or the timing of copulatory behaviours. Contrary to our predictions, females on the high-quality diet engaged in more attacks on males before and after mating and were more likely to cannibalize males following mating. Hence, females do not compensate for low-quality diets by increasing attack rates or cannibalism on males. Rather, females on the high-quality diet appear to be more voracious predators, consistent with results of some foraging studies. Egg production of females that matured and mated in the laboratory was not affected by diet quality. However,field- caught adult females produced eggsacs more quickly when reared on the high-quality diet. Our results suggest that the quality of prey can limit the latency to female egg production. These results highlight the need for more research on the role of food quality for mating interactions and the mechanisms responsible for more voracious feeding by females on high-quality diets.

AB In many gregarious species, social interactions among group members have such a potent influence on the physiology and/or the behaviour of individuals that isolation has dramatic consequences for their development and survival. Although 'group effects' have been described in many insect species, the mechanisms involved in these processes remain poorly documented. Our aim was to shed light on group effects in cockroaches by investigating the nature of the social stimuli triggering differences in developmental rates between grouped and isolated individuals. Group effects were absent in nonaggregating species (Blattella lituricollis, Blattella biligata), but present in species that form social aggregations (Blattella germanica, Symploce pallens). The presence of conspecifics increased rates of both nymphal development and oothecae production in B. germanica. Tactile stimuli were sufficient to trigger developmental group effects in this gregarious cockroach. Blattella germanica nymphs reared with tactile stimuli, either from a rotating feather or from insects of other species, grew faster than isolated nymphs. Although the role of tactile stimuli has been understudied, they could be involved in group effects in many insect species. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The goal of 'life skills training' is to improve survival of captive-reared animals after release to the wild. Our study tested the hypothesis that learned predator recognition in hatchery-reared fish is favoured at ecologically appropriate periods during ontogeny. We began by asking whether the innate response of Atlantic salmon to predator odour (from high- and low-risk predators) declines during hatchery rearing. Next, we used classical conditioning to assess the capacity of fish in different age groups to learn to recognize predator odour. The first experiment showed that innate predator recognition is retained by fish for at least 8 months in a hatchery environment. However, the response of 10- to 15-week-old salmon to predator odour was significantly greater than that of younger (3-week-old) or older (28- to 36-week-old). fish. This is consistent with a period of heightened receptivity to predator odour cues. The second experiment provided evidence for age-dependent learning because salmon aged 16-20 weeks showed learned predator recognition abilities, whereas 3-week-old fish relied on innate responses. The onset of learning occurred at the age when wild fish undergo a habitat shift that greatly increases their encounters with predators. Future attempts to improve predator recognition skills of fish should take greater account of life history and focus on the ontogenetic stage where learning is favoured.

AB Plasticity of response to sexual signals is predicted to occur in long-lived animals that have periods of reproductive inactivity. Response should be adaptive to avoid wasted energy mate searching when conditions are unfavourable. Here we test that male response to female-produced sex pheromone in a long-lived moth species, Caloptilia fraxinella, is plastic and depends on male physiological state. Electrophysiological and behavioural studies indicated that the sex pheromone is composed of two compounds: (Z)-11-hexadecenal and (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol. Experiments were conducted to examine how males that differed in physiological state responded to signals of varying quality and quantity produced by manipulating synthetic pheromone blends. Reproductively active males had a lower pheromone response threshold and showed an upper threshold compared to males in reproductive diapause, which responded only to high pheromone doses with no upper threshold. The nature of pheromone response also varied depending on the male's physiological state. Reproductively active males showed a more narrowly tuned response than males in diapause. However, reproductively active males did not discriminate among pheromones with (Z)-11-hexadecenal and 1-50% of (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol. Males in diapause were not attracted to pheromone composed of (Z)-11-hexadecenal and 1% (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol, showing reduced signal perception in moths in diapause. Taken together, these results indicate that male C. fraxinella pheromone response is plastic with respect to threshold and specificity and depends on physiological state of the responder.

AB Polygynous mating systems are classified according to the means that males use to control access to females. When resources critical for female reproduction are unevenly distributed or spatially clumped, monopolization of these resources may give males access to multiple females, leading to a resource defence polygynous mating system. Panorpa scorpionflies are frequently cited as an example of resource defence polygyny (RDP). Studies on American species have indicated that males monopolize food resources of different size according to their own body size, leading to differential mating success for males obtaining resources of different quality. Previous studies on European scorpionfly mating systems, however, cast some doubt on the existence of RDP. Using the same experimental approach as in the earlier studies on American Panorpa, we examined two European scorpionfly species (Panorpa alpina and P. vulgaris) to determine whether their mating systems can be characterized as RDP. Our results confirmed that scorpionflies are polygynous, but also showed that polygyny is not based on the monopolization of resources. Thus, we do not think that Panorpa scorpionflies can universally be characterized as resource defence polygynous. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Interference competition among foraging animals arises from agonistic interactions among foragers. Interactions can concern single food items but also clumps of food. Food clumps consist of multiple food items, and are therefore easier to divide among foragers than food items. Theoretical studies indicate that differences in divisibility can be essential to the interference process. Empirically, however, little is known about effects of resource divisibility on interference competition. Therefore, we performed an experiment with captive ruddy turnstones. Turnstones foraged either alone or together with a competitor. We offered food at two so-called food pits and varied the divisibility of food in these pits by burying a fixed number of food items either in several layers (divisible) or in a single layer (indivisible). Additionally, we varied the distance between food pits. We accounted for differences in the social dominance status of foragers by using pairs of foragers as our experimental unit: each pair had both a dominant and a subordinate member. We found a strong asymmetry in the intake of birds of different dominance status. The strength of this asymmetry depended on both the divisibility of food and on the distance between food pits. Only when food was divisible did subordinate foragers get a share of the food; only when food pits were close to each other could dominant foragers monopolize food pits. These findings imply that to understand and predict interference competition we need to consider both the detailed characteristics of resources, and the determinants of dominance status.

AB Studies of interference competition among foraging animals generally assume that variation in the spatial distribution of food can be neglected. This assumption may be problematic as resource defence experiments suggest that such variation is of the essence in some interference mechanisms. Interpretation of the results of field experiments on this topic, however, is hard because most studies used univariate statistics to analyse multivariate data. Because in free-living foragers interference and patch selection are connected behaviours, treatment effects on these responses are best studied simultaneously, through multivariate analyses. We performed a field experiment in which we provided wild ruddy turnstones, Arenaria interpres, with experimental plots that varied in the distance between a fixed number of so-called food pits, and, using multivariate statistics, we studied effects on the combination of the turnstones' behaviour and abundance. We found that when food pits were more spaced out, turnstones were present in higher numbers, while interacting less with each other. Nevertheless, turnstones spent about the same amount of time digging for food, our measure of intake rate, at each interpit distance. These findings imply that to reliably predict the combination of the number, intake rate and aggression of turnstones, the spatial distribution of food has to be known. We would not have reached this conclusion if we had used univariate statistics. In addition, we argue that multivariate statistics helps to clarify the way field experiments on the spatial distribution of food are to be interpreted.

AB The study of contrast investigates how rewards influence behaviour when animals are exposed to two or more levels of rewards compared to when they experience only a single level. The appearance of an exaggerated response to a shift in reward is referred to as a contrast effect and is an empirically well- established phenomenon. Although contrast effects could be important in foraging behaviour, no direct experimental tests of contrast effects in foraging by mammalian herbivores exist. During foraging, mammalian herbivores can encounter a range of plants that vary in the amount of nutrients and toxins. They may thus compare food items by taste, which in turn can give rise to contrast effects. In feeding experiments with fallow deer, Dama dama, we investigated the presence of simultaneous negative contrast. We found that the deer consumed less from a bowl of pellets containing 1% tannin when they shifted to it from a bowl with pellets containing only 0.25% tannin than when they shifted from another bowl with pellets containing 1% tannin. We estimated a fourfold difference between treatments in test food consumption at the highest levels of preloading, but none at the lowest levels. We found no support for successive negative contrast in experiments where the deer approached food in a runway, comparing a current reward with the memory of a previous reward. We suggest that simultaneous negative contrast can influence foraging decisions in mammalian herbivores. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Familiarity within groups of animals is thought to consolidate social dominance hierarchies and reduce the frequency of contests over prey. For many species in nature, however, group composition is affected by dynamic fission-fusion events, and it is likely that not all individuals within a group will be familiar with each other at any given time. This means that the advantages of associating with familiar conspecifics may not be available to all individuals within a group. We investigated this effect by constructing shoals of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, that contained two familiar fish and four further individuals that were unfamiliar both to each other and to the familiar pair. We observed that, per capita, familiar pair members engaged in fewer kleptoparasitic prey contests with each other than they did with unfamiliar members and than unfamiliar members did with each other. We saw no differences in the mean proportion of prey consumed by familiar and unfamiliar individuals, nor any differences in tendency to initiate contests over prey. Our findings suggest that there are indirect benefits to be gained from foraging with familiar individuals and we discuss them in the context of adaptive trade-offs and social network theory.

AB Many animals appear to monitor changes in other individuals' dominance ranks and social relationships and to track changes in them. However, it is not known whether they also track changes in very transient relationships. Rapid recognition of a temporary separation between a dominant male and a sexually receptive female, for example, should be adaptive in species where subordinate males use opportunistic strategies to achieve mating success. Dominant male baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) form sexual consortships with oestrous females that are characterized by mate guarding and close proximity. To assess whether subordinate males track temporary changes in the status of other males' consortships, we conducted playback experiments using a two-speaker paradigm. In the test condition, subjects heard the consort male's grunts played from one speaker and his consort female's copulation call played from a speaker approximately 40 m away. This sequence suggested that the male and female had temporarily separated and that the female was mating with another male. In a control trial, subjects heard another dominant male's grunts played from one speaker and the female's copulation call played from the other. In a second control trial, conducted within 24 h after the consortship had ended, subjects again heard the consort male's grunt and the female's copulation call played from separate speakers. As predicted, subjects responded strongly only in the test condition. Eavesdropping upon the temporal and spatial juxtaposition of other individuals' vocalizations may be one strategy by which male baboons achieve sneaky matings.

AB Empirical studies on the group-size effect (a reduction in time allocated to vigilance with an increase in group size that releases more time for foraging) have generally assumed that the influence of companions is the same irrespective of nearest-neighbour distance. However, social information transmission has been found to be affected by neighbour distance. Our goal was to assess the role of both group size and neighbour distance in explaining foraging and scanning behaviour in flocks of brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. We conducted a seminatural experiment in which we simultaneously manipulated group size (3, 5, 7 individuals) and minimum neighbour distance (0, 2.5, 5 m) of birds in visual but not physical contact. Foraging and vigilance were affected by both flock size and neighbour distance in different ways. Flock size generally influenced foraging and scanning behaviour, with an initial increase/decrease and then a levelling off at higher flock sizes. Neighbour distance also affected individual behaviour in a nonlinear fashion, but we also found patterns for pecking rate and proportion of time scanning that suggest linear changes. We found that the strength of the group-size effect varied with neighbour distance and was weakest when the birds were furthest away from each other. Future studies should consider as members of a group only those individuals within a radius that allows detection and dilution effects to operate.

AB I explore antipredator vigilance in a spatially explicit group. In a spatially explicit group, foragers with high vigilance can shift the burden of predation to their less vigilant companions if they escape first and the predator selects laggards preferentially. I refer to this as the pass-along effect on vigilance. In a series of models, I examine changes in ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy) levels of vigilance as a function of initial distance between foragers. In a group with peripheral foragers, vigilance first decreases and then increases with decreases in the initial distance between foragers. The decrease in vigilance arises because the foragers occur further away from the predator and have a greater head start when escaping. However, as foragers occur closer to each other, the risk of being overtaken by companions increases and favours higher vigilance. This increase in vigilance with group density also occurs for centrally located foragers that are not exposed directly to attack but which can be overtaken by peripheral companions. When all foragers in a group are alerted instantaneously by the escape of companions, the relative position of prey in the group cannot change, impeding the pass-along effect. The pass-along effect on vigilance is thus expected to be more prevalent in groups with less efficient collective detection of predation threats.

AB Four sea lions were assessed for their ability to master a reverse-reward contingency task. The subjects were presented with two stimulus arrays of one and five fish and received the array they did not choose. Three subjects spontaneously learned to choose the smaller of two food quantities to obtain the larger one, although their initial choices were for the latter. The fourth subject learned to select the smaller quantity after the introduction of a large-or-none contingency. When confronted with new combinations of quantity, the subjects almost always selected the smaller quantity, showing that they were able to generalize the rule. The results suggest that sea lions appear to perform better than primates tested under the same conditions. Performance in reverse-reward tasks is probably related to food-searching strategies in natural habitats. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The jumping spider Portia labiata can complete detours in which it must move away from a goal (i.e. prey) before approaching it. This detouring behaviour can be divided into two phases: a scanning phase, during which Portia stays roughly in one spot and examines its environment using its principal eyes, and a locomotory phase, during which Portia performs the detour. Earlier experiments showed that when Portia is initially confined to a small, elevated platform from which it has an unobstructed view of the goal, it plans the initial stage of its detour by scanning the possible route and picking out an unbroken path from start to goal and then aiming at an initial objective along the detour. In the present experiments, I examined the detouring behaviour of P. labiata in an open arena where obstacles provided either indirect access or no access to the goal. Although scanning movements and detour decisions of spiders were similar to those of spiders initially confined to an elevated platform, spiders in the open arena not only scanned at the start but also along the route of the detour. Decision making thus occurred gradually, during both the scanning and the locomotory phases. Taken together, these results and those of previous studies suggest that detouring behaviour in Portia involves a form of vicarious trial and error in which the spider inspects possible routes and selects a series of intermediate goals during both the scanning and locomotory phases of a detour.

AB Female behaviour during copulation that could function as communication with the male is probably more common than previously appreciated, but its functional significance remains little studied. Stridulation during copulation by the female of the spider Physocylus globosus (Taczanowski, 1873), documented here for the first time, is common and noncoercive, thus permitting simple tests regarding its possible function. Males squeezed females rhythmically with their enlarged, powerful genitalia throughout copulation, and more male genitalic squeezes were associated with increased paternity when females mated with two males. Contextual associations suggest that female stridulation represents attempts to induce the male to interrupt genitalic squeezes: female stridulation was more common when the male was squeezing her; females were more likely to stridulate when individual male squeezes were longer, and when the male had not responded to a previous stridulation by loosening a squeeze; females were more likely to refrain from stridulating when the male loosened a squeeze; males were more likely to loosen squeezes when the female stridulated; and female stridulation was associated with rejection of males in other contexts. Males that responded to female stridulation more consistently by loosening their squeezes obtained greater paternity. Possible female communicatory behaviour during copulation is known in other species. Future attention to female as well as to male behaviour, and to possible dialogues during copulation, promises to be valuable in understanding sexual interactions.

AB Sexual segregation occurs widely in ungulates, and four principal hypotheses (predation, forage quality, social preferences and activity patterning) have been suggested as possible explanations. However, no single explanation has so far received widespread support. We used data on the grouping behaviour of feral goats, Capra hircus, on the Isle of Rum, Scotland, U.K. to test between competing hypotheses. We first used Conradt's (1999, Animal Behaviour, 57, 1151-1157) test to show that sexual segregation is not a consequence of sex differences in habitat preference. Since the predation risk hypothesis can be ruled out by both the absence of important predators on Rum and the tendency for those individuals most sensitive to predation (mother-offspring pairs) to be the furthest away from their neighbours, any explanation for sexual segregation must either lie in differences in activity patterning or be the consequence of a social preference for associating with same-sex individuals. We analysed data on the patterns of fission, behavioural synchrony and neighbourhood in relation to party size and composition to show that the activity budget hypothesis is the more likely. However, the data also suggest that the social preferences hypothesis none the less has a residual influence on segregation tendencies of the Rum goats. We conclude that one likely reason for the conflicting results in the literature may be that all four hypotheses in fact apply simultaneously, but that their relative weightings may depend on habitat- and species-specific characteristics.

AB Although most (> 90%) species of birds have biparental care, little is known about the consequences of such care for offspring behaviour and fitness-related traits. We examined the effect of biparental care on chick growth and begging behaviour in zebra finches, by comparing biparental broods with uniparental broods in which the male parent was removed and the brood size halved to control for potential parental workload. Differences in patterns of growth and begging behaviour between treatments therefore resulted from the difference in (1) the number of parents providing care and/or (2) the number of chicks per brood. Collaborating parents did not appear to act in concert and fed chicks independently of each other's feeding bouts. Broods reared by two parents were fed more frequently than those fed by one, and because biparental feeding bouts were less predictably spaced in time with less food available for each chick per feeding bout, competition was greater than in broods reared by single parents. Furthermore, chicks in biparental broods sustained an additional cost of begging: they had to beg almost twice as hard as chicks reared by single parents to receive a given amount of food, and they received less food per chick. Despite these effects, they grew faster. Growth rate may depend not just on the amount of food available but also on the frequency and predictability with which it is delivered, and, in particular, it reflects an adaptive response to competition for the available resources.

AB Animals make economic decisions on where to feed based on balancing intake rates with the risk of starvation, When foraging, they must also manage time allocation to feeding, antipredator behaviour and resource guarding. These behaviours are usually believed to be mutually exclusive. The most intense foraging effort is predicted to occur in low-risk situations, while more antipredator behaviour is seen in high-risk situations. We studied the time allocation of individual light-bellied brent geese, Branta bermicla hrota, and the proportion of the flock engaged in foraging and vigilance behaviour in high- and low-risk habitats. Geese faced with a depleted resource in a low-risk intertidal situation responded by foraging in a higher-risk terrestrial habitat. Individual intake rates and levels of agonistic interactions were higher during terrestrial feeding, but group vigilance was maintained, with certain flock positions showing disproportionate levels of vigilance. In contrast to previous studies, agonistic interactions were more frequent when the geese were feeding on a nonpatchy resource, suggesting that different mechanisms drive agonistic encounters in different habitats. We discuss these results in the context of a growing population with limited resources. By remaining behaviourally plastic, the geese are able to adapt novel trade-off strategies to use alternative prey types. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behavior.

   RECOGNITION; CHICKS; MANIPULATION
AB Vigorous begging is usually seen as an expression of parent-offspring conflict over limited resources. Chicks signal need by begging, but the evolution of honest signals requires the signals to be costly. Although some possible costs have been identified, the cost-inducing mechanisms underlying this widely distributed signalling system remain unclear. Because hormones associated with stress and hunger (corticosterone) and aggressive behaviour (testosterone) have deleterious side-effects, signalling costs may be coupled to the expression of such hormones, if they are closely associated with the signal. We tested whether begging in chicks of thin-billed prions (Aves, Procellariiformes) is associated with secretion of corticosterone and testosterone. Prion chicks honestly signalled their nutritional state. Begging increased with decreased body condition, both within and between chicks. Adults responded to more intense begging by delivering larger meals. Chick testosterone levels were positively correlated with measures of begging intensity and the mean body condition of chicks was correlated positively with testosterone and negatively with corticosterone. In a cross-fostering experiment, the change in testosterone and corticosterone between control and experimental periods was positively correlated with the change in begging intensity. This is the first experimental evidence that the control of chick begging by endogenously produced testosterone and corticosterone may form a mechanism controlling parental provisioning in birds, and that chick behaviour can help to explain the variation in growth patterns between individual birds.

AB Although the relation between behaviour and stress in humans and other vertebrates is well documented, few comparable observations exist for invertebrates. We addressed this issue by considering the impact of the physical environment on cardiac activity in invertebrates exposed to predation and nonpredation threat scenarios. We used cardiac activity as a proxy of stress in juvenile queen scallops, Aequipecten opercularis, under predation threat by the common starfish, Asterias rubens. Stress levels were monitored in juvenile queen scallops exposed, and not exposed, to predation threat on a substratum known to act as a refuge (live maerl) as well as substrata known not to possess refuge potential (dead maerl, sand and no sediment). In the vicinity of known refuges, stationary scallops under predation threat had significantly lower cardiac activity than individuals in habitats lacking refuges. Scallops not under predation threat did not show significant differences in cardiac activity. These are probably habitat-mediated physiological responses to the presence of a predator and possibly to the availability of suitable attachment substrata. These findings have implications in terms of behavioural physiology in invertebrates. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of the role of testosterone (T) in birds have typically focused on sexual or aggressive behaviours of males during the breeding period, but males of nonmigratory species may invest in mate and territory long before breeding, and the influence of T in facilitating nonbreeding-season behaviours is poorly understood. We gave free-living male downy woodpeckers, Picoides pubescens, T-implants during the winter to determine whether elevated levels of T increased a male's ability to exclusively occupy territory-based resources, and whether elevated T strengthened a male's investment in an existing pair bond relationship. We also explored how a female's foraging efficiency might be affected by her mate's behaviour if he had elevated T. We found little difference between control and T-implanted males with regard to home range exclusivity. Surprisingly, male-male display rates were significantly lower in T-implanted males than in controls. Regarding male-female interactions, T-implanted males that experienced high incursion rates from other males maintained more frequent spatial association with their mate, suggesting that T facilitates male behaviours that could restrict the mate's access to other male birds. Female mates of T-males showed reduced foraging rates, but because male-female aggression was similar between treatment groups, the cause for this reduction is unknown. The results indicate that exogenous T during winter affects a variety of behaviours in male woodpeckers, and proximate influences on pair bond maintenance in winter may be a fruitful avenue for future research.

AB Food-caching western scrub-jays cache items themselves, and use observational spatial memory to steal the caches of others. Our aim in this study was to investigate the strategies used by scrub-jays to reduce cache theft by conspecifics. In three experiments, scrub-jays were allowed to cache wax worms in two different locations. In experiment 1, the birds preferred to hide items in distant sites when watched by another jay, but used near and distant sites equally when the observer's view was obscured by a screen. As conspecifics rely on observational spatial memory to steal other jays' caches, this use of distance might reduce the visual information available to the potential thief and thus decrease pilfering accuracy. Where possible, however, placing caches out of sight may be more effective. In experiment 2, storers cached predominantly in distant, out-of-view, sites. However, items placed in view of the observer were moved multiple times, possibly confusing the observer as to their location. In experiment 3, when in-view and out-of-view sites were equidistant to the observer, storers cached mainly in out-of-view sites when observed, but cached equally in both sites when not observed. In all three experiments, some items were cached in nonpreferred sites (near, in view). During recovery sessions, when the storer was not observed, these items were selectively recached in new sites unbeknown to the observer. It may be advantageous not to hide all the caches in one place, because unpredictability might provide the best insurance against pilfering.

AB Traits that influence social interactions (signals) are widely thought to be honest indicators of some underlying quality of their bearer. One hypothesis is that a signal and the bearer's immunocompetence are linked via a condition-dependent pathway. We tested this idea by measuring the effect of specific dietary components on the development of a melanin-based plumage signal and the production of antibodies in juvenile male house sparrows entering their first moult. We maintained sparrows on one of three artificial diets: high total protein, low total protein, or intermediate protein with the precursors of melanin, phenylalanine and tyrosine (PT), reduced by 50%. Diet did not affect survival or weight gain. Two aspects of male plumage differed between treatments; the white wing bar was significantly smaller in low-protein males, and the black bib feathers had significantly higher reflectance in PT-reduced males. PT reductions had no effect on bib size. PT-reduced birds also produced more antibodies to diphtheria and tetanus antigens than did other subjects. After repeating the experiment using a better control and a different diet formula to compensate for an energy imbalance resulting from reduced PT levels, PT reduction again produced lighter bib feathers, but the effect of diet on antibody production disappeared. We conclude that the amino acid precursors to melanin affect melanin synthesis if scarce in the diet, but in this case, do not affect size, the most conspicuously variable aspect of the signal. We found no evidence of a condition-dependent link between melanin synthesis and immunocompetence. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We investigated individual nest site choice behaviour and its fitness consequences in female hawksbills nesting at Trois Ilets, Guadeloupe. We found a significant repeatability of nest site choice, suggesting that this behaviour is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. By looking at possible consequences of nest site choice, we found that hatching success was similar among different beach zones, but the ability of hatchlings to emerge from the nest was impaired in areas subject to tidal inundation. Sea-finding tests showed that hatchlings were more susceptible to disorientation in areas deeper in the forest. Maintaining phenotypic diversity in nest site choice could derive from variation in the environment, where a constantly shifting balance between phenotypes would be promoted by environmental change over time. Alternatively, the different nesting behaviours could be maintained though frequency-dependent selection. Phenotypic sex of sea turtle embryos is determined by the incubation temperature of the nests, and different beach zones have different thermal properties. Females that nest in areas that produce the rarer sex may therefore gain a fitness advantage. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In male baboons, social instability is known to increase concentrations of glucocorticoids (GCs), a class of steroid hormones associated with the vertebrate stress response. The stress response may be particularly marked among male chacma baboons, whose social groups often demonstrate a strong mating skew and high rates of infanticide. Here we test this prediction and explore additional correlates of variation in concentrations of GCs measured in faeces. We collected 482 faecal samples from 13 males over 14 months. Changes in the male hierarchy were the major source of GC variation. Such instability occurred as the result of a new immigrant male's take-over of the alpha position, a resident male's rise to the alpha position, and the rise in rank of a young natal male. All three events were correlated with elevated GCs among all males and higher rates of male-male aggression than were found during periods of stability. The interaction between rank and instability had a significant effect on GC concentrations; low-ranking males had higher GCs during stable periods, whereas high-ranking males had higher GCs during unstable periods. Males that dispersed had elevated GCs in the month following immigration but not at other times, including the month preceding emigration. Finally, entering into a sexual consortship led to a temporary increase in a male's GC measures. By contrast, seasonal changes and a male's age were unrelated to GCs. GC variation in chacma males was primarily explained by temporary elevations following events that relate to reproductive fitness. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Theoretical models predict that modalities of prey detection depend upon foraging modes: ambush foragers will rely on visual cues to launch a strike whereas active searchers will use chemical cues to locate prey. Testing this prediction is hampered by phylogenetic conservatism; ideally, we need to compare closely related animals that differ in foraging mode. Aquatic filesnakes from tropical Australia offer a unique opportunity of this kind, because female filesnakes ambush large fish in deep water whereas male filesnakes search actively for smaller fish in shallow water. We exposed freshly captured filesnakes to artificial prey items providing visual and/or chemical cues and measured tongue-flick rates and feeding responses of the snakes. Males responded most intensely to fish scent, regardless of movement, whereas females responded strongly to movement. Thus, our data provide the first intraspecific (sex-based) evidence for a functional relationship between foraging mode and the types of cues used for prey detection.

AB Vertebrate flee alarm calls can provide information about the type of predator, and some mammalian alarm calls also appear to communicate the degree of danger and therefore urgency of escape. However, because predators are usually rare, it has proved difficult to obtain observations differing only in the degree of danger, or to record sufficient naturally provoked alarm calls for fully replicated playback experiments. In this study, we took advantage of a system in which the major aerial predator was common, allowing repeated, matched observations of natural interactions between predator and prey, combined with a fully replicated playback experiment. We found that the aerial trill alarm call of the white-browed scrubwren, Sericornis frontalis, varied according to the distance from the suddenly appearing predator: the closer the predator, the greater the number of elements in the call and the higher their minimum frequency (pitch). Playback experiments showed that multi-element alarm calls prompted a more urgent response, including immediate fleeing to cover. Furthermore, the response was graded, such that an alarm with more elements provoked a more urgent response. Our study therefore isolated the effect of predator distance on alarm call design, and showed that individuals respond appropriately to calls in the absence of any other cues. To our knowledge, this is the most explicit demonstration that avian flee alarm calls can convey urgency.

AB The honeybee, Apis mellifera, has an extremely polyandrous mating system, which often involves multiple nuptial flights by its queens. To understand the evolution of extreme polyandry, we investigated the cost of multiple nuptial flights in relation to potential benefits. We analysed, with eight DNA microsatellite loci, the paternity of worker offspring of naturally mated queens. Queens that were restricted to one nuptial flight, but may have taken additional nuptial flights if allowed to do so, had significantly fewer matings than queens that started oviposition after a single nuptial flight. Furthermore, the number of sperm stored in a spermatheca increased significantly with the number of matings. We suggest that queens adjust their nuptial flight frequencies according to their mating success in their previous nuptial flights. The number of copulations seems to serve as a signal for the initiation of oviposition. In the light of these findings, we reconsider and discuss the significance of the sperm limitation hypothesis for the evolution of extreme polyandry in A. mellifera.

AB Many studies have examined grouping as a form of antipredator behaviour, but relatively few studies have examined how group size responds to natural variation in predation risk across space and through time. We studied the responses of elk, Cervus elaphus, herd size and composition to natural variation in the risk of predation by wolves, Canis lupus, in the Gallatin Canyon of Montana. We found that elk herd size increased as distance to protective cover increased. A positive association between group size and distance to cover is often interpreted as evidence that grouping is an antipredator response. However, we found that herd size increased only on days that wolves were absent. When wolves were present, herd sizes remained small at all distances from cover. This suggests that aggregation far from cover on days that wolves were absent was a foraging response, rather than an antipredator response. These data highlight interaction between temporal and spatial variation in predation risk, and suggest caution in conclusions about the antipredator benefits of grouping in the absence of direct data on risk or predator presence.

AB In the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior, wingless males compete with nestmate males for access to female mating partners, leading to local mate competition (LMC). Queen number varies between colonies, resulting in variation in the strength of LMC. Cremer & Heinze (2002, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 269, 417-422) showed that colonies responded to increasing queen number by producing a less female biased sex ratio, as predicted by LMC theory. However, the proximate mechanisms responsible for this variation in the sex ratio could not be determined because the study was restricted to adult sex ratios. With LMC, the primary sex ratio (proportion of haploid eggs laid by the queen) is expected to be female biased, which lowers the conflict between queens and workers over sex allocation. We compared the primary sex ratios laid by queens in monogynous and in polygynous experimental colonies of C. obscurior. The proportion of haploid eggs laid by queens was significantly lower in single-queen than in multiple-queen colonies. Furthermore, queens rapidly adjusted their primary sex ratios to changes in colony queen number. This is the first report of an adaptive adjustment of the primary sex ratio in response to LMC by ant queens. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The diversity of courtship displays throughout the animal kingdom is immense and displays can range from seemingly simple, to incredibly complex. Signallers often possess elaborate morphological adaptations for signals directed at a specific sensory modality in receivers. In some cases, these signals are so compelling to human observers, the possibility that important signals exist in other sensory modalities is ignored, potentially resulting in an incomplete characterization of the communication system. Jumping spiders (Salticidae) have remarkable visual capabilities. Yet one species, Habronattus dossenus, has recently been shown to have a complex repertoire of multicomponent seismic courtship signals in addition to and produced in concert with its multiple visual ornaments and movement displays. Here, we demonstrate the importance of these seismic signals in the courtship display of H. dossenus by comparing mating frequencies across experimentally manipulated treatments. Virgin females were paired with males from one of two experimental groups: nonmuted males or muted males. We found that females were significantly more likely to copulate with nonmuted males than with muted males. Furthermore, in all pairs that copulated, the latency to copulation was significantly shorter in nonmuted pairings than in muted pairings and precopulatory cannibalism rates were significantly lower. These results demonstrate that seismic signals are a critical component of male H. dossenus courtship displays. Additionally, we demonstrate that many other Habronattus species include a diversity of seismic signals in their courtship displays and we discuss potential selection pressures that may drive the evolution of multimodal displays even in species that already possess elaborate morphological adaptations for signals directed at one sensory modality.

AB Encounters between potential mating partners are usually accompanied by sexual conflict. In the case of internally fertilizing simultaneous hermaphrodites that perform one sexual role at a time, this conflict arises over the sexual roles. If both animals prefer to mate in one role, and simultaneous reciprocal insemination is not possible, the conflict can be resolved by sex role swapping after the first insemination, potentially resulting in a form of sperm trading called conditional reciprocity. Although sequentially reciprocal insemination has been reported in several hermaphroditic species, we investigated whether conditional reciprocity is the only possible explanation for such mating patterns. We studied the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis in which sexual isolation increases male sexual drive. Sex role alternation occurred only in pairs where both animals had been isolated and may be conditional. Previous studies in freshwater molluscs have interpreted the occurrence of role alternations per se as conditional reciprocity. However, based on our finding and a review of previous studies, we conclude that future experiments need to be designed very carefully to prove the existence of conditional reciprocity.

AB Antipredator theory has rarely been invoked to explain why birds associate in kin groups. Instead, it has been argued that offspring delay dispersal in response to poor dispersal opportunities and changes in the social environment as a consequence of dispersal decisions have been overlooked. To test whether parents provide their offspring with nepotistic antipredator protection, we conducted a field experiment to investigate predator mobbing in the Siberian jay. We used models of a mounted hawk and owl, which represent the two main predators as confirmed by recoveries of killed radiotagged individuals. Kin groups mobbed the predator models for longer and uttered both more calls in total and more predator-specific calls than nonkin groups. However, not all categories of individual called equally. In particular, alpha males gave most calls, especially in the presence of their retained offspring. Unrelated immigrants behaved least cautiously and approached the models closer and for longer than any other individual category. Furthermore, jays mobbed the hawk model, their most dangerous predator, for longer and took fewer risks than they did when mobbing the owl model. Our experiments show that effort and risk taking while mobbing in the Siberian jay not only depend on the danger posed by the predator, but are also influenced by the social environment. Parents invest more in the presence of their offspring. We suggested that such nepotistic antipredator behaviour gives offspring an incentive to delay dispersal and that nepotism could therefore have a pivotal role for the evolution of kin group living in animals.

AB Aggregation is widespread in invertebrate societies and can appear in response to environmental heterogeneities or by attraction between individuals. The performed experiments with cockroach, Blattella germanica, larvae in a homogeneous environment to investigate the influence of interactions between individuals on aggregations. Different densities were tested. A first phase led to radial dispersion of larvae in relation to wall-following behaviours; the consequence of this process was a homogeneous distribution of larvae around the periphery of the arena. A second phase corresponded to angular reorganization of larvae leading to the formation of aggregates. The phenomenon was analysed both at the individual and collective levels. Individual cockroaches modulated their behaviour depending on the presence of other larvae in their vicinity: probabilities of stopping and resting times were both higher when the numbers of larvae were greater. We then developed an agent-based model implementing individual behavioural rules, all derived from experiments, to explain the aggregation dynamics at the collective level. This study supports evidence that aggregation relies on mechanisms of amplification, supported by interactions between individuals that follow simple rules based on local information and without knowledge of the global structure.

ID TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDER; AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR; FORAGING TACTICS; FEMALES
AB Most studies of animal behaviour are based on direct observations of behaviour in a natural or laboratory context. While the potential for observation biases has often been discussed, there have been few quantitative analyses of the kinds of biases that may affect behavioural data. We used multiple observers of aggression and foraging behaviour in red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cincreus, to investigate observation biases related to the gender of the observer. We divided observers so that half were aware of the sex of the salamanders and the other half were kept blind to salamander sex. We then used comparisons between blind and unblind treatments to determine the magnitude of observation biases. We found little evidence for bias due to differential perception of male and female animals by men and women observers ('gender identification bias') for any of the behaviours examined. Although the expectations of men and women about salamander behaviour did sometimes differ, we also found no evidence that observers' expectations affected their observations of salamander behaviour. However, for one component of aggressive behaviour and one component of foraging behaviour, men observed higher overall frequencies of behaviour than did women, regardless of the sex of the salamander. Additionally, for three components of aggressive behaviour, both men and women recorded greater frequencies of behaviour when they were aware of the sex of the salamander than when they were unaware of the salamanders' sex. For two components of foraging behaviour, there were no significant biases with respect to the observers' gender or their knowledge of the sex of the salamander. These results suggest that observation biases with respect to observer gender may exist for some behavioural variables, and that these biases may be relatively subtle. Although conducting blind experiments may eliminate some types of bias, our results suggest that behaviours should also be carefully screened for consistency and repeatability prior to formal data collection, even for blind experiments.

AB in many sexually dimorphic ungulates, adults spend most of their time in single-sex groups outside the mating season. We tested two hypotheses proposed to explain this social segregation. The activity budget hypothesis predicts that females spend more time grazing than males, and that activity synchrony is higher within single-sex than mixed-sex groups. The social affinity hypothesis states that higher spatial proximity and aggregation within the sexes results from sexual differences in motivation to interact socially. fifteen merino sheep, Ovis aries, 2 or more years old, of each sex were penned together in three I-ha paddocks in succession during 7 winter weeks. Despite the high sexual dimorphism in body weight, both sexes were found together, and did not differ substantially in activity budget. Males grazed less than females but the difference was small. The degree of activity synchrony was similar within and between the sexes. When grazing, males walked more rapidly and tended to tie at the front of the group more often than females. Ewes were rarely seen interacting with other sheep, in contrast to males, which interacted twice as often with females as with males. However, same-sex pairs of nearest neighbours were found more frequently than expected, whether or not the males were at the front of the group. These results indicate a social segregation at a small spatial scale, which can be explained by differences in speed of movement between males and females and/or higher social affinity between same-sex than opposite-sex peers. The lack of single-sex groups can be explained by the strong gregariousness of merino sheep, and possibly the young age of the adult males.

AB Studies on domestic chicks Gallus gallus domesticus, have shown an advantage of multimodal advertisement by prey species. An interaction of novel colour and novel odour cues creates a synergistic aversive reaction (that is, the effect of the two cues presented simultaneously is greater than predicted by their individual presentation). Such reactions have not been tested empirically with passerine species, which account for about 60% of all bird species. We investigated the reactions of a passerine model, the zebra finch to novel colour and novel odour cues within food by measuring latencies to make contact with and to eat it. Zebra finches showed a synergistic reaction towards a combination of novel colour (red) and novel odour (pyrazine) cues despite showing no reaction to novel odour alone. As domestic chicks behave similarly, our results reveal that avian predators from different families show the same behaviour and suggest it might be a general behaviour of all birds. A comparison of the contact and consumption latencies for food of novel colour, and food of novel colour and odour, found that contact latencies remained the same while consumption latencies increased. We propose this is evidence of independent regulation of the processes controlling contact with a novel food (neophobia) and consumption of that food (dietary conservatism).

AB We assessed the effect of olfactory cues on agemate discrimination between lambs, Ovis aries. In experiment 1, a local anaesthetic was sprayed into the nostrils of 2-3-week-old lambs to inhibit olfaction. To verify whether the treated animals were anosmic, they were tested for their responses to a food source tainted with the odour of dog faeces, a scent that is strongly avoided by intact lambs. In a simultaneouschoice test, lambs that were categorized as anosmic, i.e. that fed in the presence of dog faeces odour, responded preferentially to a familiar penmate over an alien agemate, indicating that olfaction is not essential for social discrimination. We then examined intact lambs' responses to pairs of agemates that were anaesthetized and partially hidden, thereby eliminating vocal and salient visual characteristics of the stimulus lambs, but allowing access to their odours. During the choice tests, subject lambs responded more positively to their familiar twin than to an unfamiliar, unrelated lamb, but they did not discriminate between a familiar, unrelated penmate and a strange stimulus lamb. Thus, olfactory cues appeared to be a sufficient basis for twin recognition in this context. We conclude that discrimination of a twin but failure to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar unrelated lambs probably reflects differential familiarity between twins and unrelated penmates, but perceptible similarities between the odour phenotypes of twins may also facilitate the discrimination.

AB Although population sex ratios rarely deviate from unity, the sex ratio of individual mothers should be labile, allowing them to bias their sex ratios in favour of the more successful sex when they can expect a difference in the mean reproductive value of their daughters and sons. just how mothers should bias sex allocation is particularly complicated in cooperative breeders, because the adaptive sex ratio may be influenced by conflicting impacts of helpers on their parents' fitness via 'local resource enhancement' and 'local resource competition'. In western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, breeding-age helpers-at-the-nest are exclusively male and increase their parents' nesting success in the current year. As such, they are viewed as helpers, not hinderers, even though by failing to gain a breeding position they reduce their parents' annual inclusive fitness below that of parents with a breeding son. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that nonbreeding, stay-at-home helpers indicate poor breeding prospects for locally competing sons, and investigated one prediction of this hypothesis that such helpers also indicate a tendency for parents to produce substandard sons. A female removal experiment showed that female mates were in short supply. Pairs had daughter-biased broods when they had a stay-at-home helper son that failed to get a mate in the first place, but not when they had a helper that had been breeding on his own, but returned home to help sometime after his mother finished laying her eggs. Stay-at-home sons were not developmentally delayed relative to breeders of the same cohort, suggesting that helpers may not be inferior to breeders. Although the population sex ratio fluctuates about unity, a multiyear data set showed a negative relationship between the frequency of helping and the annual brood sex ratio for the population. These results suggest that local resource competition outweighs local resource enhancement in driving individual and population sex ratio variation in western bluebirds, a pattern that would not be predicted based on the simple question of whether helpers help or hinder at the nest.

AB Life history theory predicts that reproductive effort should increase as life expectancy decreases. Empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis is still fragmentary. We measured the effects of different potential indexes of mortality risk on oviposition in a geometrid moth Scotopteryx chenopodiata L. We conducted two experiments: in one we manipulated mortality risk by clipping wings or depriving the moths of food; in the other we studied the effect of incidental injuries, and varied host quality and food availability. Physical injuries led to a higher oviposition rate and shorter latency (i.e. a shorter discrimination period before oviposition) on both a high-ranked and a low-ranked host. High mortality risk was associated with a shorter latency to oviposit on the low-ranked, but not on the high-ranked host. These effects remained significant when we controlled for the influences of estimated adult age and eggload. Insects deprived of food as adults increased oviposition activity in the first experiment but not in the second. Our results suggest that certain cues of an adverse environment, as well as the individual's terminal condition, can increase reproductive effort and reduce host selectivity in insects.

AB The songs of male Puget Sound white-crowned sparrows form about 13 dialects along the Pacific Northwest coast of North America. In his original description of dialects in this subspecies, Baptista (1977, Condor, 79, 356-370) defined dialects by the terminal trill portion of the song because most males at a given location sing the same trill. Complex syllables in the introductory part of the song vary between males at a sample location and occur over a wider geographical range than trills. Baptista also recognized two superdialects or 'themes' based on differences in the phrase order within songs. We performed three playback experiments to territorial male white-crowned sparrows using both natural and computer-modified stimuli to test which acoustic features of song these birds attend to. Two of the experiments were conducted in nine dialect areas spanning nearly the entire geographical range of the subspecies. The results of the first such experiment indicate that across dialect areas, males give stronger responses (increased song rate and a shorter approach distance) to natural songs from the local dialect than they do to songs from a neighbouring dialect, a different theme, or another subspecies of white-crowned sparrow. Two experiments using modified stimuli conducted either across nine dialects or in one dialect led to the same conclusion: substitution of the trill from a neighbouring dialect into a song elicited weaker responses relative to the local control than did substitution of a neighbouring dialect's introduction. We conclude that the response of male Puget Sound white-crowned sparrows to playback is influenced most by variation in the song's trill. We found no evidence that the birds recognize 'superdialects' as do humans. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many coral reef fish possess ultraviolet (UV) colour patterns. The behavioural significance of these patterns is poorly understood and experiments on this issue have not been reported for free-living reef fish in their natural environment. The damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis has UV facial patterns, and spectroradiometric ocular media measurements show that it has the potential for UV vision. To test the potential behavioural significance of the UV patterns, I studied the response of males, in natural territories on the reef and in aquaria, to two conspecific intruders, one presented in a UV-transmitting (UV+) container and the other in a UV-absorbing (UV-) one. Territory owners attacked intruders viewed through UV+ filters significantly more often and for longer than intruders viewed through the UV- filter. In general, the results of the field experiment confirmed those of the laboratory experiment. The results support the hypothesis that P. amboinensis males are sensitive to UV light and that reflectance patterns, which appear in high contrast only in UV, modulate the level of aggressive behaviour. A recent survey showed that many predatory fish may not have UV vision and the use of UV colours in select species of reef fish may therefore serve as a 'private communication channel'.

ID FILIAL CANNIBALISM; PATERNAL CARE; BROOD SIZE; EVOLUTION; INVESTMENT;
   DYNAMICS; ECOLOGY
AB Partial filial cannibalism, the act of cannibalizing some offspring, has been explained as a response to the high energetic cost of care. I tested this hypothesis by manipulating the cost-to-benefit ratio of care in the scissortail sergeant, Abudefduf sexfasciatus, a tropical damselfish with male care. Background egg mortality was lower than the incidence of cannibalism, confirming that males did not just dispose of dead eggs. Investment in the current brood affected future investment, because males forced to skip a brood cycle put more effort into courtship during the following cycle and obtained larger broods than did unmanipulated males. Any factor influencing the cost-to-benefit ratio of parental care should also affect the incidence of cannibalism. I reduced the cost of care by supplementary feeding and reduced the benefit of care by simulating a decrease in paternity certainty through simulated intrusions by non-nesting males. Supplementary feeding significantly reduced partial filial cannibalism by parental males, a result compatible with the hypothesis that eggs are consumed to cover the energetic costs of parental care. Cannibalism decreased regardless of whether males were fed with conspecific eggs or crabmeat. Cannibalism was only reduced but not fully eliminated by supplementary feeding, and residual levels of cannibalism after feeding were similar to the background rate of egg mortality. Simulated intrusions by non-nesting males led to an increase in filial cannibalism and a decrease in parental effort. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Males achieve greater reproductive success through multiple broods, than

AB In polygynous species, it is unclear whether extrapair matings provide a better reproductive payoff to males than additional social mates. Male house wrens, Troglodytes aedon, show three types of social mating behaviour: single-brooded monogamy, sequential monogamy (two broods) and polygyny. Thus, male reproductive success can vary depending on the number of mates, the number of broods and the number of extrapair fertilizations. We used microsatellite markers to determine the realized reproductive success (total number of young sired from both within-pair and extrapair fertilizations) of males in these three categories. We found that polygynous males were more likely to be cuckolded than monogamous males; however, half of the polygynous males had a third brood, which resulted in similar reproductive success for sequentially monogamous and polygynous males. Despite the paternity gained from extrapair fertilizations by single-brooded males, males were more successful when they produced multiple broods during a season, either sequentially (monogamy) or simultaneously (polygyny). In our population, multibrooded males were more likely to have prior breeding experience and arrived earlier in the season, which provided a better opportunity to obtain more than one brood and, thus, produce more young.

AB In many insects, both sexes mate multiple times and females use stored sperm for fertilizations. While males frequently engage in two distinct behaviours, multiple mating (with different females) and repeated copulations (with the same female), the reproductive consequences of these behaviours for males have been quantified for only a few species. In this study, males of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, were found to be capable of mating with as many as seven different virgin females within 15 min. Across sequential copulations with virgin females, there was no decline in either male insemination success or average female progeny production over 48 h. However, when males copulated with previously mated females, there was a significant decline in male paternity success across sequential copulations, possibly due to male sperm depletion. In separate experiments, T castaneum males were found to engage in two to six repeated copulations with the same, individually marked female. These repeated copulations did not increase male insemination success, short-term female fecundity, or male paternity success. Repeated copulations may possibly play a role in sperm defence. This study indicates that males may frequently engage in multiple matings, but these additional matings may lead to diminishing male reproductive returns.

AB The limited amount of space that we provide for research animals can adversely influence the validity of behavioural data and animal welfare. Consumer demand studies have examined the strength of motivation that animals have for additional space; however, one problem of these studies is that the animals tested were generally of a gregarious species, but were tested in isolation. I trained a single mouse from each of six groups to perform an operant task to gain access to an additional 319, 777, or 1600 cm 2 while group-housed. As the cost of visits increased, the mice continued to gain access to the additional space, although the numbers of visits and the time in the additional space decreased. The slopes of the demand functions for the three amounts of additional space ranged between 0.64 and 0.44, indicating that the mice perceived additional space to be an important resource. The slopes of the demand functions, the areas under the demand functions and the Y-axis intercepts were not significantly different between the three sizes of additional space, thus corroborating previous similar work. These results indicate that group-housed laboratory mice in standard laboratory cages were highly motivated for additional space, but did not discriminate between the amounts offered.

AB Group size effects on antipredatory behaviour are well documented in numerous animals, but little is known about how the level of predation risk influences this process. We tested the hypothesis that group size and level of risk interact to affect the levels of antipredatory behaviour in the group-living sun skink, Lampropholis delicata. We controlled the size of lizard groups (N = 1, 2, 4, 8 or 12 females) and altered predation risk by providing either a basking tile covered with chemical cues from a predator (high risk) or one without scent (low risk). The time allocated to individual antipredatory behaviour decreased significantly with increasing group size. The relation between group size and time allocated to individual antipredatory behaviour was nonlinear and asymptotic, and did not change under low and high risks of predation. However, group size and predation risk interacted to affect significantly the time that lizards allocated to antipredatory behaviour. When the overall risk from predators was high, individual responsiveness decreased strongly as group size became larger. In contrast, when the overall risk from predators was low, individual responsiveness decreased weakly as group size became larger. Consequently, the time that lizards allocated to antipredatory behaviour under different risks of predation converged as group size increased.

AB In many avian species, nestlings have evolved striking plumage, behaviours and mouth colours to obtain a greater share of parental investment. Studies revealing parental feeding preferences for nestlings with red gapes have proposed that red mouth colour in songbirds can act as a signal of nestling need or condition. Alternative hypotheses suggest that bright nestling mouths in cavity-nesting birds evolved to increase nestling detectability by the parents. We tested whether nestling mouth colour affects parental feeding preferences in great tits, Pants major L. In broods of six young, we experimentally painted mouth gapes and flanges either red or yellow and tested the effect of mouth colour on nestlings' mass gain under two lighting conditions. In nests with high luminosity, there was no significant effect of mouth colour on mass gain. In nests with low luminosity, nestlings with red gapes and flanges gained less mass than nestlings with red gapes and yellow flanges or both yellow gapes and flanges. Our results suggest that, in nests with low luminosity, red mouths decreased nestling detectability to the feeding parents and support the hypothesis that poor luminosity in nesting cavities can select for pale mouths. Overall, our results do not support the hypothesis that red mouth colour signals nestling need or condition to parent great tits. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Theory predicts that variation in body size within a population of simultaneous hermaphrodites should affect sex allocation, leading to individual differences in mating strategies and increased investment in female function with size. Small animals with fewer resources should invest proportionally more of their resources in male function than large animals, resulting in sperm displacement and paternity patterns that are independent of body size. This study investigated the effect of body size on mating patterns, egg production (an indirect measure of sperm transfer) and paternity in Alderia modesta, a sperm-storing, hermaphroditic sea slug with hypodermic insemination. The relative sizes of two hermaphrodites affected the probability and duration of inseminations; smaller animals inseminated larger mates for longer than vice versa. Sperm transfer began at a smaller size and age than egg production, and estimates of both sperm transfer and egg production increased with body size. Paternity patterns varied widely; in this species, unpredictable sperm precedence patterns may be a consequence of hypodermic insemination and the lack of a well-defined sperm storage organ. Hypodermic injections across all sections of the body successfully transferred sperm and fertilized eggs. The function and consequences of hypodermic insemination are discussed.

AB Honeybees have an age-based division of labour that is influenced by genetic variability for the tendency to perform specific tasks. Individuals in a honeybee colony comprise diverse genotypes and their interactions can influence task allocation. Colonies from an African race (Africanized honeybees, AHB, Apis mellifera scutellata Ruttner) usually produce a much stronger defensive response than do European races of honeybees (EHB), and these races may differ in how individuals are allocated to the tasks of guarding and stinging. We observed guarding behaviour in colony environments that varied in proportions of genotypes (AHB, EHB) and population size. In large colonies, AHB showed much greater guarding persistence (number of days guarding) than EHB; hybrids were intermediate. In another series of experiments, three families each of AHB and EHB were cofostered in colonies with different AHB: EHB ratios, then tested in large and small colonies. In colonies of both sizes, colony environment interacted with both famly and type (AHB or EHB) for propensity to guard. Individuals of both types guarded more persistently in large colonies, but family and type both interacted with environment. EHB were more likely to initiate guarding bouts in low-AHB colonies, but persistence did not change with environment. AHB were insensitive to effects of environment for the tendency to initiate guarding behaviour, but were more persistent in high-AHB environments. EHB and AHB may differ in how they allocate individuals to guarding. The positive reinforcement of behaviour that occurs in high-defensive environments and in large populations could cause a stronger stinging response through alarm pheromone recruitment.

AB There is currently a gap in sexual selection theory about how much the environment drives female mating decisions. We present field data that suggest that female sexual behaviour in the damselfly Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis is influenced by parasite burden. Male wing pigmentation in Calopteryx is a sexually selected trait that signals a male's ability to cope with eugregarine parasites (an intestinal parasite that feeds on the adult's ingested food). Because adult C. haemorrhoidalis females also show wing pigmentation, we examined whether this trait is similarly influenced by parasite burden and whether it may signal the female's reproductive value. Male C. haemorrhoidalis defend riverine substrates that females use for oviposition. After copulation and during oviposition, females are guarded by the copulating male against intruder males. Alternatively, females may avoid mating and 'steal' an oviposition site within a male's territory. In the present study, we found that the amount of female wing pigmentation was negatively correlated with the number of eugregarines present. Females with more parasites produced fewer eggs, survived fewer days, spent less time during courtship, 'inspected' fewer males before mating, had a lower mating success, were guarded for less time during oviposition and engaged in fewer 'stealing' events during oviposition. The reduced egg production and survival of heavily infected females may result from eugregarine depletion of the females' consumed food reserves. Thus, to offset reduced longevity, heavily infected females may accept a mating more rapidly and mate with fewer males. 'Stealing' behaviour may be related to the female's differential use of sperm from some males, particularly high-quality males. Interestingly, males that mated with low-pigmented females showed greater variance in wing pigmentation than did males that mated with high-pigmented females. Possibly, female wing pigmentation may signal a female's reproductive value, which provides females with longer mate-guarding episodes and reduced interference from intruder males. This study points out one possible constraint, intestine parasites, that females may face during mating decisions. Because females in bad condition mate with males in both good and bad condition, this constraint may be pervasive enough to weaken the intensity of selection for a male sexually selected trait, wing pigmentation, and help to maintain its variation in phenotypic expression.

AB Brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, frequently parasitize red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus. The presence of a brood parasite, unrelated to both host nestlings and parents, has provoked speculation regarding within-brood food allocation and parental provisioning. This study is the first to compare directly the effect of brood parasitism on host parent and offspring behaviour in younger and older broods. We videotaped 28 unparasitized red-winged blackbird broods and compared them to 22 parasitized broods. Red-winged blackbird nestling begging appears largely unaffected by cowbird parasitism. The presence of the cowbird in the nest affected neither the latency nor duration of host nestling begging, but stimulated more frequent begging by red-winged blackbird nestlings following food distribution. Begging by cowbirds was unique in two ways: (1) cowbirds maintained a consistent begging effort throughout the nestling period (but did not receive a consistent food share); and (2) cowbirds begged longer and more frequently following the allocation of food. Persistent begging by the cowbird following the allocation of food has implications for the division of parental care, if by doing so the brood parasite is able to provoke the foster parent to increase provisioning, at the expense of brooding. We found no evidence for the adjustment of parental care. Neither the foraging rates nor the lengths of the parental feeding visits differed markedly between parasitized and unparasitized broods.

AB It is widely observed that mate-seeking behaviour in insects starts suddenly at a species-specific time and lasts at most for a few hours (i.e. periodic). Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain why periodicity occurs, none has incorporated a game-theoretical situation within and between the sexes at the same time. Using a theoretical model, we show that the coevolution of mating strategies can result in the emergence of two distinct population level phases: with and without mate seeking. In the mate-seeking phase, all individuals (male or female) search for mates, whereas no individuals seek mates in the phase without mate seeking. If there are individuals that do not seek mates in the mate-seeking phase, the model predicts that these should be of the sex with (1) lower survivorship during mate-seeking behaviour; (2) higher survivorship during nonmate-seeking behaviour; (3) higher expected future reproductive potential or (4) the sex towards which the sex ratio is biased. Furthermore, the model predicts that the mate-seeking phase is favoured when individuals have (1) high searching efficiency, (2) high survivorship during mate-seeking behaviour of either males or females, (3) low survivorship during nonmate-seeking behaviour of either males or females, or (4) low future reproductive potential for either males or females. In addition, the model suggests the existence of a critical environmental condition that divides these two phases, predicting that gradual changes in this condition trigger a sudden transition between the mate-seeking and nonmate-seeking phases.

TI For whom the male calls:: an effect of audience on contact call rate and

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID NEIGHBORING SONG SPARROWS; COMMUNICATION; RECOGNITION
AB Budgerigars are well known for their ability to imitate sounds, but little is known about the functional contexts in which they use these imitations. Recently, we have shown that male budgerigars consistently imitate the contact calls of the females with whom they are paired. Here we investigate whether males produce these imitations more frequently when they are with their mates than when they are with other females. In one experiment, we established seven budgerigar pairs and then tested each male with his mate and with an unfamiliar female. In the second experiment, we allowed pairs to form freely in an aviary and then tested the males with their mate and with a familiar mated female. In both experiments, the males produced significantly more imitations of their mate's call (defined as calls that were more than 75% similar to the mate's predominant contact call) when they were with their mate than when they were recorded with another female. Under aviary conditions, this difference was due to both a general increase in the males' rate of calling and to an increase in the percentage of the males' calls that were imitations. These data show that male budgerigars modify their contact call rates and repertoires in an audience-specific manner. This audience effect is unusual because it involves a learned vocalization and is extremely specific to a particular audience, namely the mate.

AB An animal's ability to win intrasexual conflicts is often determined by the combined influence of several different traits, such as size, experience, residency and prior injury. When each of two (or more) asymmetries favours a different rival, the outcome of a conflict will reflect each asymmetry's contribution to overall status. We investigated the interacting effects of size difference and prior loss of forelegs (a common injury in nature) on the ability of males to win intrasexual conflicts in Trite planiceps, a New Zealand jumping spider (Salticidae). When both rivals were intact, the probability of the larger rival winning increased with the size difference between rivals. When rivals were of matching size, injury was a strong predictor of outcome; intact spiders beat rivals missing one or both forelegs and spiders missing one foreleg beat rivals missing both forelegs. During conflicts between spiders that differed both in size and in injury state, these two variables had combined effects on outcome. The tendency for larger rivals to win increased with size difference, but the probability of the larger rival winning diminished if the larger rival of the pair was the more injured. We used inverse prediction from logistic regression models to quantify the size advantage that is sufficient to offset the disadvantage of prior injury.

   aggression towards displaced neighbours
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID DEAR ENEMY RECOGNITION; INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION; BEHAVIOR; ACQUISITION;
   COSTS
AB differential responses to neighbours and strangers (the dear enemy phenomenon) and individual recognition presumably evolve to reduce costs of territorial defence. Territorial residents have been found to demonstrate reduced aggression towards neighbours wherever they are encountered along that resident's territory boundary except for when the neighbour is displaced to the boundary opposite the shared boundary. In this new location, the displaced neighbour represents a greater threat to the resident's territory ownership, and should be treated as equally aggressive as a stranger. Finding increased aggression towards displaced neighbours has been interpreted as individual recognition, but these results do not provide sufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the resident sees the neighbour out of its normal context as just another stranger. We tested the hypothesis that territorial collard lizards can individually recognize neighbours and will increase aggression towards them as the threat to territorial ownership increases. Resident males treated neighbours that had been moved to the opposite boundary as equally aggressive as strangers. However, residents responded more aggressively towards strangers than towards neighbours on natural territories (the dear enemy phenomenon) and also in neutral arena encounters. Our results suggest that resident male collared lizards are able to recognize individuals regardless,of context and respond to them according to the threat that they pose.

TI Long-distance communication of acoustic cues to social identity in
   African elephants
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID VOCALIZATIONS; MAXIMUS; CALLS; HEARING
AB Research on long-distance vocal communication in mammals has tended to focus on the maximum distances over which a vocal signal might be physically detectable. For example, because elephants and some whales communicate using infrasonic calls, and low frequencies are particularly resilient to attenuation, it has often been assumed that these species can communicate over very long distances. However, a wide range of acoustic characteristics typically carry in-formation on individual identity in mammalian calls, and frequency components crucial for social recognition could be distorted or lost-as distance from the source increases. We used long-distance playback experiments to show that female African elephants, Loxodonta africana, can recognize a contact call as belonging to a family or bond group member over distances of 2.5 km, but that recognition is more usually, achieved over distances of 1-1.5 km. We analysed female contact calls to distinguish source- and filter-related vocal characteristics that have the potential to code individual identity, and rerecorded contact calls 0.5-3.0 km from the loudspeaker to determine how different frequencies persist with distance. Our analyses suggest that the most important frequency components for long-distance communication of social identity may be well above the infrasonic range. When frequency components around 115 Hz become immersed in background noise, once propagation distances exceed 1 km, abilities for long-distance social recognition become limited. Our results indicate that the possession of an unusually long vocal filter, which appears to incorporate the trunk, may be a more important attribute for long-distance signalling in female African elephants than the ability to produce infrasound.

ID BREEDING SUCCESS; GEESE; COLONIES; ADVANTAGES; INTERPLAY; LEMMINGS;
   DEFENSE; MAGPIES; GREBES; CHOICE
AB We tested the predator protection and similar habitat hypotheses in relation to red-breasted goose, Branta ruficollis, nesting associations. Geese began laying 1-3 weeks after all associated species. In almost all cases they nested on the mainland only if raptors were also present and always followed raptors when they changed eyries between years. They selected peregrines, Falco peregrinus, and snowy owls, Nyctea scandiaca, as associates in preference to rough-legged buzzards, Buteo lagopus, even though the latter were several times more abundant along river corridors. Nest defence experiments with a surrogate Arctic fox, Alopex lagopus, showed that this could be explained by differences in nest defence intensity, rather than habitat types selected. Similar experiments also suggested that gulls were much less aggressive than owls or falcons. Foxes rarely approached, and were easily repelled from goose colonies associated with owls and peregrines, but gulls were apparently incapable of repelling foxes. Breeding success was much higher for geese nesting with raptors than for those on islands and geese apparently preferred to nest with owls in peak lemming years than to remain on islands. These findings support the hypothesis that red-breasted geese actively choose to nest near raptors; however, they probably associate with gulls primarily because both species select fox-free islands. Compared with other studies, red-breasted geese nesting with raptors and on islands apparently represent two extremes in a continuum of nesting associations generally seen in birds. We discuss why the behaviour might have evolved and argue that this may be the only known bird species whose evolution has been facilitated primarily by the exploitation of the nest defence behaviour of aggressive raptorial hosts.

AB Among pair-living species, which represent a simple form of gregariousness, the degree of cohesion appears to be highly variable, but the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of cohesiveness have been poorly studied. We present data from long-term behavioural observations of eight pairs of fork-marked lemurs, including year-round data on their sleeping site use and spatial data from simultaneous focal follows of both pair partners, that characterize its social organization as 'dispersed pairs'. Although pairs were stable over several years, territories of pair partners overlapped almost perfectly and interactions between them were frequent, the cohesiveness of pairs was extremely low. High rates of conflict relative to frequencies of affiliative interactions indicated that avoidance of the pair partner is the key mechanism responsible for the observed pattern of space use. The repeated use of the same predictable food resources during the night, frequent conflicts over food and patterns of vocal communication imply that avoidance of direct feeding competition, together with incomplete knowledge about the pair partner's position, lead to the observed low cohesiveness. The freedom to forage solitarily and the associated lack of information about the pair partner's position found in fork-marked lemurs are in contrast to most group-living species and qualify dispersed pairs as a focus for future studies. of models on animal movement decisions.

AB This study examines the effect of female presence on the amount of 'strippable' sperm, and the relationship between male sexual activity and the amount of 'ready' sperm in the male guppy Poecilia reticulata. The amount of strippable sperm was greater in males paired for one week with females than in isolated males. We separated these 'paired' males from females by a clear partition and thus exposed males to visual and possibly olfactory stimuli. In the second experiment, control males spent more time attending females and performed more sexual acts during a 15-min test period than males previously stripped of spermatophores. These results indicate that females play an important role in stimulating sperm availability in males and that the amount of ready sperm influences male sexual behaviour.

AB Parasites can affect mate choice, with females preferentially selecting parasite-free males. Prior exposure to, or experience with, males has also been suggested to influence mate responses. Here, we examined the effects of an immediate, brief (1 or 15 min) pre-exposure to the urinary and associated odours of either an uninfected male house mouse, Mus domesticus, or a male infected with the natural murine nematode parasite, Heligomosomoides polygyrus, on the subsequent responses of female mice to the odours of infected and uninfected males. Using an odour preference test we found that females displayed a marked overall preference for the odours of uninfected males. Pre-exposure to the odours of a parasitized male decreased female preference for nonparasitized males and increased female preference for parasitized males. This 'prior male' effect was evident for both the total odour preference and initial odour choice. Females pre-exposed to the odour of a parasitized male displayed decreased choosiness and made no particular initial choice of a male, while still maintaining an overall preference for the odours of uninfected males. These shifts in initial choice and odour preference were not directly associated with either female stress responses or stress-related odour cues of the males. Our findings show that female mice can distinguish between parasitized and nonparasitized males on the basis of odour and suggest that a brief exposure to the odours of infected males influences females' immediate odour preferences, and their subsequent preference for and choice of males. This rapid, infection-associated 'prior male' effect may contribute to the reported variations in female mate preference and choice.

AB We investigated whether individual great tits, Parus major, vary consistently in their exploratory behaviour in a novel environment and measured the repeatability and heritability of this trait. Wild birds were caught in their natural habitat, tested in the laboratory in an open field test on the following morning, then released at the capture site. We measured individual consistency of exploratory behaviour for recaptured individuals (repeatability) and estimated the heritability with parent-offspring regressions and sibling analyses. Measures of exploratory behaviour of individuals at repeated captures were consistent in both sexes and study areas (repeatabilities ranged from 0.27 to 0.48). Exploration scores did not differ between the sexes, and were unrelated to age, condition at fledging or condition during measurement. Heritability estimates were 0.22-0.41 (parent-offspring regressions) and 0.37-0.40 (sibling analyses). We conclude that (1) consistent individual variation in open field behaviour exists in individuals from the wild, and (2) this behavioural variation is heritable. This is one of the first studies showing heritable variation in a behavioural trait in animals from the wild, and poses the question of how this variation is maintained under natural conditions.

TI Forage quality and the costs of lactation for female gelada baboons

ID BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY; RAINFALL; NUTRITION; BIOMASS; TIME
AB Field studies of two species of baboons suggest that Altmann's model of maternal time budgets (1980, Baboon Mothers and Infants, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press) provides a good qualitative but a poor quantitative fit to observed changes in the time that mothers spend feeding across infant age. We suggest that the poor quantitative fit might be explained by the fact that food quality varies across time, so that females are forced to feed for longer to gain the same nutrient intake when quality is poor. The hypothesis was tested with data from both gelada baboons, Theropithecus gelada, and Altmann's own baboons, Papio cynocephalus, with rainfall and ambient temperature as indices of vegetation nutritional quality. The results confirm that a three-factor model incorporating infant age, rainfall in the 2 preceding months and current ambient temperature provides a significantly improved fit to the observed data.

AB We present the first empirical test of the timing hypothesis regarding the generation of size-assortative pairing in amphipods. The timing hypothesis proposes that, since large males are better able to afford the costs of mate guarding than small males, the former can take larger females into precopula earlier in the female moult cycle than is feasible for the latter. This leaves small males to form pairs with smaller females closer to moult, thus generating size assortment. We presented male Gammarus pulex, collected both in precopula and as singletons, with females that were (1) previously guarded and therefore near to copulatory moult and (2) previously unguarded and therefore far from copulatory moult. This comparison tested the prediction of the timing hypothesis, that size assortment should break down when the opportunity for time-based male decisions is removed, but that size assortment should occur where timing is not disrupted. Counter to the hypothesis, we found that size assortment did not break down upon removal of the time factor. Large males tended to initiate mate guarding earlier than small males in both female moult groups. However, only in the previously unguarded group did large males guard for longer than small males. This result suggests that, although size assortment occurred in all groups, the causative mechanisms that generated this pattern may differ between these groups. We therefore consider the possible importance of mechanisms such as aggression, simultaneous manipulation of females and female resistance in producing size assortment where males encounter numerous females that are close to moult. We also observed that prior recent guarding experience by males had no effect on latency to guard or size-assortative pairing. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   prelude of <i>Panorpa cognata</i>
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID INDIRECT SPERM TRANSFER; MULTIPLE PATERNITY; MECOPTERA; VULGARIS
AB The scorpionfly Panorpa cognata has a prolonged premating period. After the male attracts a female, there is usually a long delay, from a few minutes to almost 7 h, before the male initiates copulation by secreting a salivary mass. In our experiments, we manipulated the amount of food, and hence the condition, of males and then measured their premating duration. The premating duration was strongly influenced by male nutrient availability and, consequently, male mating resource limitation. Males with ample resource availability, that is with large salivary glands, initiated copulations faster than males with limited resources. In addition, premating duration decreased with increasing male age. The secretion of a salivary mass was more likely to result in a successful copulation if males delayed copulation. When males initiated copulation soon after attracting a mate, nuptial gift offering often failed because of interruption by other scorpionflies or female rejection. Since the value of each invested salivary mass is high for males with limited resources, we suggest that these males invest prudently: to enhance the probability of a return on their investment, they delay secreting the salivary mass until they are confident that females are motivated to mate. Furthermore, with this strategy, males enhance the likelihood of copulating in a sheltered location, where they are unlikely to be interrupted by intruders. Alternative hypotheses are that males in poor condition have more difficulty in persuading females or that males with small salivary glands need longer to produce the salivary mass.

   SIZE
AB In species where parents repeatedly provide their offspring with food, the offspring often communicate their need to the parents. Burying beetles, which breed on a wide size range of carcasses of small vertebrates, are interesting model systems to test theories on begging, because the larvae show partial begging, that is, they obtain food through both signalling to their parents (begging) and feeding directly from the carcass. We manipulated resource availability in Nicrophorus vespilloides by providing parents with mouse carcasses spanning a wide size range, and allowing them to rear the larvae that hatched, so that both the amount of resources and the number of siblings varied. Time spent begging by each larva was strongly influenced by the time parents spent near the larvae. Brood size had a nonlinear effect on larval begging, with begging increasing with brood size for relatively smaller broods and decreasing again for larger broods. Carcass size and number of parents present had no effect on begging. Time spent provisioning the larvae by the parents was strongly associated with the time spent begging by each larva. Parents spent more time provisioning under biparental care than under uniparental care, while brood size and carcass size had no significant effect. These findings suggest that the larvae adjust their begging to the behaviour of their parents and the number of siblings, but not to the amount of resources. Furthermore, parents adjust the time spent provisioning to the average amount of begging by each larva in the brood, and not to the availability of resources. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Giant wood spiders, Nephila maculata (Fabricius 1793), typically have a greenish cephalothorax and a dark abdomen decorated with striking yellow bands and spots. However, in Taiwan and neighbouring coastal islands we also found some morphologically indistinguishable individuals that were totally dark. As insects are attracted to ultraviolet (UV) light, we compared the UV reflectance property and insect-catching ability of the two morphs to see whether variation in colour affected foraging success. We also examined the population genetic structure to estimate indirectly the level of gene flow between these two colour morphs. Body surface UV reflection rate was measured from six areas of the spider with a spectrometer. To compare the insect-catching ability of different morphs, we recorded the spiders' body colour, orb size and insect-interception rates. The typical morph of N. maculata reflected significantly more UV in four of the six areas examined and caught significantly more insects than the melanic morph. We estimated population genetic structure by allozyme electrophoresis, using 20 loci from 17 enzymes. The population differentiation index (FIT) derived from all eight polymorphic loci was 0.023, indicating a minimum level of genetic differentiation. These results indicate that the two morphs of N. maculata may be members of an interbreeding population, and melanics have lower foraging success because of a lower body surface reflectance.

AB Variation in the investment of maternal resources in eggs, such as proteins and lipids, can have a profound influence on the growth and development of young. Maternal resources transferred to eggs also include androgens found in the yolk. In several species of birds the concentration of testosterone in the yolk either increases or decreases with laying order. Yolk testosterone has been shown to have various effects on the young including enhanced growth and dominance as well as reduced survival. Previous work suggested that the concentration of testosterone in the yolk may be influenced by the female's social conditions, specifically the frequency of aggressive interactions. In tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, we found that yolk testosterone was correlated with the aggressive interactions of the female before and during egg laying. In contrast to other species, yolk testosterone did not vary with laying order in tree swallows. Thus, patterns of yolk testosterone are more variable than thought previously and may be influenced by the social conditions experienced by the female during laying.

AB In social insects the mixture of cuticular hydrocarbons is generally considered to act as a recognition pheromone. However, little information exists on the relative importance of single compounds or of different classes of hydrocarbons. We tested the importance for nestmate recognition of a series of alkenes, methyl-branched alkanes and linear alkanes present in the cuticular profile of the social wasp Polistes dominulus. We applied the hydrocarbons on to live wasps and observed the behaviour of nestmates once the treated individual attempted to enter the nest. Linear alkanes had no effect upon the recognition response, whereas wasps treated with methyl-branched alkanes or alkenes were attacked. This is the first systematic evaluation of the role of hydrocarbon classes as recognition cues and begins to define the recognition signature within the cuticular profile for a genus regarded as a model organism for the study of recognition in animals.

   EXPLOITATION; DOMINANCE; SUCCESS
AB Group living can confer advantages to individuals, but it can also impose severe costs through resource competition. Kleptoparasitism is one example in which some individuals (joiners) can exploit the food discovered by other animals (finders). This type of social foraging has been modelled either as an information-sharing model or as a producer-scrounger game. An important variable in these models is the finder's advantage: the number of items obtained by the finder before the arrival of other individuals. In this study we describe how the spatial position and rank of individuals in a group of wild tufted capuchin monkeys affect their ability to discover and exploit new food sources. We also analyse the factors that affect the finder's share and the total amount of food obtained by the finder from a newly discovered resource. By placing platforms filled with bananas at novel locations in their home range, we show that animals in the leading edge of a foraging group have a higher probability of discovering new food sources than animals occupying other spatial positions. The alpha male and the alpha female, which tended to occupy central-forward positions, were able to monopolize newly discovered food sources and thus obtain a major share of them. The finder's share at the feeding platforms was smaller when there was more food on a platform, but increased with longer delays before the arrival of other individuals. The total amount of food obtained by the finder from the feeding platforms was larger when there was more food on the platform, when the finder was of higher social status, and when it took longer for other individuals to arrive. Animals can increase their finder's share and total amount consumed from a newly discovered resource by keeping large interindividual distances and by avoiding giving cues about the presence of food (such as food-associated vocalizations) to other animals.

ID JOINT VISUAL-ATTENTION
AB Primates follow the gaze direction of conspecifics to outside objects. We followed the ontogeny of this social-cognitive skill for two species: rhesus macaques and chimpanzees. In the first two experiments, using both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal design, we exposed individuals of different ages to a human looking in a specified direction. Rhesus infants first began reliably to follow the direction of this gaze at the end of the early infancy period, at about 5.5 months of age. Chimpanzees did not reliably follow human gaze until 3-4 years; this corresponds to the latter part of the late infancy period for this species. In the third experiment we exposed individuals of the same two species to a human repeatedly looking to the same location (with no special object at that location) to see if subjects would learn to ignore the looks. Only adults of the two species diminished their gaze-following behaviour over trials. This suggests that in the period between infancy and adulthood individuals of both species come to integrate their gaze-following skills with their more general social-cognitive knowledge about other animate beings and their behaviour, and so become able to deploy their gaze-following skills in a more flexible manner.

ID HYPOTHESIS; BEHAVIOR
AB One of the most commonly cited functional explanations for animal duet songs is strengthening of the pair bond. However, the evidence to support this view is, at best, limited. This study provides support by documenting a relationship between pair bonds and duet singing in siamangs. As a working hypothesis, we assume that if duetting were related to pair bonding, we might expect to see a relationship between duetting intensity and indicators of pair bond strength. Like most gibbon species, siamang pairs produce loud, long and well-coordinated duet songs. We recorded daily frequency and duration of duetting and three generally accepted indicators of pair bond strength (mutual grooming, behavioural synchronization and distance between mates) in 10 siamang groups in zoos. Duetting activity was positively correlated with grooming activity and. behavioural synchronization, and negatively correlated with distance between mates. These results suggest that the production of coordinated duets by siamang pairs is related to pair bonding. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Plasma testosterone (T) levels in male dark-eyed juncos peak early in the breeding season, then decline. If T enhances opportunities for reproductive success, as suggested by previous experiments, why does elevated T not occur naturally? To address this question, we prolonged the early peak level throughout the breeding season and explored potential energetic costs of maintaining elevated T. We measured daily energy expenditure (DEE) of treated males (T-males) and controls (C-males) using doubly labelled water (DLW). We also conducted behaviour scans of T- and C-males housed in outdoor aviaries. DEE was not higher in T-males than in C-males. However, T-males did increase locomotion and foraging and decrease rest and self-maintenance. These results suggest that elevated T may increase the contribution of some components of DEE and lower the contribution of others. Furthermore, the T-induced decrease in allocation of time to rest and maintenance may represent a long-term cost that has led to selection against the maintenance of elevated T beyond the natural early spring peak.

AB There is a growing body of robot-based research that makes a serious claim to be a new methodology for biology. Robots can be used as models of specific animal systems to test hypotheses regarding the control of behaviour. At levels from learning algorithms to specific dendritic circuits, implementing a proposed controller in a robotic device tests it against real environments in a way that is difficult to simulate. This often provides insight into the true nature of the problem. It also enforces complete specifications and combines bodies of data. Current work can sometimes be criticized for drawing unjustified conclusions given the limited evaluation and inevitable inaccuracies of robot models. Nevertheless, this approach has led to novel hypotheses for animal behaviour and seems likely to provide fruitful results in the future. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Genetic polymorphism along an environmental gradient may be maintained if disruptive selection on habitat-specific traits leads to a correlated response in traits that reduce gene flow between habitats. We studied a short-distance dine in a population of freshwater snails Potamopyrgus antipodarum in which sexual and clonal snails coexist. Sexuals and clones show a life history dine by depth: snails reproduce at a smaller size in shallower habitats. Clones are also structured genetically across habitats and seem not to mix, even though habitats are within the dispersal distance of the snails and the opportunity for gene flow via migration must be considerable. Because habitat preference may promote divergence in both clones and sexuals along the depth gradient, we investigated whether snails show habitat-specific food choice behaviour that could reduce migration. We tested the food choice behaviour of the snails by exposing them simultaneously to food from their home and adjacent habitats. Both juvenile and adult snails from the shallow shore bank and a mid-water macrophyte habitat preferentially grazed on the vegetation of their original habitats. We suggest that the observed genetic and life history dine may be maintained by food choice behaviour that may promote a partial barrier to gene flow between the habitats.

AB Subordinates often have to wait for dominants to obtain food. As a result, their foraging success should be less predictable and they should therefore maintain a higher level of energy reserves compared with dominants. A corollary of this prediction is that subordinates should gain mass earlier in the day and maintain higher mass than dominants. We tested these predictions with captive Carolina chickadees. In two different experiments tone where birds were given ad libitum access to food and the other with food access limited to 60 min/day), we formed social flocks of two previously unfamiliar birds and compared their energy management (body fat and food caches) while they were in the flock with energy management when housed alone. Results from both experiments failed to support the predictions. Of all the parameters of body mass and food caching we measured only the following results were significant: (1) On the ad libitum food schedule, both subordinates and dominants accumulated more mass over the day when in a flock compared with when they were solitary, and there were no differences in mass gain between dominants and subordinates. (2) When analysed separately, dominants showed a higher evening mass in the flock compared with the solitary condition, a trend that runs opposite to the prediction. Our results suggest that when in favourable foraging conditions, social interactions might cause dominant and subordinate birds to accumulate more energy reserves as a result of competition. On the other hand, if food supply is limited, both dominants and subordinates may be forced to maintain similar fat reserves as an insurance against increased risk of starvation.

   PRIMACY
AB In a previous experiment, we showed that domestic pigs, Sus scrofa, unlike many other species, performed accurately in a spatial memory task, where visits to a previously baited food trough were rewarded (win-stay). We investigated whether pigs have a predisposition for this strategy, by comparing their performance in a radial arm maze under either win-stay (N=10) or win-shift (N=10) reward contingencies. Contrary to our earlier results, only one of the animals in the win-stay condition was able to reach the imposed criterion level of accuracy. The performances of the other win-stay pigs did not deviate from random. All pigs in the win-shift condition reached criterion by day 25 of the experiment, and performed better than expected by chance. Analysis of the types of errors made matched our a priori predictions that shift movements would occur more frequently, especially within visits to the maze. We suggest that the difference in learning rates may reflect the fact that win-stay pigs needed to use two different rules, stay between trials and shift within trials, while win-shift pigs only heeded to use the shift rule. In our previous study, win-stay pigs did not experience a conflict of rules and this may have facilitated stay learning. We found evidence of a recency effect in win-shift animals and a primacy effect in the win-stay group. However, we discuss the unsuitability of these specific terms in this type of experiment, and propose an alternative interpretation of the results.

   INCUBATION; BEHAVIOR; SURVIVAL; CARE; COST; AGE
AB Life-history theory predicts that differences in reproductive effort and residual reproductive value among species should result in differences in the level of risk that parents are willing to tolerate to themselves versus their offspring. Specifically, highly fecund and shorter-lived species are expected to place greater value in current offspring than themselves, whereas less fecund and longer-lived species are expected to place greater value in their own survival and future breeding opportunities. Here, we test the prediction that parental investment decisions are correlated with life histories by comparing risk-taking behaviour in two species of nuthatch that differ in reproductive effort: the white-breasted nuthatch, Sitta carolinensis (more fecund, lower survival) and the red-breasted nuthatch, S. canadensis (less fecund, higher survival). We experimentally manipulated stage-specific predation risk by presenting models of an adult predator (hawk) and an egg predator (wren) and measured the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest. We found that both species of nuthatch responded to predators by increasing the length of time between visits and aborting more visits to the nest. However, as predicted by their life histories, S. carolinensis displayed a significantly stronger response to the egg predator, whereas S. canadensis responded more strongly to the adult predator. Thus, species can differ in their willingness to tolerate risk to themselves and their young, and such differences appear to be related to differences in investment in current reproduction and the probability of future survival.

ID SEXUAL SELECTION; POECILIA-RETICULATA; FEMALE PREFERENCE; COLOR
   PATTERNS; MATE-CHOICE
AB To display to females, male wrens, Troglodytes troglodytes, use cork nests built on their territories. Nest building starts about a month before the first females begin egg laying. The timing of nest building is highly variable between males with up to 8 weeks separating the earliest from the latest males to initiate this display activity. Males that weigh more before the breeding season initiate nest building earlier than lighter males. We measured testis size in male wrens in the prebreeding period during which seasonal testicular recrudescence is occurring. The initiation df nest building was predicted by male age and by testis size. This suggests that variation in the start of courtship activity may reflect variation between males in the rate of testicular recrudescence. Variation in male prebreeding body mass was influenced by variation in testis size, which suggests that the relation reported earlier between body mass and timing of nest construction could be explained, in part, by variation in testis size. Alternatively, if body mass reflects body condition then both the extent of testes recrudescence and the timing of courtship activity could be condition-dependent traits.

AB Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is thought to be an indicator of developmental stability and negatively related to male mating success in many animal taxa. We investigated the relationships between mating success of males, body size and FA for both wing length and number of setae on the legs in the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Males were classified as mated or unmated at the time of sampling. Fluctuating asymmetry, expressed as right-left differences, showed normal distributions without evidence of directional asymmetry or antisymmetry. Univariate analyses showed a significant negative correlation between size and mating success, and significant negative correlations between FA and mating success for both characters. On the other hand, with a multivariate analysis, new to studies on FA, the effect of body size was still significant but FA did not reach significance for either character. We conclude that the multivariate analysis should be used to assess the role of the different factors affecting mating success. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We employed a Bayesian statistical approach to examine female preferences in the Neotropical frog Physalaemus pustulosus for the temporal relationship of the two parts of the conspecific advertisement call. The male advertisement call consists of a 'whine', which is necessary for species recognition, followed immediately by one or more 'chucks', which make the whine more attractive to females. We conducted 42 two-choice experiments with a total of 840 individual tests to compare the attractiveness of a whine with a chuck in a variety of positions relative to the start of the whine against a normal whine or against a normal whine/chuck. Females have a bimodal preference function for chuck position. Chucks placed in a variety of positions after the whine(including the position of a chuck in a normal call) were generally as attractive as a normal whine/chuck. Chucks placed before the whine were generally more attractive than a whine alone, and in some positions as attractive as the normal whine/chuck. Chucks overlapping the end of the whine make the call more attractive than a whine alone, but not as attractive as a normal whine/chuck, while chucks overlapping an initial portion of the whine beginning 50 ms into it are ignored; previous work (Wilczynski et al. 1995, Animal Behaviour, 49, 911-929) indicates this region to be critical for species recognition. These results suggest that female P. pustulosus have preferences for the temporal relationship of the two parts of the conspecific male advertisement call that far exceed the vocal signals produced by males, and that male calls have evolved calls to exploit one peak of this function.

AB Theoretical models predict that birds should decrease their body mass in response to increased predation risk because lighter birds take off faster and are more manoeuvrable. We studied the effect of predation risk by chasing coal tits in large outdoor aviaries thus simulating an attempt to capture them. With this increase in predation risk, both perceived and actual, coal tits lost significantly more weight than in a control situation when they were not pursued. This pattern was attributable to a smaller gain in weight only during the day; nocturnal weight did not change in relation to diurnal predation risk. The lower daily weight gain was not consistent with predictions from models of interrupted foraging, but war consistent with predictions from risk adjustment models. Moreover, there was no difference in weight gain over 2-h periods that included a 1-h fast and those in which feeding was ad libitum, suggesting that coal tits could easily regain their body mass after a predator had interrupted their feeding. Our results therefore suggest that pursuit by predators leads to a decrease in the body mass of small birds. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Jumping spiders Portia labiata were tested in the laboratory on three different kinds of detours. In one, both routes led to the lure. In the other variants, one of the routes had a gap, making that route impassable. When tested with only one complete route, Portia chose this route after visually inspecting both routes. An analysis of scanning showed that, at the beginning of the scanning routine, the spiders scanned both the complete and the incomplete route but that, by the end of the scanning routine, they predominantly scanned only the complete route. Two rules seemed to govern their scanning: (1) they would continue turning in one direction when scanning away from the lure along horizontal features of the detour route; and (2) when the end of the horizontal feature being scanned was reached, they would change direction and turn back towards the lure. These rules 'channelled' the spiders' scanning on to the complete route, and they then overwhelmingly chose to head towards the route they had fixated most while scanning.

AB Seven female and six male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were reared in acoustic isolation from song and tested for their preference for conspecific song when 28-53 days old by allowing them to select exposure to zebra finch or European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, song. The birds hopped more frequently on a perch that generated zebra finch song than one that produced starling song, and they spent more time listening to zebra finch song. There were no sex differences. The results indicate that during their sensitive period for song learning, and prior to experience with song, zebra finches prefer conspecific song to heterospecific song.

AB We examined whether individual differences in patterns of parental care relate to individual differences in situations involving novelty, risk and aggression In the convict cichlid, Cichlasoma (Archocentrus) nigrofasciatum. Individual differences in situations of novelty and risk could be summarized along two axes: Freezing versus Activity and Activity-Inspection versus Freezing. However, these factors were not independent and formed a single higher-order dimension of general activity,Parental locomotor activity was negatively correlated with the Freezing versus Activity factor in females, Males that did little brood provisioning tended to be less active in the presence of a novel fish. Individuals that spent more time near their offspring at late brood stages were less inhibited in behavioural tests. Furthermore, extreme assortative mating by body size was found (r(S)=0.91). The cichlids also spawned assortatively by the factor Freezing versus Activity and by the general activity factor (r(S)greater than or equal to 0.49), but not by the factor Activity-Inspection versus Freezing or by aggressiveness.

TI Demographic consequences of incest avoidance in the cooperatively

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID INBREEDING AVOIDANCE; SONG SPARROWS; DEPRESSION; POPULATION
AB The avoidance of breeding with close relatives is an adaptation to inbreeding depression. Unfortunately, inbreeding depression has proved difficult to document or measure in the wild, despite being frequently observed among animals in captivity. We address this problem indirectly by determining the demographic cost of incest avoidance in the cooperatively breeding, polygynandrous acorn woodpecker, Melanerpes formicivorus, following the death or disappearance of all breeders of one sex within a group (a reproductive vacancy). Groups undergoing female vacancies that also contained female nonbreeding helpers experienced significantly lower reproductive success in each of the subsequent 3 years than those in which either no nonbreeding helpers or only male nonbreeding helpers were present, a decrease attributable to incest avoidance between the helper females and the related breeder males in the group. Using a computer simulation combined with a life-table analysis, we estimated that incest avoidance costs the population 9.2-12.1% in overall reproductive potential (measured in fledglings/female) and decreases the population rate of increase by 1.78-2.33%/year. These results suggest the presence, on average, of at least 1.2-1.8 lethal equivalents per individual, a value of the same magnitude as estimated for several other taxa, including humans. Incest avoidance may compound random demographic and environmental events and significantly facilitate the decline of threatened populations even prior to any detrimental effects of inbreeding depression per se.

   CHOICE; EXPERIENCE
AB We studied mate choice in the wandering albatross, Diomedea exulans, using data from 32 years of banding returns in the population of the Crozet Islands. We studied mating choices in a single year, when the Crozet Islands population was male biased (8:5, males:females). Thus, we expected that females might show great flexibility of choice of partners. Because age and experience might influence mate choice, we tested the expectation that females would choose the oldest and most experienced males for pair bonding. Pair bonds usually last until one member of the pair dies (0.3% of the birds 'divorce'), so mate choice should be especially important. We found that the ages of males and females in both displaying and bonded (breeding) pairs were significantly correlated. These age-associated pairings were not a passive phenomenon, but appeared to be due to an active process of selection of mates of similar age. First-time breeders sought mates of similar age, but preferred those with the most experience. Remating, experienced birds whose mates had died did not pair with individuals of significantly similar age, but predominantly paired with other widowed birds that, on average, were also relatively old. Mate fidelity in wandering albatrosses may be due to the cost of finding;and bonding with a new mate. Pair bonds, and thus breeding, took an average of 3.2 and 2.3 years to establish, for males and females, respectively. Thus, remating exerts a potential average reproductive cost of about 15% of lifetime reproductive success, (C) 1999 The Association for the Study Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB In many ant species, including the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, queens can found their colonies alone or in associations of two or more. Colonies founded by associations produce a larger worker brood,have higher survival and mature earlier than colonies founded by solitary queens. However, cofoundresses almost invariably fight after the eclosion of the first workers. As a result, only one queen survives and monopolizes the colony's future reproductive output. Queen mortality also occurs before worker eclosion, but neither the causes (e.g. starvation, conflict), nor the factors (e.g. social environment) potentially affecting its occurrence, have been investigated. We analysed the effect of social environment and queen body mass on early mortality by keeping queens (1) solitarily, (2) within associations of four queens of the same initial mass, and (3) within associations of four queens of random initial mass. Mortality was higher for queens within associations than for solitary queens. Within associations of equally heavy queens, mortality significantly increased with the queens' body mass. In contrast, mortality of solitary queens did not significantly depend on body mass. Early mortality was significantly more frequent in associations of queens of random initial mass than in associations of equally heavy queens. Altogether these results demonstrate that queen phenotype differentially affects early queen mortality depending on the social environment, and suggest that reproductive competition rather than starvation is the main cause of mortality in multiple-queen associations.

TI Woodpigeons nesting in association with hobby falcons: advantages and
   choice rules
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID COLONIES; SUBBUTEO; SUCCESS
AB Many bird species nest in close association with other bolder and more aggressive birds which provide protection against nest predators. The woodpigeons, Columba palumbus, that nest in poplar plantations in Northern Italy are found almost exclusively clumped around hobby, Falco subbuteo, nests. Woodpigeons settle in the area and build their nests after the hobby has started nesting. We carried out experiments with dummy nests and observations on woodpigeon nests. Dummy woodpigeon nests placed near a hobby's nest suffered less depredation by hooded crows, Corvus corone comix, than those placed far from it. A logistic regression analysis showed that three variables, hobby nesting stage, distance from the hobby's nest and the hobby's aggressiveness, influenced the probability of nest predation. The degree of protection varied during the hobby's nesting period and was highest when chicks were in the nest. The hobby's aggressiveness against intruders varied both between and within individuals during different nesting phases. The predation rate of dummy nests associated with the falcon was negatively correlated with the ag,aggressiveness score of the hobby during the 6 days of dummy nest exposure. Observations on real nests showed that woodpigeons selected hobbies that had a high fledging success, and a more vigorous defensive behaviour. Clues that would allow woodpigeons to choose the best protector may be early nesting by the hobby and its aggressiveness. Hobbies preyed on adult woodpigeons, but the risk incurred by the woodpigeons was low compared with the very high risk of nest predation in this area.

AB Linear habitat elements (corridors) may be important for species survival if they promote dispersal between fragments of suitable habitat, although there is little understanding of the behavioural basis for their use. I conducted experiments to determine how the movement of an arboreal habitat specialist species (the dormouse, Muscardinus avellanarius) was affected by gaps in corridors (hedgerows) and the presence of food resources. Movement in noncorridor habitat were also assessed. Translocated dormice were clearly averse to crossing even narrow gaps in hedgerows and remained in hedgerows, rather than move into surrounding noncorridor habitat. Gaps are thus likely to constrain movement along habitat corridors. Dormice travelled further in a hedgerow lacking food resources, implying that lack of food may (within an animal's fasting endurance);actually promote movement. Although strongly arboreal, dormice were able to locomote rapidly through noncorridor habitat (a grass held). Noncorridor habitat thus does not represent a complete barrier to movements of at least 100 m. The results imply that appropriately managed hedgerows (without gaps) may play an important role as corridors in the dispersal of dormice between woodlands.

ID GROUP-SIZE; BEHAVIOR; PATTERNS; MAMMALS; PREY
AB Sympatric marsupial carnivore (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae) species experience different levels of risk of predation and competition as a consequence of different body size and feeding adaptations. The small eastern quoll, Dasyurus viverrinus, is preyed upon by owls and is aggressively displaced from carcasses by its larger competitor and potential predator, the Tasmanian devil, Sarcophilus laniarius. Devils have no known predators but this specialized scavenger experiences intense intraspecific competition. I studied the vigilance behaviour of individuals of these species feeding on carcasses. (1) Eastern quells were more vigilant in the presence than in the absence of devils, suggesting that their vigilance functions to detect predators/competitors. (2) Devils showed a decrease in vigilance with increasing body size and age, and a trend towards a decrease with increasing group size. These are the same patterns expected if vigilance was in response to predation risk, although devils have no predators. Vigilance behaviour did not change in the presence of eastern quells, suggesting that vigilance is not directed towards interspecific competitors. (3) As expected from their greater risk of predation and injury from a larger competitor, eastern quells appeared to invest more in vigilance than devils did: they used vigilance postures that gave better visibility but disrupted feeding more.

AB In the common goby, Pomatoschistus microps (Pisces, Gobiidae), males build nests under mussel shells where they care for the eggs until hatching. To investigate why male common gobies cannibalize their own eggs (filial cannibalism), we conducted a feeding experiment. Males given little food ate from their eggs more often than males given food in excess. However, males given mussel meat in excess did not eat more of their eggs than males fed with both mussel meat in excess and goby eggs. This may suggest that male common gobies cannibalize their eggs to obtain energy rather than essential nutrients lacking in other diets. Moreover, males ate their whole clutch if it was exceptionally small regardless of food treatment, suggesting that males stop investing in their clutch if its reproductive value is less;than the cost of guarding it. Thus, whole clutch cannibalism and partial clutch cannibalism seem to be governed by different factors. Furthermore, poorly built nests were associated with starved males, suggesting that nest concealing is costly. There was an association between how well the nest was built and partial clutch filial cannibalism, suggesting that the appearance of the nest may indicate the condition of the male, and thus the risk of filial cannibalism.

AB We studied the consequences of monogamy and polygyny for male and female lapwings at a site in northern England between 1993 and 1995. Males and females differed in breeding behaviour, and thus the pattern of reproductive investment: males contributed less time than females to the care of their offspring and more time to mating behaviour. We argue that this has resulted from sexual selection. Reproductive behaviour was similar in monogamous and polygynous individuals of both sexes. Male mating success was related to territory size, with males on the largest territories gaining more females. Polygynous male lapwings reared on average between 58 and 100% more chicks each year than monogamous males because of fewer complete breeding failures; between-year return rates of males to the area were similar. This would result in a strong advantage in terms of lifetime reproductive success for polygynous male lapwings. The seasonal breeding success of polygynous females was marginally, but not significantly, lower than that of monogamous females.

AB Mullerian mimicry has traditionally been thought to benefit both unpalatable mimic and model species but recently its existence has been questioned. Even if both mimic and model species are unpalatable, they are unlikely to be equally unpalatable. It has been argued that the more unpalatable species will suffer a cost of increased predation because the presence of the more palatable mimic will increase its perceived palatability (by the predator), similar to that experienced by a model in Batesian mimicry. Yet, previous models of Mullerian mimicry have assumed that a predator can discriminate perfectly between available prey. We argue that this is not the case and that discrimination error is an important factor in determining the nature of mimetic relationships. Using computer simulations we show that the nature of a mimetic relationship will depend on the trade-off between the cost of an increase in perceived palatability and the benefits of a reduction in predator discrimination error. We show that mimicry can be unequivocally Mullerian, with both species benefiting, and propose that palatability should no longer be used as the sole defining characteristic of a mimetic relationship.

AB We studied state-dependent feeding behaviour of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, during several trials of sequential encounters with 6-mm and 8-mm Asellus aquaticus prey. We used stomach fullness (the number of prey eaten previously) as an indicator for state, which we assumed to affect motivation for feeding. Dummy variable regression was used to study how the per trial energy consumption, the number of events experienced, feeding efficiency and the average time spent on each accepted prey depended on trial number, day and fish. A clear individual variability was found, Feeding behaviour was strongly related to the individual's recent feeding history (within a day). Legit regression models showed that the decision to accept or reject a prey encountered depended on the size of the fish as well as its state (stomach fullness). Although limited, our results demonstrate pronounced heterogeneity in feeding behaviour among individual fish. We discuss this phenomenon in the broader context of population regulatory mechanisms.

ID MOTOR-ACTIVITY LEVEL; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ENERGY
AB There has been a long-standing debate regarding the functions of play during childhood. An important, but neglected, first step in this debate entails documenting the costs associated with play. In this study we analysed energetic costs (expressed in terms of caloric expenditure) associated with physical play in four field experiments of play in primary schoolchildren. Experiment 1 established the concurrent validity of an observational check list to estimate caloric expenditure of children's physical play. Experiment 2 compared caloric expenditure of the play (defined as all behaviour exhibited during play time) for two age groups of children during playtime outdoors and during indoor sedentary activity; caloric expenditure of outdoor activity was greater and was significantly correlated with ambient temperature. In experiment 3, children were observed, during indoor play to control for the influence of ambient temperature. Outdoor physical Flay was more energetically costly than indoor physical play. In experiment 4, children's behaviour was observed outdoors and caloric expenditure for play, games and other activities was compared. Physical play was more costly than other forms of behaviour and games. Estimates of total energetic costs of play ranged from 6 to 15%. Results are discussed in terms of the relatively low caloric costs of play. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When juvenile oystercatchers, Haematopus ostralegus, first arrived on the wintering grounds in August and September, they regularly stole mussels, Mytilus edulis, from other, mainly older, oystercatchers. By October, however, juveniles stole far fewer mussels and found almost all their mussels independently for themselves on the mussel bed. Although stealing a mussel was always less profitable than taking a mussel from the mussel bed, a simple rate-maximizing optimality model showed that, in August and September, juveniles increased both their net and gross rates of energy intake by stealing because they were rather inefficient at foraging for themselves. By October, their greater efficiency at finding good quality mussels, combined with the increased resistance of potential victims to kleptoparasitic attacks, resulted in higher intake rates if juveniles stopped stealing mussels and took mussels only from the mussel bed.

TI A model for the evolution of reproductive skew without reproductive
   suppression
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIETIES
AB Reproductive skew is a measure of the way breeding is distributed among the members of an animal society or group. Up to now, explanations of patterns of skew have been limited to one particular model, which assumes that a single dominant has full control over the distribution of subordinate reproduction. If this control is incomplete or absent, however, unsanctioned breeding by subordinate females will increase the total number of young produced. Here I present a new model for the evolution of skew that considers the effect of brood size on the inclusive fitness of dominants and subordinates. By augmenting brood size, a subordinate female reduces the per capita fitness of a dominant's offspring, so the net benefits of producing young are lower for related subordinates. I consider the stable level of skew when both dominant and subordinate attempt to maximize their inclusive fitness under two conditions: (1) when the dominant is unable to anticipate that a subordinate will add to her brood; and (2) the dominant does anticipate subordinate reproduction and can respond by adjusting her own brood size. In the first case, the model predicts that reproductive skew will increase with relatedness between breeders, because related subordinates are selected to add fewer young to the dominant's brood. In the second case, the dominant's optimal response to the presence of a second breeder exaggerates the relationship between relatedness and skew: dominants should produce more young when breeding with related compared with unrelated subordinates.

AB Honey bees, Apis mellifera, use short-lived repellent scent marks to distinguish and reject flowers that have recently been visited by themselves or by siblings, and so save time that would otherwise be spent in probing empty flowers. Conversely, both honey bees and bumblebees, Bombus spp., can mark rewarding flowers with scent marks that promote probing by conspecifics. We examined detection of recently visited flowers in a mixed community of bumblebees foraging on comfrey, Symphytum officinale, in southern England. When foraging among inflorescences on a plant, three abundant species of Bombus probed fewer inflorescences more than once than would be expected from random foraging. Bees frequently encountered inflorescences but departed without probing them for nectar. Examination of the incidence of such rejections in the two most common species, B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, revealed that the low incidence of multiple probing visits was due to two factors: bees both foraged systematically and selectively rejected inflorescences that they had previously visited. When presented with inflorescences of known history, bees selectively rejected those that had been recently visited by themselves or by conspecifics compared with randomly selected inflorescences. They were also able to distinguish inflorescences that had been visited by other Bombus species. Bees were unable to distinguish and reject inflorescences from which the nectar had been removed artificially. We conclude that these Bombus species are probably using scent marks left by previous visitors. The significance of deposition and detection of interspecific scent marks for competitive interactions between species is discussed. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We tested two hypotheses regarding the effect of the social mating system on extra-pair paternity in an Illinois population of house wrens, Troglodytes aedon. According to the genetic-quality hypothesis, polygynous males are of higher quality than monogamists, and monogamously paired females, in an attempt to obtain high-quality genes, should have a greater proportion of extra-pair nestlings in their nests than polygynously paired females. According to the trade-off hypothesis, polygynists, with temporally overlapping nests, will have a greater proportion of extra-pair nestlings in their nests than monogamists, because polygynists have difficulty guarding one or both of their social mates. DNA fingerprinting revealed that extra-pair paternity was most frequent in secondary nests of polygynists. The proportion of secondary broods with extra-pair nestlings increased with the temporal overlap of polygynists' nests, although this trend was not significant. Both results are consistent with the trade-off hypothesis but not with the genetic-quality hypothesis. We did not address the effects of genetic quality on male success at siring nestlings in the nests of other males. Although the trade-off hypothesis focuses on male mate guarding, female behaviours may also affect frequencies of extra-pair paternity. Secondary females may compensate for reduced male defence by engaging in extra-pair copulations with neighbours to reduce the likelihood that neighbours destroy their nests. Thus, in house wrens, female participation in extra-pair copulations in combination with male mate-guarding constraints may generate higher levels of extra-pair paternity in secondary broods than in primary polygynous or monogamous broods.

AB The hypothesis of kin recognition by phenotype matching predicts that relatives can be identified without previous contact, and/or that cues used for recognition can be learned indirectly from a third but related individual. This hypothesis was tested in the field using 22 beaver, Castor canadensis, families. Individually identifiable beavers were provided with a two-way choice between two experimental scent mounds, one of which was scented with the anal gland secretion (AGS) from an unfamiliar sibling of the test subjects, the other with AGS from an unfamiliar non-relative. Beavers showed less strong territorial responses to AGS from their siblings than to that from non-relatives. The mates of the test subjects, which were not related to, or familiar with, either of the AGS donors, also responded less strongly to the AGS from their mates' siblings than to that from other unfamiliar non-relatives. This discrimination was not shown when castoreum samples were tested instead of AGS. Therefore, it was concluded that (1) information about kinship in the beaver is coded in the AGS but not in the castoreum, (2) the mechanism of phenotype matching is used in beaver sibling recognition, and (3) the cue used in phenotype matching can be learned and used for recognition of related individuals by an unrelated individual.

AB Following aggressive interactions, dominant female baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, occasionally grunt to their victims. To examine the effect of these apparently reconciliatory grunts on victims' subsequent behaviour, a series of playback experiments was designed to mimic reconciliation. Victims were played their opponents' grunts in the minutes immediately following a fight and then observed for half an hour. After hearing these grunts, victims approached their former opponents and also tolerated their opponents' approaches at significantly higher rates than they did under control conditions. They were also supplanted by their opponents at significantly lower rates. By contrast, playbacks of control females' grunts did not influence victims' behaviour. Playbacks of reconciliatory grunts did not increase the rate at which opponents approached or initiated friendly interactions with their former victims. Playbacks of reconciliatory grunts, therefore, appeared to influence victims', but not opponents', perception of recent events. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Baboons face a serious threat of predation from leopards, Panthera pardus, and lions, Panthera lea. Since trees and cliff faces provide safety from these predators, baboons might use such refuges in order to reduce predation risk. This hypothesis was explored in a study of four groups of chacma baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, in a desert population in Namibia (groups ranged between 22 and 55 individuals with one to six adult males). All baboons spent most of their time close by refuges and little time distant from them. This pattern was most accentuated among females in smaller groups. These females spent more time on refuges primarily as a result of greater refuge use during resting and grooming. This pattern was less clear during feeding and travelling, apparently owing to the constraints on refuge use imposed by the nature of these activities. A comparison of refuge use in high-risk and low-risk habitats (after the confounding effects of habitat-specific refuge availability had been removed) suggests that baboons might adopt one of two strategies in high-risk areas; if refuges are widespread they will use refuges more intensively, but if refuges are scarce they will adopt a time-minimizing strategy to leave the area as rapidly as possible. The baboons also increased their vigilance when refuges were distant. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that baboons use refuges to reduce predation risk.

AB This study reports developmental changes in the vocal signals produced by wild-caught pre-volant and volant Myotis lucifugus. Audio recordings were made from young animals (1-33 days old) and adults (over 1 year of age). The animals were removed from an attic maternity roost and studied individually in a room below. To stimulate flight-related behaviours, animals were released from a launching platform via a hinged floor, and their vocalizations were recorded as they approached a soft foam pad below. When the hinged floor opened, the youngest animals (1-4 days old) typically dropped onto the pad, but older animals either flapped their wings to achieve some horizontal displacement (> 4 days) or sustained horizontal flight (> 17 days). Vocalizations recorded under these conditions showed frequency modulation characteristic of adult echolocation sounds, even in animals as young as 4 days. Ontogenetic trends showed an increase in sound frequency, an increase in sound repetition rate and a decrease in sound duration as the animals matured. These data are discussed in the context of the development of echolocation behaviour in bats. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Enclosure and field trials were used to investigate the responses of hedgehogs, Erinaceus europaeus, to predator (badger, Meles meles) and non-predator odours. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) hedgehogs are capable of responding to badger odour; and (2) hedgehogs prefer not to forage in areas tainted with badger odour. In enclosure trials, hedgehogs almost exclusively avoided feeding at sites tainted with badger faeces in favour of sites tainted with non-predator faeces, and continued to avoid the previously badger-tainted site after 2 days, but got after 4. Field experiments with free-ranging hedgehogs showed a reduction in foraging effort in response to badger odour over periods of 5 and 30 min, but no evidence of site avoidance over a 24-h period. Lack of persistent avoidance of badger odour in the field was probably due to the costs of predator avoidance, which were negligible in the enclosure owing to the presence of an alternative superabundant food source.

AB Female pursuit of extra-pair copulations was investigated in a western population of red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus. Potential genetic benefits to females were considered in this study; potential material gains were examined in Gray (1997; Anim. Behav., 53, 625-639). In this population, females initiate courtship and copulation outside their social bond, and between 18 and 43% of all breeding females engaged in extra-pair copulations each breeding season. The peak of extra-pair copulation occurred 2 days before the first egg was laid and I day closer to egg laying compared to the peak of within-pair copulation, suggesting that extra-pair copulations conferred a genetic advantage to females. Females that copulated with extra-pair males improved their reproductive success by hatching a significantly greater proportion of eggs and hedging a significantly greater proportion of young than females that did not copulate with extra-pair males. Improved hatching success was probably due to female avoidance of temporary male sperm depletion. Improved hedging success resulted from significantly lower depredation rates of clutches laid by females that copulated with multiple males. In addition, a lower proportion of nestlings tended to starve in broods containing extra-pair fertilized offspring. I found no evidence that participation in extra-pair copulations was costly to females. Male aggression towards females was rare, and males were never observed chasing or force-copulating with a mate immediately following an extra-pair copulation. These results show that the selection pressure on females to engage in extra-pair copulations is strong, and they support new theories maintaining that extra-pair copulations are an important aspect of female reproductive success.

AB The ontogeny of orientation mechanisms in migratory birds involves a complex of programmed learning rules and calibrations between the several compasses used during migration. Visual information at sunset, especially the pattern of polarized skylight, provides a primary source of orientation information for night-migrating species. To examine the development of visual orientation mechanisms at sunset, hand-raised Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sanchwichensis, were given controlled experience with the clear daytime sky during the first 3 months of life. One group of birds saw the daytime sky only within an earth-strength magnetic field with magnetic north shifted 90 degrees clockwise to true east; a control group had similar exposure to the sky within a normal, unshifted magnetic field. Orientation tests were performed on clear evenings between the time of sunset and the first appearance of stars within a vertical magnetic field of normal earth intensity (no directional magnetic information). There was no difference in the orientation of the two groups: both showed southwestward orientation. Contrary to indications from earlier experiments, the visual orientation mechanism at sunset develops independently of magnetic directions and, in this context, is similar to the ontogeny of stellar orientation.

AB Female burrower bugs, Sehirus cinctus (Cydnidae), brood and provision their young. This study provides an integrative approach to insect parental behaviour by examining the influence of maternal experience on the maintenance and termination of maternal care. Intensity of care (maternal responsivity) was determined by assaying a subject's response to tactile disturbance and by measuring time spent in proximity to young. First-brood mothers were highly responsive until 3 days after their eggs hatched. Second-brood mothers, however, were only responsive until 1-2 days post-hatching. This effect was associated with differences in age and parity, but not experience, because second-brood females prevented from caring for their first group of eggs did not differ from females with previous maternal experience. To examine cues surrounding the termination of care, cross-fostering techniques were used to move the time of hatching such that it occurred either several days early (truncated brooding) or not at all (extended brooding). Females experiencing a 'premature' hatch showed immediate declines in responsivity following hatching. Extended brooders, which guarded viable but 'unhatching' eggs, remained highly responsive for 6 days after their own eggs would have hatched before terminating care. These findings suggest that internal processes and external cues interact to ensure that maternal care is of appropriate duration. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sex differences in African wild dog dispersal behaviour have been described variously as strongly female biased to unbiased. Dispersal from natal home ranges to reproductive home ranges was recorded over 5 years from eight study packs in a free-ranging population of wild dogs in northern Botswana. Analysis of sex differences in natal dispersal was based on (1) age of natal dispersers, (2) dispersing group size, and (3) natal dispersal distance. Dispersal distance was measured by (i) the distance between arithmetic centres of range locations, (ii) spatial association of reproductive and natal home ranges (contiguous versus disjunct), and (iii) pair-wise comparison of dispersal distances between males and females establishing a reproductive home range together. Males in this population dispersed later, in larger groups and further than females. These results contrast with earlier reports for wild dogs and show that females are the more spatially philopatric sex. This pattern of sex-biased dispersal is evaluated in relation to two current, alternative but not mutually exclusive hypotheses: inbreeding avoidance and competition for mating opportunities. All wild dogs of both sexes emigrated when in the presence of their opposite sex parent. Despite frequent opportunities, no dogs mated with close relatives (r greater than or equal to 0.5). The consequences of sex-biased dispersal in wild dogs are consistent with both hypotheses, but the competition for mating opportunities hypothesis is supported only within the context of dispersal behaviour indicative of close inbreeding avoidance.

AB The mating system of the sexual-asexual complex of sailfin mollies, Poecilia latipinna, and Amazon mollies, P. formosa, depends on the close proximity of individuals in aggregations or shoals because P. formosa is gynogenetic (that is, sperm only initiate embryogenesis but do not contribute genetic material) and must be inseminated by male P. latipinna. Furthermore, female P. latipinna copy the mate choice of female P. formosa with the result that male P. latipinna become more attractive to conspecific females when they mate with P. formosa. Mate copying of heterospecifics has not been reported in other systems, and in mollies it could result from the inability of females to discriminate species. In experiments both P. formosa and P. latipinna females preferred to associate with a conspecific than a heterospecific, but preferred a larger heterospecific group to a smaller conspecific one. Females can thus discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific females, so that heterospecific mate copying is not a result of mistaken identity. Females preferred to associate with conspecifics, but this preference was overridden by preference for larger groups although the threshold differed between the two species.

AB Nest construction by the wasp Polybia occidentalis involves the coordination of three groups of specialized workers; Wood-pulp foragers deliver their loads to builders, who use it to construct the nest. Water foragers transfer water to both pulp foragers and builders, who use it to keep the pulp moist during handling. During a round of nest construction or repair, the levels of activity in the three groups are kept in balance, minimizing queuing delays during transfer of these materials. If the operation is perturbed, balance between the groups is restored, indicating that the system self-regulates. The aim of this study was to determine the sources of information used by each of the three task groups to adjust its level of activity to those of the others. Colonies' responses to experimentally-induced increases and decreases in the flow of each material during nest repair were videotaped in the field in Costa Rica. The results showed that only the builders received information about the nest damage directly from the nest. Feedback between builders determines the level of building activity, which in turn sets the size of the entire repair operation. The level of pulp-foraging activity was determined by information about demand for pulp received by pulp foragers from builders. Water foragers similarly adjusted their group's activity rate in response to feedback received from pulp foragers and builders about the demand for water. Such a chained flow of information from one task group to the next, in reverse order of material flow, allows each task group to fine-tune the size of its effort to that of the group it serves, enabling the whole system to respond efficiently to perturbations.

AB A number of recent models of optimal paternal investment predict that males should alter their investment in offspring in response to changes in paternity or certainty of paternity. One way in which it has been suggested that male birds might do this would be to recognize their own offspring and to discriminate in their favour. Despite frequent statements that nothing is known about whether birds possess this ability or whether they exercise it, there is a considerable body of evidence suggesting that males do not discriminate against non-related offspring. This evidence is reviewed and an attempt made to explain the absence of kin discrimination in males under these circumstances by considering potential mechanisms of kin discrimination. Although there is selection for males to discriminate in favour of their own offspring it is argued that they are unable to do so because of conflicts between the male, female and offspring over signalling identity, and because the circumstances associated with extra-pair paternity disrupt the operation of some mechanisms. Male birds might possess behavioural 'rules of thumb' which lead to behaviour that appears similar to offspring recognition, but the sophistication of such rules is likely to be limited by the stochasticity inherent in fertilization.

AB The present study was designed to describe maternal behaviour and body weight regulation during lactation, and its consequences for the growth of the pups, of darns from house mouse, Mus domesticus, lines bidirectionally selected for aggression, both when caring for their own pups and when caring for cross-fostered pups. Mothers from the aggressive line (SAL) nursed and groomed their pups more, and rested less alone, than mothers from the non-aggressive line (LAL). Body weight regulation during lactation differed markedly between the two lines. SAL mothers kept their body weight at a relatively stable level until the last phase of lactation, when they lost weight. LAL mothers showed the more generally observed pattern of weight development: a steady increase in body weight, followed by a stabilization and a rapid fall during the last 3-4 days of lactation. Pup weight and growth rate were not influenced by these differences in behaviour and physiology of the darns. Maternal behaviour of SAL dams was not affected by cross-fostering. LAL dams nursed cross-fostered SAL pups more than their own pups, without reaching the nursing level of SAL darns. In neither line was body weight regulation of the dams affected by cross-fostering. The different patterns in maternal effort imply a significant difference in the early experience of genetically aggressive and non-aggressive mice.

   PREFERENCES
AB Sexual selection, and thus the evolution of both female mating preferences and preferred male traits, may be constrained by costs associated with mate choice. Recent theoretical models predict that female preference should decrease with increasing costs of mate choice such as predation risk. This general hypothesis was tested experimentally by presenting individual female guppies, Poecilia reticulata, originating from two Trinidadian populations with different predation regimes, with a choice of paired males (differing mainly in colour pattern) as potential mates in both the absence and presence of a cichlid fish predator that naturally co-occurs in one of these populations. Moreover, any reduction in female preference under risk was predicted to be positively correlated with the level of predation intensity occurring in their respective populations. In an experiment in which only the female could see the nearby predator, females from the high-predation population (Quare River) significantly reduced both their overall level of sexual activity and their preference for a particular male (most commonly the more colourful male) in the presence of the predator. In contrast, the sexual activity level and mating preference of females from the low-predation population (Paria River) were unaffected by the apparent threat of predation. Observed changes in female sexual activity level and mating preference could not have been mediated by any change in male behaviour when the predator was present, because the males could neither see or smell the predator nearby. In a corollary experiment in which both males and females from the risk-sensitive Quare River population could freely interact with one another and see the predator, females significantly reduced their preference for the more brightly coloured male in the presence of the predator, irrespective of predator-mediated changes in male courtship behaviour. These results are best explained by a reduction in female preference under increased apparent risk of predation, and are consistent with the general hypothesis that female mate choice in the guppy is potentially costly in terms of an increased risk of mortality due to predation and that females from different populations are differentially sensitive to this risk when assessing and choosing potential mates. Therefore, predators may exert direct selection on female mate choice in certain natural populations of the guppy. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Experimental studies on social learning in animals have commonly centred on the psychological processes responsible for learning, ana neglected social processes as potential influences on both the likelihood of social learning and the type of information that can be acquired socially. A model relating social learning to social dynamics among members of a group is presented. Three key hypotheses of the model are (1) behavioural coordination in time and/or space supports the process of social learning; (2) different kinds of coordination differentially support acquisition of different kinds of information; and (3) the various forms of behavioural coordination will be differentially affected by social dynamics. Several predictions relating inter-individual and group differences in social dynamics to social learning that follow from these hypotheses are presented.

AB Bird song is thought to function in territory defence and mate attraction. This 'dual function hypothesis for song in male chipping sparrows was tested using two approaches. Males of this species each sing a single, simple, individually distinct song type. It has been hypothesized that selection should favour this type of song structure when song functions primarily in territorial defence. First, male responses to playbacks of songs of territorial neighbours and strangers at the boundary of a subject's territory were compared. If song functions primarily in territory defence, theory and previous studies suggest that males should respond more strongly to strangers than to neighbours. Although males did respond, there was no difference in the response to neighbour and stranger playbacks either before or after the onset of incubation. Second, the pattern of song output was examined during different stages of the breeding cycle. Song output declined to near zero after pairing, but resurged dramatically when males lost mates. These results suggest that chipping sparrow song functions primarily in mate attraction, contrary to predictions based on song structure. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Studies of auditory distance perception in songbirds have shown that the overall degradation of songs during atmospheric propagation can be used to estimate the distance of the singer (called ranging). Natural sound degradation, however, incorporates several potential auditory distance cues that are not always equally available. This study investigated whether Carolina wrens, Thryothorus ludovicianus, can separately use reverberation and high-frequency attenuation to estimate the distance of a singer. In response to playbacks broadcast from within a subject's territory but at least 40 m away from its singing location, subjects approached more frequently and responded more intensely to playback of clear (unaltered) songs than to playback of reverberated, high-frequency attenuated, or naturally degraded songs. The results indicate that Carolina wrens can use reverberation and high-frequency attenuation separately to assess the distance of a singing conspecific. This ability could be an adaptation that enables them to defend territories efficiently in habitats with different acoustical properties. In addition, the ability to use several cues to assess auditory distance is likely to increase the accuracy of ranging by pooling information acquired in different ways.

ID MELOSPIZA-MELODIA; EASTERN PHOEBE; BIRD SONG; ACQUISITION; PHONOLOGY
AB When adult songbirds sing, movements of the beak and other elements of the vocal tract are closely coordinated with the activity of the syrinx. The physical configuration of the vocal tract affects the tonal quality of sounds originating at the syrinx, and coordination between vocal tract movements and syringeal activity is thought to be necessary for the production of pure-tonal song. The ontogeny of this coordination in laboratory-reared song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, was examined. Developmental changes were quantified in (1) the acoustic structure of song notes, as measured by spectrogram cross-correlation, (2) the magnitude of beak movements during song, (3) the correlation between beak movements and acoustic frequency, and (4) the tonal quality of song. Each variable changed significantly over the course of song development, but at different rates. Note acoustic structure achieved adult-like form midway through song development, but increased use and coordination of beak movements were not observed until later stages of development. The late development of coordinated beak movements appears to correspond with the development of tonal quality. This finding suggests that the coordination of vocal tract movements with syringeal activity is delayed in ontogeny. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

TI PATTERNS AND CONSEQUENCES OF EGG DESTRUCTION AMONG JOINT-NESTING ACORN
   WOODPECKERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID RECIPROCAL ALTRUISM
AB Reproductive competition among joint-nesting female acorn woodpeckers, Melanerpes formicivorus, culminates in the removal and subsequent destruction of eggs laid by co-breeders. Females destroying eggs gain both by synchronizing egg laying and by having more of their own eggs incubated in the final clutch. Here results are summarized based on observations of 19 joint nests. Egg destruction accounted for the loss of 38% of all eggs laid. Either or both joint-nesting females destroyed eggs at the same nest, and a female that destroyed eggs during one nesting attempt sometimes had her own eggs destroyed during the next. Egg destruction was not moderated by the genetic relatedness of joint-nesting females and was apparently unrelated to behavioural dominance, but substantially lowered per female success of three- compared with two-female nests. Females did not discriminate between eggs; thus egg destruction ended when both females laid normal eggs simultaneously in the nest cavity. However, egg destruction ended most frequently when a female did not destroy an egg laid by her co-breeder 1 day prior to laying her own first egg. Such failures to destroy eggs entail short-term fitness costs that may be compensated by the potential for reciprocity across breeding attempts. Abnormally small 'runt' eggs, rarely found in other species of birds, were commonly laid as the first egg of the clutches of one or both joint-nesting females. The laying of runt eggs may allow females to destroy normal eggs laid simultaneously by their co-breeders. Egg destruction is a major constraint on the degree to which females nest jointly. More generally, egg destruction and its associated behaviour patterns demonstrate that reproductive interference can be as complex and destructive within groups of close relatives as between unrelated individuals.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID PLUMAGE COLOR; GREAT TITS; PREFERENCES; CHOICE
AB In sexually dimorphic birds, morphological characteristics are assumed to play an important role in conspecific sex recognition. In spite of the limited evidence, most studies done so far support this assumption. Less attention has been given to the question of how adult birds may have acquired the ability to discriminate between the sexes. This study investigates the relationship between the early experience of young birds and their later competence in differentiating between male and female conspecifics. Young white zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were reared by white parents. The white morph of this species lacks all sexually dimorphic markings, except for a difference in the intensity of the red coloration of the bill. Bill colour of the parents was manipulated by applying nail polish. As adults, males and females were tested for their preference in a series of two-choice tests. Males showed a clear preference for birds with the same bill colour as their mother, irrespective of the sex of the stimulus birds. Females, on the other hand, preferred males to females, but did not differentiate on bill colour. It can be concluded that in zebra finch males sex recognition is guided by morphological characteristics that have acquired their signal value during rearing. For females, other factors, such as behavioural cues, appear to be most important for sex recognition. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Since 1981, the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has dominated studies of non-kin cooperation. Alternative models have received relatively little attention. The simplest alternative is mutualism, in which mutual cooperation always pays best. The behaviour of three pairs of blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, was tested in precisely controlled iterated mutualism and Prisoner's Dilemma games. Although the jays readily cooperated in the mutualism game, cooperation neither developed nor persisted in a Prisoner's Dilemma. No empirical justification was found for the status of the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma as the basic paradigm of non-kin cooperation. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB A model of patch choice, in which individuals choose between two sites with different continuous input rates, is presented. Individuals differ in their competitive ability and may not perceive small resource differences between these patches. The model is historical, in that the individuals are added to the system sequentially, building up a complete system. Including this historical aspect leads to a different result from that derived using equilibrium-centred models. Monte Carlo simulations of the model show that (1) the historical development of a distribution of animals significantly affects its final form, and (2) an equilibrium distribution may not be reached until long after all individuals are present. When individuals have different competitive abilities, the 'free' assumption of the ideal free distribution (IFD) is violated, giving rise to a distribution we call the ideal competitive-differences distribution (ICDD). As has been previously noted, several different ICDD outcomes are possible in a given situation, but our historical perspective suggests that deviations from the habitat-matching prediction of the IFD (usually undermatchings) are much more likely than previously realized. A widely cited example of the ICDD, for instance, fails to give the IFD-mimicking habitat-matching distribution as its most likely outcome. Lastly, perceptual limits in conjunction with competitive differences result in mismatches with the ICDD. It is suggested, therefore, that experimental results are likely to undermatch resources compared with predictions from both the IFD and the ICDD.

Drosophila planitibia from Maul is the presumed ancestor of the other two species, which occur partly sympatrically on the island of Hawaii. Drosophila silvestris is split into two morphologically different populations. The behaviour of the flies of these species/populations in successful and unsuccessful courtships was investigated. The most crucial differences between species were found in female responses (standing and walking) to male circling and in male responses to female standing and walking. Differences between D. silvestris strains were small compared with species differences. There were major differences between successful and unsuccessful matings in the response patterns most characteristic of different species. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Social interactions among Nauphoeta cinerea (Dictyoptera: Blaberidae) are mediated primarily through pheromonal signals. Males produce a three-component pheromone blend that attracts females and influences the close-range interactions between the sexes. Ontogenetic changes were documented in the quantity of pheromone produced by socially isolated males that ranged in age from adult emergence to 50 days after emergence. Pheromone quantity paralleled the development of male attractiveness to females, male sexual competence and male agonistic behaviour. Although males are sexually mature at 6 days of age, the quantity of 2-methylthiazolidine and 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol in their glands continued to increase beyond that age, while the quantity of 3-hydroxy-2-butanone reached a plateau by 4 days of age. The quantity of the former two components returned to a baseline level after long-term isolation. In addition to ontogenetic changes, social experience altered the quantity of pheromone produced. Both winning in male-male agonistic encounters and mating apparently stimulate the production and/or release of male pheromone. The quantities of 2-methylthiazolidine and 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol were reduced in the glands of dominant males but not subordinate males. Although the quantities changed, the ratio of 2-methylthiazolidine to 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol was not different between dominant and subordinate males. All males showed reduced quantities of 2-methylthiazolidine and 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol 48 h after mating but showed no change in 3-hydroxy-2-butanone or the ratio of 2-methylthiazolidine to 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol. Potential functional integration for two of the three pheromonal components is suggested by the similar pattern of synthesis and depletion of 2-methylthiazolidine and 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol. The unique pattern of synthesis and lack of depletion of 3-hydroxy-2-butanone suggests there may be an independent role for this compound. The differential depletion of these components suggests that the active release of the pheromone by N. cinerea males may be a conditional strategy, with the specific tactic depending an previous social experiences.

AB The ability of sheep, Ovis aries, to discriminate between sheep, humans and other animals on the basis of facial and vocal cues was tested in an enclosed Y-maze. Pairs of faces or voices were presented which had a clear differential significance for the sheep (i.e. sheep versus human, dog or an unfamiliar breed or species). Some Clun Forest and Dalesbred sheep could actively distinguish (>75% choice) between different faces, with the best performances being seen for sheep versus human faces (the sheep face being preferred to that of the human). Other animals showed pronounced position preferences in the maze whatever faces were shown although they approached sheep faster than other faces, suggesting that they could discriminate between them. Dalesbred, but not Clun Forest, sheep could also discriminate between sheep and human vocalizations alone in the maze. For both breeds, combining appropriate sight and sound stimuli did not significantly enhance performance although mismatching them reduced it. In a further experiment on animals that performed at more than 75% choice criterion in the maze, inverting the faces, turning them to profile or masking the eyes all significantly reduced performance in discriminating between sheep and human faces. In another experiment, Clun Forest ewes could also distinguish between the faces of male and female breed members. During anoestrus they preferred the faces of females and when they were in oestrus they preferred those of rams. Overall, these results suggest that sheep can use facial cues to discriminate between different species, breeds and male and female members of the same breed. They also show that discriminatory performance is influenced by orientation, the presence of eyes and, to some extent, vocal cues.

AB Experiments with green stink bugs in the laboratory demonstrated that females choosing between males preferred to mate with the larger of the two, when the confounding effect of direct physical male-male competition was removed. Similarly, males preferred to mate first with the larger of two females. A significant positive relationship between female body size and fecundity was found. Thus the adaptive significance of male choice for large females is a direct reproductive gain while the advantage to females choosing large males is less clear.

AB The banner-tailed kangaroo rat, Dipodomys spectabilis, advertises its territorial ownership with individual footdrumming signatures used in neighbour recognition. The aim of this study was to examine how social experience influences development of the footdrumming signatures of newly dispersed juveniles and older adults. Over 5000 footdrumming signatures were recorded and analysed for 101 different animals over a 7-year period from 1986 to 1992 in which population densities fluctuated. During these years, the footdrumming signatures of individuals differed in structure within neighbourhoods, but those of non-neighbours overlapped when population densities were high. In general, the footdrumming signatures of juveniles varied more than adults, but both juveniles and adults changed elements of the signal if they changed territories, which occurred more frequently at higher population densities. Kangaroo rats, therefore, can modify their footdrumming signatures over their lifetime in response to changes in the social environment. The rat that moves into a new neighbourhood adjusts its footdrumming signal to differ from its new neighbours.

AB Field observations have shown that there are inter-population differences in the sexual behaviour of male guppies in Trinidad. The greatest differences are between guppies that co-exist with different predators. Here, the sexual behaviour of male Trinidadian guppies was studied to determine to what extent these differences in behaviour evolved in response to selection pressure by the predators, to what extent they are an environmentally induced response to aspects of guppy biology that covary with the predators and to what extent these factors interact. To do this, male offspring of guppies from different predator localities were reared in the laboratory under conditions designed to mimic natural variation in wild populations. Two aspects of young male guppies' social environment were manipulated: (1) population demography and (2) origin (predator locality) of conspecifics. Heredity (origin of the males' parents) was responsible for only a small proportion of the variation in sexual behaviour; social environment had a much greater influence. Also, inter-population variation was found in the degree to which a male's behaviour was affected by demographic conditions and in the relationship between a male's body size and his rate of courtship. Male sexual behaviour also varied with male age and with the origin of the female being courted. Various components of male sexual behaviour (e.g. courtship, mating attempts) were influenced to different degrees by the factors examined. Therefore, inter-population differences in male sexual behaviour result from complex interactions between heritable factors, social environment, male age and male size.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID INTRASPECIFIC AGGRESSION; AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR; TIME COURSE; RATS
AB Earlier studies have found that priming a resident female hamster by allowing it to attack a conspecific intruder transiently reduced the latency of its attack on a second (probe) intruder. The present series of experiments showed that the time the subject spent in contact with each intruder prior to attack revealed this priming effect more clearly than did the conventional total elapsed time measure. The inference that stimuli encountered during the first few minutes of intruder exploration would heighten the subject's aggressive arousal was confirmed in experiments showing that increasing exposure to an anaesthetized intruder from 0 to 90 s systematically reduced subsequent attack latency. Ninety seconds of contact with an anaesthetized intruder just prior to testing on a pair of priming and probe trials significantly reduced the priming effect. However, such exposure may not reproduce the full reduction in latency that follows an overt attack. Consecutive priming and probe attack latencies were uncorrelated even though the latter is routinely shorter than the former. Attacks were therefore modelled as stochastic events. Standard log survivor analysis suggested that attack probabilities increase to an asymptote during both priming and probe trials. A novel theta(t) transformation of the data showed more clearly that the priming effect results from a probability of attack which starts at a higher level on probe trials and rises to asymptote faster.

AB In monogamous and polyandrous species of primates it has been suggested that reproductive status is concealed rather than communicated. The generally monogamous pygmy marmoset shows few, if any, observable signs of ovulation, but it is still possible that the female's reproductive state is communicated to the male. The sexual behaviour of 10 pairs of captive pygmy marmosets was observed during 30-min tests for 60 consecutive days after pairing. Urine was collected daily from females for the measurement of luteinizing hormone and oestradiol. Sexual behaviour occurred throughout the ovarian cycle of 36-37 days and the conception rate was 83%. Female marmosets did not alter rates of scent-marking across the ovarian cycle, however, male marmosets showed significantly more responses to female anogenital scents and increased rates of mounts, piloerection and staring (courtship behaviour) during their mate's peri-ovulatory period. In addition, female aggression towards the male was observed only during non-ovulatory periods suggesting that an absence of aggressive behaviour may serve as a cue to ovulation. This is the first evidence that the female pygmy marmoset's reproductive state is communicated directly to the male, suggesting that qualitative changes in female olfactory cues or decreased female aggression can affect male sexual behaviour.

AB In contrast to brood-reducing species, pigeons, Columba livia, that rear broods in a food-poor environment allocate parental feedings equitably. This results in non-differential, growth of squabs and maintenance of brood size. The behavioural mechanisms underlying the frequency and allocation of parental feedings were examined in the present set of studies. Observations of undisturbed nests (experiment 1) showed that regurgitations were allocated in proportion to amount of begging. In experiment 2 squabs were experimentally fed or sham-fed prior to test sessions. Food-deprived squabs spent more time begging and received more regurgitations than experimentally fed squabs. A final experiment examined the relative importance of squabs versus parents in limiting the total number of regurgitations received by individual squabs. Squabs were deprived of food and/or parents were deprived of the opportunity to feed squabs prior to test sessions. The total number of regurgitations squabs received early in the nestling period was limited by squab capacity to ingest food, whereas parents played the more important role later in the nestling period. The results show that begging plays a role in intra-brood competition, and that the pigeon's strategy of brood maintenance is based on parents' distributing food in proportion to hunger level.

AB Male meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, were tested with unrelated pups to determine the social factors that affect the initiation of paternal responsiveness and the inhibition of infanticide. Adult males were initially more responsive to pups if they had been reared as neonates with their fathers rather than with unfamiliar males. Decreased aggression and facilitation of paternal responsiveness occurred most reliably after extensive exposure to pups, even if exposure had occurred more than 2 months before testing. Unlike house mice, neither copulation nor exposure to females enhanced male responsiveness to pups. Given that male meadow voles only nest with females and young during the colder parts of the breeding season, it may be adaptive for paternal responsiveness to be triggered by pup exposure, rather than by some aspect of earlier contact with the female.

Male P. occidentalis discriminated against heterospecific relative to conspecific females, while male P. protodice displayed no interspecific mate choice. In both species, intraspecific male mating preferences may be adaptive, and in P. occidentalis may oppose sexual selection generated by female choice.

AB Hunting behaviour is described for 18 individually identified fish of the piscivorous cichlid Lepidiolamprologus profundicola in Lake Tanganyika. When hunting, individuals of this species aim at, dash at and try to capture various kinds of prey fish. Most individuals exhibited only a few of nine documented hunting techniques, each of which was related to a particular microhabitat. These specializations were consistent during periods of more than 4 months. The hunting specializations of each fish were not a simple reflection of the relative abundance of the potential hunting places that each predator encountered; they were not always ascribable to intraspecific competition or phenotypes (size, sex, colour patterns); nor were they associated with specific prey species. Capture success rate was low, and failures to capture were due to rapid flight of the prey fish. It is suggested that individual specialized foraging behaviour was developed mainly through learning.

AB To determine whether fathead minnows can learn to recognize potential predators through releaser-induced recognition learning, predator-naive minnows were simultaneously exposed to a neutral visual stimulus, the sight of a northern pike, Esox lucius, or a goldfish, Carassius auratus, paired with either minnow alarm substance (Schreckstoff) or water. Two days after this initial conditioning trial the visual stimuli were presented alone and minnows previously conditioned with alarm substance exhibited an appropriate anti-predator response, while those conditioned with water did not. The conditioned minnows were tested approximately 2 months later and again the minnows that were previously conditioned with alarm substance showed an appropriate anti-predator response, while those conditioned with water did not. A comparison of the reaction of minnows conditioned to a natural predator (the pike) and those conditioned to a non-piscivorous exotic (the goldfish) revealed a similar response intensity when tested 2 days after the initial conditioning trial. However, approximately 2 months after the conditioning trial, the reaction of minnows conditioned to pike was stronger than that of minnows conditioned to goldfish, indicating that learning may be constrained to favour a response to the natural predator. Minnows that were initially conditioned to pike did not show an anti-predator response to goldfish nor did minnows that were conditioned to goldfish respond to pike, demonstrating that the learned response was specific to the species used in the conditioning trials and not to any large fish. These results extend the known benefits to alarm-signal receivers.

AB Mating in the Sierra dome spider, Linyphia litigiosa (Linyphiidae) begins with 2-6 h of aspermic copulatory courtship, termed pre-insemination phase copulation. Male intromission rate, that is, the speed of repeated genitalic insertions, withdrawals and se-insertions, and body mass are related to fertilization success via cryptic female choice (i.e. female preferences are expressed in their sperm use patterns; Watson 1991b, Anim. Behav., 41, 343-360). Carbon dioxide (CO2) respirometry indicated that pre-insemination phase copulation is energetically demanding. Male intromission rate and body mass (which are uncorrelated traits) each were positively associated with different subsets of six complementary measures of metabolic competence made during copulatory courtship; (1) efficiency; (2, 3) maximum metabolic rate and scope; (4, 5) rate and linearity of metabolic increase; (6) the consistency of metabolic output during sustained courtship. Composite ranks of males based on the six metabolic and the two overt phenotypic measures of quality were positively correlated. Body mass and intromission rate also were associated with two aspects of male fighting ability, strength and aggressiveness (i.e. willingness to escalate when at a modest size disadvantage), respectively. Fighting is important for defence of webs, prey and mates. Thus metabolic competence, a fundamental and possibly heritable component of viability, is favoured by sexual selection; this may help to yield offspring that fare better under both natural and sexual selection.

ID SEXUAL SELECTION; MALE COMPETITION; ZEBRA FINCHES; MATE CHOICE
AB In previous studies a positive correlation has been observed between female preference and male display rate or duration, but the causal relationship remains unclear. Female zebra finches, Taenopygia guttata, were allowed to choose between a pair of males. Females preferred the male that displayed more. However, preferred males displayed more than non-preferred males only when the female was directly in front of the male. The level of male display increased with female proximity but the amount by which display effort increased varied between individual males. Females and males were equally likely to begin an encounter, and encounter duration was not correlated with display duration. The observed correlation between female preference and male display rate was thus a combination of both male and female behaviour. Male display rate varied intrinsically between males, and was also affected by female proximity.

AB In two Campylomormyrus species, tamandua and rhynchophorus from Central Africa, the electric organ discharge (EOD) activity was studied during the nocturnal activity phase in the laboratory. Both species have a pulse-type EOD of less than 200 mu s duration and similar waveform; the sequence of inter-discharge intervals, however, differed characteristically: C. tamandua displayed a 'micro-pattern' encompassing nearly the whole range of intervals in a sequence of only three intervals (long-intermediate-short), while in C. rhynchophorus adjacent intervals tended to be more similar in duration. Four C. rhynchophorus and five C. tamandua were tested for their preference of conspecific pulse sequences rather than those of the other species, respectively, in playback experiments. These were performed in a T-maze paradigm such that two pulse patterns, one from each species, were simultaneously presented via two electric fish dipole models. Two pulse sequences recorded from different individuals were used to represent each species; the natural EOD waveform was replaced by a square-wave pulse of approximately natural duration. The pattern pairings and the sequence of stimulus patterns followed a randomized blocks design. Each of the four C. rhynchophorus had significantly higher preference scores for the conspecific pulse patterns than for those of C. tamandua, while in C. tamandua no such discrimination was observed. It is suggested that the juvenile C. tamandua used would probably have joined mixed-species schools as reported to exist in the wild, while this appears unlikely in the more mature C. rhynchophorus. One of the functions of the inter-discharge interval code of communication in mormyrids is species recognition although this may be seen only in sufficiently mature fish.

TI DO PREDATORS AVOID GROUPS OF APOSEMATIC PREY - AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study investigated the widely held idea that predators are disinclined to attack groups of aposematic prey. There were four experimental situations. Great tits, Parus major, were presented with either grouped or solitary individuals of either larvae of the European pine sawfly, Neodiprion sertifer, or larvae of the European swallowtail, Papilio machaon. Sawfly larvae are naturally gregarious and the swallowtail larvae solitary. The sawfly larvae were attacked, killed and eaten more frequently than swallowtail larvae. The attack frequency wasnot independent of whether prey was grouped or solitary but groups of sawflies were attacked less than solitary individuals, whereas groups of swallowtails were attacked more than solitary individuals. The results imply that a high initial cost of group living may be reduced through the evolution of communal defence or display.

TI SEASONAL-CHANGES IN THE SIZE SELECTION OF MUSSELS, MYTILUS-EDULIS, BY
   OYSTERCATCHERS, HAEMATOPUS-OSTRALEGUS - AN OPTIMALITY APPROACH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Field observations were made of the size selection of mussels by oystercatchers throughout the year. Birds that opened mussels by hammering through the shell selected thin-shelled individuals and fed disproportionately on intermediate size classes for most months of the year. Profitability increased monotonically with mussel length for dorsal hammerers, but peaked at an intermediate size for ventral hammerers. In spring, all oystercatchers switched to feeding on small mussels and this coincided  with weight loss in large mussels associated with spawning. An optimal diet model, which in addition to handling time included both the probabilistic costs of making selection errors and encounter rates with thin-shelled mussels, was a good predictor of the birds'' diet selection for most months of the year, but did not explain why hammerers ate such small mussels in spring. These results are discussed in relation to some of the assumptions implicit in the model.

TI ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING AND LOCUST FEEDING - EVIDENCE FOR A LEARNED HUNGER
   FOR PROTEIN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experiments are described that show, first, that locusts, Locusta migratoria (L.), are able to associate an odour paired with a diet and the protein content of that diet and, second, that the behavioural response shown to the odour depends specifically on the insects'' state of protein deprivation. Nymphs were trained for 2 days with free access to two artificial foods that were similar in all respects except that one lacked digestible carbohydrate (the P diet) and the other lacked protein (the C diet) and each was paired with one of two distinctive secondary plant odours. The locusts were then fed for 4 h on either the P diet or the C diet with neither odour present, after which time the insects were deficient in digestible carbohydrate or protein, respectively. The nymphs were then observed in a test chamber with the two odours present. Those insects deprived of protein responded very differently to the two odours, approaching the source of the odour previously paired with the P diet significantly more often than that previously paired with the C diet. Locusts deprived of digestible carbohydrate, on the other hand, did not show any discrimination between the two odours. Further experiments showed that both odours were repellent to naive locusts and that the strong tendency, shown by protein-deprived nymphs, to approach the odour previously paired with the P diet was due to reduction in the repellency of that odour, combined with maintained repellency of the odour  previously paired with the C diet.

TI PHEROMONES, MATE RECOGNITION AND COURTSHIP STIMULATION IN THE
   DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER SPECIES SUBGROUP
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female fruitflies of certain species of Drosophila possess cuticular hydrocarbons which act as contact pheromones, capable of inducing male courtship. In three species of the D. melanogaster species subgroup (D. melanogaster, D. sechellia and D. erecta) adult males and females have hydrocarbons of different lengths and structures. In four other species (D. simulans, D. mauritiana, D. yakuba and D. teissieri) there is no qualitative difference between the sexes. Observations of  courtships showed that hydrocarbons act as courtship-inducing pheromones in all the species studied here. Males can be induced to court other flies, regardless of sex or species, if the hydrocarbons of the courted fly correspond to the main female cuticular hydrocarbon of the species of the courting male. Males from species that do not show a hydrocarbon dimorphism responded mainly to the principal hydrocarbon of their species. Males from the dimorphic species tended to respond to a wider range of hydrocarbons, and also showed high levels of courtship with young flies of both sexes and all species, whose hydrocarbons had some structural similarities to those of homotypic adult females.

TI MIXED-SPECIES GROUPING IN THOMSON AND GRANT GAZELLES - THE ANTIPREDATOR
   BENEFITS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Thomson''s gazelles, Gazella thomsoni, and Grant''s gazelles, G. granti, in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, frequently associate in mixed-species groups. Males are more likely to associate than females. Here the antipredator benefits of such associations are investigated. Compared with remaining as a smaller group of conspecifics, joining Grant''s gazelles to form larger mixed-species groups had several advantages for Thomson''s gazelles. First, they were less vulnerable to cheetahs,  Acinonyx jubatus, one of their main predators, as a result of improved predator detection, the lower success rate of cheetah hunts and the tendency for cheetahs to avoid hunting larger groups. Second, the Thomson''s gazelles in mixed-species groups shared vigilance to some extent with the Grant''s gazelles, leaving more time available for feeding. However, compared with joining conspecifics, joining Grant''s gazelles to form mixed-species groups had few additional advantages and such  associations were likely to be beneficial only when the number of conspecifics in the resulting mixed-species groups was relatively high. Associating with Grant''s gazelles did not, for example, enable indivdiual Thomson''s gazelles to spend less time vigilant than associating with the same number of conspecifics. Grant''s gazelles benefited from the association because the cheetahs'' preference for the smaller Thomson''s gazelles reduced the rate at which the Grant gazelles were attacked when in mixed-species groups.

TI EVIDENCE OF SEX-BIASED POSTNATAL MATERNAL INVESTMENT BY MONGOLIAN
   GERBILS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three experiments were undertaken examining the relative costs to female Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus, of rearing four male or four female pups from birth to weaning. In experiment 1, it was observed that gerbil dams rearing all-male litters were almost twice as likely as gerbil dams rearing all-female litters to be found: (1) with all their young in the nest throughout a 20-min observation period; and (2) with one or more pups attached to their nipples. In experiment 2, (1) dams  rearing all-male litters delivered significantly fewer young as a consequence of impregnation during postpartum oestrus than did dams rearing all-female litters and (2) dams rearing all-male litters exhibited both significantly greater periods of vaginal closure (preventing copulation) and significantly greater inter-litter intervals than did dams rearing all-female litters. In experiment 3, it was found that vaginal closure also provides an index of whether a gerbil dam will transfer milk to  her pups. Consequently, the greater durations of vaginal closure observed in dams rearing all-male litters than in dams rearing all-female litters (experiment 2) suggest a longer period of milk transfer from dams to their male than to their female young before weaning. The data were interpreted as consistent with the hypothesis that rearing male pups was more costly to gerbil dams than was rearing female pups. Difficulties in determining the relative cost to dams of rearing male and female young were discussed.

TI LEK BEHAVIOR IN BIRDS - DO DISPLAYING MALES REDUCE NEST PREDATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male lek display in birds may reduce nest-related predation by decoying predators away from nests and alerting incubating females when a predator is approaching. The sentinel/decoy model predicts a region of decreased predator density just inside the maximum range at which predators are attracted by displaying males. The expected ring of successful nests is evident in data from three species of North American prairie grouse. Well-documented features of female mate choice in lekking species, including repeated visits to maledisplay sites prior to mating, mate fidelity and mate copying, are consistent with females maximizing the proposed antipredator benefit. The sentinel/decoy model makes a number of unique predictions that will facilitate critical tests of the model.

TI VARIATION AMONG CONSPECIFIC INSECT POPULATIONS IN THE MECHANISTIC BASIS
   OF DIET BREADTH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Post-alighting oviposition bevariours of adult females was studied in two oligophagous populations of the butterfly, Euphydryas editha. Comparison of these two populations shows that similar patterns of host use can result from dissimilar patterns of plant-insect interaction. In one population, Schneider''s Meadow, the variation of host use among individual insects resulted directly from heritable behavioural variation of preference rank. In the other population, Sonora Pass, this behavioural variation was absent. Variation of host use arose more from plant distribution and abundance than from variation among insects. At Schneider''s Meadow, any of the three host species present could be ranked highest by a particular butterfly, and we found all possible permutations of preference rank order in pairwise comparisons of these hosts. Because host specificity was high, and because all three host species were abundant, butterflies usually found their preferred host species and expressed their preferences by laying eggs on the host species they preferred. At Sonora Pass, all butterflies that expressed preferences ranked host species in the same order, but many egg batches were laid on the second-ranked host. Host specificity of those insects that discriminated was significantly lower than at Schneider''s Meadow. Because of this low specificity and because the top-ranked host was rare and clumped, many females failed to find this species before the second-ranked host also became acceptable.

TI DOES DOMINANCE DETERMINE HOW FAR DARK-EYED JUNCOS, JUNCO-HYEMALIS,
   MIGRATE INTO THEIR WINTER RANGE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavioural dominance hypothesis suggests that differential migration among individuals of a species of bird is due solely to social interactions that force subordinate individuals (often a class, e.g. female or young birds) to migrate farther into the winter range than dominant individuals (often a class, e.g. make or old birds). Here, this hypothesis was tested with two experiments. In the first experiment, the prediction was tested that dominance acts within a sex-age class and  influences migration distance. The outcomes of interactions within dyads of dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, were observed. Each dyad consisted of a junco caught in winter in Michigan [USA] matched with another of the same sex-age class caught in Indiana, which is situated farther south and therefore farther into the winter range of this species. Michigan birds were dominant in only half of the experimental dyads (21 of 41 dyads), which is inconsistent with the prediction of the dominance  model. In the second experiment the prediction was tested that members of a sex-age class that migrates farther into the winter range should be subordinate to members of a different class that migrates a shorter distance. Young males that wintered in Michigan were pitted against old males that wintered in indiana. In 19 of 25 dyads, the more southern-wintering old males were dominant, which also is counter to the prediction of the dominance hypothesis. These results indicate, at the very least,  that in migratory J. h. hyemalis, dominance does not play as important a role in determing latitude of winter residence as has been suggested.

TI NEST CONSTRUCTION BY THE PAPER WASP, POLISTES - A TEST OF STIGMERGY
   THEORY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper wasp, Polistes fuscatus, begins building its nest by a linear series of construction steps. Once the first cell is initiated, the building becomes more complex in that any one of several construction acts may be done at any given time. The cues controlling construction during the initial linear series of steps were investigated. The building programme of this wasp was then compared to stigmergy theory, a model of linear construction behaviour which holds that ongoing construction is regulated by previous construction. As predicted by stigmery theory, P. fuscatus uses certain features of already completed construction to provide the cues for subsequent construction. Contrary to predictions from the theory, however, this wasp uses other additional types of cues and evaluates some of the same nest features at each step of construction. Thus, this wasp is able to analyse many different aspects of its nest at one time to determine the correct building sequence and methods, a process more complex than that proposed by stigmergy theory.

TI SOURCES OF NESTMATE RECOGNITION CUES IN THE IMPORTED FIRE ANT
   SOLENOPSIS-INVICTA BUREN (HYMENOPTERA, FORMICIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Aggression bioassays were conducted to investigate nestmate (worker-worker) recognition in monogyne colonies of the imported fire ant. Environmentally correlated cues dominated the recognition cue hierarchy of laboratory and field colonies, and diet alone significantly modified recognition labels and templates of laboratory-reared workers. ''Discriminators'' associated with worker genotype also affected recognition but ''queen discriminators'' did not significantly affect either labels of templates of laboratory-reared workers exposed as adults to alien queens for 28 days. Factors contributing to the importance of environmentally derived recognition cues in this species and the potential implications of such cues for the formation of polygynous fire ant populations are discussed.

TI ONTOGENY OF ROUTINE SWIMMING ACTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE IN ZEBRA DANIOS
   (TELEOSTEI, CYPRINIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Zebra danios, Danio rerio, 3-39 mm long, were studied to quantify ontogenetic changes in routine (spontaneous) swimming. Swimming speeds and mean acceleration rate increased during the larval period with the most rapid changes occurring when fish were between 5 and 15 mm long. At larger sizes, the rate of increase in performance was small. This pattern presumably resulted from morphological changes which also proceeded rapidly in larvae and levelled off towards adulthood. Swimming bouts began with either a large (105.degree.) or a small (3.degree.) turn. Turning angle changed with size apparently due to hydrodynamic conditions, as indexed by Reynolds numbers (Re). Larvae spent 98% of the time in the viscous and intermediate hydrodynamic regimes, of which 90% occurred at an Re of less than 110, and 23% was in the viscous regime (Re < 30). Larvae made exclusively small turns when the bout was in the viscous regime (Re < 23) and exclusively large ones in the intermediate regime (75 < Re <  270). Other species show similar rates of travel at lengths between 3 and 7 mm. At larger sizes, the zebra danio, Pacific mackerel, Scomber japonicus, and red sea bream, Pagrus major travel much greater distances per unit time. When their different sizes and rates of development were taken into account, the majority of species examined showed similar performance levels throughout the larval period. Two species that cover small distances per unit time at a given length (northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, and Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus) showed performance comparable to that of faster species when their prolonged larval period was taken into account. The implications of these ontogenetic changes in swimming performance for the development of foraging and anti-predator behaviour are discussed.

TI VARIATION OF GROUP COMPOSITION AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE WITH GROUP-SIZE IN
   A SEX-CHANGING FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Current knowledge of stable social groups of different size and structure suffers from a paucity of data on processes of group formation and development. If, for stable groups of one species, fission, growth, or other features of development reflect a uniform process operating on all groups, one might expect any group at one point in time to represent a single stage in the developmental process. Thus, unless group development is synchronous, a population should contain groups at all stages. A simple way to provide information about group development is to describe a large number of groups in a uniform habitat and to arrange the data along a variable axis, such as group size, that is thought to vary directly with development. A study was conducted on the tropical marine fish Anthias squamipinnis. Groups rnaged in size from 1 o 370 fish. Small groups were spatially unitary. Intermediate-sized groups were divided into two separate subgroups, i.e., were bipartite. Large groups were  divided into three subgroups, i.e., were tripartite. Subgroups within each group were classified by relative size as small, medium, or large. Unitary groups were statistically similar to the larger subgroups in bi- and tripartite groups, but differed from small subgroups in sex ratio, juvenile membership, and relation to the substrate. While subdivision of groups could, in theory, be explained by proximity among randomly dispersed aggregations or by discontinuity of underlying substrate or  available food, existing evidence does not favour these hypotheses. Group subdivision is probably the consequence of successive fissions of a previously unitary group.

TI SONG RATE AND PAIR FORMATION IN THE WILLOW WARBLER,
   PHYLLOSCOPUS-TROCHILUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mean song rates (number of songs per 50-s period) varied considerably between individual territorial willow warbler males during the period before pair formation. There was a negative correlation between the time a male spent foraging and his singing rate, and thus males that had the highest song rates allocated less time to foraging. Females started to return to the breeding area 10-14 days after the first males. The sequence of pairing correlated well with male song rate. Song rate may be a  cue on which females base their choice of mate; other male characters, such as age, size and weight, seem less important in this species.

TI THERMOREGULATION AND DAILY ACTIVITY PATTERNS IN A BLACK DESERT
   GRASSHOPPER, TAENIOPODA-EQUES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behavioural thermoregulation was studied in the western horse lubber grasshopper Taeniopoda eques(Burmeister), a native of the Chihuahuan Desert of North America. The grasshoppers regulated their temperature through a series of daily cyclical vertical movements between vegetation and the soil, and by the adoption of four thermoregulatory postures: flanking, crouching, stilting and stem-shading. At dawn, the grasshoppers moved from their nocturnal roost-plants to the ground, returned to bushes during the middle of the day, moved back to the open ground in the afternoon, then reascended vegetation at dusk. The occurrences of the four thermoregulatory postures were synchronized with these microhabitat shifts. During the cooler mornings and afternoons, the insects maximized heat gain by flanking and crouching, achieving thoracic temperatures of up to 16.degree.C above ambient. Throughout the hot middle of the day the insects stilted and shaded, minimizing heat gain. These behaviours  effectively kept the grasshopper''s body temperatures near the preferred temperature (36.2.degree.C), but lower than the maximum voluntarily tolerated temperature (41.9.degree.C), critical thermal maximum (45.2.degree.C) and instantaneous lethal maximum (46.5.degree.C). The body size of flanking insects influenced heating and cooling rates, wind effects and temperature excess at equilibrium. Both infrared and visible radiation appeared to elicit flanking. The need and ability to thermoregulate are influenced by this insect''s reliance on chemical deterrents for defence.

TI TEMPORAL SEPARATION BETWEEN PHILOPATRIC JUVENILE PIKAS AND THEIR PARENTS
   LIMITS BEHAVIORAL CONFLICT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Most juvenile pikas, Ochotona princeps, in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado [USA] remain on the home ranges of their parents throughout the summer of their birth and eventually settle close to their natal home range. Because conflicts potentially exist between these philopatric young and their individually territorial parents, tests were done to see whether periods of juvenile activity on parental territories were independent of adult activity. Data were gathered with focal-animal sampling  on a fully marked population of pikas during July and August in 1980 and 1981. Juvenile activity on the territory of a parent was dependent on parental activity; juveniles were most likely to be active when their parents were inactive. The temporal separation between parents and juveniles appears doubly advantageous in that it allows juveniles to avoid adult aggression and may facilitate their settlement nearby.

TI ACOUSTIC CUES FOR FEMALE CHOICE AND MALE COMPETITION IN
   TETTIGONIA-CANTANS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Songs of the bush cricket Tettigonia cantans were analysed, and synthetic song models constructed, to reproduce both the natural variation in the song parameters and the modified spectral balance (high-frequency attenuation) seen after songs are transmitted through the natural habitat. In the laboratory, song models were replayed to female insects in a series of two-choice trials and the phonotactic response was used as the criterion for song preference. Controlling single variables in the models showed that females orientated preferentially to lower-pitched songs, louder songs and models with a relatively louder high-frequency content. Further trials confirmed song frequency to be an important cue and demonstrated spectral balance to be a more effective stimulus than intensity per se. Song models replayed in the field to established (''territorial'') singing males produced different behavioural responses depending on the song frequency. To low-pitched songs, males were more likely to reduce their singing activity and move away from the sound source. High-pitched song often resulted in an increase in the singing rate and an approach to the loudspeaker. A model without the high-frequency band elicited no detectable response, the subject continuing to sing normally from the same perch. These results support the hypothesis that the spectral balance of the song can be used for range determination. The poor correlation between the measured song variables and morphology suggest that song in this species advertises the status of the male rather than other single attributes such as size or weight.

AB Mate desertion during the breeding cycle was documented at 28 of 36 (78%) snail kite, Rostrhamus sociabilis nests in Florida between 1979 and 1983. Offspring mortality occurred at only one deserted nest, however. Parents that were deserted by their mates continued to care for their young until independence (3-5 additional weeks) and provided snails at a rate similar to that of both parents combined before desertion. Males and females deserted with nearly equal frequency, except in 1982 when more females deserted. No desertion occurred during drought years, whereas desertion occurred at nearly every nest during favourable conditions. The occurrence of mate desertion was generally related to indirect measures of smail abundance: foraging range, snail delivery rates to the young and growth rates. Small broods were deserted more frequently by females than by males and tended to be deserted earlier than large ones. After desertion, deserters had the opportunity to re-mate and nest  again since breeding seasons were commonly lengthy, but whether they did so was impossible to determine conclusively in most cases. The deserted bird sometimes incurred increased energetic costs and lost breeding opportunities during periods of monoparental care.

TI THE AMOROUS GAMMARUS - SIZE ASSORTATIVE MATING IN GAMMARUS-PULEX
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The hypothesis that size assortative mating in Gammarus pulex is due to male-male competition was examined in three experiments. When males were given a choice of two mates they preferred to enter into precopula with the female that offered the greater utility in terms of eggs fertilized per reproductive effort. When a receptive female was simultaneously encountered by two males it was usually the larger male that entered into precopulatory amplexus. There was more male-male conflict in the presence of a receptive female than in that of an unreceptive female. Few take-overs occurred but those that did were by males larger than the male in precopula. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that competition results in size assortative mating; however, it is suggested that the optimal time (relative to female moult) of entry into precopula varies as a function of both male and female size. Thus large males enter into precopula earlier than small males and prefer to take a large  female to a small female. Male-male competition may determine some of the costs and benefits associated with size assortative mating but it is not the mechanism by which it occurs.

AB The shell exchange behaviour of the hermit crab Clibanarius antillensis was examined for evidence that the non-initiating crab used information about the initiator''s shell. Manipulation of the internal volume of the initiator''s shell altered the outcome of exchanges in a manner consistent with the negotiations model of resource exchange. It is suggested that the fundamental frequency of shells is detected by crabs during rapping behaviour when the initiator raps its shell against that of the  non-initiator.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB Adult female mice of the inbred strain SEC1Re/J (SEC), either individually cross-fostered by the C57BL6/J (C57) strain or non-fostered, preferred, when naive, the scent of C57 males to that of SEC males. Following an exposure to males of either strain, which allowed acoustic and olfactory interactions to take place between the experimental females and the stimulus-males, those females that had experienced C57 male cues strengthened their preference for C57 males scent. By contrast, subjects exposed to SEC males preferred SEC male scent, so reversing their previous choice. Thus, the initial tendency to choose the odour of C57 males appeared to be modified by the effects of appropriate social experience during adulthood.

TI PRECOPULATORY MATE GUARDING IN AN AMPHIPOD, GAMMARUS-LAWRENCIANUS
   BOUSFIELD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Traditional theoretical accounts of crustacean mate guarding have assumed that changes associated with the female''s reproductive state elicit the mate guarding behaviour of the male. The present study systematically examined the effects of both the male and female reproductive states on the precopulatory mate guarding decision of the amphipod Gammarus lawrencianus. Independent manipulation of the male and female variables indicated that both contributed additively to the probability of precopulatory mate guarding. When considered together, the results demonstrate that females that are closer to the post-moult copulation state are more likely to be guarded; and that males are more likely to enter the mate guarding relationship as the time since their last copulation increases. An adequate theoretical account of crustacean precopulatory mate guarding must, therefore, consider the contribution of both the male and the female reproductive states to the mate guarding decision.

TI DECISION-MAKING BY RATS IN AN UNPREDICTABLE LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT -
   FINAL DECISION RULES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A simple laboratory situation was developed in order to test statistical decision making in the white rat. The subject''s problem is to obtain rewards (water) which can be achieved by performing one of two possible alternative activities. The profitability of each of these two activities depends on the state of the test apparatus. The subject does not have perfect information about this state but information becomes available as a consequences of doing activity 1 and/or 2. The problem is  expressed mathematically and the optimal behaviour calculated. The predictions from the theoretical model are compared with the actual performance of the rat. The conclusion is that the optimal solution predicts the average behaviour of a rat during a test session well. The variation in the responses however cannot be understood from the model. The set up is suitable for pharmacological and physiological behavioural research.

Evidence is also provided that females can distinguish, not only between such sounds and similar sounds on the reef, but also between courtship sounds of different conspecific males, the latter indicating a role in mate assessment by the acoustical modality.

AB The oxygen consumption of great tits (Parus major) in winter flocks and of male pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in breeding condition, was measured. Resting metabolic rate was significantly correlated with dominance rank, as expressed by the width of the breast-stripe in the great tits and the darkness of the plumage on the head and back, or date of pair-formation, in males of the pied flycatcher. Individuals with the highest metabolic rates were the most dominant ones. Similarly, heart weight, relative to body weight, in dominant great tits was greater than that in lower-ranking birds.

TI AGGRESSIVE COMMUNICATION IN FULMARS (FULMARUS-GLACIALIS) COMPETING FOR
   FOOD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A simple model which considers communication of subjective resource value during aggressive encounters is developed. If different behavioral patterns differ in effectiveness (probability of winning) the model predicts that: the expected cost should differ for different behavior patterns, when effectiveness increases, the associated cost should increase; and the optimal choice should be influenced by the value the resource represents for the animal. These predictions were tested on field data from 1383 interactions between fulmars competing for food. In these interactions, 1 bird was the owner who defended the food item and during the time of ownership ate pieces of the food item. The owner was regularly challenged and take-overs occurred in 22% of interactions. The effectiveness of a given behavior pattern was measured as the proportion of interactions won. The cost was measured as the proportion of interactions that entailed physical fighting. Resource value was estimated  indirectly by comparing time as owner with choice of behavior. An animal''s choice of behavioral influenced its probability of victory, and expected cost, and that effectiveness and cost correlate positively. The frequency with which different behaviors were observed is influenced by the value of the resource for the bird.

TI EFFECTS OF LOCATION IN TERRITORY AND DISTANCE FROM NEIGHBORS ON THE USE
   OF SONG REPERTOIRES BY CAROLINA WRENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB By capturing territorial Carolina wrens (T. ludovicianus) and housing them in portable cages on their territories, it is possible to control each one''s location in its territory and distance from neighbors in experiments on the use of song repertoires. Experiment 1 demonstrated that these wrens sang more songs in the center of their territories than at the edge, but that they did not use more song types or different song types at the center than at the edge. In experiment 2, in which I played  tape-recorded songs at 2 distances from wrens caged in the centers of their territories, birds responded more strongly to songs at 25 m, simulating an intruder, than to songs at 165 m, simulating a territorial neighbor. Birds also switched more frequently between song types and sang more song types per 100 songs in response to the nearer playback. Experiment 3 compared captive wrens 140 m, 80 m, 20 m, or 0 m apart on adjacent territories. As the distance between neighbors decreased, birds sang less, but also switched more frequently between song types, used more song types per 100 songs, and matched songs with neighbors more frequently. There were no differences in the kinds of song types sung at different distances from neighbors. A comparison of the results from experiments 1 and 3 confirms that the use of song repertoires is influenced by distance form conspecifics and not by location in the territory.

AB Fourteen infant cotton-top tamarins from 5 captive family groups were studied during the 1st 20 wk of life. The roles of parents and of siblings of different ages as caregivers and as social companions for the infants and the effects of group composition and group size on these roles were examined. Parents and adult siblings played similar active roles in infant caregiving during the 1st few weeks after birth, with males showing a greater involvement than females. In groups without other  offspring the 2 parents showed equal infant caregiving behavior; fathers carried more than mothers did in groups with offspring present. Although infants received more caregiving from males, they showed a preference for contact and proximity with their mothers. No sex differences were found in infant behavior or in the direction of behavior by caregivers toward infants. Twins showed greater amounts of both social and solitary play in weeks 15-20 than did singletons and there was no effect of  the number of older siblings on the amount of play shown by an infant.

TI INVESTMENT AND RELATEDNESS - A COST-BENEFIT-ANALYSIS OF BREEDING AND
   HELPING IN THE PIED KINGFISHER (CERYLE-RUDIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Helping at the nest in birds is often termed altruism. No study has yet demonstrated high costs to a helper''s own lifetime reproductive success (direct fitness), nor its compensation through benefits from relatives other than its own offspring (indirect fitness). In pied kingfishers (Ceryle rudis) the relationship between investment, relatedness and inclusive fitness (expressed in terms of genetic equivalents) was investigated for breeding males and males that help either relatives (primary  helpers) or strangers (secondary helpers). With respect to guarding nests against predators and feeding young, primary helpers invest as much as breeders, but secondary helpers contribute significantly less. These differences in status and investment (measured in energy expenditure) affected the birds'' future to such an extent that primary helpers have a lower chance of surviving and mating than secondary helpers. Their costs in direct fitness were compensated by pronounced benefits to indirect  fitness, resulting from improved survival of siblings and parents. An attempt was made to calculate the inclusive fitness of birds following different strategies over a 2-yr period. Breeding was superior to helping and helping superior to doing nothing and kin-selection must be invoked to explain why surplus males choose the more costly primary helper strategy instead of the cheaper secondary helper strategy. Alternative explanations, including group selection, parental manipulation and  reciprocity, were discussed.

Individual males showed a preference for substrates with their own fecal and cloacal odors rather than those marked by unfamiliar conspecific males. This discriminatory ability did not depend on recent differences in food consumed. These scent marks might be used to define breeding territories in the field.

AB Males of the carpenter bee X. v. virginica are territorial at nest sites, food plants and landmarks such as boulders and houses. Their territories are defined as hover spaces of about 0.03 m3 inside hemispherical 20 m radius attack spaces. They copulated in or near nest site and food plant territories. Territorial males frequently fought with other males and chased or flew toward females and other airborne objects, such as heterospecific insects, birds and airplanes. They held territories at nesting sites in April and May, but were seen to mate only in fall and on the 1st vernal flight days of females in April. Patrolling and interloping males without territories frequently attempted mating in the territories of others.

TI TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT BEHAVIORS AND CLUSTER FORMATION BY AGGREGATING
   LADYBIRD BEETLES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB At their winter aggregation sites, convergent ladybird beetles, Hippodamia convergens (Coccinellidae), become active during snow-free days but form dense clusters in protected microhabitats at night. This daily dispersal and nightly reformation of clusters is correlated with 2 temperature-sensitive behaviors. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that ladybird beetles become photopositive as the temperature in a controlled environment room decreases from 20.degree. to 7.degree. C, but they revert to a photonegative response as the temperature falls below 5.degree. C. Ladybird beetles tend to form clusters as the temperature falls from 35.degree. C to .apprx. 15.degree. C. An attractant pheromone assists in cluster formation. Possible selective advantages of cluster formation by laydbird beetles are discussed.

TI QUANTITATIVE ETHOLOGY OF SOCIAL WASPS - TIME ACTIVITY BUDGETS AND CASTE
   DIFFERENTIATION IN ROPALIDIA-MARGINATA (LEP) (HYMENOPTERA, VESPIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Time-activity budgets of several individually identified members of R. marginata colonies were constructed to study caste differentiation in social wasps that show no morphological differences between individuals. Analysis of these data by multivariate statistical techniques including principal components analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis has demonstrated the presence of 3 different behavioral castes which are named sitters, fighters and foragers. The sitters in a colony consist of the queen and also some non-egg-laying individuals. The fighters are non-egg-layers that show alarm reactions in response to disturbances and also fight with other individuals on the nest to a very large extent. The foragers are also non-egg-layers and they spend a large proportion of their time making trips to places away from the nest to collect food, building material, etc.

TI A COMPARISON OF PREDATORY BEHAVIOR IN FLATFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The feeding behavior of 6 spp. of flatfish was examined. Four species of bothids showed very different hunting tactics when feeding on mysids. Attacks (70%) by turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) occurred in the water column, compared with only 6% for brill (S. rhombus); the topknots, Zeugopterus punctatus and Phrynorhombus regius, always remained in contact with the substratum. The turbot were agile and rapidly pursued their prey, brill slowly stalked their prey and the topknots employed a sit and wait strategy. When feeding on shrimps, turbot made 90% of their attacks from the substratum. Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) feeding on live worms exhibited less complex behavior sequences than the bothids. All hunting occurred on the substratum and consisted of short sequences of a browsing type of predation. When offered more mobile prey (Corophium sp.) plaice did not display the agility nor the complex hunting tactics shown by the bothid species. The simplest feeding behavior was shown by the sole (Solea solea) when feeding on worms and this simplicity is probably related to its olfactory/tactile method of prey location.

TI RECIPROCITY IN THE GREEN WOODHOOPOE (PHOENICULUS-PURPUREUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Green woodhoopoes (P. purpureus) exhibit behaviors that appear to meet all the criteria of reciprocity. In this species social units typically are composed of 1 breeding pair plus a variable number of helpers. A helper (X) that feeds nestling Y often is repaid by Y via Y''s critical assistance in the acquisition of territorial ownership and breeding status by X; Y later also feeds the offspring of X. This pattern follows whether or not X and Y are related. Unrelated adult woodhoopoes of the same sex also may merge to form new social units, with the younger, lower ranking bird helping the older to acquire and retain territorial space. It also provides care for the older bird''s offspring. A population structure based on a combination of cooperatively-breeding groups and high rates of mortality have favored the evolution of reciprocal exchanges between unrelated individuals.

TI COMMUNICATION WITH REPERTOIRES OF SONG THEMES IN TUFTED TITMICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The possibility that song themes of tufted titmice (P. bicolor) might communicate information about the singer to territorial neighbors was examined. The 8-12 themes sung by each individual in the population were divided into 3 classes based on acoustic structure and frequency of use. Class-I themes (the most frequently used) occurred disproportionately often early in the day, early in the breeding season and in the central portion of the singer''s territory; class-III themes (the least frequent) showed the opposite trends. Playbacks revealed differences in responses of territorial neighbors to the 3 classes of themes. When the subject failed to match the playback, it sang class-III themes disproportionately. Class-II themes were sung in response to playbacks of class-I themes, but not the converse. Class-II themes also tended to be used by females separated from their mates. Class-I themes serve primarily for long-range advertisement, class-II themes of males indicate a tendency to escalate an encounter and class-III themes indicate a low probability of aggression or a tendency to terminate an encounter.

TI SENSORY PROCESSES IN THE DISCRIMINATION OF PUPS BY FEMALE MICE
   (MUS-MUSCULUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Maternal pup retrieval by house mice (M. musculus) was studied in an investigation of sensory processes in the discrimination of own from alien pups. In a control condition, mothers were able to discriminate their own from alien young. This ability seemed to be based on olfactory cues, while visual and auditory cues did not seem to be involved. Retrieval probably consists of: elicitation (probably mediated by auditory cues); location of the pup (auditory and olfactory cues); and recognition of the pup (initially olfactory cues, with subsequent gustatory and tactile cues).

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Aggressive dominance orders of adults in a confined troop of Japanese macaques (M. fuscata) were determined each mating and birth season during a 4-yr interval. Males outranked more females in the mating than in the birth season, and some males shifted back and forth from ranks lower than female ranks in the birth season to ranks higher than female ranks in the mating season. Mating behavior (number of female partners in mount and ejaculation series and ejaculation frequency) did not differ among males with ranks higher than, as high as, or lower than those of most females, nor did individual males mate more in years when they were high-ranking than in years when they were not. Ejaculation frequency was correlated with the number of females defeated by males. A pattern of increasing male rank with age was found.

TI AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR OF MALE MICROTUS-BREWERI AND ITS
   DEMOGRAPHIC-IMPLICATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Patterns of laboratory-determined aggressive behavior and exploratory activity were examined in wild-caught male beach voles (M. breweri), an island-endemic species. This species does not exhibit the super-annual population cycles typical of other rodents in the subfamily Microtinae. Body weight and reproductive condition were good predictors of aggressive behavior, with heavier and reproductively active voles showing higher incidences of several stereotyped aggressive acts. Aggression also increased as the percentage of males and females who were reproductively active in the control population increased. Aggression was negatively correlated with population density, and more or less independent of dispersal rate. Dispersers and residents exhibited similar aggressive behavior patterns. These observations are consistent with models which proposed that population cycles in other vole species are controlled through the social interactions of individuals.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Grooming in dyads of 6 captive female hamadryas baboons (P. hamadryas) was analyzed. Each dyad was observed in isolation and as part of a group of 3-6 females. The isolated dyads differed from dyads in groups as follows. Grooming in isolated dyads depended mainly on the actor''s general tendency to groom; actors in groups were more responsive to who the recipient was. In groups, grooming tended to be more frequent among females of high dominance rank and among females who preferred one another in choice tests. The opposites were true for isolated dyads. Females in isolated dyads seemed to use grooming to improve a poor relationship; grooming in groups was used as if to maintain and defend a valuable relationship.

TI PARENT-OFFSPRING RECOGNITION IN BANK SWALLOWS (RIPARIA-RIPARIA) .2.
   DEVELOPMENT AND ACOUSTIC BASIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In study 1, bank swallow (R. riparia) chicks were exchanged with like-aged chicks from other broods. Parents accepted chicks that were transferred into their nests at age 15 days or younger; rejection began to occur at 16-17 days. In study 2, chicks'' vocalizations were recorded in the burrow. An immature begging call given by young chicks is replaced by a signature call at 15-17 days of age. An acoustic analysis suggested that these calls are individually distinctive. Study 3 was a playback experiment designed to test whether the chicks'' signature calls are a sufficient cue for parental recognition. Parents would approach a speaker broadcasting the calls of their chicks in preference to one simultaneously broadcasting the calls of alien chicks. The pattern of results suggests that parental recognition is based on the chicks'' signature calls and that development of recognition is dependent on the development of the call.

TI INFORMATION PARASITISM IN MIXED COLONIES OF WESTERN GREBES AND FORSTER
   TERNS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Of 38 western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis) colonies initiated on the Delta Marsh, Lake Manitoba, from 1973 through 1979, > 1/2 (53%) included breeding Forster''s terns (Sterna forsteri). Tern-associated colonies included 12 of the 13 largest colonies, incorporating 83% of the total nesting effort (N = 2821 nests). Such colonies were impossible to approach undetected, because grebes used the tern''s aerial alarm system to warn of danger. Playbacks showed that grebes recognized the tern''s alarm call and responded by immediately leaving their nests. This essentially constitutes a form of information parasitism, which probably is widespread in many nesting associations. This work suggests a broadening of the information center hypothesis to include transfer of information about any reproductive requisite, not just food.

TI CALLING DISPLAY AND MATING-BEHAVIOR OF COPIPHORA-RHINOCEROS PICTET
   (ORTHOPTERA, TETTIGONIIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Substrate-transmitted signals, known from scattered accounts to occur in several species of acoustic. Orthoptera, are brought together and briefly reviewed. Males of a neotropical katydid, C. rhinoceros, alternate stereotyped bouts of body vibration (tremulation) with an 8.7 kHz air-borne song. This calling display is remarkable in combining vegetation-conducted transverse waves with stridulation. A complete acoustic analysis accompanies detailed descriptions of 3 field matings. Females responded to the male''s display silently but with similar body shaking. Copulation lasted almost 4 h, and courtship was prolonged by repeated male withdrawals. The male''s coyness probably reflects a costly nutritional investment in a single mating: his spermatophore includes a huge bilobed spermatophylax, consumed by the female after copulation.

LA English
DT Article
AB Playbacks of synthetic and normal songs were used to determine what song parameters are important to species song recognition by territorial male swamp sparrows (M. georgiana) and song sparrows (M. melodia). Syllable morphology influences the discrimination of conspecific song from the song sparrows'' song in adult swamp sparrows, but temporal pattern does not; this result duplicates that found in studies of song learning of the young in this species. Species song recognition is influenced by both syllable morphology and temporal pattern in adult song sparrows, in contrast to the situation in young sparrows, which seem not to distinguish their own species'' song from that of swamp sparrows'' on either cue.

TI RAPE IN PANORPA-SCORPIONFLIES AND A GENERAL RAPE HYPOTHESIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The adaptive significance of heterosexual rape is difficult to demonstrate because female coyness is difficult to distinguish from apparent rape, and male fitness must be enhanced by rape. Male Panorpa scorpion flies inseminate unwilling females by securing the female''s wings in an abdominal clamp. Panorpa rapists gain fitness through avoidance of risks of predation by web-building spiders associated with the more typical male behaviors of feeding females a dead insect or salivary secretion during copulation. Males should be most strongly selected to rape in species in which males provide resources important for female reproduction. In such species, the strength of selection on males to rape should exceed the strength of selection on females to prevent rape.

TI CREPUSCULAR RHYTHM OF LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY IN THE FRESHWATER PROSOBRANCH,
   MELANOIDES-TUBERCULATA (MULLER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB M. tuberculata, entrained to a L:D 12:12 regimen, exhibits a crepuscular pattern of locomotor activity which persists for 6-7 days in both constant light and constant relative darkness at a period which deviates only slightly from 24 h, showing the rhythms to be endogenous. In constant conditions, the activity peaks drift relative to the times of the zeitgebers, but retain the same relationship to each other, suggesting that the free running period is the same for both peaks. The free running period varies in different light intensities, being less than 24 h in constant light and greater than 24 h in constant relative darkness, but remains approximately the same in constant light at different ambient temperatures. The rhythm is shown by individual animals and is evident in a population. The characteristics and biological significance of the rhythm are discussed.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF SHELL PREFERENCES BY THE HERMIT CRAB PAGURUS-BERNHARDUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The occurrence of empty gastropod shells and those occupied by the hermit crab, P. bernhardus, was examined on the shore. Small crabs prefer Littorina littoralis shells to those of Gibbula spp. and this was confirmed by preference tests in the laboratory. Crabs removed from these small shells show an initial preference for Nucella shells to those of L. littorea. Medium sized crabs collected in either Nucella or L. littorea prefer the species in which they were collected. This preference is still apparent when the size of the test shells is varied. The 1st clear evidence for a modification of shell preferences after experience of particular shell species is discussed.

TI SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ADULT MALE AND FEMALE MOUNTAIN GORILLAS IN
   THE WILD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Social relationships between adult males and females in 2 groups of wild mountain gorilla are described. Each group contained about 5, largely unrelated sub-adult and adult females, a peripheral near-adult male, and 1 fully mature male. Females were clearly attracted to the dominant male, and those with young offspring spent the most time near him. Also, when a female came into estrus, her time near the dominant male increased temporarily. Not all females engaged in grooming with this male, and those that did were judged to have the less stable, i.e., less potentially long-lasting, relationships with him. The relevance of affinitive behavior to acquisition of benefits and to establishment and maintenance of relationships, plus the influence of competition on maintenance of relationships, are discussed.

TI TERRITORIAL DEFENCE IN SPECKLED WOOD BUTTERFLY (PARARGE-AEGERIA) -
   RESIDENT ALWAYS WINS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males competed for territories, spots of sunlight on the ground layer of woodland, which were the best places for finding females. At any one time only 60% of the males had territories; the remainder patrolled for females in the tree canopy. Males continually flew down from the canopy and rapidly took over vacant sunspots. If the sunspot was already occupied, then the intruder was always driven back by the owner. This was true even if the owner had been in occupation for only a few seconds. The rule for settling contests was thus ''resident wins, intruder retreats''. Escalated contests only occurred when both contestants ''thought'' they were the resident. These results support the theoretical predictions of Maynard Smith and Parker (1976). The reason intruders accept defeat immediately without a serious fight may be that contests are costly and territories abundant.

TI SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG GELADA BABOONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of estrus on the social behavior of male and female gelada baboons (Theropithecus gelada) are quantitatively described. Estrus had little effect on the social behavior of either the male or the female and did not disrupt to any significant extent the structure of social relationships among the members of the unit as a whole. The female is responsible for initiating most sexual interactions, but did not show any marked increase in the amount of attention paid to the male. These results contrast with findings reported for other species of the baboon-macaque group, and the differences are discussed in relation to the contrasting social systems of these species.

TI SENSITIVITY AND RESPONSIVENESS OF ANTS TO THEIR COCOONS IN RELATION TO
   AGE AND METHODS OF MEASUREMENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB Groups of 200 young Formica polyctena ants reared from birth in the presence of cocoons for 2 wk developed an effective cocoon-nursing behavior. In the course of varying the age of the ants when 1st exposed to the cocoons, one test gave a negative result, while another test suggested that the 1st wk of exposure to the cocoons is decisive and the 2nd wk ineffective. When the development of the ants'' sensitivity to cocoons as a function of age was studied in groups of 2 young workers, the sensitivity was pronounced and unchanging if the ants were exposed from birth to cocoons. If the ants were not exposed to cocoons before the test, their sensitivity varied markedly with age, reaching a maximum at 48 h. Questions concerning divergent views on the issue of sensitive periods are discussed.

TI SHEDDING ENHANCES SEXUAL ATTRACTIVENESS OF ESTRADIOL TREATED GARTER
   SNAKES AND THEIR UNTREATED PENMATES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The courtship behavior of male garter snakes (Thamnophis radix) was tested with females who received or did not receive estradiol benzoate (EB) injections prior to shedding, and with non-shedding females who received EB. Each female injected for 5 or more days prior to shedding was courted only after the shed. Most penmates of the EB treated shedders were courted frequently after the treated female shed. Females who received no EB prior to shed showed little or no increase in sexual attractiveness. EB treated females who did not shed were inconsistently courted. Shedding probably potentiates the release of a sexual pheromone from the dorsal skin of EB treated females, and this pheromone can then be spread to the backs of penmates.

TI MECHANISMS OF AVIAN EGG-RECOGNITION - ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE FOR LEARNED
   COMPONENTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rejection of non-mimetic eggs occurs at nearly all the nests of certain species of passerines. Rejection behavior is almost certainly genetically programmed. Addition of artificial brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) eggs to empty northern oriole (Icterus galbula) nests indicates that the type of egg orioles consider their own is learned in an imprinting process that occurs during a sensitive period beginning several days before and ending shortly after the onset of laying. Orioles habituate to a cowbird egg they cannot eject and reduce rejection attempts after several days. Orioles are relatively unresponsive to eggs that differ from their own eggs only by being smaller. Selection may favor orioles most responsive to egg-color and maculation, the egg-parameters by which oriole eggs differ most strongly from those of the parasitic cowbird.

TI HEAD GROOMING BEHAVIOR IN THE PRAYING MANTIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mantis [Sphodromantis lineola] head grooming is a rhythmic behavior pattern involving coordinated movements of head and foreleg. The probability of grooming is influenced by releaser concentration, while the number of cycles/episode is influenced by concentration and amount of releaser. Within a grooming episode (usually 4-6 cycles) successive cycles are longer in duration. This is primarily caused by an increase in the actual head cleaning phase, although all 3 phases increase in duration. The phase cleaning the femur brush is most sensitive to feedback effects from releaser substances. Head grooming may be a programmed, i.e., centrally organized, movement pattern responsive to peripheral feedback. First approximations to the model-equations and model-hypotheses are presented.

AB Flappet larks [Mirafra rufocinnamomea] produce a mechanical burring sound with their wings which serves as territorial song. Individuals (33) were recorded wing-singing in the Serengeti [Tanzania] and Ruwenzori [Uganda] National Parks. Each wing-song is represented by a simple formula which summarizes its structure and timing. An individual bird is consistent in the wing-songs produced and different from almost all neighbors. In Ruwenzori, but not in Serengeti, there was local variation over distances of a few kilometers. Regional and geographical variation remain to be investigated adequately. The mechanical wing-song of the flappet lark shows many of the features of normal bird song.

TI FACTORS IN TIMING OF PARENT-CHICK RECOGNITION IN SWALLOWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Exchanged, sham-exchanged and untouched clutches of eggs of tree swallows (Iridoprocne bicolor) and of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) all hatched with equal incubation periods. Exchanged and sham-exchanged broods of tree swallows, exchanged at 3, 7, 12 and 17-days post-hatch showed no differences in overall or day-to-day weight changes, and barn-swallow groups failed to show a difference. Nestlings exchanged and sham-exchanged on day 17 departed from the nest earlier than did untouched controls in both species, demonstrating a handling effect. Exchanged broods departed earlier than sham-exchanged broods. Observations of parental behavior in the 30 min before and after exchanges and sham exchanges in the tree and barn swallows showed that handling decreased parental care similarly in both species. When own and alien young were tethered near the nest, alien young begged and struggled more and received more aggressive responses from the parents than did own young. Field observations of color-marked birds showed that parent barn swallows restrict feeding and protective responses to their own young, and behave aggressively to alien juveniles. Juveniles vocalize to the sight or sound of approaching adults, and are not fed until they vocalize, so that exchange of signals could provide for the post-fledging discrimination. Parent-chick recognition begins at about the time of fledging, after which it is very specific. This timing matches the factors of altricial nesting; parents can restrict parental care to their own eggs or nestlings by merely discriminating their nest from others, after fledging parents must discriminate their own young.

   RHESUS-MONKEYS (MACACA-MULATTA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pairs of adult rhesus monkeys of opposite sexes (12 pairs) were studied during 1 h mating tests (986 tests). Ovariectomized females received 5 .mu.g estradiol intravaginally throughout to keep them attractive to males and maintain a relatively constant level of male sexual activity. Females were given s.c. silastic implants of testosterone to change their sexual receptivity. A 3-fold change in sexual invitations resulted from the implantation and removal of testosterone in the absence of any major changes in the behavior of their male partners. These changes in invitational behavior reflected an action of the hormone on an internal mechanism within the female subserving sexual motivation which was independent of changes in the behavior of the male. Radioimmunoassay of plasma testosterone (109 samples) and plasma estradiol (86 samples), and gas-liquid chromatography of vaginal secretions (306 samples), facilitated the monitoring of variables needed to interpret the results.

AB Under what circumstances a vertebrate grandparent is selected to spoil its grandchild in defiance of the wishes of the child''s parent was questioned. To answer this question (the doting grandparent problem) a mathematical model of conflict and coalition in an animal society, some or all of whose members may possess imperfect information about potential costs and benefits of acts affecting themselves and their kin, is applied to interactions within extended families in diploid, outbreeding species. The model predicts that natural selection will not favor grandparent-grandchild alliances against the parent unless direct costs and benefits of behavioral acts over which conflict may occur are sufficiently broad in impact to affect at least 3 different kin categories simultaneously.

TI PERFORMANCE ON HEBB-WILLIAMS MAZE AS RELATED TO DISCRIMINATION AND
   REVERSAL LEARNING IN RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Performance on the Hebb-Williams maze was studied in relation to visual form discrimination and reversal. Three groups, each of 20 hooded rats, were 1st tested on the Hebb-Williams maze and then on discrimination and reversal in a T-maze with either vertical and horizontal black and white stripes or a black circle and triangle against white background as stimulus patterns. Animals in group I and II were tested for both discrimination and reversals. Hebb-Williams maze scores were found to correlate significantly with performance in the first discrimination and reversal. The results are inconsistent with the assumption of Woods and his associates that Hebb-Williams maze scores are merely reflective of locomotor behavior.

TI SOCIAL DOMINANCE IN SWINE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Data on social dominance value (DV) of 1629 Duroc and Hampshire pigs were obtained from Iowa State University''s swine irradiation project. DV was analysed within subclasses differentiated by irradiation treatment of sires, and breeds. It was calculated, within litters, from observations of pigs replacing others at a small number of feeder openings. Barrows were more dominant than gilts. The sex difference was larger in Hamsphires than in Durocs. Scrotal irradiation of sires increased both the variance component for interaction of sire by sex, and the variance within litters. Within sex, within litter, DV was highly correlated with weights at birth and at 21, 42, 98 and 154 days of age. At constant weight, DV was not correlated with depth of backfat.

TI EXTERNAL STIMULI AND READINESS TO INCUBATE IN BENGALESE FINCH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pairs of domesticated Lonchura striata Aves: Estrildidae) were tested for incubation by placing eggs in their nest boxes before laying. Readiness to incubate is present in both sexes before egg-laying, but earlier in males than in females. With females induced to incubate before laying the subsequent clutch is reduced in size or suppressed. Absence of nest material delays egg-laying and the start of incubation by males. Lack of material has no effect on the start of incubation by females but protracts its further development. The effect of nest material on males is apparently due to the experience gained in carrying it into the nest box.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Vision, tapping, wing vibrations and licking/smelling are important. Vision is necessary for initial orientation and for location of the female by the male. Tapping and smelling form the basis of sexual and inter-specific recognition. In tapping sexual recognition involves the entire leg while inter-specific recognition is restricted to the tarsi. The wing vibrations of the male, which release a sonic stimulus, are essential for stimulating the female for coition.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rats were given ten T-maze reversals while criterion of learning (8 out of 10 correct with last 5 consecutive; 12 consecutive correct; 30 consecutive correct) and type of discrimination (spatial vs. non-spatial) were varied. Results showed no effects of overtraining and no significant decrease in errors over reversals in non-spatial group. Analysis of the situation was made in terms of simultaneous and successive non-spatial learning and was related to the learning of attending responses.

TI HOMING ABILITY OF NEOTROPICAL BAT PHYLLOSTOMUS HASTATUS WITH EVIDENCE
   FOR VISUAL ORIENTATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Homing performance was superior to that usually found in temperate latitude bats. During the first night after release 94% returned from 3 to 6 miles, 57% from 7 to 21 miles, aid 26% from 25 to 33 miles; but none returned from 39 to 40 miles in one night, although 12% homed over the next several days. The most rapid returns averaged about 6 miles/hr. over 6 to 28 miles. Blindfolded Phyllostomus hastatus flew normally and some were seen for several days with blindfolds intact. But none homed in one night from 15 to 20 miles while over half of the untreated controls did so, as well as over half of controls fitted with transparent "goggles" of the same weight and method of attachment as the blindfolds but with transparent windows over the eyes. The measured homing performance from 5 to 6 miles was less seriously affected by blindfolding.

TI NORMAL AND ABERRANT COPULATORY BEHAVIOUR IN MALE RATS (R NORVEGICUS)
   REARED IN ISOLATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sixteen male rats raised in social isolation from weaning exhibited disorientation and inability to achieve intromission in 2 or 3 copulation tests with receptive females. Four other males raised under presumably similar conditions, but tested at a slightly older age in a smaller arena, exhibited normal sexual behavior. The only controlled factor to which aberrant sexual behavior could be attributed was social isolation. Although social isolation is apparently necessary to produce aberrant sexual behavior in the male rat, other unidentified experimental factors are also necessary to bring it about.

TI CONDITIONED EMOTIONALITY IN RAT AS A FUNCTION OF STRESS IN INFANCY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Animals were shocked, handled, or not handled but exposed to the shock and handling compartment from birth until weaning. At 50 days of age, half of each infantile group were trained on a shock avoidance task and the other half were trained on an instrumental reward task. The groups were further subdivided in terms of whether the learning apparatus was identical to (Runway-S) or different from (Runway-D) the infant treatment setting. On both the stressful and nonstressful learning tasks, Ss (subjects) shocked in infancy performed faster than controls in Runway-S but performed similarly in Runway-D. These results were dependent on the sex of the animal and the type of task, but the fact that differences were found only in Runway-S provided some evidence that repeated shock stimulation in infancy resulted in direct conditioning of emotional responses to situational cues. Emotionality, measured in terms of open field and consummatory behavior, was a curvilinear, rather than a monotonic, function of the amount of infant stress. A discrepancy between learning data and emotionality data was noted.

TI CORRECTING BEHAVIOUR IN MEALWORMS ( TENEBRIO ) + REJECTION OF PREVIOUS
   HYPOTHESIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.), when forced to make a turn in a maze tend to make a second opposite turn. The frequency of this correcting behavior increases as the start to forced turn distance is increased and decreases as the forced turn to choice point distance is increased. The latter is a function of distance and not time. An explanation based on "reactive inhibition" has been rejected. Turn alternation is apparently the result of an interaction between events occurring at the forced turn and an excitatory state accumulated prior to the forced turn.

AB Groups of naive Ss were presented with a weak stimulus: W. S. (1 day drowned pup) for eliciting maternal behavior. Some groups had previously contacted a strong stimulus: S. S. (1 day living pup) and others not. Responsiveness to W. S., measured by numbers of Ss displaying retrieving, licking, nest-building and lactation-position, was significantly higher in groups previously presented with S. S. This increase is a long-term effect: it persisted 1 week after the presentation with S. S., and it does not seem to depend upon performance of the responses during the initial contact with S. S.

TI ANALYSIS OF INTER-NEST MOVEMENT BY WORKERS OF ANT FORMICA OPACIVENTRIS
   EMERY ( HYMENOPTERA - FORMICIDAE )
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Marking experiments under field conditions indicate that workers visit between nests with a ratio of marked to recovered visiting workers of between 0.05% and 5.46% over a period of several days. Mean visiting ratio for a group of 7 nests studied in 1963 was 1.99+ 0.70% in close agreement with similar low ratios found at separate nests in 1962. Workers marked at one nest visit at several nests in the vicinity and individual nests are visited by workers from several surrounding nests. The maximum visiting radius observed was 25m. Differences in the frequency with which marked workers visit at neighboring colonies is related to the distance from the marked nest and to the conditions of the colony visited, colonies in recent decline being the most heavily visited. Colonies which released the smallest number of visitors, were visited the least. The existence of visiting behavior among discrete colonies is interpreted as further evidence that, in Formica opaciventris colonies are integrated to form a social unit at the level of the population of the colonies.

AB Many biological features are expressed as 'time-to-event' traits, such as time to first reproduction or time to first response to some stimulus. The analysis of these traits frequently produces right-censored data in cases where no event has occurred within a certain time frame. The Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model, a type of survival analysis, accounts for censored data by estimating the hazard of an event occurring at each time point. While random effect variances can be estimated in CPH models, it is currently not possible to estimate within-cluster variance. Consequently, we lack a general method for calculating ecologically and evolutionary relevant variances and metrics like repeatability from time-toevent data. We here present a solution to this issue. We first describe the characteristics of CPH models and introduce repeatability as an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). We demonstrate how CPH models with discrete time intervals are comparable to binomial generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) with the complementary log-log link. Through this equivalence, we show how to estimate an ICC using the estimates of the random effects variance component(s) resulting from CPH models and the distribution-specific variance (within-cluster variance) from the binomial GLMM. We provide a case study and online materials to demonstrate how our new method for ICC for time-to-event data can be implemented and used. We conclude that the proposed method will not only generate a standard way to quantify consistent individual differences (ICC) from time-to-event data, but also broaden the use of survival analysis outside of the typical implementation for survivorship studies.

AB Humans have profoundly changed the global soundscape. Studying how nonhuman animals respond to music can contribute to a better understanding of the effect of sound on animals. Animals are frequently exposed to human music, whether intentionally (for example, in laboratory settings), or unintentionally (for example, when animals live in close proximity to humans). Although several papers examine animals' responses to music, these typically do so from a purely animal behavioural perspective, sometimes missing relevant details about salient features of the music being played. An interdisciplinary approach that places musical and scientific knowledge on equal footing can improve our understanding of how animals respond to music and music-like sounds, in new and exciting ways. Here, we show with a systematic review that crucial factors (intrinsic music properties, listener properties, playback context and producer properties and contexts; ILPP) are not being adequately considered or reported in recently published scientific articles on the effects of music on animals, which hinders scientific reproducibility within this area of study. These problems are caused by improper referencing of music sources, misunderstanding of music and unexamined assumptions about individual variation and preferences between individuals of the same or different species. We then suggest that Berlyne's psychobiological theory might provide a useful framework for studying how animals respond to human-generated sounds.

AB Antagonistic coevolutionary interactions between avian brood parasites and their hosts can lead to selection for the discrimination of parasites by their host via visual or acoustic signals. Therefore, nestlings of some brood parasites may be under selection to evolve visual and vocal mimicry of host nestlings to avoid discrimination by host parents. Some brood parasites diversify into host-specific populations by mimicking visual features of the host offspring (either eggs or nestlings). However, whether a similar mechanism applies to the begging calls of their hosts remains unclear. In this study, we analysed the begging calls of three subspecies of the shining bronze-cuckoo, which present visual mimicry of three different host species (family Acanthizidae) that vary in their ability to discriminate parasite nestlings. We found that the begging calls of each cuckoo subspecies match the respective host more closely than any of the other cuckoo subspecies. Therefore, selection for coevolutionary diversification appears to overcome phylogenetic constraints on cuckoo begging call structure. The coevolutionary interactions in these parasite-host systems have promoted the selection for refined host mimicry by the cuckoo and the formation of geographically isolated evolutionary units across the range of the species.

AB For oviparous species, the external environment is replete with cues that contain diverse information relevant to developing embryos, including potential predation threats. Information about predators obtained during the egg stage is known to improve survival after hatching by allowing individuals to recognize and respond to potential threats more effectively, but the development and mechanisms by which embryos learn are not well studied. Here, we sought to identify the developmental onset of embryonic learning in a freshwater fish, the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas, by conditioning embryos to identify a piscivorous predator, the bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, and evaluating their behaviour in response to predatory cues each day before hatching. In addition, we manipulated egg number (small or large clutch) and configuration (clustered, isolated) in experimental clutches to determine whether social attributes of the clutch, specifically, group size and embryo proximity, influence the acquisition of learned predator information or the expression of antipredator behaviour. Behavioural evidence of learned predator recognition first emerged among predator-conditioned embryos at 4 days postfertilization, expressed as a reduction in locomotor activity in the presence of predator cues. In addition, we found general effects of both the number and proximity of neighbouring eggs on embryonic activity levels but not on the developmental onset of predator recognition in predator-conditioned embryos or the expression of antipredator behaviour. These findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge on embryonic learning in oviparous aquatic vertebrate species and suggest that aquatic vertebrate embryos may be more sensitive to the social environment of the clutch than is commonly considered.

AB Biparental care can be favoured when offspring care by both parents provides a stronger fitness incentive to parents than deserting their offspring. In species with precocial offspring, the burden of care is expected to be comparatively low, facilitating desertion by one parent and uniparental care by the abandoned partner. However, care patterns can vary widely between and within precocial species, with some parents deserting their offspring, while other families remain biparental. Understanding the details of the care delivered by males and females in families before desertion is important to provide insight into the mechanisms that influence the stability of biparental care. Here we used detailed behavioural observations from the brood care period to investigate the balance of care between male and female parents in a well-studied precocial shorebird, the Kentish plover, Charadrius alexandrinus, both within families where females subsequently deserted and within families that remained biparental until the offspring were independent. We found that both males and females expressed all care behaviours (brooding, vigilance and brood defence) characteristic of precocial species, and we utilized quantitative mutual entropy analyses to show that the division of parental labour (i.e. care task specialization) was unrelated to the maintenance of biparental care. We also found that while males and females provided broadly similar levels of care, there were subtle differences: females typically delivered slightly more care than males across offspring development, suggesting that sex differences in self-maintenance may underlie sex differences in care. Together our results indicate minor differences in the care patterns of males and females, consistent with theoretical predictions that the division of labour should be limited in populations with frequent desertion and uniparental care.

AB Analysing social behaviour provides valuable insights into the dynamics of species living in groups. An essential part of social behaviour is represented by lead-and-follow interactions as they influence group stability through individual needs and decision making. In horses, Equus ferus caballus, this behaviour plays a crucial role since individuals depend on the security and knowledge their group offers. Only one study has analysed the lead-and-follow behaviour of Przewalski's horses, Equus ferus przewalskii. However, no such study has been conducted on the wild population, nor on the potential impact of the horses' origin and experience. We filmed 34 wild-born and captive-bred individuals with different experiences (held in a fenced enclosure before release into the wild, long-term reintroduced and wild- born) in the Great Gobi B (Mongolia) over summer 2018, late spring 2019 and autumn 2019 to investigate Przewalski's horses' lead-and-follow behaviour in situ. We documented lead-and-follow interactions within 11 groups and used these data to construct lead-and-follow networks. We also examined the influence of various social factors (origin, sex, age, dominance rank, group size, parity, kinship and time belonging to the group) on different network measures. The analyses revealed that wild-born horses with greater experience in the area tended to exhibit well-defined lead-and-follow connections with few leading individuals, typical of stable groups of horses. In contrast, in inexperienced reintroduced groups, many (or all) members controlled the movement. The results show that newly formed groups of released Przewalski's horses require time to develop typical and stable lead-and-follow patterns.

AB Parasitism is increasingly seen as an ecological factor contributing to behavioural variation among individuals. Yet, the causal direction of the relationship between animal personality and parasites remains unclear. We measured behavioural traits (i.e. exploration, activity, boldness) in pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, before and after an experimental infection using cages in a lake where sunfish were naturally exposed to trematode and cestode infection for 1 month. Despite our initial assumptions (i.e. that all individuals would have the same risk of infection within a cage), we found that initial behavioural traits strongly influenced infection susceptibility: initially bolder and less active fish acquired a higher density of trematode and cestode parasites during the infection period. Following infection, fish body condition decreased with increasing cestode density, suggesting that infection is costly to hosts. Body condition was positively correlated with distance moved, a measure of activity, regardless of individual infection status. The repeatability of exploration and activity behaviour and the strength of the activity-exploration correlation (i.e. behavioural syndrome) were reduced following parasite exposure. Distance moved and trematode density were negatively correlated, suggesting that this infection decreases host activity levels. Since trematodes have a complex life cycle with piscivorous birds as a final host, a decrease in activity following infection may make infected fish more susceptible to bird predation, benefiting the parasite. Our results highlight the close links between behaviour and parasitism. We propose that two mechanisms may simultaneously operate: initial host behaviour influences their risk of infection, and infection introduces variation in the behavioural traits of infected hosts.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer invaluable contributions to wildlife observation, reducing costs and human risk while minimizing disturbance to animals during aerial surveys. However, within a population, individual animals can exhibit different responses to UAVs. This indicates that the level of UAV disturbance might differ between individuals even when the disturbance is mild at the population level. However, few studies have investigated UAV disturbance at the individual level. In this study, we explored the variation in response to UAVs among individual Weddell seals along the Terra Nova Bay coastline in Antarctica. We also examined how internal factors such as age, group composition and whether their eyes were open, as well as external factors such as UAV flight schemes, influenced responses. Our findings showed substantial variation among individual seals in both their overall response and changes in response to descending UAVs. Notably, seals were more sensitive to UAVs with vertical flight schemes than to those with horizontal flight schemes. When seals were in groups or had their eyes closed, their vigilance responses to UAVs decreased. Therefore, our findings highlight the importance of not only considering individual factors but also avoiding vertical flight patterns during UAV-based aerial surveys of Weddell seals, thus minimising disturbance. Additionally, we recommend developing more effective approaches for wildlife research that utilize UAVs by incorporating the consideration of individual differences in responses to UAVs.

AB Foraging strategies are fundamental traits that characterize predators, with strong differences between sit-and-wait predators and active-searching predators. Optimal foraging theory predicts that environmental conditions affect the efficiency of these strategies, with active predators being favoured when prey are scarce and difficult to detect. Subterranean habitats are ideal models to study the effectiveness of foraging strategies. Laboratory studies on fish and salamander predators showed that active foraging often characterizes cave-adapted species, but field studies demonstrating the advantages of active foraging for growth and survival are lacking. In this study, we assessed how predators displaying a sitand-wait strategy can cope with the variable costs of foraging under different ecological contexts, such as cave and surface environments. We performed a cross-environment experiment that was repeated in 3 years by rearing salamander, Salamandra salamandra, larvae from caves and surface streams in cages placed in both surface and cave environments. We measured larval growth (weight and total length) repeatedly every 10-20 days, from March to July, and assessed water temperature variation, prey availability and metamorphosis achievement in the rearing sites. Larvae in stream cages grew larger than larvae in subterranean cages, which showed negative growth. Our results suggest that the sit-and-wait strategy does not provide enough prey for development in cave environments, irrespective of larvae origin. In food-deprived environments, active foraging is necessary to obtain the energy required for the basic functions of the organisms exploiting them. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

DE animal behaviour; ecological constraints; GPS tracking; movement

ID KIN COMPETITION; NATAL DISPERSAL; EVOLUTION
AB Movement is a key part of life for many animals. However, a number of temporal constraints, from changes in light and temperature to varying risks of predation, limit not only where animals can move, but also when. Such constraints are likely to be most pronounced when animals must make large displacements, as is the case when individuals disperse. However, little is known about how dispersers overcome temporal constraints on movement, despite significant implications for the success of dispersal. We outline a general framework for identifying the strategies animals use to achieve large displacements in the face of constraints on when and how to move, which we predict should follow one of three patterns: increasing their movements during those times when they typically move more, uniformly across the day, or when they previously moved least. Using high-resolution GPS tracking of dispersing and resident vulturine guineafowl, Acryllium vulturinum, we show that dispersers expressed the greatest increases in movement at the same times of day that they moved most prior to dispersing. Our results suggest that individuals face the same ecological constraints during dispersal as they do in daily life and achieve large displacements by maximizing movement when conditions are most favourable.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Males of the fiddler crab Austruca lactea exhibit drumming behaviour as vibroacoustic communication and wave their enlarged claw for courtship. However, we identified that they also perform drumming as an agonistic behaviour. To determine whether vibrational characteristics differ depending on context, we compared five drumming parameters (pulse rate, pulses per train, train duration, pulse duration and dominant frequency) between courtship and agonistic contexts. We found that courtship drumming had a longer train duration, with more pulses per train than agonistic drumming. However, agonistic drumming had a higher pulse rate than courtship drumming. Pulse duration and dominant frequency did not differ significantly between contexts. Therefore, fiddler crabs' vibrational signals might have evolved into two different signals, for agonistic and courtship interactions.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Parents that provide parental care must balance the conservation of resources with the benefits of expenditure in support of existing offspring. There is added complexity in social systems in which siblings also contribute to brood care, wherein dynamic social interactions exist, and brood care can influence group fitness. Most bumble bees are annually eusocial insects in which queens undergo a stark transition from living a solitary, to subsocial, to eusocial lifestyle over the course of several weeks as they initiate new nests. We used detailed behavioural analyses of queen bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) parental care behaviour to examine how performance of five parental care-related tasks differs when queens are living in either subsocial conditions (with brood but no adult workers) or as part of a eusocial group with either three or five workers. These three groups reflect the ontogeny of sociality across the early nesting stage. We show for the first time that queen bumble bee parental care behaviour is tightly regulated by the number of helpers in the nest. With three workers in the nest, queens exhibited -60% reduction in brood feeding and -30% reduction in incubation but no reduction in food collection. However, the addition of just two additional workers resulted in nearly complete cessation of pollen and nectar collection behaviours, whereas in-nest parental care behaviours persisted. We propose that this sequence of behavioural changes might reflect queen avoidance of threats such as predators, parasites or harsh weather. Queens may cease performing tasks outside the nest early in colony development, but only when a threshold number of helpers in the nest is met. More broadly, our results suggest that bumble bee queen parental care behaviour is heavily impacted by the number of helpers in the nest, who may alleviate some of the constraints queens face during nest initiation.

AB Tracking technologies have revolutionized zoological research in recent decades; however, technologi-cally simple methods of tracking spoor should not be removed from the researcher's arsenal. Tracking spoor, or field signs, is an old human skill, considered to be fundamental to our evolution as an intelligent species. It comprises finding and categorizing footprints, droppings and other animal-related signs, such as trampled paths and nests. Zoologists have been using traditional tracking methods as research tools for many years and still use them today. Tracking is being used mainly in the fields of animal behaviour and conservation. In animal behaviour studies, tracking is an important tool to measure behavioural responses while in conservation efforts, tracking is often an effective survey method compared to other methods. In this paper, we briefly review the history of tracking in human culture and zoology and present the different uses and methods of tracking employed in behavioural studies and wildlife surveys. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods and present the conditions required for each method to be effectively applied. Our main goal is to encourage researchers to use spoor tracking, as it is reliable, easy and cheap to use and can be incorporated with modern methods to gain otherwise unachievable information.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The distance at which animals move away from threats, flight initiation distance (FID), is often used to study antipredator behaviour and risk assessment. Variation in FID is explained by a variety of internal and external biotic and physical factors, including anthropogenic activities. Most prior studies focused on unidentified individuals, so our understanding of the fitness consequences of FID is relatively limited. We asked whether consistent individual differences in variation in flight initiation distance is associated with variation in summer survival and/or winter survival in an individually marked population of yellow -bellied marmots. We found no clear association between flight initiation distance and summer sur-vival or winter survival. This suggests that FID decisions, while demonstrably optimizing current survival, may not have longer-term fitness consequences. Our results may be explained by the relatively modest repeatability of FID or it may have emerged from our attempt to explain longer-term measures of fitness. Future studies of the fitness consequences of personality traits should pay particular attention to the time interval between measuring the individuality of a trait and examining its fitness consequences.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Brood reduction is a frequent outcome in asynchronously hatching birds. In these species, first-hatched nestlings get a disproportionately larger share of the food delivered by parents, often leading the youngest nestling to starve to death soon after hatching. However, we still do not know the proximate mechanisms of such brood reduction. Starvation of the smallest nestling may be the outcome of scramble competition among nestmates (due to brood size hierarchies) or, alternatively, be caused by parents that ignore the persistent begging from their smallest nestling. To determine whether parents or scramble competition among siblings induces brood reduction, we used a cross-fostering approach to experi-mentally create asynchronous Eurasian blackbird, Turdus merula, broods. Then, we assessed food allo-cation by parents in two different situations: when sibling competition was allowed and when competition was prevented by physically separating nestlings with wooden barriers placed within the nest. We found that smaller nestlings experimentally introduced into blackbird nests received less food than their larger nestmates regardless of whether scramble competition among nestlings was allowed or not. Males preferentially fed larger nestlings regardless of the competitive context, while females showed no feeding differences. Our results suggest that nestlings may exert limited control over parental food allocation.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social network analyses are used by ecologists to examine the various drivers of animal social structures. While social behaviours are found throughout the animal kingdom, their roles in structuring marine communities are poorly understood. Comparisons of sociality across marine fishes in the same location and time are rare. A large acoustic telemetry network in Delaware Bay allowed us to analyse the sociality of Atlantic sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus, and sand tiger sharks, Carcharias taurus. Both species co-occur in the bay, are long-lived, make seasonal migrations and aggregate for unknown rea-sons. However, these species occupy distinctly different trophic positions and ecological niches. We found little evidence for sociality among Atlantic sturgeon. However, sand tigers exhibited evidence for preferential co-occurrence, modularity and assortment by maturity. In addition, we found that these species preferentially associate with conspecifics. Our findings suggest that sand tigers exhibit a higher degree of sociality than Atlantic sturgeon while in the Delaware Bay. From these findings, we outline the social structures of two evolutionary distinct species while they co-occur in the Delaware Bay. Addi-tionally, we explored the influence that environmental acoustic conditions have on social network metrics and make recommendations for future analyses using acoustic telemetry in estuarine environments.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Early detection of predators greatly improves prey escape and survival chances. By investigating cues predators leave behind, such as fur, urine, faeces or feathers (secondary predator cues), prey may gain vital information about predators in the vicinity. Meerkats, Suricata suricatta, display an unusual mobbing-like response upon encountering secondary predator cues, not reported in any other species. The function of this behaviour is unclear because, unlike mobbing of a live predator, it cannot yield the primary benefit of driving the threat away. Here we examine two potential functions. First, we hy-pothesized that older group members may exhibit exaggerated mobbing-like responses towards sec-ondary predator cues as a form of teaching to promote learning in naive pups. Meerkats are known to teach pups hunting skills, but there is no evidence that any nonhuman species teaches across multiple contexts. Mobbing-like responses could also function to facilitate group member recruitment, stimu-lating information gathering and collective decision making by the group. Using experimental pre-sentations of secondary predator cues in the presence and absence of pups, in combination with 20 years of data on natural encounters with secondary predator cues, we found that older group members' response frequency was lower when pups were present and that response intensity declined as the proportion of pups to total group member number increased. Conversely, the intensity of responses increased when a greater proportion of group members interacted with the cue and varied with predator cue type. The response frequency to natural encounters with secondary predator cues was greater in larger groups, and the distance travelled by the group decreased following an encounter with secondary predator cues. These results suggest that meerkats do not show exaggerated responses to secondary predator cues as a form of teaching. Mobbing-like responses more likely serve to increase recruitment of others to investigate the cue and inform defensive group behaviour. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Sexual conflict occurs in biparental species because working together provides shared benefits while incurring individual costs. In birds, coordination of provisioning visits via turn taking has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate this conflict. However, alternation of visits requires that birds have access to reliable information on their partner's behaviour, e.g. through high synchrony of nest visits or short foraging distances (allowing for direct observation of partners). Here we investigated parental coordination in the European starling, a species that forages at considerable distances from the nest (200 -1600 m), where there is no evidence that pairs forage together, and where synchrony at the nest appears to be low, so that direct access to information on partners will be variable and limited. There was some evidence that individuals were 'paying attention' to their partner's provisioning rate, adjusting their behaviour in response to their partner's behaviour. In first broods, female intervisit intervals that were preceded by a male visit (order of visits: male, female, female) were longer than those that were preceded by a female visit (order of visits: female, female, female). Females and males both responded to mate removal by decreasing their provisioning rates though these returned to preremoval levels the day after removal. This is consistent with 'matching' of parental workload not 'partial compensation'. These results suggest that birds do adjust their behaviour in relation to information about their partner's behaviour or absence/presence. However, despite this, there was no evidence of true coordination via alternation or synchrony (i.e. this was not different from random) in European starlings.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The study of animal play is highly complex since its potential functions vary with social and environmental circumstances. Although play is generally characteristic of immature animals, it may persist in adults in its social form, particularly when interacting with young individuals, and less often with other adult playmates. We measured the amount of social play in 62 wild adult howler monkeys, Alouatta palliata, belonging to seven different groups in Mexico and Costa Rica. Overall, adult play represented a small mean proportion of observation time across all groups, but it was present in all study groups. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that group size correlated with both adult-adult and adult -immature play, supporting the hypothesis that more individuals provide more play opportunities. While play between adults decreased with increases in the immature to adult ratio, we did not find a clear preference for adults to play with immatures, emphasizing the importance of playing with other adult peers. Conversely, adults played more with immatures as the immature to adult ratio increased, which may correspond with the role adult-immature play may have in the socialization process of young individuals. More time dedicated to foraging on fruits corresponded with more adult-adult play. This finding, aside from being associated with more energy being available to engage in play, supports the hypothesis that play is a mechanism for solving conflicts associated with contest competition by either reducing social tension and/or fighting for a limited resource. The range of factors affecting social play indicates that this behaviour in adult howler monkeys is facultative, having affiliative, socializing and competitive roles, depending on the socioecological context.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Urban environments differ in many aspects from natural or rural ones and thus pose challenges for many animal species. Some of these challenges have been connected to the observation that urban individuals of many animal taxa are bolder and more aggressive than their rural conspecifics. Apart from average behavioural differences between rural and urban populations, the variation of such behaviours within these populations may differ, enabling them to deal with the spatially and temporally heterogeneous habitats within cities. Here we tested average differences in behaviour as well as the components of variation in these behaviours in rural and urban populations of shrews. We chose two shrew species which differ in life history and time since synurbanization: the fast-paced Sorex araneus and the slowpaced Crocidura russula. We conducted repeated tests of boldness and aggression on 86 shrews. As predicted, urban shrews of both species were bolder than rural ones, although not more aggressive. Additionally, urban populations showed higher among-individual variation in both boldness and aggression, that is, urban individuals differed more from each other in their behaviour than rural individuals, independent of any within-individual variation. All differences were smaller in S. araneus than C. russula, possibly due to their generally bolder behaviour and shorter time since synurbanization. Large behavioural differences among the individuals of urban populations might allow them to better cope with the various and constantly changing challenges of city life for animals.

AB To assess the welfare of captive animals, validated measures, so-called 'welfare indicators', are required. We used a triangulation approach to investigate the extent to which different measures converged to provide corroborating evidence of welfare. Laying hens were exposed to living conditions designed to be generally preferred (GP) or generally nonpreferred (GNP), using previous studies of chickens' majority preferences for resources and environments. The hens were also tested at the end of the study to identify their individual preferences for these living conditions, assigned to groups that showed an individual preference, or nonpreference, for their own experimental housing, regardless of whether it was generally preferred or not (IP and INP). Both GP and IP birds showed more ground-foraging behaviour, and lower pulse rates during handling, than GNP and INP birds. Individual preference was associated with more optimistic-like judgement biases when birds were tested after 6 weeks of exposure to these living conditions, but not after 24 weeks. Serum blood glucose levels were also lower in hens showing individual preferences for their experimental living conditions. General preferences were associated with a number of measures, including higher rates of ground-foraging behaviour and lower faecal water content (after both 6 and 24 weeks), lower pulse rate during handling and greater tibia strength and stiffness post mortem. There were no associations between judgement bias and other candidate welfare indicators, but it is not clear whether this represents evidence of absence or merely absence of evidence. Overall, the different approaches did not converge to identify a precise state of animal welfare, although some measures (preference, stress indicators: pulse rate, faecal water and blood glucose, foraging behaviour) were aligned consistently across timescales. We conclude that further work is needed to establish which alternative measures of affective state might be more appropriate indicators of animal welfare.

AB Interspecific aggression has important fitness consequences across the animal kingdom and can be especially important during species invasions, where asymmetric interactions between native and invasive species can lead to native species declines. We investigated the immediate behavioural consequences of interspecific interactions for a native species, the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis, after an invasion by a closely related invasive species, the Cuban brown anole, Anolis sagrei. We housed captive populations of green anoles (6 males, 6 females) in large outdoor enclosures and recorded their display behaviours (displays/min), activity levels (movements/min) and habitat use (2D and 3D home range size, perch height) for 10 days. We then introduced brown anoles and recorded the green anoles' behaviours for another 10 days, seeking differences between pre-and post-invasion behaviours. We recorded behavioural interactions between individuals (i.e. headbob and dewlap displays, chases, mating attempts, fights and copulations) throughout the study. To serve as a density control, we duplicated the experiment in a second enclosure using green anoles as 'invaders'. We performed the experiment eight times with two densities of invaders: high (4 males, 4 females) and low (2 males, 2 females). We found that green anoles have smaller two-dimensional and three-dimensional home ranges and higher average perch heights after invasions but that these changes resulted from increased population densities rather than aggression from brown anole invaders. Furthermore, although green and brown anoles did display to each other, both species preferentially interacted with conspecifics and escalated aggressive behaviours between the two species (e.g. lock-jawed fights) rarely occurred. Taken together, these findings indicate that high brown anole population densities, rather than direct interference competition, could be driving green anole displacement across the brown anole's invasive range.(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal architecture is diverse in form and structure, and extraordinarily intricate, often facilitated by the collective behaviour of several individuals. Social spider webs are one such example of animal architecture, robustly supporting the collective colony weight and intercepting prey for the entire colony. Thus, these webs are interesting, yet little studied from architectural and behavioural perspectives. In the social spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum we examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of web architecture and tracked web development in different group sizes through controlled experiments and image analysis. Geometrical parameters including coordination number, and pore size remained constant across group sizes. Silk density was highest near the retreat (nest) and decreased with radial distance for all group sizes. We tested the silk conservation hypothesis, a proposed benefit for the evolution of group living, by asking whether (1) total silk investment increases with group size and (2) per capita silk investment decreases with group size. Our results indicate that while larger colonies produced more silk than smaller ones, per capita silk investment did not decline in larger groups. We propose further investigations into the roles of ecological factors and body condition in shaping individuals' silk investment with consequences for web architecture and colony fitness.

AB Variation in the distribution and abundance of food resources are key factors affecting animal sociality. In environments with variable resources, dynamic social organization, such as the fission and fusion of groups, is thought to increase the benefits of group living, while reducing the costs. We investigated the relationship between social organization and prey abundance in a highly social predator, the killer whale. This was achieved by analysing 12 years (2006-2018) of seasonally delineated (coinciding with high and low prey abundances) association data obtained from nearly 90 000 identification photographs of killer whales in-shore at Marion Island in the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean. Association network measures were compared between periods using randomized association matrices. Half-weight association index, degree, number of modules and group size were all greater during periods of high prey abundance while mean distance, centrality and modularity were lower during this same period. Results suggest that killer whales at Marion Island were more social, formed larger groups and had more associations during periods of high prey abundance. During periods of lower prey abundance, fewer interactions, stronger clustering and more division in the association network were observed. These results indicate that the social organization of this population of killer whales is seasonally dynamic, with increased sociality measures coinciding with periods of higher prey abundance. These results are similar to those of other social species, emphasizing the importance of resource abundance as a driver of social structure in animal societies.

AB Reproductive behaviour is generally under strong natural and sexual selection, meaning that variation in mate attraction investment reveals important fitness trade-offs. Nevertheless, in many taxa with sexspecific displays, individuals differ considerably in such investment. Male white-ruffed manakins, Corapipo altera (Pipridae), exhibit dramatic variation in display investment, despite having a mating system shaped by strong sexual selection. We tested three alternative hypotheses that could explain this variation: (1) individual quality and condition, (2) competition or (3) cooperation. We manipulated the social environment of male manakins at display sites in two experiments. First, we increased the acoustic signalling around focal males' display sites by broadcasting the sounds of other displaying males to simulate elevated display of neighbouring males. Second, we temporarily prevented neighbouring males from using their display sites, thereby increasing the competition at focal display sites. Males reduced rates of vocalization in response to elevated acoustic signalling, suggesting that males may cooperate with neighbours to advertise the locations of leks, minimizing their individual effort when possible. The number of individuals at the focal display site and the number of silent displays increased when neighbours were prevented from displaying nearby, consistent with the competition hypothesis. However, the constancy in time investment and rates of other display behaviours throughout both manipulations suggests that male quality or condition underlies much of the individual variation in behaviour at display sites. Overall, our results are consistent with cooperation and individual quality mediating individual investment in display site advertisement. While manipulations created opportunities for competition, the responses of focal males were not consistent with antagonist social interactions affecting investment in display. This work demonstrates the importance of both intrinsic and social drivers shaping investment in courtship behaviour and highlights the potential for multimodal displays to facilitate cooperation.

AB When animals move along well-established pathways, sensory cues along the path may provide valuable information concerning other individuals that have used the same route. Yet the extent to which animals use pathways as sources of public social information is poorly understood. Here we quantified the responses of wild African savannah elephants, Loxodonta africana, to olfactory information along natural elephant pathways, habitual routes that link predictable critical resources in the environment. By monitoring the behaviour of elephants travelling on pathways in a predominantly male study population, we found that elephants were highly olfactorily responsive to pathway substrate. Lone travellers were more responsive than elephants travelling in groups, suggesting elephants without social companions may be more dependent on olfactory cues on pathways during navigation. Furthermore, by experimentally presenting olfactory cues on pathways we found that male African elephants exhibited focused olfactory responses to urine cues of same-sex conspecifics for at least 48 h from time of deposition, and that urine from adult elephants was more likely to elicit vomeronasal system responses than subadult urine. African elephants may therefore potentially be able to discern the age and maturity of individuals they can expect to encounter in the environment from remote urine cues on pathways. We suggest elephant pathways act as a public information resource, assisting navigating elephants via the depositing of urine and dung by previous travellers on the route. These results could help inform elephant management, which may manipulate olfactory information on pathways in high human-wildlife conflict areas, or could use olfactory urine cues to improve the efficiency of corridors that link protected areas for elephants.

AB Behaviours are highly plastic phenotypic traits whose variation depends on the short-term response to external stimuli (contextual plasticity) and on the long-term response to past experiences (developmental plasticity). Despite this great flexibility, behaviours often show individual differences that are consistent across time and context (i.e. ?animal personality?). By adopting a behavioural-reaction-norm (BRN) approach, we used a factorial common garden experiment to investigate the effects of contextual and developmental plasticity on the antipredator behaviour of treefrog tadpoles, Hyla intermedia. We raised 96 tadpoles from eight half sib-full sib families under different biotic (predation risk) and abiotic (shading) environmental conditions and described their activity and spatial behaviour in experimental arenas with either a caged predator, a caged conspecific or an empty cage. Tadpoles raised with predator cues were always less active and stayed further away from caged predators than their predator-na?ve siblings. Tadpoles raised in the shade were less active than those raised in the sun. Not only was the raising environment responsible for among-individual variation but it also acted at the within-individual level by affecting behavioural repeatability, which was higher in predator-na?ve than in predator-experienced tadpoles. Besides the important role of the environment, this study also shows consistent variation in BRNs with body size and time: tadpoles became more active as they got larger and their activity increased with time in the presence of caged predators, decreased in the presence of empty cages and did not change with caged conspecifics. These results suggest that the effects of past and present experiences on tadpole behaviour vary with time as a consequence of growth and development. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Consistent interindividual differences in behaviour (i.e. animal personality variation) can influence a range of ecological and evolutionary processes, including predation. Variation between individual predators in commonly measured personality traits, such as boldness and activity, has previously been linked to encounter rates with their prey. Given the strong selection on predators to respond to prey, individual predators may also vary consistently in their response to prey in a manner that is specific to the context of predation. By studying wild piscivorous fish (pike cichlids, Crenicichla frenata) in their natural environment using experimental presentations of prey and control stimuli, we show that individual predators differ consistently in the amount of time spent near prey. Crucially, these differences were not explained by the behaviour of the same individuals in control presentations (the same apparatus lacking prey), suggesting that variation in the response to prey reflects a 'predator personality trait' that is independent from other individual traits (body size, boldness and/or neophobia) and environmental factors. Pike cichlids that spent more time near prey also attacked prey at a higher rate. These findings imply that the likely risk posed by individual predators cannot always be adequately predicted from typically studied axes of personality variation.

AB Understanding the patterns and processes related to sexual dimorphism and sex differences in diverse animal taxa is a foundational research topic in ecology and evolution. Within the realm of animal communication, studies have traditionally focused on male signals, assuming that female choice and male-male competition have promoted sex differences via elaboration of male traits, but selection on females also has the potential to drive divergence. Here, we describe female song in barn swallows, Hirundo rustica erythrogaster, for the first time, report rates of female song production and couple song data with plumage data to explore the relative degree to which sex differences in phenotypic traits are consistent with contemporary selection on males versus females. During previous intensive study of male song over 2 years, we opportunistically recorded songs for 15 females, with matched phenotypic and fitness data. We randomly selected 15 high-quality samples from our larger male data set to test whether sex differences in song and plumage are more strongly associated with fledgling success for females or genetic paternity for males. Analyses included 35 potential sexual signals including 22 song parameters and 13 plumage traits. Outcomes indicate that female songs were used in multiple contexts, restricted primarily to the beginning of the breeding season; song traits showed greater sexual differentiation than visual plumage traits; and trait correlations with reproductive success in females, rather than males, predicted sex-based differences in song and plumage. These results are consistent with phylogenetic studies showing that sex-based phenotypic differences are driven by changes in females, highlighting the potential role of female trait evolution in explaining patterns of sexual differentiation. To achieve a better understanding of sex differences and dimorphism, we require comprehensive studies that measure the same traits in males and females and their fitness consequences.

AB Sexual signals are often elaborate, even spectacular, behaviours. The reproductive rewards for successful display are great, but so are the potential costs. These costs include not only the resources needed to produce a display, but also resources required if the display evokes attack from a rival or predator. To maximize payoff, individuals must monitor both internal and external cues to adjust display effort. We know surprisingly little about how these competing demands are balanced. Leptin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue, regulates energy allocation to functions as diverse as feeding, sleep, reproduction and immunity. Despite evidence that leptin influences reproductive trade-offs, its role as a putative regulator of courtship display is poorly understood. Here we examine the use of interoceptive and exteroceptive cues to modulate display effort in Alston's singing mouse, Scotinomys teguina. We manipulated individual perception of energy balance through intraperitoneal injection of exogenous leptin, and we manipulated social context through playback of conspecific song. Leptin-injected mice responded with song to playback more frequently and more quickly than saline-injected controls. Although leptin seems to promote increased song effort, we found that leptin also reduced song duration. Song effort increased after leptin injection and playback of conspecific songs. Understanding the mechanisms by which animals respond to internal and external cues broadens our understanding of context-dependent display as well as behavioural plasticity more generally.

AB The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis posits that personality traits (i.e. consistent individual differences in behaviour) are linked to life history and fitness. Specifically, fast-paced individuals are predicted to be proactive (i.e. active and aggressive) with an earlier age at first reproduction, a shorter life span and higher fecundity than slow-paced individuals. Environmental conditions and sex differences may be important in maintaining behavioural and life history variation in populations and may influence the covariance of personality with life history or lifetime fitness. However, these effects are rarely tested together. We investigated whether the occurrence of a resource pulse (called a mast year) during adulthood altered the associations between personality and life history traits or lifetime offspring production in adult North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus. Despite accounting for environmental context during adulthood, we found no evidence of an overall pace-of-life syndrome in this population as personality was not associated with age at first reproduction or longevity in either sex. Males and females had similar activity levels, but females were more aggressive, potentially due to the fitness benefits of protecting their offspring from predation. In all females, regardless of mast experience, there was no association between activity and lifetime pup production, but there was a positive association between aggression and lifetime pup production. In males that experienced a mast, there was a positive association between lifetime pup production and both activity and aggression. In males that did not experience a mast, there was no association between activity and lifetime pup production, but there was a negative association between aggression and lifetime pup production. Lifetime recruit production (number of adult offspring recruited into the breeding population) in either sex was not influenced by activity or aggression regardless of mast experience. Overall, our results suggest that the infrequent occurrence of mast years may contribute to maintaining variation in personality traits in red squirrels.

AB The idea that animals gain a higher food intake rate when foraging in larger groups has been reported in many studies. However, some studies suggested that the number of neighbours under surveillance may play a more important role in affecting food intake rate than flock size. In addition, the effect of the number of neighbours should also depend on the position of an individual within a flock. To test these hypotheses, we examined the effects of flock size, number of neighbours and position within a flock on foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate of wintering greater white-fronted geese, Anser albifrons. We observed the foraging behaviours of 490 individual geese from 71 flocks during December 2016-March 2017 at Shengjin Lake, Anhui, China. We found that mean foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate were not influenced by flock size, whereas, at the individual scale these variables were significantly affected by the number of neighbours and position within a flock. Moreover, the effect of the number of neighbours on the foraging parameters did not differ between central and peripheral individuals, despite central individuals always having greater foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate regardless of the number of neighbours. Both the decreased foraging time and decreased foraging efficiency indicated a potential increase in cryptic competition from neighbours. More neighbours contributed to a decreased intake rate. Our study highlights the possible effects of cryptic competition among neighbours on their foraging behaviour. We hypothesize that an increase in intraspecific competition between neighbours in areas of shrinking wetland habitats may contribute to population declines of wintering geese and other wildfowl.

AB It has been argued that the influx of women into the fields of primatology and animal behaviour caused a transformation in conventional beliefs, particularly with regard to our understanding of male-female sexual dynamics and the role of females in animal societies. Women members of the Animal Behavior Society (ABS) have played important roles in challenging the accepted wisdom in our field. Simultaneously, at least during the last 40 years, women have become an increasingly vibrant force within the ABS, including playing significant roles within the leadership of the society. As a result, animal behaviour represents a notable exception with regard to gender parity when compared to some other scientific disciplines. This paper examines the synergisms between the influx of women into animal behaviour and novel advances in the field. It also addresses questions debated by feminist scholars regarding the reasons and mechanisms for women's impacts and whether feminism is a factor in disciplinary transformations. Finally, it suggests the integration of women in animal behaviour provides a blueprint for inclusion of other groups under-represented in the sciences.

AB Chemical signalling is widespread across animal taxa. Even birds, once thought to have little or no sense of smell, are now known to possess a fully functional olfactory system and may thus respond to conspecific and heterospecific chemical signals. In birds, body odour derives primarily from preen oil, a complex chemical mixture that is potentially rich in information: for example, preen oil chemical composition differs between the sexes and among species. Hypothesizing that songbirds attend to preen oil odour cues in the contexts of intra- and interspecific communication, we presented breeding-condition adult song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, with preen oil odour cues in two-choice tests. We compared time spent in a Y-maze arm scented with preen oil from same-sex conspecifics relative to the absence of such odour; from opposite-sex relative to same-sex conspecifics; and from female brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater (frequent brood parasites of song sparrows), relative to the absence of such odour. The time spent with same-sex conspecific preen oil was not significantly different than time spent without odour. However, both males and females spent more time with opposite-sex than same-sex preen oil. We found a sex-by-stimulus interaction with respect to female cowbird odour: male song sparrows spent more time with cowbird preen oil than without odour, but female song sparrows showed the opposite pattern. Our findings show that even relatively nonsocial species can attend to the information contained in preen oil secretions. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID CONFORMITY; INFORMATION; COHESION
AB The costs and benefits that come from being part of a group have most often been categorized by their adaptive function, such as reducing predation risk or increasing foraging competition. However, collective behaviours may also be characterized by several different behavioural mechanisms. For example, individuals may have a relatively fixed attraction to any group, as well as being able to flexibly use the information they derive from observing the group to make choices. We label these two mechanisms 'fixed' and 'informational'. In most situations, both mechanisms encourage group cohesion. Here, we placed fixed and informational mechanisms in conflict by training zebrafish, Danio rerio, to move away from or ignore a conspecific group in order to find food. Fish failed to learn the task when the group was visible to them while making their choice, but they were able to learn the task when the group was visually obscured. Fish trained to approach the group to find food were able to learn to do so under both conditions. Our results suggest that fish exhibit a prepotent group-joining response, even when this is potentially maladaptive - a type of conformity. This response can be inhibited under certain conditions, such as when the group is not immediately visible. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The rarity of facultative asexuality in animals is an evolutionary puzzle. It has been hypothesized that male factors that influence female performance could be key to this paradox because parthenogens that fail to obtain fitness-increasing stimulation from males at certain life stages may reproduce poorly via parthenogenesis. However, given that certain male factors can reduce female fitness, an alternative hypothesis is that exposure to male factors could exert a sexually antagonistic suppressive effect on females' capacity for parthenogenesis. To test the contrasting predictions of these two hypotheses, we used the spiny leaf stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum, a species capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction, to investigate developmental age-dependent effects of nonmating exposure to males on female behaviour and parthenogenetic performance, with exposure to other females as a control. We found that females reared with immature males were more likely than controls to show resistance-like behaviours as juveniles. Moreover, as adults, females reared with immature males produced asexual eggs with greatly depressed hatching success, resulting in a two-fold reduction in asexual performance compared to controls. By contrast, nonmating exposure to adult males at maturity had little effect on female behaviour or performance. However, females maintained exclusively with other females had slightly reduced fecundity, perhaps due to deprivation of fecundity-increasing male stimulation. Our results suggest that interactions with juvenile males can suppress the development of females' parthenogenetic capacity, an effect that appears to be sexually antagonistic. Such effects could help to explain the rarity of facultative asexuality in animal systems. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   COMPETITION
AB Intraspecific competition for indivisible resources can trigger the expression of agonistic behaviour in individuals of many animal species. Aggressiveness and conflict resolution may be influenced by the value individuals place on the resource (subjective resource value) but also by genetic relatedness between competitors. The ability to differentiate genetically related from unrelated individuals (i.e. kin recognition) can play a key role in the dynamics of agonistic interactions between individuals. In this context, the theory of kin selection predicts that competitors should display fewer aggressive behaviours towards closely related individuals. Recognition of kin can be driven by the perception of (1) genetically linked phenotypic cues (phenotypic matching) and/or (2) environmental cues (familiarity). In the hymenopteran solitary parasitoid Eupelmus vuilleti, individuals develop on larvae and pupae of their host, Callosobruchus maculatus, which infest cowpea seeds, Vigna unguiculata. Eupelmus vuilleti females can fight for the host on which they lay their eggs. Here, we investigated the effect of genetic relatedness (genotype) and familiarity (the seed containing the host on which they develop as juveniles) on aggressiveness and contest outcome over hosts in E. vuilleti females. We first demonstrated that the probability of a conflict escalating was affected by the interaction between genetic relatedness and familiarity among females. We then found that familiarity alone affected the likelihood of contest resolution. The occurrence of escalated conflicts was reduced between related and familiar females, and contests were more likely to be clearly resolved when occurring between familiar competitors. Our results highlight a parasitoid wasp's abilities to identify and discriminate kin, showing for the first time that two kin recognition components can interact in mediating competition avoidance for resource access in a solitary insect species.

AB Theory predicts that the outcome of mating interactions should be influenced by the condition of both males and females. First, females should base their mating decisions on reliable cues about male quality, which are often condition dependent. Second, the costs and/or benefits of being choosy during mating may depend on the female's own condition. Finally, when males divide their time between different mating tactics, investment in alternative mating tactics may depend on male condition. Here we examined the effects of male and female nutritional condition on mating behaviour in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We manipulated male and female nutritional condition either during sexual maturation or at the time of mating and monitored female mate choice and male mating tactics. We found that females in poor condition (i.e. starved either during sexual maturation or at the time of mating) preferred to mate with males in good condition over males that were starved at the time of mating. In contrast, well-fed females showed no such preference. Furthermore, males that were starved during sexual maturation increased their investment in alternative mating tactics by spending more time signalling for females. Our results add to evidence suggesting that females in poor condition bias mating towards males in good condition although it is currently unclear why these females are choosier in this species.

AB The fear of predation can have marked effects on an individual's phenotype, and the resulting phenotype is selected to increase an individual's chance of survival during a predator encounter. However, for species with inducible defences, such defensive phenotypes must be costly enough to prevent them from becoming constitutive. While morphological and life-history adaptations have been shown to incur costs, much less research has been done on the costs of behavioural adaptations, which are often thought of as plastic, with limited associated costs. In this study, we document the costs of a high-risk behavioural phenotype. Under high-risk conditions, damselfish are known to exhibit a high-risk phenotype, which among other traits, confer a significant survival advantage during encounters with predators. We exposed juvenile damselfish to a high-risk or low-risk environment for 4 days. We then set up competitive encounters between size-matched pairs of high-risk and low-risk conspecifics. To test for context dependency, we also ran trials when the pair was exposed to a novel predator odour during the competitive encounter. Our results indicate that low-risk fish were the superior competitors in a low-risk environment, but not in a high-risk environment. This result may be explained by an increase in motivation by high-risk individuals to seek shelter from a potential predation threat. Our results highlight (1) the existence of significant costs, even for rapidly induced behavioural phenotypes, and (2) the importance of investigating the adaptive value of phenotypes within the context in which they develop.

AB In humans and some other mammals and birds, the development of communication systems requires social feedback. How do such systems evolve from ancestral states featuring innate developmental mechanisms? We report evidence of a novel form of social ontogeny in the communication system of Enchenopa treehoppers that suggests an answer to this question. These insects use plant-borne vibrational signals throughout their lives. Signal repertoires of nymphs and adults differed and showed sexually dimorphic ontogenetic trajectories; individual differences projected into some of the features of adult signals and mate preferences. Signals and mate preferences differed between adults reared in isolation and adults reared in groups, but even individuals reared in isolation developed species-typical signals. In this type of social ontogeny, peer inputs cause variation in signals and preferences. Thus, even innate communication systems can be socially malleable. This may set the stage for the evolution of obligate social feedbacks in communication: the starting point is already socially plastic and does not require learning to arise de novo.

AB Animal personality traits and the emergence of behavioural syndromes, i.e. between-individual correlation of behaviours, are commonly quantified from behavioural observations in controlled environments. Subjecting large and elusive wildlife to controlled test situations is, however, rarely possible, suggesting that ecologists should exploit alternative measures of behaviours for quantifying differences between individuals. Our goal was to test whether movement and space use data can be used to quantify behavioural syndromes in the wild. We quantified six behaviours from GPS and dual motion sensor tracking devices of 46 adult female brown bears followed in southcentral Sweden over the summer and early autumn. As well as daily travel distance, an indicator for activity, and daily displacement, an indicator for exploration, we quantified four behaviours that increase a bear's likelihood of encountering humans and could thus serve as indicators for boldness: diurnality, selection for roads and selection for two open habitat types, bogs and clearcuts, with low lateral cover. We tested (1) whether behaviours showed repeatable between-individual variation (animal personality) and (2) whether behaviours were correlated between individuals and thus formed a behavioural syndrome. Repeatability of behaviours ranged from 0.16 to 0.61 confirming between-individual variation in movement, activity and space use. A multivariate mixed model revealed significant positive correlations between travel distance, displacement and diurnality, suggesting the existence of an activity-exploration and potentially partial boldness syndrome in our bear population. Selection for exposed or human-frequented habitats were uncorrelated with the activity-exploration syndrome and with each other, albeit there was a trend for stronger road avoidance by bears that readily used clearcuts. We show that large tracking data sets can be used to quantify between-individual correlation in spatial behaviours. We suggest that delineating behavioural types from wildlife tracking data will be of increasing interest because of the importance of animal personality for ecological processes, wildlife conservation and human-wildlife coexistence.

AB Animals may modify their behaviour towards conspecifics to manage social conflict that arises due to group living. Given that social conflict is likely to vary through space, we would expect individuals to adjust their social behaviour, accordingly, across their home range. This, however, remains to be explicitly investigated. Here, we used a longitudinal behavioural data set on eastern water dragons, Intellagama lesueurii, a social reptile, to investigate the extent to which social tactics (individual patterns of long-term social preferences and avoidances) vary across individuals' home ranges. We found that expression of both social tactics increased within the core home range, which also coincided with increased population density and frequency of agonistic displays. Furthermore, we found that the magnitude of this spatial behavioural shift was sex dependent, with females exhibiting a greater increase in both social tactics than males. Together, our results illustrate that dragons modify their social tactics across space, highlighting the importance of accounting for the spatial dimension when studying social behaviour. Our observations further suggest that spatial social plasticity may be key to balancing costs associated with increased social conflict. We encourage new studies to test this link, which may provide important insight into the adaptive significance of spatial social plasticity.

AB Individuals often show considerable variance in social behaviour and aggression, leading to defined social roles. Removal of individuals with particular roles from groups may have impacts on group function, leaving those groups less able to locate critical resources and avoid danger. In recreational fisheries, capture by humans constitutes a mortality risk, and therefore angling has the potential to fundamentally alter social structure in exploited populations if individuals with defined social roles are disproportionately captured. However, little work has examined the linkage between social behaviour and angling vulnerability. To address this gap, we conducted a study on bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, a freshwater fish known to be socially gregarious, and a common target of recreational anglers in North America. Fish were angled in a naturalistic pond setting, and a subset of captured and uncaptured fish was then assessed for sociability in a shoaling assay and aggression/dominance in paired dyadic contests. Results showed a significant effect of time spent in the social zone on capture status, with captured individuals spending significantly more time near a transparent divider separating it from a shoal of conspecifics compared to uncaptured fish. Dominance was not associated with angling vulnerability, and sociability was not linked with dominance. Collectively, these results show that more social bluegill are more likely to be captured by anglers. This could in turn lead to decreased social functionality in exploited populations as a result of the removal of particularly social individuals, as well as possible evolution of social behaviour in exploited populations due to this selection.

AB Animals living in groups can show substantial variation in social traits and this affects their social organization. However, as the specific mechanisms driving this organization are difficult to identify in already organized groups typically found in the wild, the contribution of interindividual variation to group level behaviour remains enigmatic. Here, we present results of an experiment to create and compare groups that vary in social organization, and study how individual behaviour varies between these groups. We iteratively sorted individuals between groups of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, by ranking the groups according to their directional alignment and then mixing similar groups. Over the rounds of sorting the consistency of the group rankings increased, producing groups that varied significantly in key social behaviours such as collective activity and group cohesion. The repeatability of the underlying individual behaviour was then estimated by comparing the experimental data to simulations. At the level of basic locomotion, individuals in more coordinated groups displayed stronger interactions with the centre of the group, and weaker interactions with their nearest neighbours. We propose that this provides the basis for a passive phenotypic assortment mechanism that may explain the structures of social networks in the wild.

AB Many animals perform their migratory movements within discrete time periods of the day/night cycle. Among migratory songbirds the majority of species generally restrict their migratory flights to the night. This makes their nocturnal departure timing a key factor determining the potential duration of migratory flights, which in turn affects their travel speed. Previous correlative studies revealed that part of the variation in nocturnal departure timing of migratory songbirds is explained by the respective length of the night, with birds departing earlier when nights are short. As the length of the night is inextricably linked to the time within the season, it has been impossible to ascertain which of the two factors drives variation in nocturnal departure timing. To virtually decouple both factors, that is, length of the night and time within the season, we conducted a series of short-term experiments using migratory songbirds caught at stopover. These birds were exposed to nights of either natural or shortened length. We found that birds exposed to shortened nights showed slightly earlier nocturnal departures than those exposed to the natural length of the night. This coincided with a seasonal pattern in the start of nocturnal migratory behaviour (migratory restlessness during the experimental period and actual departures following release) among birds, irrespective of the experimental treatment. Based on these results we suggest that birds' nocturnal departure timing pursues an innate seasonal schedule of migratory activity, which is adjusted to the current length of the night. Such a mechanistic framework provides the potential for cross-calibrating birds' innate seasonal schedule of migratory activity with the current spatiotemporal progress during migration.

AB In species that advertise their toxicity to predators through visual signals, there is considerable variation among individuals in both signal appearance and levels of defence. Parental effects, a type of nongenetic inheritance, may play a key role in creating and maintaining this within-species diversity in aposematic signals; however, a comprehensive test of this notion is lacking. Using the ladybird Adalia bipunctata, we assessed how egg coloration and defence level (concentration of the toxic alkaloid (-)-adaline) is influenced both by simulated predation risk in the egg-laying environment and by parental phenotype (coloration and toxin level). We found that egg toxin level and colour were predicted by parental phenotype but were not altered in response to cues of egg predators. Egg luminance (lightness) was positively correlated with paternal elytral luminance, while maternal toxin level positively predicted egg toxin level. In response to egg predator cues, ladybird mothers altered the timing of laying and total egg number, but not egg toxin level or colour. It appears therefore that in A. bipunctata variation between individuals of the same morph in the colour and toxin level of the eggs they lay, that is, egg aposematic phenotype, is more strongly influenced by individual variation in parental aposematic traits than by environmental cues of egg predation risk. Furthermore, these results provide the first indication that, in a warningly coloured species, male coloration may play a dual role as predator deterrent and indicator of paternal quality, influencing maternal investment in offspring.

AB The selection of flight speed (airspeed) in migrating birds depends on multiple internal and external factors, such as wing morphology, weight and winds. Adjustment with respect to side winds to maintain an intended track direction may include a shift in heading direction and/or an increase in airspeed. Compensation for cross-winds cannot always be achieved if visual references are lacking or may not even be beneficial if adaptive wind drift is favourable. Flock size is an additional, although often neglected, factor that could influence the airspeed of birds. Here, we show that responses to cross-winds to achieve compensation differed on a small geographical scale (a few kilometres) in migrating shorebirds, where the availability of topographical features such as coastlines may play an important role for the birds' behaviour. We also show that airspeed was significantly influenced by flock size in three species of shorebirds, increasing with increasing flock size. This is contrary to the prediction based on the hypothesis of energy saving by flight in flock formation, but in agreement with empirical findings for migrating terns. The reason why flock size influences airspeed remains unclear, but we propose a mechanistic explanation based on the largest/heaviest individual(s) determining the speed of the flock.

AB Human activity can dramatically affect personality traits in birds and small mammals. However, we know very little about how anthropogenic disturbance shapes personality in mammalian carnivores, and whether the personality traits that may be affected have fitness consequences in human-dominated landscapes. We adapted standard experiments commonly used to assess personality in captive animals to compare three personality traits in 72 wild juvenile spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, living either in areas heavily disturbed by human activity or in areas with low levels of disturbance. We examined neophobia, defined as the tendency to avoid unfamiliar things, exploration, defined as the number of different ways an individual interacts with an object, and boldness, defined as an individual's tendency to take risks. To assess neophobia and exploration, we measured individuals' responses to a novel object, and to assess boldness, we measured the hyaenas' propensity to enter a wire-mesh box to obtain food. Juvenile spotted hyaenas living in low-disturbance areas were significantly more neophobic and less exploratory than individuals living in high-disturbance areas. This is consistent with results obtained with birds and small mammals; however, unlike these other taxa, hyaenas living in low-disturbance areas were bolder than individuals living in high-disturbance areas. The expression of some of these personality traits was also affected by the subject's social rank and the presence of a littermate, but not by subject age or sex. Of the three traits, only boldness predicted survival to adulthood: less bold individuals were significantly more likely to survive than bolder individuals, in both high-disturbance and low-disturbance habitats. We propose that behavioural or physiological maternal effects may be shaping offspring temperament differences related to disturbance. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Stress physiology is thought to contribute to individual differences in behaviour. In part this reflects the fact that canonical personality measures consist of responses to challenges, including novel objects and environments. Exposure to novelty is typically assumed to induce a moderate increase in glucocorticoids (CORT), although this has rarely been tested. We tested this assumption using great tits, Parus major, selected for divergent personalities (bold-fast and shy-slow explorers), predicting that the shy birds would exhibit higher CORT following exposure to a novel object. We also scored behavioural responses to the novel object, predicting that bold birds would more frequently approach the novel object and exhibit more abnormal repetitive behaviours. We found that the presence of a novel object did induce a moderate CORT response, but selection lines did not differ in the magnitude of this response. Furthermore, although both selection lines showed a robust CORT elevation to a subsequent restraint stressor, the CORT response was stronger in bold birds and this effect was specific to novel object exposure. Shy birds showed a strong positive phenotypic correlation between CORT concentrations following the novel object exposure and the subsequent restraint stress. Behaviourally, the selection lines differed in their response during novel object exposure: as predicted, bold birds more frequently approached the novel object and shy birds more strongly decreased overall locomotion during the novel object trial, but birds from both selection lines showed significant and similar frequencies of abnormal repetitive behaviours during novel object exposure. Our findings support the hypothesis that personality emerges as a result of correlated selection on behaviour and underlying endocrine mechanisms and suggest that the relationship between endocrine stress physiology and personality is context dependent.

AB Collective decision making is one of the main mechanisms of organization in social insects. However, individual decision making can also play an important role, depending on the type of foraging behaviour. In the termite-hunting ant species Megaponera analis information about foraging sites is collected by only a handful of individual scouts that have to convey this information to the colony as accurately as possible to optimize their foraging behaviour. We therefore looked at predictions made by optimal foraging theory to better understand the interplay between collective and individual decision making in this obligate group-raiding predator. We found a clear positive relation between raid size (200-500 ants) and termite abundance at the foraging site thereby confirming predictions of the maximization of energy theory. Furthermore, selectivity of the food source increased with distance, thus confirming central place prediction theory. The confirmation of these theories suggests that individual scouts must be the main driver behind raid size, choice and raiding behaviour. The marginal value theorem was also confirmed by our results: time spent at the hunting ground increased with distance and prey quantity. This raises questions on how foraging time at the food source is regulated in a group-hunting predator. Hunger decreased selectivity of scouts with respect to food sources, while average raid size increased and more scouts left the nest in search of prey, thus implying that scouts are aware of the hunger state of the colony and adapt their decision making accordingly. Remarkably, most central place foraging behaviours in M. analis were not achieved by collective decisions but rather by individual decisions of scout ants. Thus, 1% of the colony (10-20 scouts) decided the fate and foraging efficiency of the remaining 99%. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Proximate mechanisms underpinning between-individual variation in repeatedly expressed behaviours (animal personality) remain poorly understood. Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body size. Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1) test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3) determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural syndromes. Body size explained 40% of the between-individual variance in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P. corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal personality.

AB By 2.5 years of age humans are more skilful than other apes on a set of social, but not nonsocial, cognitive tasks. Individual differences in human infants, but not chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are also explained by correlated variance in these cooperative communicative skills. Relative to nonhuman apes, domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, perform more like human infants in cooperative communicative tasks, but it is unknown whether dog and human cognition share a similar underlying structure. We tested 552 dogs in a large-scale test battery modelled after similar work with humans and nonhuman apes. Unlike chimpanzees, but similarly to humans, individual differences in dogs were explained by correlated variance in skills for solving cooperative communicative problems. Direct comparisons of data from all three species revealed similar patterns of individual differences in cooperative communication between human infants (N = 105) and domestic dogs (N = 430), which were not observed in chimpanzees (N = 106). Future research will be needed to examine whether the observed similarities are a result of similar psychological mechanisms and evolutionary processes in the dog and human lineages.

   HERITABILITY
AB Male secondary sexual traits and female mate choice traits must contain heritable variation for sexual selection to operate. However, for female mate choice, especially, this is poorly known. To complicate matters, both male sexual traits and female mate choice typically show condition dependence, implying that environmental effects probably play an important synergistic role. Using a cross-fostering design, we therefore aimed to disentangle genetic, environmental and their potential interacting effects to investigate how they affect the expression of a sexually selected trait (here birdsong) and female mate choice. To assess environmental effects, we focused on the role of the social environment and thus on learned components. Among the different male song traits investigated, we found a high heritability for song bout length and song bout repertoire, as well as an intriguing gene-by-environment interaction for song bout repertoire. Specifically, the tutor appeared to negatively affect the song bout repertoire of the tutee when his genetic father had a large song bout repertoire but had a positive effect on descendants from fathers with small song bout repertoires. In contrast, we did not detect significant heritability in female mate choice. Female mate choice contained a learned component as females significantly disfavoured their foster father in the mate choice tests, indicating a learned inbreeding avoidance. Thus, our study provides important insights into the role of the social environment for both birdsong and female mate choice. However, the absence of a heritable component in female mate choice suggests a need for studies investigating the heritability of female preferences for (heritable) male song traits in order to gain a better understanding of a potential coevolution between male sexual traits and female mate choice. Overall, our results suggest that indirect genetic effects acting during the pre- and postfledging social contexts may play a prominent role in sexual selection.

AB In recent years, there has been considerable research effort to determine whether other species exhibit prosocial motivations parallel to those of humans; however, these studies have focused primarily on primates, and with mixed results. We presented captive ravens with a modified prosocial choice task which aimed to address several criticisms of previous methods by including a stringent pretraining regime and a set-up that disentangles motivation to provision a conspecific from motivation to feed next to one. In this task six subjects received no rewards for themselves but could choose to deliver food rewards to either a conspecific or an empty, inaccessible compartment. Subjects did not demonstrate any prosocial tendencies (i.e. they did not preferentially choose to reward a conspecific over the empty compartment), and instead often ceased pulling on test trials when they received nothing for themselves (up to 70% of 80 trials with a partner present, up to 83% of 40 trials in a nonsocial control condition). The relationship between the subject and the partner had no influence on the subject's choices; however, subjects were more likely to pull immediately after performing socio-agonistic displays. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence that despite their sophisticated social cognitive abilities and range of cooperative behaviours exhibited in the wild, unpaired (or unbonded) ravens do not seem to act to benefit conspecifics in the absence of immediate self-gain.

AB Kin selection is regarded as a key process in the evolution of avian cooperative breeding, and kinship influences helper decisions in many species. However, the effect of kinship on nonbreeding social organization is still poorly understood despite its potential fitness implications. Here, we investigated the origins and consequences of kin associations in nonbreeding flocks of long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus, an atypical cooperative breeder where helpers are failed breeders that redirect care towards relatives living in kin neighbourhoods. We found that kinship is an important factor in initial grouping decisions; all members of a nuclear family initially joined the same flock and failed breeders chose to flock with their relatives. Flocks that merged during the nonbreeding season also contained relatives. In contrast to these findings of positive kin association, when long-tailed tits switched flocks they tended to disperse into flocks with fewer relatives, although such switches often occurred with kin. In a playback experiment, we found no evidence that aggression shown towards members of other flocks was affected by kinship, indicating that kin associations result from a preference to flock with relatives rather than a constraint on flocking with nonrelatives. Finally, using social network analysis, we show that fine-scale nonbreeding associations among individuals were positively related to kinship, and that these nonbreeding associations were reflected in helping decisions in the subsequent breeding season, in addition to the previously reported effects of kinship and proximity. We conclude that long-tailed tits prefer to associate with kin when not breeding, and suggest that by doing so they gain either nepotistic benefits within flocks or future indirect benefits during breeding.

AB Cannibalism, intraspecific predation, is a fascinating behaviour that can serve as a model system for researchers interested in learning more about conspecific conflicts ranging from siblicide to sexual cannibalism. Cannibalism is most often studied in terms of the benefits it provides the predator, but the prevalence of such an ecologically significant behaviour is also shaped by the costs inherent in a cannibalistic attack. Perhaps most intuitively, the risk of injury when attacking a conspecific of similar or larger size has been considered, and led to the prediction that cannibalism should be most common by larger individuals among asymmetrically sized pairs. This prediction is commonplace in the cannibalism literature, and leads to the more novel hypothesis that siblicide then may be reduced to the extent that maternal investment yields developmental synchrony and size-matched siblings. Here we test these hypotheses in the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, by rearing some eggs at 4 degrees C warmer temperatures for 7 days, and thus experimentally creating size asymmetries between clutchmates. Our temperature manipulation was successful at speeding development (eggs reared at warmer temperatures attained their first moult 2.5 days sooner than their counterparts). This developmental asynchrony accelerated cannibalism by more than 3 days relative to control groups in which eggs and spiderlings were all reared at either consistently colder or warmer temperatures. Lastly, the mass and size of an egg were poor predictors of cannibalism in both treatments that included individuals reared at warm temperatures. In contrast, in our control group where both eggs were reared at cooler temperatures, we found that families typified by heavier and larger eggs were slower to show cannibalistic behaviour. We discuss the implications of these findings, paying particular attention to their relevance to the black widow's emerging role as an urban pest.

AB Animals possess various antipredator behaviours to reduce their risk of predation. Whereas most prey make considerable effort to avoid their predators, sometimes individuals approach and mob predators as a group. Among the types of predators that elicit mobbing, raptors such as hawks and owls are one of the more consistent targets. We conducted playback experiments to investigate the strength of mobbing behaviour according to the perceived risk associated with either predator dangerousness or local predation pressure. We first determined whether mobbing is specific to dangerous predators or more broadly directed at predatory species. We experimentally investigated whether prey can discriminate the level of dangerousness of two owl species. Our results indicate that prey adjusted the strength of their mobbing behaviour according to the perceived risk: passerine birds mobbed the Eurasian pygmy owl, Glaucidium passerinum (i.e. a dangerous predator) but not the boreal owl, Aegolius funereus (i.e. a far less dangerous species). Second, we compared mobbing behaviour in similar habitats differing in predation pressure (with or without pygmy owls). Working on identical bird communities, we revealed that mobbing varied in relation to the local presence of the predator. Where the pygmy owl was absent, calls of this dangerous predator failed to elicit mobbing among passerine birds although they responded strongly to a playback of a mobbing chorus. This study provides experimental evidence that intense predation increases the expression of cooperative mobbing in passerine birds. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Ontogenetic colour changes in animals generally involve cryptic juveniles developing conspicuous coloration when they achieve sexual maturity. However, there are several species in which juveniles develop conspicuously coloured tails that become cryptic in adults. In lizards, colourful tails may act as an antipredator mechanism, either by diverting predator attacks from vital body parts to the expendable tail (decoy hypothesis) or, when associated with tail movements, by signalling to the potential predator that it has been spotted and an attack will probably not succeed (pursuit deterrent hypothesis). In both cases, the antipredator function would allow lizards with colourful tails to show more risk-taking behaviours. The aim of this study was to test whether conspicuous coloration was related to risk behaviours in spiny-footed lizards, Acanthodactylus erythrurus, a species with red-tailed juveniles. Behaviour was recorded in free-ranging lizards and several risk-related behavioural indices were calculated. As predicted, risk behaviour and tail coloration were found to be related, as redder (less orange) lizards stayed further from refuge, maybe because redder coloration was associated with a perception of lower predation risk. Coloration was not related to any other behavioural index, including tail displays, but the level of activity was negatively related to lizard size, suggesting a change towards less active behaviour associated with growth, probably because energy and thermoregulatory requirements depend on body size. In conclusion, the link between red coloration and risk-taking behaviour in spiny-footed lizards supports the antipredator function of this coloration that enables more colourful lizards to take more risks when necessary. Moreover, the nonsignificant association between coloration and tail displays is not consistent with the pursuit deterrent hypothesis, thus making the decoy hypothesis more probable.

AB Studying the emotional consequences of social behaviour in nonverbal animals require methods to access their emotional state. One such method is provided by cognitive bias tests. We applied a judgement bias test to tufted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus sp., to evaluate (1) whether receiving grooming was associated with a short-term increase in 'optimism' (that is, a positive bias in the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli) and (2) whether interindividual differences in 'optimism' were related to dominance rank or overall rates of social and nonsocial behaviour. Receiving grooming had no detectable immediate consequences, but increased 'optimism' was observed in dominant monkeys and in monkeys that received overall larger quantities of grooming. These results provide only partial support for the hypothesis that a system of emotional bookkeeping underlies the capacity of group-living animals to reciprocate cooperative interactions.

AB Patterns of coalitionary aggression among female animals are generally explained by kin selection theory. Frequent female coalitions are almost exclusively observed in female-philopatric species, where females stay in their natal group, and females typically form coalitions with their kin. Bonobos, Pan paniscus, in contrast, are male-philopatric, with females emigrating to new groups at adolescence, but female bonobos frequently form coalitions even though they are generally with nonrelatives. Here we investigated the patterns of female coalitions in a group of wild bonobos at Wamba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, in order to explore alternative mechanisms to kin selection for cooperation among females. We found that all female coalitions (defined as coalitions in which two or more females participated) were formed to attack males, usually after the male(s) behaved aggressively towards one or more females. There was no evidence that female bonobos used proximity, grooming or genito-genital rubbing (GG-rubbing) to develop coalition partnerships, although higher association provided females with more opportunity to form coalitions. Instead of reciprocal agonistic support, we found a unidirectional pattern in which older females supported younger females. Females defeated males more easily when they formed coalitions than when they confronted males alone. Unlike female coalitions in other species that use coalitions to cope with competition among females, our results suggest that coalitions in female bonobos might have evolved as a counterstrategy against male harassment. Females might choose their coalition partners based not on affiliative relationship or reciprocity but on mutualism. In contrast to the hypothesis that affiliative behaviour leads to coalition formation, coalitions might in fact increase gregariousness among females, leading females to develop affiliative interactions that promote tolerance.

AB The migration timing of birds can be controlled by endogenous parameters. However, little is known about how environmental parameters influence the timing of migration and which have the greatest influence at different stages of migration. In this study we identified the main environmental parameters that correlate with the timing of the last stage of spring migration for the barnacle goose, Branta leucopsis. GPS tracking data were registered for 12 barnacle geese (in 2008-2010) on the Russian flyway and 17 (2006-2010) on the Svalbard flyway. A linear mixed -effect model and principal component analysis were used to retrieve statistically significant parameters. Departure date from the last staging site on the Russian flyway was related to daylength, temperature, cloud cover and barometric pressure, and on the Svalbard flyway to a food availability index and daylength. Arrival date at the Russian breeding site was related to cloud cover and barometric pressure en route and the food availability index and temperature at the breeding site. For the Svalbard flyway, temperature and cloud cover en route and the food availability index, wind, temperature and cloud cover at the breeding site were significantly related to arrival date at the breeding site. Our study highlights the importance of environmental parameters including food, weather and daylength for the last stage of goose spring migration. We found different priorities in selecting the environmental parameters in migration timing decisions between Svalbard and Russian barnacle geese which fly over sea and over land, respectively. Identifying the key factors that act as cues during the final stages of spring migration is important when assessing the possible effects of climate change on the timing of migration for a highly selective herbivore such as the barnacle goose. 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB All prey face a fundamental trade-off between avoiding predation and pursuing activities, such as foraging and mating, that enhance fitness. Therefore, the effects of predation can be both consumptive and nonconsumptive and prey need to assess and respond appropriately to predation risk which in turn varies with environmental and social contexts. We tested the effects of predator density and diel cycle on the consumption, interspecific interactions and behavioural responses of a prey species, the native Australian glass shrimp, Paratya australiensis, exposed to a predator, the invasive eastern mosquito fish, Gambusia holbrooki. In the laboratory, P. australiensis were exposed to low or high densities of conspecifics or predators and observed during the day and at night. While P. australiensis experienced more interspecific approaches and nips when exposed to a high density of G. holbrooki and during the day, neither predator density nor diel cycle influenced the actual number of P. australiensis consumed. Similarly, while P. australiensis engaged in significantly more shelter use and swam less, there was no difference in these behaviours in relation to predator density and diel cycle. Foraging by P. australiensis was not related to species composition, but instead depended on the overall number of animals present with more P. australiensis foraging when exposed to a high density of conspecifics and G. holbrooki. These results indicate that the mechanisms by which G. holbrooki exerts negative effects on P. australiensis can be multiple and wide ranging, from direct predation to a reduction in activity and competition for resources. However, as neither predator density nor diurnal variation altered predation rate, P. australiensis did behave in an adaptive manner, by only adjusting its behavioural responses in proportion to the direct risk of predation.

AB Animals living with kin and nonkin should make social decisions based on the consequences for both direct and indirect fitness. Common vampire bats, Desmodus rotundus, invest in stable cooperative relationships that benefit both components of inclusive fitness. To disentangle these two factors, we conducted two types of playback trials using a captive group of familiar common vampire bats with mixed kinship and varying rates of dyadic food sharing. We presented each subject with two speakers, playing contact calls from two different familiar conspecifics. In 'past donor trials', 15 vampire bats chose between calls recorded from either a frequent or rare food donor, but both callers were related to a similar degree with the subject. In 'kinship trials', 31 vampire bats chose between calls recorded from either a close or distant relative, but both callers were matched for food-sharing history with the subject. We found that vampire bats were attracted to contact calls of frequent food donors when controlling for kinship, but not to calls of kin when controlling for food-sharing history. Responses and acoustic analyses suggested that bats recognized individuals from vocalizations. These results corroborate past findings that prior food sharing can overshadow relatedness in determining the social decisions of vampire bats. Common vampire bat contact calls allow food-sharing partners to recognize and find each other at a distance, which likely enables them to switch roosts together in the wild.

AB Personality differences are widespread throughout the animal kingdom and can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Despite a rapidly increasing body of literature, large (marine) vertebrates remain underrepresented in personality research. Given their unique life history traits (e.g. slow growth rate, slow reproduction rate, long life span) and their pivotal role in ecosystem processes, this is an important gap in our current knowledge. Here we investigated consistency and plasticity in movement behaviour of wild juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris, by repeatedly subjecting sharks to open field tests. First, we investigated the presence of interindividual differences in movement behaviour in a novel open field. Second, we investigated the effect of trial repetition on movement behaviour to understand whether movement in a novel open field reflects a reaction to novelty, or general activity. Third, we estimated individual differences in habituation/sensitization rates over trial repetition and studied how the habituation rate was predicted by the initial movement rate. We found consistent individual differences in movement behaviour during the open field tests. Sharks showed habituation in movement behaviour (i.e. decrease) over repeated trials indicating that the movement behaviour during the first trials is a reaction to novelty, and not general activity. Individuals, however, differed in their rate of habituation (i.e. plasticity) and this rate was negatively related to an individual's movement behaviour in the first open field trial. In addition to showing individual differences in consistency and plasticity in juvenile lemon sharks, our study emphasizes the importance of examining the validity of personality tests when adapting them to new species.

AB The transient stage prior to definitive recruitment, known as juvenile dispersal, is thought to be under great evolutionary pressure and subject to a trade-off between associated costs and long-term benefits for fitness. Conspecific attraction has been shown to be an adaptive mechanism driving dispersal behaviours that may lead to negative density-dependent dispersal patterns. However, conspecific attraction can be scarcely discernible from imprinting to the natal area in wild populations. Reintroductions in the absence of settled individuals can be used as alternative colonization-like contexts to investigate the relative role of conspecific attraction in juvenile dispersal behaviours. We examined the spatiotemporal development of dispersal movements in reintroduced juveniles of a long-lived species with deferred maturity, the Spanish imperial eagle, Aquila adalberti, in comparison with nonmanipulated juveniles from a nearby population. We found that reintroduced birds started dispersal earlier and were initially more philopatric, probably encouraged by the advantageous competitive environment in the release area. Conversely, they revealed a more expansive strategy as they matured and approached the time when settlement decisions would be made, especially in females. They returned less frequently, increased exploratory movements and dispersal ranges, and visited breeding areas, probably as a consequence of the relatively lower reproductive prospects in the release area than in nearby populations. Therefore, the singular social cueing in reintroductions may eventually lead to juvenile wandering behaviours characteristic of colonization contexts in this territorial long-lived species. Such dispersive strategies relying on conspecifics may have important consequences for population dynamics and management. They may hinder the initial settlement phase in reintroductions, although behaviours such as longer returns may enhance recruitment prospects. Translocation programmes should consider specific dispersal scenarios, as well as postrelease monitoring to increase philopatry and success probabilities.

AB Theory suggests that behaviours previously thought only to influence intrasexual selection, such as aggression between males, can also be co-opted to serve in intersexual selection as honest indicators of male quality. Our previous research revealed an audience effect: male Jamaican field crickets, Gryllus assimilis, fight more aggressively in front of a female audience. One way for this to evolve is if females are more attracted to more aggressive males or fight winners. Given the potential interplay between intra- and intersexual selection, we investigated how observing a fight influences subsequent female mate choice and mating behaviour. We utilized two female treatments: Observers watched the two males fight, whereas Non-observers watched two noninteracting males. We then immediately tested Observer and Non-observer females for their mating preferences towards male fight participants using dichotomous and no-choice tests. Our approach enabled us to assess whether females preferred either dominant (winner) or subordinate (loser) males and whether females gathered information about males while watching them fight that informed their mating preferences. While females did not prefer fight winners over losers in dichotomous choice tests, in the no-choice tests, females were more likely to mount winners and mount males that they had preferred in the dichotomous choice tests. Intra-and intersexual competition appears to be mutually reinforcing in this species, but eavesdropping is unlikely to explain the evolution of audience effects.

AB Individuals are different, but they can work together to perform adaptive collective behaviours. Despite emerging evidence that individual variation strongly affects group performance, it is less clear to what extent individual variation is modulated by participation in collective behaviour. We examined light avoidance (negative phototaxis) in the gregarious cockroach Blaberus discoidalis, in both solitary and group contexts. Cockroaches in groups exhibited idiosyncratic light-avoidance performance that persisted across days, with some individual cockroaches avoiding a light stimulus 75% of the time, and others avoiding the light just above chance (i.e. similar to 50% of the time). These individual differences were robust to group composition. Surprisingly, these differences did not persist when individuals were tested in isolation, but returned when testing was once again done in groups. During the solo testing phase cockroaches exhibited individually consistent light-avoidance tendencies, but these differences were uncorrelated with performance in any group context. Therefore, we have observed not only that individual variation affects group-level performance, but also that whether or not a task is performed collectively can have a significant, predictable effect on how an individual behaves. That individual behavioural variation is modulated by whether a task is performed collectively has major implications for understanding variation in behaviours that are facultatively social, and it is essential that ethologists consider social context when evaluating individual behavioural differences.

AB Alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) are commonly associated with differences in morphological, physiological and behavioural traits. The morphological differences can be associated with differences between ARTs in effectiveness of sexual display but the relationship has rarely been documented. We tested it using the Asian water strider Gerris gracilicornis (Heteroptera: Gerridae), in which males have two ARTs: a signalling courtship tactic and a nonsignalling tactic. Many G. gracilicornis males employ an intimidating signalling courtship tactic capitalizing on predators' behaviours and female responses to predators. The males produce courtship ripple signals on the water's surface by vibrating their middle legs after mounting the female. In this study we found that smaller males more often adopted a nonsignalling than a signalling courtship tactic. We hypothesized that smaller males with shorter middle legs and weaker muscles may not be able to produce ripples that are sufficiently strong to attract predators from a distance, and therefore sexual selection favours nonsignalling tactics in smaller but not larger males. We created a 2 x 2 experimental design to test the contribution of male body size to the intimidation effect under different levels of predation risk. We showed that only large males' ripple signals had an intimidation effect on females. We also found that females suffered a higher predation risk when large, but not small, males mounted them. The signal intensity of large males was also stronger than that of small males. Hence, we suggest that size-dependent effectiveness of the intimidation signalling maintains the size-dependent reproductive tactics in G. gracilicornis.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
DE avoidance; behaviour; goats; heart rate; hierarchy; RMSSD; sociability
AB Modulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity allows animals to effectively respond to internal and external stimuli in everyday challenges via changes in, for example, heart and respiration rate. Various factors, ranging from social such as dominance rank to internal such as personality or affective states can impact animal physiology. Our knowledge of the combinatory effects of social and internal factors on ANS basal activity and reactivity, and of the importance that each factor has in determining physiological parameters, is limited, particularly in nonhuman, free-ranging animals. In this study, we tested the effects of dominance rank and personality (assessed as exploration/avoidance and sociability) on the heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability of goats, Capra hircus, in relation to the category of behaviour performed. We collected heart rate data while the animals could freely move and interact with conspecifics. A model selection procedure showed that behavioural category and sociability, as well as their interaction effect, explained most of the variation in HR. HR was lowest, and heart rate variability highest, during affiliative interactions. The HR of less social goats increased more between the behaviour triggering the lowest HR and the behaviour triggering the highest HR, compared to the HR of more social goats, which was more stable. This suggests lower ANS reactivity (HR response) in social goats. Our results thus highlight the important relationships between personality types, physiology and the behaviour of free-ranging animals. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The limited availability of refuges may represent an important factor promoting the evolution of sociality, particularly in bats. Spix's disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor) show highly specialized morphological adaptations that enable individuals to roost inside furled musoid leaves. This roosting ecology presents major challenges, as leaves rapidly unfurl, forcing bats to locate new roosts on a daily basis. Despite the reliance of T. tricolor on such ephemeral roosting resources, bats form stable group associations. This social stability has been attributed to the potential benefits that group members gain from searching for new roosts together versus alone. The purpose of our study was to characterize the behavioural patterns associated with assessing roosts and any accompanying communication strategies of Spix's disc-winged bat. We determined that bats regularly monitor furled leaves within their roosting range, during which they emit a number of distinct social calls. Roost assessment involved close inspection of leaf dimensions and surroundings, and was mostly performed by single individuals. Thyroptera tricolor's call repertoire during flight indicates that group contact involves a combination of acoustic signals. Our approach in a natural setting provides valuable insight into the role of shelter stability in the evolution of the T. tricolor social system.

AB In birds, there is evidence that adult cognitive traits can both run in families and be affected by early developmental influences. However, different studies use different cognitive tasks, which may not be measuring the same traits, and also focus on different developmental factors. We report results from a study in which we administered multiple cognitive tasks (autoshaping, discrimination learning, reversal learning, progressive ratio schedule, extinction learning and impulsivity) to a cohort of 34 European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, for which several early developmental measures were available. The cohort consisted of siblings raised either apart or together, whose position in the size hierarchy of the rearing brood had been experimentally manipulated. We examined how the different cognitive measures co-varied, the extent to which they ran in families, and which of the developmental factors predicted which of the cognitive outcomes. We found that discrimination and reversal learning speeds were positively correlated, as were breakpoint on the progressive ratio schedule and resistance to extinction. Otherwise, the cognitive measures were uncorrelated, suggesting that they reflected different underlying traits. All traits except discrimination and reversal learning speed ran in families to a substantial extent. Using a model selection approach, we found evidence that natal brood size and developmental telomere attrition (the extent to which the birds' erythrocyte telomeres shortened in early life, an integrative measure of developmental stress) were related to several adult cognitive measures. Results are discussed with respect to the best way of measuring avian cognitive abilities, and the utility of developmental telomere attrition as a predictor of adult outcomes. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Noisy miners, Manorina melanocephala (Australian honeyeaters, Meliphagidae) feed on both nectar and invertebrates. The spatiotemporal distributions of these two food resources differ: nectar is a static, visually signalled resource, and invertebrates are cryptic and mobile. In the present study, we investigated whether birds would forage more efficiently if they could plan their search path through a 'patch' of feeders, than if they could not. We predicted that the ability to plan would only increase the efficiency of nectar foraging. Wild-caught captive birds were allowed to forage through arrays of feeders containing both nectar (sucrose) and invertebrate (mealworm) prey. When foraging for nectar, birds made more search errors if they were unable to plan their foraging route, while search efficiency for invertebrate prey was not affected in this way. These results suggest that noisy miners make use of the advertised locations of nectar to plan their search route. Such route planning may be a type of planning that does not involve anticipation of future motivational states. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Prey often face uncertainty when learning about predation risk because stimuli indicating risk can vary in reliability. However, the way this uncertainty is expressed at the individual level is often poorly understood. Here, we compared how prey fish (Pimephales promelas) responded to information conflicting with their previous experience when this information came from contrasting sources. First, fish had the opportunity to learn that a novel odour was safe from repeated exposure to the odour in the absence of negative consequences, or they received pseudo-exposures. Then, using one of two learning paradigms, we conditioned fish to recognize that the 'safe' odour was actually the odour of a predator. Fish were exposed to the odour paired with either (1) cues released from injured conspecifics (alarm cues), allowing for the fish to learn alone, or (2) cues from a knowledgeable (frightened) conspecific responding to the risky odour, allowing fish to acquire the information via social learning. Fish were tested individually following conditioning, and movement, foraging, shelter use and freezing were quantified. Learned antipredator responses were similar between the two mechanisms for individuals with no prior exposure to the odour. However, fish that knew the odour as safe did not acquire a fearful response to the odour following conditioning with alarm cues, whereas interaction with frightened conspecifics appeared to cause fish to ignore their prior learning of safety, suggesting that learning from a live conspecific was more persuasive than individual assessment via alarm cues. This study adds to the body of literature contrasting the reliability of information sources and their consequences on cognition, communication and group dynamics.

AB Prey use many strategies to avoid being detected by their predators. However, once detected and identified as potentially palatable, prey must employ a second line of defence such as performing a deimatic (startle) display. During the predation sequence, composed of the stages encounter, detection, identification, approach, subjugation and consumption, such defences should be deployed as the predator approaches, but before prey are brought under the predator's control (i.e. before subjugation). We tested this assumption in the mountain katydid (or bush cricket), which is cryptic at rest, but when disturbed flashes spectacular abdominal colours by lifting its wings, and is chemically defended. We experimentally determined which visual, auditory and tactile stimuli trigger their deimatic display via six treatments. Contrary to expectations of the predation sequence katydids required tactile cues before performing their deimatic display, that is, it was performed only after attempted subjugation. Field experiments also showed that katydids perform their deimatic display after experiencing tactile stimuli. Mountain katydid natural history may explain this counterintuitive behaviour. Being slow and cryptic, katydids cannot effect a fast escape after performing their deimatic display but their tough cuticle and chemical defences make survival of initial subjugation attempts likely. Holding their deimatic display until after initial subjugation may prevent continued attack and avoid the potentially large cost of revealing themselves to predators that have not yet noticed them. Performance of deimatic display after subjugation may be more common than currently recognized and we encourage further investigation. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Organisms can respond to and cope with stressful environments in a number of ways including behavioural, morphological and physiological adjustments. To understand the role of behavioural traits in thermal adaptations we compared heat resistance, locomotor (walking and flying) activity, flight performance and morphology of three European populations of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) originating from different thermal conditions (Spain, Switzerland and Denmark) at benign and stressful high temperatures. Spanish flies showed greater heat resistance than Swiss and Danish flies. Similarly, at the stressful high temperature Spanish flies flew the furthest and Danish flies the shortest distance. Neither body size nor wing loading affected flight performance, although flies with narrower wings tended to fly further (wing shape effect). Swiss flies were most active in terms of locomotor activity at the benign temperature, whereas the Spanish flies were able to stay active for longer at the stressful temperature. Population differences in behavioural traits and heat resistance were obtained using flies held for several generations in a laboratory common garden setting; therefore we suggest that exposure to and avoidance of high temperatures under natural conditions has been an important selective agent causing the suggested adaptive differentiation between the populations.

AB An individual's home range determines its access to resources, significantly influencing its fitness. Food availability and population density are considered to be among the primary factors influencing home range sizes; however, no study has experimentally tested whether these two factors affect home range sizes independently. This is important as these two factors correlate significantly with each other, making it difficult to differentiate the effect of one from the other. First, we supplemented food to 23 female African striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, belonging to 15 different groups. To avoid an increase in population density by immigration, we also provided food to neighbouring groups. Although population density did not increase, female home range sizes decreased by 43.1%. In a second experiment, we manipulated population density by removing entire social groups of striped mice. We carried out experiments within 7 weeks, a period short enough to control for a change in natural food availability. Experimental decrease of population density caused an increase of female home range sizes of 44.3%. The degree of home range overlap between female striped mice was unaffected by supplemental feeding or by reduction of population density. However, female home range sizes were negatively affected by the total number of female neighbours, especially of heavier individuals. In addition, after removal, females significantly decreased their overlap with neighbouring breeding females indicating that competition with same-sex individuals shapes females' home ranges. This is the first comprehensive experimental field study demonstrating that an increase in food availability and a decrease in population density independently affect home range sizes of individuals.

AB Marine tetrapods represent powerful models for studying how evolutionary transitions shape the life history traits, physiology and behaviour of animals. Whereas adaptations to diving are driven primarily by the need to secure underwater food, diving in the pelagic sea snake, Hydrophis (Pelamis) platurus, seems less foraging-dependent. Indeed, this reptile captures fish while floating at the sea surface. Despite knowledge about its surface ecology, its underwater behaviour remains mostly unknown. Yet, study of this life phase is a key to understanding how and why this snake dives. In this study, we reanalysed published data on its diving behaviour. The pelagic sea snake spends 95% of its time underwater, where it can dive to 50 m and stay for 3.5 h without breathing. Dives are S-shaped, with a long phase of gradual ascent during which the snake is neutrally buoyant. Snake lungs deflate slowly during this phase at a rate that increases with water temperature, and thus metabolism. Dive duration is linked to inferred lung volume at the start of the dive, suggesting aerobic diving. We propose that pelagic sea snakes dive for multiple reasons, but primarily to avoid sea surface turbulence. Underwater, they can reduce metabolism by targeting cooler water layers. By hovering in the water column, they reduce energy expenditure and escape both surface and bottom predators, while more easily locating their own prey from underneath. Some marine turtles occasionally display S-shaped dives, but the role of such dives remains under debate. We suggest the study of sea snakes can help interpret diving behaviour in other lineages of marine reptiles. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To maximize survival, animals should adjust their behaviour flexibly in response to indicators of predation risk. Predation risk is affected by a range of ecological, social and individual variables, which can fluctuate over different timescales. In general, current risk levels are known to influence the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates are engaged in other activities. However, there has been little consideration of whether decisions made at different stages of a sentinel bout are affected in the same way by perceived predation risk and whether the same level of behavioural plasticity is exhibited when making these different decisions. Here we used detailed behavioural observations and a playback experiment to investigate the behavioural choices of dwarf mongoose sentinels at three different stages of a bout (before, start, during). Individuals were more likely to begin a bout, and did so sooner, following alarm calls, which are immediate, direct indicators of elevated risk. Sentinels selected an initial height from which to guard depending on factors that tended to vary in the medium term (hours), choosing higher positions in denser habitat and less windy conditions. In contrast, decisions about bout duration were made in relation to short-term (seconds/minutes) changes in information, with sentinels guarding for longer when an alarm call was given during a bout, and terminating bouts sooner when groupmates moved out of sight. Our results demonstrate that sentinel decisions are influenced by both direct and indirect indicators of likely predation risk and that sentinel behaviour is adjusted flexibly with regard to information presented on various timescales, highlighting the complexity of decision-making processes.

AB Among the many hand preference studies on nonhuman primates, several have demonstrated the effect of diverse action demands on the direction and magnitude of hand preference. However, few studies have assessed hand preference in the natural repertoire of motor behaviours in nonhuman primates, especially in actions that differ in velocity. Nevertheless, velocity is involved in the coordination between the upper limb joints and could be related to cerebral hemispheric specialization. Indeed, depending on the velocity, some joints, and so some muscles, are used more than others. The purpose of this study was to quantify hand preference across various natural actions to evaluate how the nature of the action modifies hand preference in capuchin and squirrel monkeys. First, we observed seven female tufted capuchin monkeys during spontaneous foraging, performing fast actions (pounding and capturing fast-moving prey) and slow actions (picking fruit, carrying, tapping and catching slow-moving prey). Second, we observed seven squirrel monkeys performing fast actions (capturing fast-moving prey) and slow actions (picking fruit and catching slow-moving prey) in their enclosure. The results showed that (1) capturing fast-moving prey and pounding were associated with a left-hand preference and (2) slow actions were associated with variable hand preferences. Fast manual actions may elicit consistent hand preference. Given that many nonhuman primates use fast actions to capture prey, this possibility deserves further investigation. If this finding is confirmed, a novel link between motor control processes and hand preference can be pursued. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although there has been great interest in the evolutionary approach to cooperative breeding species, few studies actually directly compare fathers and mothers on their motivation to parent offspring. We tested the responsiveness of common marmoset mothers and fathers to vocal and olfactory cues from their own and other infants using a two-chamber test apparatus designed to evaluate responses in the absence of competition from other caregivers within the family. We tested parentally experienced mothers and fathers living with young infants and former parents with no current offspring to address the following questions: (1) do mothers and fathers respond equally to sensory cues of infants; (2) do parents discriminate cues of their own offspring when the infants are highly dependent and when the infants are more independent; and (3) are parents responsive to both auditory and olfactory cues? Mothers and fathers reacted similarly in all tests. Parents responded equally to isolation calls from their own and unfamiliar dependent infants and there was minimal response to olfactory cues. Responses to infant vocal cues were significantly stronger when infants were dependent upon direct parental care. There was no difference in response between parents whose infants were no longer dependent and former parents with no current offspring. The results show that both parents are highly responsive to infant vocal cues when their own infants are dependent on parental care, supporting an effect of hormonal priming. However, parents only showed behavioural discrimination between vocalizations from their own and unfamiliar infants when their infants were mostly independent.

AB For many animals, a key benefit of group living is lowered predation risk. With increasing group size, individuals commonly reduce vigilance. This group size effect can arise from both dilution of risk and increased collective detection. To determine which was more important, we compared vigilance levels of plains zebra, Equus quagga, in areas inhabited by their main predator, lion, Panthera leo, as a function of herd size and composition (zebra-only versus mixed-species herds). For zebra-only herds, vigilance declined with increasing zebra numbers. In contrast, in mixed-species herds, zebra vigilance levels were significantly lower and did not vary with the total number of ungulates and/or zebra in the herd. This lower vigilance can be explained by detection benefits, since we controlled for the influence of herd size (i.e. dilution) statistically. Furthermore, we found that zebra in smaller herds were half as vigilant when they co-occurred with another preferred prey of lion, blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, compared with zebra-only herds. However, when zebra foraged with impala, Aepyceros melampus, a nonpreferred prey, there was only a slight reduction in vigilance compared with similar-sized zebra-only herds. Interestingly, the decrease in zebra vigilance when herding with wildebeest was influenced by the presence/absence, but not number, of wildebeest. In contrast, impala only reduced zebra vigilance when they comprised about 75% of the herd. Ultimately, our results indicate that for zebra in mixed-species herds, detection benefits are relatively more important than dilution over a larger range of herd sizes. However, detection only reduces vigilance when zebras herd with species that share a common predator (i.e. diluting partner). Potentially, detection by species that do not share a common predator (i.e. low-diluting partner) is not as reliable as detection by diluting species.

AB Behavioural ecologists often note that one or a few group members appear to shape the collective behaviour of social groups differentially. Our understanding of these keystone individuals is largely taken from meticulous field observations and semi-scientific anecdotes. In this study we experimentally test whether the behavioural tendencies of putative keystone individuals shift the collective behaviour of colonies using the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. Prior studies on Stegodyphus demonstrated that the single best predictor of colonies' collective behaviour is the behaviour of colonies' boldest individual. Here, we probe the causal relationship between the traits of extremely bold individuals and colonies' collective behaviour by experimentally creating colonies of identical size and personality composition in the laboratory and then adding a single individual of varying boldness (the putative keystone individual). Experimentally adding just one extremely bold individual increased the foraging aggressiveness of entire colonies and altered the total mass gained by fellow group members, relative to the addition of a less bold individual. Additionally, our data suggest that bold individuals are capable of such influence because they catalyse variation in the behavioural tendencies of fellow group members.

AB Experimental studies on traditions in animals have focused almost entirely on the initial transmission phase in captive populations. We conducted an open diffusion field experiment with 13 groups of wild common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus. Seven groups contained individuals that were already familiar with the task ('push or pull' box) and thus served as potential models for naive individuals. Additionally, in four groups one individual was trained for one of the two possible techniques and in two control groups no skilled individuals were present. First, we investigated whether experienced individuals would remember how to solve the task even after 2 years without exposure and whether they would still prefer their learned technique. Second, we tested whether naive individuals would learn socially from their skilled family members and, more importantly, whether they would use the same technique. Third, we conducted several test blocks to see whether the individual and/or group behaviour would persist over time. Our results show that wild common marmosets were able to memorize, learn socially and maintain preferences of foraging techniques. This field experiment thus reveals a promising approach to studying social learning in the wild and provides the basis for long-term studies on tradition formation. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Many animals use variation in their alarm calls to warn conspecifics about different predatory threats. Information about predators can be encoded by producing discrete types of alarm calls and/or through graded variation in a single call type (i.e. calling rate or note repetitions). Another way to encode predator information is to combine different types of calls or notes into longer structured sequences. However, few studies have examined how individuals use discrete, graded and combinatorial variation in alarm calls to denote specific risks. I investigated the acoustic structure and information content of alarm calls in Japanese great tits, Parus major minor, by exposing their nests to three predator species (snakes, crows and martens) and a nonpredator species (doves). Great tits produced acoustically discrete alarm calls for the different nest predators: 'jar' calls for snakes and 'chicka' calls for crows and martens. The adults further discriminated between crows and martens by altering the calling rate and note number of the 'chicka' calls. A total of 175 types of note combinations were observed in the 'chicka' calls, and the tits used these combination types differently for the crows and martens. These results provide the first demonstration that birds can encode information about predator type by using production specificity, graded features and note combinations of discrete alarm calls. Previous studies have shown that parent and nestling Japanese great tits can respond in different, adaptive ways to discrete alarm calls. However, further playback studies are required to determine whether and how conspecifics can extract predator information from graded and combinatorial variation in alarm calls.

AB The evolution of sexually dimorphic, elaborate male traits that are seemingly maladaptive may be driven by sexual selection (male-male competition and or female mate choice). Tusk possession in the Asian elephant is sexually dimorphic and exaggerated but its role in male-male competition has not yet been determined. We examined the role of the tusks in establishing dominance along with two other known male-male signals, namely, body size and musth (a temporary physiologically heightened sexual state) in an Asian elephant population in northeastern India with equal proportions of tusked and tuskless males. We observed 116 agonistic interactions with clear dominance outcomes between adult (>15 years) males during 458 field days in the dry season months of 2008-2011. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to predict the probability of winning as a function of body size, tusk possession and musth status relative to the opponent. A hierarchy of the three male-male signals emerged from this analysis, with musth overriding body size and body size overriding tusk possession. In this elephant population tusk possession thus plays a relatively minor role in male-male competition. An important implication of musth and body size being stronger determinants of dominance than tusk possession is that it could facilitate rapid evolution of tuskless males in the population under artificial selection against tusked individuals, which are poached for ivory.

AB Operant conditioning is fundamental to many animal behaviour experiments, including the alternative forced-choice (AFC) task, a powerful and popular paradigm for establishing learning and discrimination abilities across a wide array of species. One frequently overlooked aspect of this paradigm is the relative importance of the positive (S+ or 'target') and negative stimulus (S- or 'distractor'). It is often assumed that subjects learn to associate S+ with a reward. However, it is equally possible that they learn to associate S- with the absence of a reward. The rule learned may have repercussions for the design of experiments, and may also provide information about the decision strategies employed by a particular animal or species. Archerfish are becoming increasingly popular as a model for testing cognition in lower vertebrates. We conducted three experiments to explore how archerfish learn to complete a common type of forced-choice test. In the first experiment, we showed that archerfish were able to discriminate a range of shapes in an AFC task. In the second experiment, we found that replacing S- with novel stimuli caused a greater disruption in performance than replacing S+. In the final experiment we showed that archerfish: (1) were probably using complex decision rules; (2) made context-dependent choices; and (3) examined some or all of the stimuli before making a decision when faced with multiple stimuli. Our results show that archerfish have a flexible learning strategy which may facilitate exploitation of novel food sources. The discovery that archerfish avoid negative stimuli fits with their generalist feeding ecology in which they may learn to avoid distasteful/toxic prey. At the same time the fish demonstrate a willingness to try new prey, which have the potential to offer a greater reward than familiar target prey.

AB Allogrooming has hygienic and social functions. Moreover, anxiety is thought to be reduced in the first few minutes after a grooming interaction is terminated. Few data exist on postgrooming reduction in anxiety, and mostly concern the recipient of grooming and captive animals. We analysed whether anxiety is reduced after grooming and whether this reduction differs between the donor and recipient of grooming. We collected 10 min postgrooming and matched-control (PG-MC) focal data on the donor and recipient of the same grooming interaction in wild Barbary macaques. We recorded all the occurrences of self-directed behaviours (i.e. self-scratching and self-grooming) as these are reliable indicators of anxiety. The occurrence of self-directed behaviour was greater in PGs than in MCs for both the donor and recipient. This increase in postgrooming anxiety was more evident for the recipient than for the donor. The postgrooming increase in anxiety was not due to a higher risk of receiving aggression after grooming. Unlike previous studies, our results indicate that anxiety may increase after grooming in Barbary macaques. If so, the social and hygienic benefits of grooming may outweigh its short-term anxiety cost. Self-directed behaviour may increase because of the emotional response to the change in activity (e. g. from grooming to travelling) and/or frustration at the termination of grooming. Our findings highlight the need to investigate further the link between emotions and grooming. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although the role of animal signals in the resolution of family conflicts has been thoroughly studied, it has been typically analysed in isolated two-player interactions. For instance, parents are usually considered as the sole receivers of offspring begging signals or mates the receivers of sexual displays. However, this view does not wholly encompass the dynamic and complex nature of the family scenario. In this essay, we review for the first time the clearest evidence of animal signals found to play a role in more than one family context (e.g. mate-mate, parent-offspring and sib-sib interactions). We then argue that these signals might have coevolved in multiple family contexts because the whole network of related individuals shares genes and similar physiological mechanisms underlying signal expression and perception abilities. Finally, we propose candidate traits that we would expect to function in multiple family contexts and we consider questions that could be addressed in further studies to understand better the evolution of family signals.

AB Many forms of selection are density dependent. It is often assumed that all individuals of a given sex compete for the same resources, but in many species different types of individuals (e. g. morphs or body sizes) compete for different resources. Selection on competitive traits should be examined relative to the density of the relevant competitors (and contested resources) rather than total population density. Crucially, a predictable decline in effective competitor density with size might affect selection on fighting behaviour in species with indeterminate growth. We investigated whether male fighting behaviour over burrows in the fiddler crab Uca annulipes is consistent with size-dependent burrow usage that affects the density of relevant competitors and contested resources (burrow availability is limited). We show that larger males occupied larger burrows and occurred at lower densities, so they must travel further to locate new, suitably sized burrows. This should favour larger males investing more in each fight that they initiate. Indeed, larger males fought for significantly longer than smaller males, which increased their likelihood of winning a burrow. The observed increase in fight duration is not readily explained by ontogenetic changes in fighting costs (i.e. 'giving up' thresholds). It is worth testing whether increased fight duration with size/age occurs in the innumerable other species with indeterminate growth that compete for refugia (e. g. hermit crabs, reef fish) because a decline in density with body size is inevitable owing to cumulative mortality, and a physical constraint on the minimum-sized refugia that can be entered is commonplace.

AB Despite extensive research in the field of sexual selection, the evolutionary origin and maintenance of preferences for sexual ornaments are still debated. Recent studies have pointed out that plasticity in mate choice might be more common than previously thought, but little is still known about the factors that affect such plasticity. The swordtail characin, Corynopoma riisei, is a tropical fish species in which males use a food-mimicking ornament to attract females. We tested whether ecological factors, more specifically prior foraging experience, can affect female preference for male ornaments. For this, we habituated females on a diet consisting of either red-coloured food or standard-coloured green food items and then we tested whether female preferences for artificially red-coloured male ornaments matched their previous foraging experience. We found a strong effect of food treatment: females trained on red food showed a stronger response to males with red-coloured ornaments than females trained on green food. Our results show that ecological variation can generate divergence of female preferences for male ornaments and that the response in preference to environmental change can be rapid if the bias is partly learnt.

AB Early juvenile environments influence trait expression in complex and often nonintuitive ways. Although the breadth of these effects is well recognized, researchers generally focus on the effect of single ecological triggers (such as resource availability, latitude or predator presence) on traits within a single dimension (e.g. morphological, behavioural or physiological phenotypes). This approach has yielded a wealth of knowledge about environmental conditions that trigger different plastic allocation strategies and reaction norms of a number of traits. However, it tells us little about the way in which early life conditions influence resource allocation, yielding differentially integrated adult phenotypes. Here, I argue that we must begin to understand how complex environments shape the conditional development and expression of suites of traits to produce complex, adaptive phenotypes. I begin by examining the importance of the juvenile environment when attempting to understand phenotypic expression at later life history stages. I describe how different types of plasticity affect relationships between traits, and I provide four case studies that illustrate the influence of plasticity on trait integration, which strongly suggests that evolution of norms of reaction must be considered if we are to understand the evolution of integrated phenotypes. I next highlight the importance of understanding the physiological and genetic underpinnings of this plasticity because such poorly understood aspects of the phenotype regulate developmental pathways that determine phenotypic expression. I conclude with suggestions as to how future research can begin to accommodate multidimensional approaches, and in doing so, further our understanding of an integrated phenotype concept.

AB There is currently great interest in the phylogenetic origins of altruistic behaviour within the primate order. Considerable attention has been focused on chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, because they are our closest living relatives and participate in a wide range of collective activities, including hunting and food sharing. Food sharing is of particular importance because it plays a critical role in the human foraging niche, but food sharing among adults is rare in nonhuman primates. Some research suggests that chimpanzees selectively share meat with reciprocating partners and allies, while other work indicates that chimpanzees primarily share to reduce harassment from other group members ( tolerated theft). We examined the effects of kinship, relationship quality, reciprocity and the intensity of solicitations on the pattern of food transfers in six captive groups of chimpanzees. We observed events that occurred after the chimpanzees were provisioned with large frozen juice disks. These disks share some properties with prey carcasses: they are a valued, but limited, resource; they take a considerable period of time to consume; they can be monopolized by one individual, but bits can be broken off and transferred to others. Our analyses suggest that food transfers serve multiple functions for chimpanzees. Individuals may use food transfers to enhance the welfare of closely related group members, strengthen social relationships with favoured partners and reduce the costs of persistent solicitations.

AB Prey often suffer foraging costs associated with antipredator behaviours such as vigilance. Migration is one behaviour in ungulates that can lead to trade-offs between forage acquisition and predator avoidance. However, when forage intake is limited by food-handling time rather than by food encounter rate, ungulates can reduce foraging costs by synchronizing vigilance with chewing (multitasking). In this study, we compared patterns of vigilance, frequency of multitasking and total foraging time between migrant and resident individuals in a partially migratory elk, Cervus canadensis, population while they were together on their sympatric winter range. We used these comparisons to determine whether one herd segment had an advantage over the other in terms of forage intake and predator avoidance. Using observations of focal individuals, we found that residents were better than migrants at adjusting vigilance levels to spatial variation in wolf, Canis lupus, predation risk associated with a human-caused predation refuge. Migrant elk were less vigilant than residents where wolf predation risk was highest. Residents probably had an advantage over migrants because they were better at mitigating the foraging costs of vigilance by synchronizing vigilance with chewing. Migrant elk did not compensate for higher foraging costs by altering total activity time. Our study shows how foraging behaviours of free-ranging ungulates might contribute to demographic differences that lead to the loss of migratory behaviours.

AB Agonistic interactions between males for the ownership of mating territories are common among animal species. There are at least three theoretical models aimed to clarify the rules used by rivals to decide the contest winner: war of attrition model (WOA), sequential assessment model (SAM) and cumulative assessment model (CAM). However, few empirical investigations have simultaneously tested predictions from these three models, reducing our ability to infer each model's explanatory power. In this study, we used males of the dragonfly Diastatops obscura to identify traits that affect individual fighting ability (resource-holding potential, RHP) and to test predictions derived from WOA, SAM and CAM models. For this, we identified morphological and physiological male traits related to chances of victory, timed contests between males and evaluated the relationship between male traits, contest duration and performance of costly behaviours. Individual body mass represented the main trait affecting RHP. Contest duration decreased with increasing winner body mass and increased with increasing loser body mass, rejecting the WOA model. The probability of physical contact increased with decreasing mass differences between rivals. Additionally, when considering pairs of rivals that showed similar mass differences, contest duration was unrelated to loser body mass. Since fights can lead to physical contact, body mass may affect the capacity to inflict costs on the rivals. Also, the relationships between contest duration and RHP and between the probability of physical contact and RHP difference between rivals indicate that males perform mutual assessment of fighting ability, as presumed by SAM.

AB There is considerable controversy about what is encoded when primates produce alarm calls to an external event. Results are often compatible with multiple explanations, such as differences in a caller's perceived level of threat, direction of attack or category of predator. Using acoustic predator models, we investigated how male blue monkeys', Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmani, alarm calls were affected by predator type, distance, and elevation. We found that individuals produced two types of acoustically distinct alarm calls, 'pyows' and 'hacks'. Males produced these calls in predator-specific ways, but call rates were also affected by the distance and location of the predator. We discuss these findings in relation to the different predator hunting techniques and two common antipredator strategies pursued by monkeys, predator deterrence and conspecific warning.

AB An understanding of how animals alter their behaviour in relation to environmental conditions is a key element in the study of animal movement, foraging ecology and habitat use, and can provide valuable information for practical conservation and management applications. To exploit resources in heterogeneous landscapes optimally, foragers should intensively search in profitable patches while minimizing foraging activities in low-quality areas. We used first-passage time (FPT) analysis to identify and characterize area-restricted search (ARS) behaviour along the nightly movement paths of racoons. While FPT analysis has been successfully applied to a variety of pelagic species, our goal was to determine the ability of FPT to detect habitat characteristics associated with changes in searching behaviour for a terrestrial predator. Racoons, Procyon lotor, were tracked via radiotelemetry during their nightly movements. We found evidence of ARS behaviour in 55 of 58 paths, with racoons concentrating intensive searching bouts in areas with an average radius of 42.6 m (range 20-100 m). To test whether our detection of ARS represented an actual change in behaviour, we tracked five racoons in relation to an artificial food patch. We detected ARS behaviour during 9 of 10 occasions in which a tracked animal encountered the food patch. Racoons showed ARS behaviour in areas with abundant shallow water, and they moved quickly through openings and dry areas with sparse ground-level vegetation. Application of this method should prove useful for studies of habitat use and foraging ecology of terrestrial predators by providing links between animal movements and the environment.

AB Both sensory and motor mechanisms can constrain behavioural performance. Sensory mechanisms may be especially important for constraining behaviours that depend on experience, such as learned bird-songs. Swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, learn to sing by imitating the song of a tutor, but they fail to accurately imitate artificial tutor songs with abnormally accelerated trills, instead singing brief and rapid trills interrupted by silent gaps. This 'broken syntax' has been proposed to arise from vocal-motor limitations. Here we consider whether sensory limitations exist that could also contribute to broken syntax. We tested this idea by recording auditory-evoked activity of sensorimotor neurons in the swamp sparrow's brain that are known to be important for the learning, performance and perception of song. In freely behaving adult sparrows that sang songs with normal syntax, neurons were detected that exhibited precisely time-locked activity to each repetition of the syllable in a trill when presented at a natural rate. Those cells failed to faithfully follow syllables presented at an accelerated rate, however, and their failure to respond to consecutive syllables increased as a function of trill rate. This 'flickering' auditory representation in animals performing normal syntax reveals a central constraint on the sensory processing of rapid trills. Furthermore, because these neurons are implicated in both song learning and perception, and because auditory flickering began to occur at accelerated trill rates previously associated with the emergence of broken song syntax, these sensory constraints may contribute to the emergence of broken syntax.

AB In communication networks, territorial neighbours often regulate social relations using long-range signals. However, such relations may be affected when unfamiliar third parties threaten the territorial integrity of the neighbourhood. We investigated responses of vocally interacting nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos, that were successively challenged by simulated rivals prospecting the neighbourhood. Using playback experiments, we tested whether territorial behaviour of males is affected differently dependent on whether their neighbours were challenged with aggressively or moderately singing rivals and whether information from the observed interaction is being used in subsequent encounters with the simulated prospector. Males sang more moderately the closer they were to a neighbour that was threatened by an aggressively singing rival. When challenged themselves, these males then discriminated between rivals depending on how they had previously interacted with their neighbour. Thus, males condition their vocal behaviour on their neighbour's situation and use information from neighbour-stranger interactions in future decision making. These findings reveal that in social networks, rivals' behaviour and distance to neighbours matter, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple individuals and their spatial relations when assessing the functions of territorial signalling.

AB Negotiating joint routes during group travel is one of the challenges faced by collectively moving animals, on spatial scales ranging from daily foraging trips to long-distance migrations. Homing pigeons, Columba livia, provide a useful model system for studying the mechanisms of group decision making in the context of navigation, owing to the combination of their gregarious nature and the depth of our understanding of their individual orientational strategies. Previous work has shown that during paired flight, if two birds' individually preferred routes are sufficiently different, one bird will emerge as leader whom the other follows. What determines the identity of a leader has important implications for the efficiency of a moving collective, since leaders with higher navigational certainty can increase the accuracy of the group. We examined factors contributing to the establishment of leadership/followership, focusing on the role of previous navigational experience. We tested, on a homing task, pairs of pigeons in which the two partners had relatively greater and lesser prior experience, generated through individual training. Analysis of the GPS-tracked routes taken by such pairs revealed a negative correlation between homing experience and the probability that a pigeon would follow a co-navigating partner. Thus, the larger the difference in experience between two partners, the higher the likelihood the more experienced bird would emerge as leader. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms and potential payoffs of collective navigational decision making in species that travel in mixed-experience groups.

AB Agonistic signals used during contests over important resources have been extensively studied; post-conflict signals have received comparatively little attention. While 'triumph displays', performed by winners following fights, have been described for many species, no experiment has yet assessed one of the main hypotheses explaining their existence: advertising victory to social eavesdroppers. Our experiments evaluated the impact of triumph calls on the behaviour and stress responses of surrounding penguins. We found that territorial male little blue penguins, Eudyptula minor, having previously been exposed to playback of a vocal exchange between conspecifics followed by the sounds of a fight, had higher heart rates in response to the winner's call than that of the loser; females had high rates in response to both winners and losers. Males were also less likely to threaten winners than losers vocally during a simulated approach of their burrow, while females remained silent in both contexts. Our findings support the hypothesis that triumph calls facilitate an association of winners' distinctive vocalizations with stress generated by nearby overt aggression. By advertising their victories, males may establish a 'reputation' for winning fights within the social group, potentially reducing the likelihood of being challenged by eavesdroppers in future contests.

AB Theory predicts that investment in current offspring should negatively influence a parent's ability to invest in future offspring. Despite extensive interest in documenting reproductive costs in birds, evidence for fitness-related costs of egg production to breeding females is scarce. In this study, we used an egg-removal experiment on the house wren, Troglodytes aedon, to test the hypothesis that producing eggs is reproductively costly. By removing eggs from the nest as they were laid, we induced females to produce more eggs than normal, although experimental and control females incubated clutches of similar size. Females producing extra eggs paid steep fitness costs for their increased effort; relative to controls, females with increased egg-laying demands were less likely to reproduce again within the same breeding season, and those that did took longer to do so, had a smaller clutch size and produced fewer fledglings from their subsequent broods. Although females in each treatment group were equally likely to return to breed the following summer, experimental females produced fewer eggs than control females in their next breeding season. This is the first demonstration that increased effort in egg production reduces the future reproductive output of passerine birds. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sexual conflict over female remating behaviour has been implicated in the evolution and maintenance of nuptial food gifts in insects. Recent evidence suggests that the spermatophylax provided by male decorated crickets, Gryllodes sigillatus, a gelatinous adjunct to a male's spermatophore that is consumed by the female after mating, contains substances that inhibit female sexual receptivity, but that females have evolved resistance to these compounds. The identity of these substances remains unknown, but a significant component of the solid fraction of the gifts is composed of free amino acids, primarily glycine and proline. We tested the hypothesis that glycine is the refractory-inducing substance in two experiments in which we (1) injected female house crickets, Acheta domesticus, a species known to be susceptible to the refractory-inducing effects of spermatophylax consumption, with solutions containing glycine, proline, or a saline control and (2) fed female A. domesticus experimental gels containing glycine, proline, a mixture of both, or a saline control. The results of these experiments suggest that ingestion, but not injection, of glycine leads to a delay in remounting and remating by female A. domesticus. The absence of an effect of glycine injected into the haemocoel of the female suggests a mechanism by which glycine inhibits female sexual receptivity: glycine may be stimulating taste neurons that have downstream neurological effects on female behaviour.

AB A male displaying to attract a mate faces the problem of effectively communicating through a complex and variable signalling environment. Many solutions to this problem include flexible adjustments of signaller behaviour that result in improved signal transmission, yet the mechanisms underlying these solutions remain unknown. We propose that males can optimize signal transmission by attending to female feedback cues and adjusting their signalling position accordingly. We test this hypothesis with males of the wolf spider Schizocosa rovneri, which court females with seismic signals transmitted through substrates on the forest floor. In response, receptive S. rovneri females perform a slow pivot display, producing visual and seismic cues. We mimic female receptivity using puppets, manipulated remotely, and ask whether males alter their signalling position, in terms of substrate use, with female feedback. We further ask if adjustment depends upon receiving cues in particular sensory modalities. We found that males receiving visual and/or seismic feedback cues from puppet females increased overall signalling effort. However, only males that received seismic feedback cues altered substrate use when subsequently signalling. Ultimately, males optimized their signal transmission by altering their use of signalling substrate in response to seismic female receptivity cues. Our results demonstrate a behavioural mechanism for how males effectively position themselves in the signalling environment: experience with female feedback.

AB Microbial ecologists strive to understand the factors that influence the structures and functions of microbial communities. At first glance, understanding these communities might not seem to offer much to biologists studying the behaviour of animals. However, several exciting new studies demonstrate that microbial ecology has the potential to advance research on both proximate and ultimate questions in animal behaviour. Here we review three such questions: (1) how do animals recognize individuals, group members and kin, (2) how do animals choose among potential mates, and (3) what are the evolutionary costs and benefits of social relationships? Contributions to these problems from microbial ecology come from two basic ideas. First, the structure of animals' bacterial communities is shaped by their hosts' environments, physiologies, genotypes and social relationships. In turn, these communities can communicate this information about their animal hosts, especially through odour. Second, social relationships can mediate exposure and susceptibility to bacteria, and this socially mediated transmission can influence the evolutionary costs and benefits of social relationships. Throughout our review, we focus on the bacterial communities of vertebrates because their behaviourally relevant symbionts have received little attention compared to those of invertebrates. We focus on how new genetic tools in microbial ecology make it possible to test long-standing hypotheses in behavioural ecology, and we highlight future research directions at the interface of microbial and behavioural ecology.

AB Male reproductive cooperation is rare in nature: expectations from evolutionary theory suggest that males should be competitors for reproductive opportunities and provide little parental care. Counter to this expectation, in cooperatively polyandrous mating systems, multiple adult males mate with a single breeding female and subsequently cooperate to rear her young. This raises the question of the fitness benefits of parental care, as males may be providing care to offspring that are not their own. Here, I use genetic and demographic data from a multiyear field study of Geoffroy's tamarin, Saguinus geoffroyi, to test predictions of the indirect and direct fitness benefits hypotheses. I found that polyandrous males within a group were related at levels consistent with filial or fraternal relationships (r = 0.36-0.44) and could also share paternity (40% of groups had > 2 male sires). Sharing of paternity occurred both within litters and over multiyear associations that remained stable throughout the study period of 2-3 years. However, remaining groups had a single sire, perhaps owing to the ability of males to prevail in sperm competition. These results suggest the joint role of indirect and direct fitness benefits in male-male cooperation in tamarins, in contrast to other cooperatively polyandrous species. The high average relatedness of polyandrous males may be consistent with fraternal cooperative polyandry in this species, as observed in certain human societies, providing a novel example that should enhance comparative studies of the evolution of male-male cooperation in reproduction.

AB The ability to learn and form long-term memory (LTM) can enhance an animal's fitness, for example by allowing it to remember predators, food sources or conspecific interactions. Here we used the great pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, to assess whether variability among natural populations in memory-forming capabilities occurs on a microgeographical scale. We used four populations from two different habitat types separated by 1-20 km: two from large, permanent canals and two from small, fluctuating drainage ditches. Of the four populations tested, only one, from a small drainage ditch, formed LTM lasting 24 h after a 0.5 h operant training session to reduce aerial respiration in hypoxic conditions when trained in pond water alone. Each of the four populations demonstrated the same memory retention capability over 2 consecutive years, indicating temporal stability within each population tested. Despite this lack of a consistent ability for LTM formation among populations in pond water, all populations tested demonstrated LTM formation in the presence of predator kairomones, from both tench, Tinca tinca, a predatory fish present at the large canal sites, and crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, known to extend memory in a Dutch L. stagnalis population. Therefore, while we found differences between populations in LTM retention after training in pond water, the response to predator kairomones during training, an ecologically relevant stressor, appears highly conserved in this species, enabling all populations to form LTM.

AB Microorganisms are ubiquitous and key selective agents in parental care behaviour. Various animal species have thus evolved diverse means to prevent and combat detrimental effects of microbial competitors and pathogens on their offspring. The European beewolf, Philanthus triangulum, is a solitary crabronid wasp that stores paralysed honeybees as larval provisions in subterranean nests. In the soil the highly nutritious provisions can be attacked by a large number of microorganisms. We investigated the effect of fungal infestations of larval provisions on the reproductive success of beewolves. Although fungal infestations reduced larval survival, female beewolves largely eliminated this effect by embalming larval provisions with ample amounts of hydrocarbons. However, this came at the cost of a reduced ability to apply hydrocarbons to the provisions of future offspring. This reduced investment in embalming resulted in a higher risk of mould infestations. Embalming of the prey in P. triangulum thus meets the criterion of parental investment and females have to balance this investment of hydrocarbons in current and future offspring to maximize their lifetime reproductive success.

AB In social animals, decisions about which group to join can have important fitness consequences and may be particularly critical when groups have a strict dominance hierarchy that relates to reproductive success. Choosing a large group may maximize safety, but choosing to join a small group can minimize the delay until a dominant reproductive position can be reached. We explored this trade-off between safety and rank using Neolamprologus pulcher, a cichlid fish in which individuals conform to a rigid within-group dominance hierarchy. In this species, females typically inherit dominant positions by ascending in rank, while males commonly take over a dominant breeding position by dispersing into a new group. Because females have fewer opportunities to switch groups, we predicted that females would place higher value on social rank within their group than would males. To test this, we examined male and female N. pulcher's preferences for joining large groups at a low rank versus joining small groups at a high rank. Males showed clear preferences for larger (presumably safer) groups, while females showed no such preferences. In a second experiment, we held joining rank constant, and found that both males and females showed a strong preference for large groups. Our results suggest that when joining a group, females consider both rank and safety whereas males are primarily concerned with safety. Our results help to elucidate the factors underlying social decision making in a cooperative breeder. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent studies have reported conflicting evidence for the influence of train-feather eyespots on the mating success of peacocks, Pavo cristatus. In this study we address this controversy, using observation and experiment to evaluate the effect of train morphology and the number of eyespots displayed during courtship on female choice. We show first that the maximum number of eyespots in the train is consistent among adult peacocks in feral populations at about 165e170 eyespots, and that most of the observed variation in eyespot number appears to be due to feather breakage or loss. Although we confirm a previous report that removing a large number (>= 20) of the outermost eyespots from a male's train decreases his mating success compared to unmanipulated males, this experimental modification produces an ornament that is outside the range of eyespot number typically displayed during courtship. Thus, the considerable variation in the mating success of feral peacocks cannot be explained by natural variation in the number of eyespots visible in the train. Peafowl mate choice is clearly more complex than previously thought: females may reject a few males with substantially reduced eyespot number, while using some other cue to choose among males with typical trains.

AB Strong social bonds are uncommon among male mammals. In many mammals, however, males form all-male groups, providing opportunities for male-male bonds to emerge. We examined association patterns of male African elephants, Loxodonta africana, in all-male groups and assessed the influence of age and genetic relatedness on these associations. We also examined the influence of age and genetic relatedness on the choice of sparring partners in male elephants. Males had many weak and random associations and few valuable relationships. Male associations were positively correlated with genetic relatedness, suggesting that kinship influences patterns of male associations. Male associations were negatively correlated with age disparity, and males were more likely to spar with other males closer in age to themselves. These results suggest that males associate with other males of similar age in part because sparring may facilitate the development and maintenance of motor and psychological responses to sudden and unexpected events that occur during play; this may help prepare males for male-male competition. We also found that older males had high centrality and strength in social networks, suggesting that older males influence the cohesion of male social groups. Consequently, the elimination of older males from elephant populations by poachers or trophy hunters could negatively affect social cohesion in male elephant groups. Finally, we found that age and genetic relatedness were not significantly correlated, suggesting that male associations based on age and relatedness did not overlap. These findings highlight the complexity of male social relationships in all-male groups. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Australian desert ants, Melophorus bagoti, return home after foraging by means of path integration and visual navigation. If these mechanisms do not deliver them exactly at the inconspicuous nest entrance, they engage in a systematic search. Here we describe the structure of this search pattern in detail. Trained ants ran home from a feeder in the natural visual setting where they navigated very accurately, and were then captured for tests on a distant test field after they had almost reached their nest. The search pattern consisted of loops and was centred on the position where the nest was most likely to be located. At first, it covered a rather small area, but then gradually extended outwards to cover a larger area. The search density was also adapted to the preceding outbound foraging distance, with longer distances leading to flatter, wider search distributions. Since the visual surround at the time of capture was similar for ants with all outbound distances, we suggest this is an adaptation to the cumulative error of the homing vector. The frequency distribution of segment lengths in the paths of searching ants does not show characteristics of a Levy walk strategy. Instead, it is well described by a double exponential model, lending support to a theoretically optimal strategy that consists of a mixture of two random walks, as in the composite Brownian walk strategy.

AB Communication in complex environments poses challenges of potential loss of intended messages, but some animals may compensate by using multimodal signalling. Courtship displays of male Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz) wolf spiders are multimodal, consisting of visual and seismic signals. The microhabitat of S. ocreata is complex, including leaf litter, wood/bark, soil and rocks. Results from laser vibrometer measurements in the present study indicated that leaf litter transmitted male courtship signals with greater efficacy. Mating success was significantly greater on leaf litter (similar to 85%) compared to other substrates (similar to 30%), even though latency to male courtship did not vary among substrates. Given these results, selection should favour spiders that increase their mating potential on nonconducting substrates. We tested whether spiders detect substrate differences in a choice test, and found that when males and females visited all substrates, they spent significantly more time on leaf litter. We isolated courting male spiders on each substrate and scored courtship behaviours to see whether signals varied with substrate. Males used significantly more visual signals (waves and arches) on substrates that attenuated seismic signals (soil and rocks), but other behaviours showed no differences. Taken together, these results suggest that combined visual/seismic components of multimodal displays may serve as 'backup signals', ensuring reception under different environmental conditions. Results also suggest that male S. ocreata have the flexibility to compensate for environmental constraints by seeking microhabitats with more effective vibration conduction properties, and/or by increasing visual signals on substrates where seismic communication is less effective.

AB In most species, female reproductive success is determined by realized fecundity, which depends on the amount of female reproductive reserves and the availability of time for oviposition. Consequently, selection is likely to favour behaviour in virgin females that increases the likelihood of encountering males and thereby minimizing time without sperm. We used the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria, to test the hypothesis that virgin females increase the probability of encountering males by behaving more conspicuously. We also tested for an effect of age on behaviour, with the prediction that females behave more conspicuously if they remain unmated for a longer period. To do this we conducted controlled behavioural studies in large outdoor cages, comparing the behaviour of young and old, virgin and mated, females. We also assessed the time it took for a male to discover virgin versus mated females. Our results show an effect of age and mating status: old virgin females behaved more conspicuously than young virgin females and mated females, and spent more time in flight and performed more individual flights. Males also discovered virgin females faster than mated females. Furthermore, virgin females did not specifically locate the large sunspot, where perching males are found. Hence, females of P. aegeria adjust their behaviour in accordance with mating status and age, making them more likely to encounter a male and thereby maximize their reproductive success. This study underlines the importance of taking the distribution and behaviour of receptive females into account when studying mate-locating behaviour.

AB Access to one's newborn infant is a commodity that can be traded for other benefits such as grooming in nonhuman primates. According to the biological market paradigm, the price paid should fluctuate with the number of newborns in the group. We investigated the grooming sessions between mothers with infants less than 3 months old and other adult females in free-ranging primates: one group of sooty mangabeys, Cercocebus atys, with 35 adult females (Ivory Coast) and two groups of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops, with four and seven females, respectively (South Africa). Although many more infants were born per birth season in the mangabey group than in the vervet groups, interaction patterns involving infants showed many similarities: mothers did not reciprocate grooming received from non-mothers, but exchanged it directly for the opportunity to handle their infants, whereby obtaining access to infants required longer grooming bouts than reciprocating grooming in grooming sessions not involving infants. Low-ranking handlers needed to groom mothers for longer than their higher-ranking counterparts. The 'value' of an infant, in terms of grooming time received by the mother, decreased when infants grew older or when many infants were simultaneously present in the group. In vervets, infant availability affected handling times: females handled infants for longer when there were fewer infants. Furthermore, only frequent grooming partners of the mother could handle infants for longer and this familiarity was not kin related. This suggests that if the value of an infant varies with dominance, infant handling time may be determined by the quality of the females' relationships.

AB Studies on advanced forms of tool use in birds have mainly been concentrated on corvids. In this study, captive kea, a neophilic New Zealand parrot species, produced different orders of spatial object relationships in a tube-lifting/object-inserting paradigm. Hence, we found that kea, which are neither natural tool users nor nest builders, could readily solve a second-order tool use task. They also learned to produce highly complicated means-means-end sequences in a short period of time. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The mechanisms maintaining homosexual behaviour in animals are not well understood. In fruit flies, where male-male courtship is prevalent, it has been suggested that young males gain from being courted by mature males, perhaps through learning. I conducted two series of experiments to critically examine why mature males court immature males and what immature males may gain from such courtship. The results indicate that mature males do not identify the sex of the sexually ambiguous immature males and find them attractive even after substantial experience. These findings agree with recent research indicating that males initially court a broad range of potential mating targets and then narrow their courtship focus based on their experience of being rejected by classes of flies such as recently mated females or heterospecific females, which are clearly identified by their distinct pheromonal profiles. Compared to inexperienced males, males that either had received courtship when immature or had been housed with mature males when young did not have either higher mating frequencies or shorter mating latencies but spent more time courting females. Such higher courtship intensities may translate into a mating advantage in some settings. It appears that young males that interact with mature males develop into a sexually aggressive phenotype, which could better prepare them to compete for females.

AB Why do females mate with multiple males? Since females often acquire all the sperm they need in one mating and since mating is usually costly, the evolution of polyandry is puzzling. Females may gain from mating multiply by ensuring fertilization, increasing offspring diversity, improving mate quality ('good genes') or increasing genetic compatibility. Alternatively, multiple mating may result in a net cost to females as a by-product of male-male competition. We report on field experiments in which we evaluated whether spawning with multiple males is costly or beneficial for female horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus. Unpaired male horseshoe crabs crowd around some spawning pairs (polyandrous) as satellites while ignoring others (monandrous). We conducted three field experiments in which we compared the success of (1) unmanipulated polyandrous and monandrous females, (2) polyandrous females with and without satellites (satellites removed) and (3) monandrous females without and with satellites (forced to be polyandrous by adding satellites). When polyandrous females lost their satellite males, they laid more eggs than did polyandrous females that retained their satellites. When a satellite male arrives at a monandrous pair, some females are tolerant and will nest as a polyandrous female, but many females are intolerant of satellite males and leave immediately, thus laying fewer eggs. These results indicate that spawning with multiple males is costly in terms of nesting success for female horseshoe crabs. Yet, natural monandrous and polyandrous females did equally well, suggesting that there are compensating benefits from multiple males for polyandrous females. We suggest that monandry and polyandry may be alternative reproductive tactics for female horseshoe crabs. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In precocial bird species, the eggs constitute most of the maternal investment because parents do not feed the young after they hatch. Maternal testosterone in egg yolk influences the embryo's and chick's development. Females deposit testosterone in the eggs as a response to the environment experienced during the laying period, including the quality of their mate. To assess the relevance of the female's mate selection on egg characteristics in the grey partridge, Perdix perdix, we tested breeding females in a choice trial where they were allowed to choose between two males. After the choice trials, females were mated either with their preferred male (P group) or with the nonpreferred one (NP group). Although eggs laid by females of the two groups did not differ significantly in mass, females of the P group laid eggs with a higher yolk testosterone concentration than females of the NP group. This study agrees with previous work pointing out that partner attractiveness may play an important role in the transfer of maternally derived egg components.

AB In sheep, Ovis aries, lambs show a preference for their own mother soon after birth, which is important for their survival. The relative role of low-and high-pitched bleats provided by the mother in this early preference is not clear. While acoustic recognition is clearly established in 2-day-old lambs, it is not known whether lambs use an individual acoustic signature, or some other feature of acoustic communication (type of bleat or a combination of responses) by the mother indicating acceptance. The acoustic analysis of bleats demonstrated that both types of vocalization can support individual discrimination and that frequency spectrum and amplitude modulation exhibit an individual stereotypy. However, the characteristics of bleats and the quantity of encoding information in them differed between low-and high-pitched bleats. In two-choice procedures, we tested the ability of 48 h-old lambs to discriminate between recorded bleats of their own mother and an unfamiliar equivalent mother. Lambs showed a preference for the playback of low-pitched bleats of their own mother, but not for high-pitched bleats. Therefore, 48 h-old lambs can use an individual acoustic signature to recognize their own mother when low-pitched bleats are used. In contrast when high-pitched bleats are used, a vocal exchange between the mother and her lamb appears necessary. We conclude that 48 h-old lambs are able to learn and recognize the individual characteristics of their mother's low-pitched bleats and that this vocal recognition may be important for the establishment of the mother-young bond even at this early stage of the relationship.

AB Males and females of many species engage in agonistic encounters. However, differing selection pressures on each sex are predicted to result in sex differences in aggressive behaviour during contests. Comparing male and female intrasexual contests can yield intriguing differences, shedding light on the forces shaping the use of particular aggressive tactics. We investigated whether fundamental gender-related differences in aggression, not explained by current parental role, are present in convict cichlids, Amatitlania nigrofasciata. Intrasexual agonistic encounters between isolated males and between isolated females not previously paired to a breeding partner were staged. Using this approach we first tested for behavioural differences between the sexes. Second, using a novel startle technique aimed at probing motivation to fight, we tested for gender-related differences in aggressive motivation. Third, we examined whether size, rather than gender, plays a role in determining the tactics used during contests. In addressing these aims we found: (1) females used more frontal display and biting, and spent more time in close proximity to their opponent, whereas males used more lateral display and tail beating than females during agonistic encounters; (2) there was no difference in the response of male or female convict cichlids to a startling stimulus aimed at probing motivation to fight; and (3) the addition of focal weight and length as possible covariates had no significant effect on the analyses. Possible causal and functional reasons for these gender-related differences in fight tactics are discussed. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   RECIPROCITY; DOMINANCE; PRIMATES
AB Interventions occur when animals interfere in competitive interactions between two or more individuals. Interveners can alter the nature of the ongoing interaction by targeting one party (attacking, biting) and supporting the other. Three theories have been proposed to account for intervention behaviour: kin selection, reciprocity and direct benefits. The kin selection hypothesis predicts that interveners will selectively support relatives over nonrelatives; the reciprocity hypothesis predicts that when intervener 'A' supports individual 'B', later 'B' will intervene and support 'A'; and the direct benefits hypothesis predicts that target/support patterns should serve the immediate interests of the intervener. We tested the reciprocity and direct benefits hypotheses by exploring third-party interventions in play fighting among littermates of domestic dogs. Interveners in dyadic play did not preferentially target or support preferred playmates of the intervener. Interveners targeted the dog in the losing role at the time of the intervention, and they did not show reciprocity in support. Taken together, these last two findings suggest that littermates benefit directly and use interventions opportunistically to practise offence behaviours directed at littermates already behaving subordinately. Opportunities to practise targeting in a playful setting may help structure dominance relationships among littermates. Additionally, the tendency for puppies to do what the other is doing (target the dog in the losing role) may pave the way for synchronizing cooperative behaviours during group hunting and territorial defence. The types of behaviours used to intervene changed over development, but the outcome following an intervention remained stable. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The perception of ultraviolet light and its role in communication has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Although ultraviolet light is no different to other wavelengths in many respects, its role as a signal does deserve special consideration, if only because it is frequently overlooked by human observers who are unable to see it. Studies on the role of ultraviolet cues in inter- and intrasexual interactions are still rare, and generally focused on vertebrates with relatively complex visual systems. Here we show for the first time that crustaceans, with a relatively simple, probably dichromatic, visual system, also use ultraviolet cues in mate choice. We found that the enlarged claws of male Uca mjoebergi reflect ultraviolet wavelengths of light. Mate-searching females preferred ultraviolet-reflecting males over those whose reflectance was blocked with sunscreen. Conspecific males showed no such preference when deciding which rival to attack, suggesting that ultraviolet cues are not involved in signalling competitive ability.

AB Animal communication studies often use analogies to human language and related constructs such as information encoding and transfer. This commonality is evident even when research goals are very different, for example when primate vocalizations are proposed to have word-like meaning, or sexually selected signals are proposed to convey information about a signaller's underlying quality. We consider some of the ambiguities and limitations inherent in such informational approaches to animal communication as background to advocating alternatives. The alternatives eschew language-based metaphors and broader informational constructs and focus instead on concrete details of signal design as they reflect and interact with established sensory, physiological and psychological processes that support signalling and responding in listeners. The alternatives we advocate also explicitly acknowledge the different roles and often divergent interests of signallers and perceivers that can yield fundamental asymmetries in signalling interactions, and they therefore shift the focus of interpretations of animal communication from informing others to influencing others.

AB Lateralized behaviour in the felids has been subject to little investigation. We examined the paw use of 42 domestic cats on three tasks designed to determine whether the animals performed asymmetrical motor behaviour. The influence of the cats' sex and age on their paw preferences was also explored. The distribution of the cats' paw preferences differed significantly between the three tasks. Task 1, the most complex exercise involving retrieval of a food treat from an empty jar, encouraged the most apparent display of lateralized behaviour, with all but one animal showing a strong preference to use either their left or right paw consistently. Tasks 2 (an exercise involving reaching for a toy suspended overhead) and 3 (a challenge involving reaching for a toy moving along the ground) encouraged ambilateral motor performance. Lateralized behaviour was strongly sex related. Male and female cats showed paw preferences at the level of the population, but in opposite directions. Females had a greater preference for using their right paw; males were more inclined to adopt their left paw. Feline age was unrelated to either strength or direction of preferred paw use. Overall, the findings suggest that there are two distinct populations of paw preference in the cat that cluster strongly around the animals' sex. The results also point to a relationship between lateralized behaviour and task complexity. More apparent patterns of lateralized behaviour were evident on more complex manipulatory tasks, hinting at functional brain specialization in this species.

AB The fitness consequences of plural breeding vary considerably among social vertebrates. We tested three hypotheses for the direct reproductive fitness consequences of group living in the degu Octodon degus, a social rodent endemic to central Chile. To test the 'benefits of communal care' hypothesis, we determined the relationship between the number of females per group, per capita direct fitness and offspring survival. To test the 'food abundance and quality' hypothesis, we determined the relationship between the biomass of preferred foods at burrow systems, group size, per capita direct fitness and offspring survival. To test the 'predation risk' hypothesis, we determined the relationship between group size, the density of burrow entrances to which social groups had access, per capita direct fitness, and survival of adults and offspring. Group size of core females (i.e. those with 50% or more nightly overlap) was negatively correlated with per capita direct fitness, but not with the number of females per group or total group size. Group living did not enhance the survival of offspring. Greater biomass of food (at 3 m and 9 m) and burrow density were not linked to larger groups and offspring survival. Our results did not support predictions of the 'benefits of communal care', 'food abundance and quality' or 'predation risk' hypothesis. Pending microsatellite analyses, we hypothesize that survival benefits linked to foraging group size and not reproductive fitness benefits may explain the evolution of sociality in degus.

   DEFENSE; SIGNAL; PREY
AB Prey animals can survive a predatory encounter if they communicate unprofitability to an approaching predator. Otherwise undefended prey often use conspicuous deimatic (frightening) displays to intimidate closely approaching predators into delaying or aborting an attack. The 'startle' displays of several insect groups are the best-known example: comprising a sudden size increase coupled with a conspicuous 'eyespot' pattern, these displays can effectively deter highly dangerous avian predators, although they are often unsuccessful. Cephalopods perform remarkably similar visual displays that are presumed to function in the same way, although evidence for this is lacking. Unlike large insects, cephalopods possess rapid escape responses, and seem unlikely to benefit from predator hesitation. Moreover, field and laboratory-based observations with cuttlefish suggest that what has previously been labelled the Deimatic Display may be directed towards small teleosts that pose little or no direct predation risk. In staged encounters between cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, and large predatory fish (sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax and smooth hound Mustelus mustelus), naive cuttlefish did not perform their Deimatic Display towards large predators, even when spatially constrained and unable to flee. Cuttlefish also discriminated between large predators, selectively using a different visual signal (previously termed the Flamboyant Display) towards the more dangerous teleost fish. These results strongly suggest that, although superficially similar, cephalopod deimatic displays are functionally different to insect displays: large brains and keen senses allow cuttlefish to discriminate between species, and selectively signal to small and only indirectly threatening teleost intruders, rather than highly dangerous predators.

AB We used 40 years of long-term data to test whether dispersal decisions of female African lions, Panthera leo, are sensitive to variations in pride size, interpride competition and the quality of their natal territory. Per capita reproductive success reached a maximum at 3-6 females on the open grass plains of the Serengeti and at 3-11 females in the woodlands. Approximately 50% of female cohorts dispersed when potential pride size exceeded the habitat-specific optimum, whereas only 9% of cohorts dispersed at smaller pride sizes. Cohorts of one to two females rarely dispersed, especially in high-density habitats. Thus, pride size typically remained within the range that maximized individual reproductive success. In the high-density woodland habitat, females were less likely to disperse from prides that were surrounded by large numbers of unrelated females, as would be predicted on the basis of habitat saturation. However, the number of unrelated neighbours did not affect dispersal decisions of females living in the sparsely occupied plains habitat. After pride fission, daughters settled closer to their mothers in areas where there were greater numbers of unrelated female neighbours, but territories were just as exclusive as between unrelated neighbouring prides. Maternal prides in high-quality areas shared a greater percentage of their territory with descendant prides, but this tolerance diminished as relatedness declined through time.

AB An understanding of how confined animals move within the space available to them is essential in the design of effective captive environments that maximize animal welfare. In addition to the obvious effect of enclosure size, other factors such as the number of individuals in the group and their density per unit of area are likely to affect movement patterns. Yet determining the specific contribution of each (enclosure size, group size and density) is a challenge because confounding between two or more of these factors is experimentally difficult to avoid. The aim of our study was to isolate their unique effects by using multiple contrasts with an efficient experimental design that included combinations of groups of 10, 20 and 30 domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus) housed in 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 m(2) enclosures. This treatment structure enabled us to make comparisons across increasing enclosure size at both constant group size and constant density. In this study we show that enclosure size and density are the primary factors affecting patterns of movement and use of space for groups of domestic fowl. Animals in larger enclosures maintained larger nearest-neighbour distances, travelled greater distances and had bigger home ranges as measured by minimum convex polygons. These results suggest that larger enclosures encourage more exploratory movement in groups of domestic fowl. However, the positive effects of large enclosures may be limited by the effects of density. In this study, we found that group size had few effects.

AB Domestication has been reported to reduce learning ability and to alter social behaviour. We compared the development of filial behaviour of domestic chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, and the ancestral red junglefow1, Gallus gallus. We investigated the tendency of naive chicks to approach conspicuous stimuli, as a measure of filial motivation, and the development of a preference for familiar stimuli over unfamiliar ones, as a measure of imprinting and hence of social-learning ability. Chicks were placed in an arena containing two stimuli ( a red cylinder and a blue ball) after being housed individually with one of these stimuli for 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 or 60 h. During a 20 min trial, observations were made of their latency to approach each stimulus and the amount of time spent close to them. With no prior exposure to either stimulus ( 0 h), the breeds did not differ in their readiness to approach stimuli, suggesting no difference in filial motivation. However, the breeds differed in their initial preferences between the two stimuli tested and in their ability to imprint on them. Junglefow1 chicks showed an initial preference for the red cylinder, but imprinted equally well on both stimuli, whereas Leghorn chicks showed no initial preference but imprinted relatively poorly on the red cylinder. We suggest that junglefow1 chicks may be more. exible in their ability to imprint on stimuli than domestic chicks; however, a greater variety of stimulus types must be tested to confirm this.

AB Transitive inference is a form of deductive reasoning that has been suggested as one cognitive mechanism by which animals could learn the many relationships within their group's dominance hierarchy. This process thus bears relevance to the social intelligence hypothesis, which posits evolutionary links between various forms of social and nonsocial cognition. Recent evidence corroborates the link between social complexity and transitive inference and indicates that highly social animals may show superior transitive reasoning even in nonsocial contexts. We examined the relationship between social complexity and transitive inference in two species of prosimians, a group of primates that diverged from the common ancestor of monkeys, apes and humans over 50 million years ago. In experiment 1, highly social ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, outperformed the less social mongoose lemurs, Eulemur mongoz, in tests of transitive inference and showed more robust representations of the underlying ordinal relationships between the stimuli. In experiment 2, after training under a correction procedure that emphasized the underlying linear dimension of the series, both species showed similar transitive inference. This finding suggests that the two lemur species differ not in their fundamental ability to make transitive inferences, but rather in their predisposition to mentally organize information along a common underlying dimension. Together, these results support the hypothesis that social complexity is an important selective pressure for the evolution of cognitive abilities relevant to transitive reasoning.

AB A wide variety of fish species release chemical alarm cues upon mechanical damage to their skin by predator attack. We investigated the effects of short-term food deprivation on the response to, and the production of, chemical alarm cues in the coral reef-dwelling goby Asterropteryx semipunctatus (family Gobiidae). Gobies deprived of food for 4 days did not react with fright when exposed to conspecific skin extracts. However, when the same individuals had been fed ad libitum, they responded with a typical alarm reaction to the skin extracts, including decreased movement and feeding. In a second experiment, gobies were exposed to skin extracts from conspecifics that had been food deprived and from conspecifics fed ad libitum. Damaged skin from food-deprived individuals did not elicit an alarm response in conspecifics, whereas skin from individuals that had been fed ad libitum yielded a typical alarm response. Histological sections of goby skin showed that food-deprived gobies had fewer sacciform cells in their epidermis than did gobies fed ad libitum. Evidence suggests that there may be a trade-off between foraging and antipredator behaviour, and also between the benefits derived from maintaining chemical alarm cue cells and the cost of producing them in A. semipunctatus.

AB Contestants can either assess their own resource-holding potential relative to their opponent (mutual assessment) or rely solely on the assessment of their own fighting ability (self-assessment). To discriminate between these possibilities, we staged dyadic territorial contests between 'size-matched' male swordtails. These contests consist of a combination of ritualized displays and direct fighting. Although size differences were small, winners were larger than losers and smaller fish tended to be winners only when the size difference was negligible. Body size, however, did not influence contest duration and there was no increase in contest duration with mean body size; thus, there is no support for self-assessment in these animals. We also examined the effects of the sword, which comprises a sexually selected extension used in female choice that reduces swimming efficiency but increases acceleration. The length of the sword (adjusted for body size) did not differ between winners and losers; however, losers conceded earlier if the opponent had a large sword for its body size but this decision was independent of the loser's own sword length. Losers thus assessed the swords of winners, which precludes self-assessment; however, because winners appeared not to assess the swords of losers, this does not fully support the idea of mutual assessment.

AB In species with biparental care, a female gains fitness benefits from the joint reproductive investment of herself and her partner, but pays only the costs of her own care. Selection thus favours mechanisms that allow females to elicit a higher paternal investment from their partners. In oviparous species, the allocation of maternal yolk androgens to the eggs might represent such a female adaptation to sexually antagonistic selection. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally blocked the effects of maternal yolk androgens by an injection of the antiandrogen flutamide or a control substance in the eggs of great tits, Parus major. We subsequently manipulated the food demand of the brood in a brood size manipulation experiment, and recorded the parental feeding rates. The males' food-provisioning rates were not significantly influenced by the actions of maternal yolk androgens, whereas females adjusted their parental effort to androgen-mediated nestling signals, in particular in enlarged broods. These results show that female great tits do not exploit the male's contribution to parental care by allocating high concentrations of yolk androgens to their eggs. However, they indicate that variation in yolk androgen allocation among females has evolved through a process of coadaptation that matches maternal food provisioning and offspring demand.

AB Nonhuman animals reliably select the largest of two or more sets of discrete items, particularly if those items are food items. However, many studies of these numerousness judgements fail to control for confounds between amount of food (e. g. mass or volume) and number of food items. Stimulus dimensions other than number of items also may influence how animals perceive sets and make choices. Four chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, completed a variety of tasks that involved comparisons of food items (graham crackers) that varied in number, size and orientation. In experiment 1, chimpanzees chose between two alternative sets of visible cracker pieces. In experiment 2, the experimenters presented one set of crackers in a vertical orientation (stacked) and the other in a horizontal orientation. In experiment 3, the experimenters presented all food items one at a time by dropping them into opaque containers. Chimpanzees succeeded overall in choosing the largest amount of food. They did not rely on number or contour length as cues when making these judgements but instead primarily responded to the total amount of food in the sets. However, some errors rejected choices of the set with the smaller total amount of food but the individually largest single food item. Thus, responses were not optimal because of biases that were not related to the total amount of food in the sets. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Females should prefer to mate with males that will confer fitness benefits on them or their offspring and should select mates on the basis of traits associated with those benefits. If the association between male traits and mate choice benefits differs with environments, then preferences should also differ. Previous work in flagfish, Jordanella floridae, has shown that female preferences for male nesting and parental care activities depend on the environment's salinity. I tested the hypothesis that variation in preference reflects variation in mate choice benefits. Specifically, I quantified the effects of salinity and parental care activities on hatching success and hatchling mass. I found that the effects of male nest preparation on hatching success were greater in fresh than in brackish water, consistent with the pattern of female preference for male activity directed towards empty nests. Similarly, the effects of egg fanning were the same at the two salinities, matching the pattern of female preference for male activity directed towards nests containing eggs. These results suggest that female mating preferences are stronger in environments in which the direct benefit of distinguishing between potential mates is greater.

AB Leafcutter ants, Atta colombica, forage over 250 m in structurally complex, Neotropical rainforests that occlude sun or polarized light cues. Night foraging makes the use of celestial cues and landmarks all the more difficult. We investigated the directional cues used by leafcutter ants to orient homeward by experimentally reversing the polarity of the local magnetic field and by experimentally subjecting the ants to a strong magnetic pulse to disrupt a magnetic compass. In both experiments, we transferred homeward-bound ants from a foraging trail to a table in a chamber that occluded landmark and celestial cues. In both experiments, control ants showed path integration and walked directly towards the nest. In the reversed field, one-half of the experimental ants oriented according to the reversed field ( geographically 180 degrees opposite to the nest's direction), indicating that they used a magnetic compass to update their positional reference derived from path integration. The other half walked towards the nest, suggesting that they may have used an egocentric reference to measure their rotation when displaced, although other explanations have not been entirely excluded. With application of a very brief, but strong, magnetic pulse, experimental ants oriented randomly. We conclude that the leafcutter ants use the earth's magnetic field as a reference by which to orient when path-integrating towards home.

AB The elaborate train of male Indian peafowl, Pavo cristatus, is thought to have evolved in response to female mate choice and may be an indicator of good genes. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the male train in mate choice using male- and female-centred observations in a feral population of Indian peafowl in Japan over 7 years. We found no evidence that peahens expressed any preference for peacocks with more elaborate trains (i.e. trains having more ocelli, a more symmetrical arrangement or a greater length), similar to other studies of galliforms showing that females disregard male plumage. Combined with previous results, our findings indicate that the peacock's train (1) is not the universal target of female choice, (2) shows small variance among males across populations and (3) based on current physiological knowledge, does not appear to reliably reflect the male condition. We also found that some behavioural characteristics of peacocks during displays were largely affected by female behaviours and were spuriously correlated with male mating success. Although the male train and its direct display towards females seem necessary for successful reproduction, we conclude that peahens in this population are likely to exercise active choice based on cues other than the peacock's train.

AB To be used as honest signals of quality, phenotypic traits must vary markedly within populations and show repeatable differences between individuals. Eastern kingbirds, Tyrannus tyrannus, sing a distinctive dawn song in the predawn darkness, and one hypothesis for its function is that it serves as an honest signal of male quality that females use during choice of within- pair or extrapair mates. Over a 2- year period, we quanti. ed dawn songs of males to measure between- and within- season repeatability of the timing ( start and end time) and length of song bouts, and song rate. We also measured morphological characters to measure repeatability and describe individual differences in body size and plumage quality. All song traits varied considerably among males, start time and song rates were repeatable between years, and all song rates were repeatable within both years. All morphological characters were significantly repeatable between years. Moreover, early singing males were larger and had relatively long flight feathers, and males that sang at high rates had relatively long flight feathers. Early singing males were also paired to the earliest breeding females, and in one year, male song rate was positively correlated with their social mate's clutch size. Relatively long. flight feathers in other species are typical of older males and individuals of higher body condition, suggesting that, despite being suboscine passerines with relatively simple and innate songs, eastern kingbirds use song performance as an honest signal of male quality that females may use during mate choice.

AB Understanding cooperative breeding requires an appreciation of the direct and indirect reproductive benefits available to group members, alongside the costs of group living such as increased potential for inbreeding. We use molecular techniques to determine sex, kinship and parentage to explore the benefits of helping and the mechanisms for incest avoidance in cooperatively breeding grey-crowned babblers, Pomatostomus temporalis. Generally, helpers gained only indirect fitness benefits through helping to raise kin. Breeding vacancies were usually filled by the oldest unrelated helper or by an immigrant if all helpers were related to the surviving breeder. A disproportionate number of helpers were unrelated to the dominant of the opposite sex. This suggests that related helpers disperse when their same-sex dominant dies rather than inherit the breeding position or help an unrelated immigrant to breed. Although monogamy was typical, extrapair paternity, joint-nesting and intraspecific brood parasitism were also revealed. Extrapair paternity was predicted by the relatedness of the dominant pair and appears to be an inbreeding avoidance mechanism, although some cases also suggest within-group reproductive conflict. This study is one of few to show a direct link between the rate of extrapair copulation and incest avoidance between the dominant breeding pair in a cooperatively breeding bird.

AB Despite the fact that in many bird species offspring are provisioned by two parents, few studies to date have examined the implications of biparental care for offspring solicitation behaviour. Male and female parents can differ in their potential value to individual offspring if they follow different allocation rules and/or have different provisioning rates. If such differences occur, offspring should use different rules when soliciting to the male and female parent. This study looked at how the begging behaviour of nestling blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, is influenced by their hunger, size and by the sex of the provisioning adult. Nestling hunger was manipulated across size ranks, using periods of hand feeding or food deprivation. While nestling hunger influenced all aspects of nestling begging behaviour, nestling size and the sex of the provisioning adult only affected the position of nestlings in the nest cup. When hungry, nestlings moved closer to the male parent and the largest nestlings in a brood primarily obtained the closest positions. This may be the result of offspring responding to a difference between the sexes in parental food allocation rules. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding the adaptive significance of multiple mating ( polyandry) by females has long been a challenge in evolutionary biology. Several genetic and nongenetic benefits have been proposed to explain the evolution and maintenance of polyandry. In eusocial Hymenoptera, a prominent hypothesis is that increased genetic diversity within colonies results in more polymorphic workers and facilitates division of labour. We analysed the genetic basis of worker size (i.e. worker head width) and task preference in Cataglyphis cursor, an ant showing natural variations in queen-mating frequency. Our data show that increased genetic diversity within colonies does not result in more polymorphic workers. Moreover, worker head width is not different between patrilines within colonies. Consistent with these findings, worker size has a low heritable component. Moreover, task performance is not correlated with patriline. By contrast, it is significantly associated with worker size: the first foragers leaving the nest at sunrise are significantly larger than workers remaining in the nest. Overall, these results do not support the hypothesis that multiple mating is favoured because increased genetic diversity within colonies translates into more polymorphic workers and facilitates genetic polyethism. We discuss other hypotheses to account for the evolution of polyandry in C. cursor. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many species, social interactions play a key role in deciding resource allocation. Aggression is one mechanism by which crayfish become dominant, which, in turn, enables them to acquire higher-quality resources. In crayfish, hierarchies and dominance structures are formed by dyadic interactions. In natural habitats, crayfish have agonistic interactions that often take place with other crayfish in the vicinity. There is a possibility for observers to gain information about potential future opponents. We were interested in examining the impact of observing agonistic interactions on the social behaviour of a bystander crayfish. Bystanders were visually exposed to one of four treatments followed by an agonistic interaction with a naive individual. Treatments consisted of: (1) two size-matched crayfish fighting (fight treatment); ( 2) two size-matched crayfish not fighting (visual control); (3) an empty fight arena with a retractable wall (motion control); or (4) an empty tank with no retractable wall (handling control). The second interaction, where the bystander crayfish was fought against a naive size-matched individual, or tester crayfish, was analysed by a person, blind to treatment, for initiation, winner-loser and temporal dynamics of escalation. Our results indicate that bystander crayfish exposed to the fight treatment lost significantly more often to tester crayfish than bystander crayfish subjected to control treatments. In addition, there were changes in the fight dynamics for the bystander crayfish. These results show that observations of interactions by a third crayfish have implications for hierarchies and social behaviour in natural settings.

AB Female mate choice is an important mechanism of sexual selection, and in many species, females assess multiple characteristics of potential mates. Numerous studies have documented individual traits that females use to select a mate, but few have investigated how females use multiple male sex traits to choose a mate. In this study, we tested four hypotheses to determine how female barking treefrogs use multiple call characteristics concurrently to select a mate: (1) females may perceive as a single trait characteristics that researchers have defined as separate; (2) females may assess traits hierarchically, using the lower-level trait only when the higher-level trait is difficult to distinguish between males; (3) one trait may not be directly assessed by females, but may amplify another trait that is directly assessed; and (4) females may assess several traits at once, weighting them either equally or differently. We tested these hypotheses with two-speaker playback experiments that varied call rate, duration, or both. We also compared preference functions for rate and duration using a logistic regression model. Playback experiments supported simultaneous assessment and refuted the other three hypotheses. Females weighted duration more heavily than rate when percentage difference between stimuli was 29%, but not when percentage difference was 100%. Preference functions revealed that, for a given percentage difference between stimuli, percentage preferences were greater for higher call rates than for longer calls. Thus, female barking treefrogs appear to treat rate and duration as. two separate traits and combine preferences for these traits nonadditively.

AB Seabirds laying a single egg per season can regulate breeding investment during prelaying through size and composition of the egg, and during postlaying by adjusting parental care. Both stages can influence offspring growth and survival. Although likely not independent, attempts to measure the relative contributions of egg size per se and parental quality to offspring fitness are rare. To unravel the effects of both variables, we performed a cross-fostering experiment in thin-billed prions, where pairs laying large or small eggs were randomly given either size of eggs to raise. Nestling growth was followed through to fledging. Hatchlings from large eggs were structurally larger and heavier. Egg size effects, for the first time shown to last throughout the nestling period, influenced chick growth parameters and fledging probability. Large-egg chicks reached a significantly higher maximum growth rate and peak mass than chicks hatched from small eggs. There was also a relationship between the size of the egg laid by the foster parents and growth of their fostered offspring. Chicks raised by high-quality parents were heavier and in better body condition shortly after hatching, when mortality is high, and were provisioned at a frequency that minimized mass fluctuations during growth. Significant year effects and year(*)egg size/parental quality interactions suggest that contributions of egg size and parental quality to offspring fitness are contingent on interannual environmental variability. We discussed maintenance of egg size polymorphism in this population, where egg size repeatability was found to be high.

AB Group size in cooperatively polyandrous birds appears to be limited by the diminishing probability that any one male will achieve paternity as group size increases. Here we use molecular techniques to analyse the mating system of Eclectus parrots, a species with a surprisingly large number of males ( up to seven) in each group. We show that their social groups are not composed of kin, and that all males seek direct fitness. Most broods of two nestlings had just one father. However, further group males gained paternity in other nesting attempts within and between breeding seasons. Although the likelihood of multiple paternity increased with the number of males in the group, only a subset of group males gained paternity over the eight-year study period. Some males gained paternity at irregular intervals with the same female over multiple years, and many also mated polygynandrously at widely dispersed nests. Our data also confirm that females monopolise scarce breeding hollows over multiple years. We suggest that Eclectus parrots occur in larger group sizes than other cooperatively polyandrous species as a result of a severely biased operational sex ratio brought about by a scarcity of breeding females and a male-biased adult sex ratio.

AB In most species the operational sex ratio is male biased, so females can be choosy when selecting a mate. Male choosiness, however, may also be beneficial, especially in species where female quality is variable, male mating investment is high and there is a high probability of attracting additional females. We investigated male choosiness in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. Clutch size was positively correlated with female size. Since male mating investment is high ( prolonged mate guarding), males would therefore benefit by mating with large females. Males were capable of discriminating between large and small females, and under both natural and experimental conditions they preferentially courted larger females. They did not, however, forego mating opportunities with small females, probably because the operational sex ratio was highly male biased, which limited their opportunity for attracting a second mate. Thus male U. mjoebergi not only engaged in competition for matings, but also showed mate choice.

   BEHAVIOR; FORAGING-EFFICIENCY; DELAYED DISPERSAL; HUNTING BEHAVIOR
AB Individuals have to trade- off energy intake against the risk of predation when foraging. However, in group-living species, social interference will limit the range of choices for subordinate individuals. The trade- off between foraging and predation risk may be even more complex in species that associate in family groups because relatives can provide benefits to each other that are withheld from nonrelatives. As a consequence, nonrelatives may be forced to take greater risks to gain similar amounts of energy as relatives. Here, I investigate how the energy-risk trade- off varies among individuals in a social, group- living species, the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus. Groups in this species consist of a breeding pair, together with retained offspring and/ or nonrelated immigrants. I manipulated food quality at feeding sites that differed in their visibility to predators and observed the differences in foraging patterns between different group members. Adults and their offspring fed more often at the protected feeding site when it contained high- quality food, but switched to the more exposed site when this site offered higher quality food than the protected site. In contrast, immigrants spent a similar amount of time at each feeding site, independent of food quality. Birds generally spent more time waiting for access to the high- quality food source and protected feeding site, and family members generally harassed immigrants that tried to access these sites. None the less, all birds had a similar overall food intake, suggesting that immigrants pay substantially higher costs than other members to attain the equivalent level of energy intake.

AB Social play involves a dynamic combination of competition and cooperation, yet few studies have systematically evaluated the cooperative side of play. We studied dyadic play in domestic dogs to investigate factors influencing variation in cooperative play strategies like self-handicapping and role reversal. Dyadic play bouts were videotaped and coded for asymmetric behaviours. We predicted that variation in play style would reflect salient aspects of the canine social system, including dominance relationships and age and size differences, but not sex differences. Our results refute the 50:50 rule proposed by some researchers, which asserts that participants must equalize their behaviour to maintain a playful atmosphere. We observed divergence from 50:50 symmetry to varying degrees across dyads. This variability was especially linked to dominance and age advantages, such that higher-ranking and/or older dogs generally showed higher proportions of attacks and pursuits and lower proportions of self-handicapping than their disadvantaged play partners. These results contradict the notion that more advantaged individuals consistently relinquish their advantage to facilitate play. Role reversals did occur, but certain social conventions apparently dictated which behaviours could be used during role reversals. For example, role reversals occurred during chases and tackles, but never during mounts, muzzle bites or muzzle licks, suggesting that these latter behaviours may be invariant indicators of formal dominance during play in domestic dogs. Play signalling was linked to self-handicapping behaviour but not to attack/pursuit behaviour, indicating that perhaps self-handicapping and play signalling work together to communicate playful intent and reinforce existing roles.

AB We investigated the effects of colony condition on the use of modulatory communication in social insects by examining vibration signal behaviour in established and newly founded colonies of the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Compared to the established colonies, the newly founded colonies had smaller population sizes, built more comb, devoted proportionately more comb space to brood rearing and less to food storage, gained weight, and had higher per capita rates of foraging. In conjunction with the different growth and foraging patterns, the newly founded colonies also had higher per capita vibration rates and slightly but significantly greater proportions of workers that produced the signal. Individual vibrators in the newly founded colonies performed signals on slightly but significantly more of the workers they contacted and focused their vibration activity more strongly on less active recipients than did vibrators in the established colonies. Vibrated recipients showed increased task performance compared to nonvibrated controls, suggesting that the signal increased individual labour rates in both colony types. However, the levels of task performance did not differ between newly founded and established colony recipients, suggesting that the degree to which workers responded to the signal was not altered by colony developmental state. Thus, the vibration signal may have helped to adjust worker activity to the resource and labour demands associated with nest founding primarily by activating larger proportions of the less active work force, rather than by increasing the individual work efforts of recipients in the newly founded colonies relative to those in established colonies.

ID OSPREYS PANDION-HALIAETUS; ROUTES; ORIENTATION; RADAR; BIRDS; SPEED
AB We tested whether routes of raptors migrating over areas with homogeneous topography follow constant geomagnetic courses more or less closely than constant geographical courses. We analysed the routes taken over land of 45 individual raptors tracked by satellite-based radiotelemetry: 25 peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, on autumn migration between North and South America, and seven honey buzzards, Pernis apivorus, and 13 ospreys, Pandion haliaetus, on autumn migration between Europe and Africa. Overall, migration directions showed a better agreement with constant geographical than constant geomagnetic courses. Tracks deviated significantly from constant geomagnetic courses, but were not significantly different from geographical courses. After we removed movements directed far from the mean direction, which may not be migratory movements, migration directions still showed a better agreement with constant geographical than constant geomagnetic courses, but the directions of honey buzzards and ospreys were not significantly different from constant geomagnetic courses either. That migration routes of raptors followed by satellite telemetry are in closer accordance with constant geographical compass courses than with constant geomagnetic compass courses may indicate that geographical (e.g. based on celestial cues) rather than magnetic compass mechanisms are of dominating importance for the birds' long-distance orientation.

AB Several studies on parental investment in territorial songbirds have reported the existence of brood division. This is a type of postfledging care in which each parent has long-term feeding preferences for different young within a brood, creating two family units. Recent theoretical work indicates that conflicts between individuals should select for brood division. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the onset and maintenance of this behavioural strategy. Given the high rate of fledglings' begging calls, we hypothesized that acoustic discrimination could explain the stability of feeding preferences at a proximate level. In a 3-year field study, we recorded the responses of parent black redstarts, Phoenicurus ochruros, a territorial songbird, to playback of the begging calls of fledglings fed by the male and by the female. Parents responded more to the calls of the fledglings that they preferentially fed. A principal component analysis of the calls suggested that parents may recognize individual offspring. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that a bird can acoustically discriminate between two categories of its own offspring: those that it preferentially feeds and those fed by the other parent.

AB Colonization of novel environments may often lead to changes in socially and sexually selected traits, but there are few documented examples. We examined territorial responses of male dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis thurberi, to song playback in association with colonization of an environment very different from that experienced by the ancestral population. A small population of dark-eyed juncos became established on the campus of the University of California at San Diego in the early 1980s. This population experiences a milder climate than the nearby mountain population from which it was probably derived. The San Diego juncos have a breeding season that is more than twice as long and rear about twice as many young per individual. When confronted with song playback, male responses in such traits as the total number of songs and total number of swoops in the San Diego population were about half those recorded in the mountain population. Previous work has shown that the amount of white in the tail of this species (a trait used in aggressive displays) has also decreased in the San Diego population, and lowered territorial response may be one reason favouring the evolution of less white.

AB We studied movement patterns and the use of navigational beacons in the jumping spider Phidippus clarus (Salticidae). Phidippus clarus does not build prey-capture webs, but does construct thick silken nests used as nighttime retreats. We measured the degree of nest site fidelity with individually marked spiders and a grid of artificial nest tubes. Females in August were most site-faithful, followed by July females and then by males. Spiders moved long distances through complexly structured habitats, suggesting that nests are likely to be out of sight of the spiders during the day, and that spiders must use cues other than their nest to navigate. We then tested whether females used beacons to find their nests. In one experiment, spiders colonized nest tube'S that were either associated with beacons (orange wooden dowels) or not. They were then released near a test beacon. Spiders experienced with beacons readily approached either their own beacon or a similar, novel beacon in a different location. In contrast, spiders with no experience with beacons were significantly less likely to approach the test beacon. In a second test, spiders tested with novel beacons of the same colour as their own were significantly more likely to approach it than were spiders tested with novel beacons of a different colour. We conclude that P. clarus are likely to need navigational skills and are able to use beacons as a method of navigation. Jumping spiders provide a new and tractable model system for the study of navigation and space use. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hypotheses for the function of animal vocal duets fall into three broad categories. Male and female breeding partners may use duets to communicate with each other, to communicate with same-sex outsiders, or to communicate with opposite-sex outsiders. To evaluate these categories of duet function, I gave stereo duet playback to territorial pairs of duetting rufous-and-white wrens, Thtyothorus rufalbus, in northwestern Costa Rica. I simulated duets of a rival pair of wrens by simultaneously broadcasting male and female duet components through separate loudspeakers. Territorial males and females responded aggressively to duet playback by rapidly approaching the speakers and singing both solo songs and duets. Males sang more songs in response to playback than females, but both sexes responded to approximately half of their partner's songs to create duets. The aggressive responses of territorial pairs were consistent with a territorial defence hypothesis for duet function. Males spent more time near the male speaker and approached the male speaker more closely, suggesting that male duet contributions play a role in intrasexually aggressive extrapair communication. Females approached the male and female speakers with similar intensity, although they tended to respond more strongly to the male speaker. In the few cases where females responded independently of their partner, they responded more strongly on the side of the female speaker. Taken together, responses of rufous-and-white wrens to stereo duet playback suggest that duets play a role in territory defence against conspecific rivals, and, for males, duets may play an additional role in mate guarding and paternity guarding.

AB We investigated the use of nestmate recognition cues in a stingless bee, Trigona fulviventris. We first established that T. fulviventris can discriminate nestmates from non-nestmates, then bioassayed putative nestmate recognition cue compounds including fatty acids, alkanes, an alkene, wax esters and floral oils. At least one compound of every type affected nestmate recognition, but sham treatment of controls had no effect on nestmate recognition. Mean latency (time from first contact between bees to expression of aggression) was significantly negatively correlated with the probability that aggression would occur. These results suggest that T fulviventris workers use a set of cues similar to that used by the honeybee, Apis mellifera; 16-C and 18-C fatty acids appear to be important in nestmate recognition in both A. mellifera and T. fulviventris. In contrast to A. mellifera, however, T fulviventris workers also used other compound types, including alkanes and floral oils, for nestmate recognition. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the evolution of nestmate recognition in bees. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The asymmetry in mating strategies between males and females may influence the evolution of mate-signalling systems. Exploitation of pre-existing female preferences for certain visual or acoustic stimuli by male courtship signals has been reported from a variety of species. However, information on chemical communication systems is comparatively scarce. The sensory trap model of sexual signalling suggests that female preferences originated from and are maintained by selection pressures in a nonsexual context, e.g. prey recognition. We tested a key prediction from the sensory trap hypothesis for the evolution of the male sex pheromone in a solitary wasp, the European beewolf, Philanthus triangulum. Females hunt exclusively honeybees, Apis mellifera, as provisions for their larvae. Males mark territories with a pheromone to attract females. The co-occurrence of a long-chain alcohol, (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol, in the male pheromone and on the cuticle of honeybees suggests that males might exploit a female preference for (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol. We used behavioural assays with honeybees and honeybee dummies to investigate whether females use (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol for prey recognition. Females used olfactory cues to find and identify honeybees and (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol was an essential component of the prey recognition cue. Thus, female European beewolves have a high sensitivity for (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol that probably evolved in the context of prey hunting. Therefore, males that included this compound in their sex pheromone probably attracted more females and experienced a selective advantage according to the sensory trap model.

AB Cooperation is fundamental to human societies and widespread among animals, yet explaining how cooperative relationships persist without one party exploiting another remains a challenge. Although it is well established that altruism can be favoured when recipients are relatives or when they reciprocate, it is increasingly being recognized that many behaviours cannot be explained in these terms. Here, I argue that many cases of apparent altruism can be explained by interdependence. I formalize the degree of interdependence by defining an individual's 'stake' in another as the dependence of its fitness on that of the other. This provides a means of valuing others, analogous to Hamilton's valuation of relatives. It also provides a conceptual synthesis of theories of altruism, in which kinship and reciprocity become special cases. Interdependence means that cooperators can benefit as a secondary consequence of helping their recipients. Altruism can then be favoured when its costs are outweighed by the altruist's stake in the recipient's benefits. Whereas the exploitation problem makes reciprocal altruism inherently unstable, cooperation through interdependence can be stable because whatever others do, it is best to cooperate. I discuss the extent to which interdependence can explain examples of cooperation that cannot be explained in terms of kinship and reciprocity.

AB Fish orient by using a memorized map of their surroundings and, as they live in aquatic environments, this map must be three dimensional. Studies have shown that fish are able to encode horizontal information; however, we have little information about the cues that are learnt and remembered in the vertical axis. We used the blind Mexican cave fish, Astyanax fasciatus, to test whether fish can orient in the vertical axis and whether they use hydrostatic pressure to do so. After learning the cues associated with a specific height in the aquarium (evident by a reduction in swimming speed), the fish showed significant dishabituation (their swimming speed increased) when moved vertically upwards. When we controlled for the increase in light intensity from the bottom to the top of the tank the effect persisted, indicating that the most likely cue used by the fish to orient vertically was hydrostatic pressure. A post hoc experiment revealed that the change in swimming speed in response to altered light levels probably represents a change in the level of activity rather than an orientational response. This may define a photokinetic mechanism which operates in conjunction with a negatively phototactic response (revealed in previous experiments) by which the fish orient away from higher light levels and swim faster as light levels increase. This would result in the fish spending more time in lower light levels and would prevent the fish exiting the cave.

AB While decorations of many spiders are made entirely of silk, those built by many Cyclosa species are composed of prey carcasses. The functions of prey carcass decorations are unknown. By manipulating their presence on webs of Cyclosa confusa, we tested whether they attract prey. Insect interception rates of webs with the decoration removed were significantly higher than those of webs with the decoration present. By monitoring predators' responses to spiders with and without decorations on their webs, we also tested whether prey carcass decorations decreased spiders' mortality. Spiders on undecorated webs experienced fewer attacks from paper wasps, Vespa affinis, but these attacks were all directed against the spiders. Although spiders with decorated webs experienced more attacks, wasps usually attacked the decorations rather than the spiders. Finally, we examined how visual signals of prey carcass decorations were perceived by predators. The chromatic colour contrast of the decoration against C. confusa was such that hymenopteran predators could not distinguish the chromatic signals of decorations from those of spiders. We conclude that prey carcass decorations do not attract insects, but may redirect the attack of V affinis, and thus enhance the survival of spiders.

AB Resource defence theory predicts that the intensity of competitive aggression, degree of resource monopolization, and variation in fitness will be highest at intermediate levels of the spatial clumping of resources. We tested for this predicted dome-shaped relationship by manipulating the spatial clumping of food via competitor-to-resource ratio (CRR), the number of potential competitors divided by the number of resource units. Groups of 10 convict cichlids, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, were allowed to compete for a fixed amount of food in one of five CRR treatments (1, 1.43, 2, 5 and 10), created by varying the number of patches in which the food appeared (i.e. 10, 7, 5, 2 and 1 patch, respectively). As predicted, both the frequency of aggression and the coefficient of variation of body mass (a measure of the consequences of food monopolization and variation in a component of fitness within groups) increased significantly as CRR increased from I to 2, and then decreased significantly at CRRs of 5 and 10. In addition, mean growth rate decreased in groups with high rates of aggression, suggesting an important cost of aggression. Our study provides the first quantitative support for the predicted dome-shaped relationship and suggests that CRR is a useful measure of the degree of spatial clumping of resources.

AB Male green anoles convey territorial ownership to rivals through use of stereotyped aggressive displays, with intrasexual interactions often escalating to physical combat. In the laboratory, losers of such interactions significantly reduce their aggressive behaviour when interacting with the same opponent 7 days later. In the current study, we examined whether this behavioural modification is a function of opponent recognition. Pairs of size-matched male A. carolinensis were allowed to interact for 2 h. Following this, subjects were separated for varying intervals, and then participated in a second interaction with either the same or an unfamiliar opponent. Losers of the first interaction significantly reduced their total aggressive behaviour when re-paired with the same opponent after a 3-day interval but not after a 10-day interval between the first and second interaction. However, losers of the first interaction failed to show reduced aggression during their second interaction when paired 3 or 10 days later with an unfamiliar opponent. Therefore, A. carolinensis appear to learn information specific to their opponent during an initial agonistic interaction, with the salience of this information declining when the interval between interactions increases. Males also showed low levels of chemosensory taste behaviour during agonistic interactions, suggesting that opponent recognition does not rely on chemoreception. Similarities between our results and findings from other vertebrate species suggest that the motivation to behave aggressively during social interactions can be influenced by opponent recognition rather than by previous experience of social defeat alone.

AB Studies of a variety of taxa have almost universally shown an increase in survivorship between the first cohort of young reared by a female (or both parents) and subsequent litters. Here, we examine the effect of early experience with sibling pups during the subadult period on later maternal behaviour and reproductive success in oldfield mice. 'Experienced' females remained with their mothers through the rearing of a litter of siblings. 'Inexperienced' females were removed from their parents at 20 days of age and had no prior exposure to pups before they reproduced. Twenty-four experienced females and 24 inexperienced females (each a full sibling of an experienced female) were paired with noninbred, inexperienced males through the birth and rearing of three litters. Litter survival improved significantly with experience and increasing parity. Pairs with experienced females showed improved nest-building behaviour and averaged significantly more surviving pups than did pairs with inexperienced females. Inexperienced mates of experienced females showed improved nest building, as well, consistent with the results of previous studies showing that paternal care tends to match that of mates. Maternal body weight did not appear to influence reproductive performance. These findings support the contention that individuals may accrue significant fitness benefits by delaying their own reproduction and gaining experience.

AB Physical attributes of a nest site can be important in determining the outcome of a breeding event. However, high-quality individuals may be more able to obtain particular sites, and thus habitat quality and individual quality are often confounded in correlative studies. We examined the potential sheltering effect of nest vegetation on the nest microclimate and on the behaviour and breeding performance of herring gulls, Larus argentatus. In addition to comparing birds at unmanipulated vegetated and unvegetated sites, we experimentally manipulated vegetation around nests to tease apart breeder quality and habitat effects. Birds nesting at unmanipulated vegetated sites had earlier laying dates, heavier eggs and more fledglings than those at comparable unvegetated sites. Vegetation provided shelter from weather conditions for the incubating birds and chicks; vegetated nest sites had on average milder air temperatures and lower wind speeds than unvegetated control nest sites. During incubation, breeders at naturally vegetated nests assumed alert postures less, and spent more time sleeping, than those at naturally unvegetated sites, indicating less disturbance from neighbours. In nests where vegetation was experimentally removed, both nest microclimate and breeder behaviour became similar to those at the naturally unvegetated nests; however, despite these changes, the absence of vegetation did not alter the higher breeding performance of birds at these sites. Therefore, nest microclimate alone is not responsible for the improved performance at vegetated sites; such sites appear to be occupied by better-quality individuals.

AB Some current interpretations of male-female sexual interactions have implied that males can control female mating decisions. Here we analysed the main characteristics of female sexual receptivity of the mountain scorpion Zabius fuscus based on the premating behavioural patterns of virgin and inseminated females from natural or artificially interrupted matings. Males were used repeatedly in successive tests to evaluate females' levels of sexual receptivity (positive = accept, intermediate, negative = reject) and behavioural flexibility. Duration and frequency values of male behaviour patterns were correlated with the female's response. During the sexual recognition phase, the male performed vibratory movements of the body, termed vibration, which did not vary between the three groups of females (positive, intermediate and negative). In contrast, frequencies of occurrence of the principal male stimulatory behaviours, cheliceral massage and rubbing with legs, differed significantly between the three groups of females, reflecting a clear flexibility of male sexual behaviour according to the initial female response. Scorpion males appeared to use luring rather than coercive behaviours when facing resisting females. The observed patterns do not support the position that males override female means of mating control. Furthermore, morphologically based data indicate that postmating sexual receptivity, in females is not affected by other male characteristics such as body or spermatophore size.

DT Article
ID WATERBUCK KOBUS-ELLIPSIPRYMNUS; SATELLITE MALES; PATTERNS; CHIMPANZEES
AB Ecological explanations of sex-specific patterns of bond formation have focused primarily on resource defence and predation. Resource defence models of alliance formation had not, until recently, explicitly considered encounter rates between competing individuals. Here we present a general model for alliance formation in fission-fusion societies based upon the rates at which individuals encounter each other in competition for resources. Our model applies to both territorial and nonterritorial species. Given the prevalence of stronger bonds among female mammals, the occurrence of prominent male-male alliances in phylogenetically distant species with a fission-fusion grouping pattern is striking (e.g. chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes; bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops spp.). In our model, a sex difference in alliance formation emerges, even when encounter rates are the same for each sex, if there is a sex difference in the duration of resource defence. Thus, if the primary resources for which males compete (oestrous females) are defended for longer periods than the primary resources for which females compete (food), male alliance formation is expected to occur at lower encounter rates than female alliances. 2004 The Associatiori for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Individual animals from the same population, sex, age and reproductive status often respond differently and consistently to predators. One important dimension of this behavioural variation is the shy-bold continuum. Innate differences in boldness might explain why individuals differ in their antipredator behaviour. In a laboratory experiment, we examined the sources of individual variation in antipredator behaviour of adult male lizards Lacerta monticola. We simulated in the laboratory repeated predatory attacks of low or high risk and analysed activity levels and refuge use in both situations. Multivariate analyses suggested the existence of two consistent and independent shy-bold continua. The first described a gradient from bold lizards that spent shorter times in the refuge after predatory approaches to shy lizards with longer emergence times, whereas the other described a gradient from bold lizards with a low propensity to hide when the predator was close but risk was low to shy lizards that hid more often. We analysed whether morphological characteristics, body condition and health (estimated from their T cell immunocompetence) of individuals might account for the differences observed. Bold individuals had smaller absolute body size, but relatively larger heads, better body condition and better health. Bold individuals with a low propensity to hide when risk was low had larger absolute body sizes, whereas relative head size, and body condition and health were not important. We suggest that the position of an individual in the shy-bold continua might reflect its optimal antipredator behaviour, which would be a function of its health, general quality and ability to evade predators.

AB Social environment can have dramatic effects on the expression of species-typical sexual behaviour. Using guppies, Poecilia reticulata, we asked how an all-male social environment affects male sexual behaviour. Males were assigned to either single-sex or mixed-sex groups. After 15 weeks, their sexual behaviour was assayed in the presence of three novel individuals of each sex. Males from single-sex groups performed higher rates of sexual displays and sneak copulation attempts towards stimulus males than did males from mixed-sex groups. Males from mixed-sex groups directed the majority of their sexual behaviour towards females using typical heterosexual behaviour. The social environment for each subject was then reversed for 2 weeks, after which subjects in both treatments showed a stronger tendency to display or sneak towards males. These findings reveal that homosexual behaviour is not readily extinguished when females become accessible and that it can be induced even after the ontogeny of heterosexual behaviour. While guppies may rarely occur in all-male groups in nature, these findings highlight the capacity for social environment to shape mating behaviour, which is particularly relevant for captive populations used in behavioural studies or conservation breeding programmes.

AB We analysed video records of three mating events involving nine free-living whitetip reef sharks in Cocos Islands, Costa Rica to examine reproductive behaviour in this species. We describe several behaviours never before documented in this species, and four behaviours never before documented in any elasmobranch. Here, we also present the first hypothesis for the function of the male's paired reproductive organs, the siphon sacs, to be based on observations of mating sharks. We introduce terminology for three separate siphon sac structural components that are externally visible during courtship and mating in this species. Based on our analyses, as well as evidence from past mating studies, the siphon sacs in whitetip reef sharks appear to be used to propel sperm into the female's reproductive tract, not for flushing the female's reproductive tract of sperm from previous males. We discuss the implications of 'group courtship', 'siphon isthmus constriction', 'reverse thrusting', 'postrelease gaping' and 'noncopulatory ejaculation'.

   AGGRESSION; BEHAVIOR; PREFERENCE; AUDIENCE
AB Species that form breeding aggregations, such as the three-spined stickleback, have ample opportunity to observe and interact with others in their respective populations. This exposes courting pairs to distraction or disruption from onlooking individuals. Thus, courting inconspicuously could be beneficial to males. We tested whether males would court inconspicuously by housing them in individual tanks with visual access to a neighbouring male. A dummy of a gravid female three-spined stickleback was presented to a male in the front quadrant of the tank while screens concealed either the front quarter or front half of the tank from the neighbour. When a portion of the tank was concealed from a neighbouring rival, males courted more in the concealed areas than those that were exposed to a rival. Hence, in the presence of rivals, males can adjust their courtship behaviour in ways that could increase their mating success. Whether this reflects an active strategy' or a passive result of the male being less distracted by its neighbour is presently unknown. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID NONGEOMETRIC INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR; LANDMARKS; CONFIGURATION; PIGEONS
AB Although much is now known about the mechanisms that insects, birds and mammals use to orient within familiar areas, our knowledge of such mechanisms in fish is scant. I used the transformational approach to test whether the blind Mexican cave fish can encode shape and size in an internal representation of space. These fish are excellent study animals, as they swim at high velocities (presumably to enhance lateral line organ stimulation) when faced with unfamiliar landmarks or environments. As they are blind, potentially confounding cues from visual global landmarks are unavailable. The fish learnt a square configuration of four landmarks and so must have been be able to encode spatial relationships between the elements within this configuration. After learning landmark arrays, the cave fish showed significant dishabituation (swimming velocity was increased) when exposed to landmark transformations. The fish must therefore have been comparing the environment that they perceived with an internal representation of the environment that they had learnt. The results show that blind Mexican cave fish can encode size (absolute distance between landmarks) and possibly also shape within their spatial maps.

AB Males of many insect species, including beetles, choose their mates according to their reproductive status. However, the ways in which male beetles evaluate female reproductive status have received little attention. We tested the existence of male mate choice in the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, by observing mating and courtship behaviour of males given simultaneous access to pairs of females differing in their reproductive status: (1) mature versus immature; (2) virgin versus previously mated; (3) familiar (mated with the experimental male) versus unfamiliar (mated with a different male). Males courted and mated preferentially With mature and virgin females. To determine whether chemical cues played a role in these discriminations, we exposed males to filter paper squares bearing chemical cues from different types of females: (1) virgin versus mated; (2) mature versus immature. Males were significantly more attracted to those squares bearing chemical cues from virgin and mature females, suggesting that males can assess female reproductive statue on the basis of chemical cues alone.

AB We used vocalizations to examine the behaviour of male bearded seals, Erignathus barbatus, in relation to ice cover over 2 consecutive years. Site fidelity varied between males. Territorial males returned to the same display locations in successive years, whereas roaming males returned to the study area but not to specific display locations. Males did not vocalize under the land-fast-ice edge and were therefore limited by access to areas of drift ice and open water for the purpose of displaying. Between-year fluctuations in ice cover restricted the number of displaying males during the early part of the mating season in April. Decreased ice cover during May resulted in more males displaying, but the number of males declined in June irrespective of the continued decline in ice cover. Roaming males were not heard when the ice cover was more than 60%, whereas territorial males were present during all ice conditions. Yearly fluctuations in ice cover may alter the long-term mating success of individuals and predictably available display areas may be preferred to areas that are more likely to be enclosed by fast-ice in some years.

AB Research on learned species discrimination has focused on the consequences of early experience. However, in species where parental care is limited or absent, including most fish, juveniles have fewer opportunities to learn from adult conspecifics. We examined male mate recognition in Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulata, and in their sister species, the swamp guppy, P. picta. Choice tests revealed that males from localities where their species is the only poeciliid present initially mated. with conspecific and heterospecific females at random. In contrast, P. reticulata and P. picta found in sympatry preferred their own females. We then investigated the acquisition of mating discrimination by wild P. reticulata males from two allopatric populations. Males that were allowed to interact with females of both species learned within 4 days to distinguish conspecific partners, and within a week their species discrimination matched that of sympatric populations. This study confirms that learning is important in the acquisition of adult mating preferences and shows why learned mate preferences can be important in the last stages of speciation.

AB In the early stages of their life, solitary spiders undergo a transient gregarious phase. We designed a series of experiments in which collective displacements were induced in groups of spiderlings of the solitary species Larinioides cornutus (Araneae: Araneidae). Spiderlings were given access to a bifurcated escape route (Y-choice set-up) from a container. Consecutive passages in the set-up led to an asymmetrical distribution of individuals between branches. Individual behaviours of spiderlings were quantified and then implemented into a model with which we simulated collective displacements. Comparison between the outcome of the model and the experimental data shows that the discrete pattern of silk dragline attachment is the key mechanism involved in this collective phenomenon. Our results show that the collective responses in spiderlings of a solitary species and in social spiders are similar, and that a simple mechanism independent of the presence of silk attraction can lead to aggregation.

AB The proximal mechanisms determining social dominance are not well understood. We used the highly territorial lizard A. cristatellus to test two main hypotheses: (1) that male social dominance is associated with locomotor abilities; (2) that locomotor abilities (maximal performance), as measured in the laboratory, are correlated with behaviour in the field. In the field, we recorded locomotor behaviours and assertion displays, then characterized microhabitat use and thermal relations. In the laboratory, we measured maximum sprint running speed, endurance and morphometric characters, and assessed dominance by pairing males of similar body size in an experimental arena. In 72 of 77 interactions, one lizard (the 'winner') was unequivocally determined to be dominant over the other (the 'loser'). Winners performed more assertion displays than losers before capture and also had higher endurance in laboratory tests. Although contestants were matched for snout-vent length, winners had significantly deeper and wider heads. However, we found no significant differences in field locomotor behaviours, perch or thermal characteristics, head length, or maximal sprint speed. Our findings support those of previous studies, and extend them in several ways. This is the first demonstration that assertion displays in the field are related to both locomotor performance and laboratory-assessed social dominance. Locomotor performance may directly affect social dominance by allowing some males to perform better in dyadic interactions. Alternatively, both locomotor performance and social dominance may be linked to a common underlying mechanism, such as variation in hormone levels, which are known to affect aggression, locomotor performance and morphology.

AB We investigated the dynamics of odour learning involved in host location by a parasitoid insect, Leptopilina boulardi (Hymenoptera: Figitidae). Females of this species find their Drosophila host larvae by probing fruits with their ovipositor. They can be conditioned to respond to an odour when the odour exposure is associated with oviposition. We investigated the effect of the number of conditioning trials, sensitization tests and extinction tests on the retention of the conditioned response. Results showed that: (1) a single odour-oviposition association produced a strong short-term memory (1-2 h), which rapidly decayed over 24 h; (2) multiple odour-oviposition associations produced a memory trace that was strong in both the short term and the longer term (24 h); (3) sensitization to the odour through mere oviposition experience (without odour) was low after a single trial and high after multiple trials, but was only observed for a short period; (4) all memory traces were erased by three successive extinction tests, regardless of the intertest interval. We conclude that the probing behaviour of a Drosophila parasitoid is characterized by great plasticity shaped in the short term by sensitization, and in the longer term by associative learning. We compare olfactory plasticity in this parasitoid foraging for hosts and that of the honeybee foraging for food, suggesting common underlying processes in the central nervous system. Finally our results may relate to the dynamics of the foraging activity of L. boulardi. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated how individual variation in social behaviour among group members interacts to affect social structure and development of reproductive skills. We randomly assigned juvenile male and juvenile and adult female cowbirds to four aviaries and observed patterns of singing and social assortment in each. Although social composition of each aviary was the same, juvenile males in one aviary engaged in more intra- and intersexual affiliation and singing interactions. We designed a series of rotations of individuals among the aviaries to determine which individual traits were responsible for the observed group differences. First, we rotated groups of three males from a less interactive aviary into a more interactive aviary, replacing interactive males. Within 4 days, the rotated males changed their behaviour to match the aviary into which they had been moved (i.e. interactive males became less interactive and vice versa). Next, we rotated juvenile females through the aviaries. After this rotation, the behaviour of the juvenile females remained the same, but the behaviour of the resident males changed, becoming like the males in the females' former aviaries (i.e. when juvenile females were moved from an interactive aviary into a noninteractive aviary, the males in the new aviary became more interactive and vice versa). Across the aviaries, the amount of female-male associations correlated positively with male-male competition. During the breeding season, males that had experienced more competition over the year received more copulations than males that had experienced little competition. Furthermore, more eggs were produced in aviaries containing competitive males than in aviaries containing less competitive males. Past work has shown that females can influence male vocal development; here we show that they can also influence male social development. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB By making field observations on the movement pattern of the agrobiont wolf spider Pardosa agrestis at two spatiotemporal scales, we explored how fine-scale foraging movements scale up to medium-scale habitat use by the spiders. For fine-scale observations, we followed individuals for several metres and for up to 1-2 h. For medium-scale observations we used marking and recapture in live-trapping pitfall grids, which allowed us to detect movements up to 70 m and for 4 weeks. The analysis of fine-scale movement indicated that spiders followed a 'sit-and-move' foraging strategy, which consisted of variable periods of waiting (mean 2.5 min) and brief bouts of movements between the waiting sites. Spiders spent over 90% of the total observation time waiting. Prey capture (or capture attempts) was initiated only from waiting sites. Movement between consecutive waiting sites was more directional than predicted by the correlated random walk model. At medium (2-day) timescales the mean displacement of marked spiders was 7.4 m. Simulations suggested that such a displacement could be achieved if movement observed at the fine scale followed a random path for 2 days. We concluded that movement became less directional with increasing scale. Such a phenomenon might be related to avoidance of revisiting food patches locally and an efficient sampling of the habitat at higher scales. High movement activity in a species that is primarily adapted to ephemeral habitats might increase its likelihood of colonizing new habitat patches.

AB Most social foragers must search for food while avoiding predators. Group-foraging nutmeg mannikins engaged in a producer-scrounger game search for their own food (play producer) by hopping with the head down and search for others' food discoveries (play scrounger) by hopping with the head up. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence to more joining by foragers. We tested this prediction as well as the extent to which stationary birds use head up exclusively for antipredatory purposes and hopping birds use head up for foraging purposes only. We observed three flocks of nutmeg mannikins searching for hidden clumps of food in an indoor aviary. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design in which both the distance to a safe refuge and the food distribution were manipulated. The use of head up by stationary and eating birds increased significantly with increased distance to cover. Distance to cover, however, had no effect on the use of the scrounger tactic or on the level of joining. We found no evidence of compatibility between the scrounger tactic and antipredatory vigilance. Our results provide the first unambiguous evidence for the existence of two distinct and incompatible patterns of vigilance for predators and for conspecifics.

AB Repetitive, unvarying and apparently functionless behaviours called stereotypies are common in caged animals, but the mechanisms of cage stereotypy have remained elusive. We found that stereotypies correlate with a sign of altered brain functioning, the general disinhibition of behaviour, found in stereotyping human patients and animals treated with psychostimulants. We investigated route-tracing stereotypy in blue tits, Parus caeruleus, and marsh tits, P. palustris, caged in a behavioural research laboratory. In experiment 1, stereotypy correlated with disinhibition of responses, shown as persistent responding in extinction learning. In experiment 2a, stereotypy in blue tits correlated with repetitive sequence generation on a 'gambling task' that specifically measures disinhibited striatal functioning in humans and correlates with stereotypy in autistic and schizophrenic patients. In experiment 2b, the behavioural disinhibition correlated with stereotypy also affected food-storing behaviour in marsh tits, in particular their response to cache pilfering. In experiment 3, the sequencing of nonstereotypic home cage behaviour was correlated with stereotypy. Finally, changes in stereotypy induced by environmental enrichment correlated with changes in these measures of altered behavioural control. These results suggest that housing conditions that cause stereotypy thus alter many aspects of the behavioural control of caged subjects, mediated by altered striatal functioning. The implications for understanding cage stereotypies in laboratory, farm and zoo animals, and for laboratory-based behavioural experiments, are discussed. We suggest that improving housing conditions so that cage stereotypies do not develop would enhance the validity of laboratory-based behavioural research.

AB A female Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, will increase her tendency to affiliate and mate with a conspecific male after seeing him court and mate with another female. In the present study, we found that female quail increased the time they spent near a live target male after seeing that same male court and mate with another female in a 5-min video displayed on an active-matrix TFT monitor. However, female quail that were shown 5-min video sequences of either a target male standing alone or a randomly selected mate courting and mating did not subsequently increase the time they spent near a live target male. These findings provide the first demonstration of which we are aware of birds transferring individual identification from a video sequence to a real animal.

AB The sensory bias model of sexual selection suggests that elaborate male secondary sexual traits evolved to exploit biases in the female's sensory system. Such biases may have evolved in a nonsexual context. Male bowerbirds build and decorate elaborate structures, bowers, which function as targets of female choice. The colour of decorations used on bowers appears to be important in determining a male's mating success. We tested two predictions made by the sensory bias model, using cache presentation experiments of artificially coloured grapes made to captive bowerbirds of five species. We first searched for evidence of ancestral biases for certain colours that could explain current colour preferences across species. We found no single parsimonious explanation for ancestral patterns of colour preference across the family. We next tested whether female preference patterns could be explained in a nonsexual, foraging, context. For both of the species where sufficient data could be collected, female foraging preferences for grapes were significantly related to male preferences for grapes used as bower decorations. Our results suggest that choice of bower decoration colour may have evolved to exploit a bias in the female's sensory system, originally shaped by selection on foraging practices.

AB Behavioural correlations are at the heart of understanding how conflicting demands shape the evolution of ecologically important behaviours. Many studies have focused on the effects of negative behavioural correlations generated by time budget conflicts within situations. We examined an alternative possibility that involves positive behavioural correlations due to behavioural carryovers across situations. Specifically, we examined the role of behavioural carryovers in governing antipredator responses of streamside salamander larvae, Ambystoma barbouri, to predatory green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus. Earlier work showed that these larvae suffer heavy sunfish predation due to high larval exposure to fish (high proportion of time spent out of refuge). Earlier work also showed that paradoxically, despite selection pressure from fish, these larvae show higher exposure in the presence of fish (poorer antipredator behaviour) than a sister species that inhabits fishless, ephemeral ponds. The standard time budget trade-off between feeding and antipredator behaviour does not appear to explain the observed antipredator behaviours. Instead, the present study shows that the relatively large proportion of time that larvae spend out of refuge (exposed) in fish pools in the daytime can be explained in part by behavioural correlations across situations. Specifically, larvae showed positive correlations among individuals in their daytime exposure in fish pools, nighttime exposure in fish pools, and exposure in fishless pools. The benefits of high exposure in fishless conditions (associated with high feeding and developmental rates) and high exposure in fish pools at night (necessary to drift out of fish pools) have apparently overridden the predation cost of being exposed in fish pools in the day. Behavioural correlations across situations might often result in ecologically important behaviours that appear maladaptive in an isolated context.

AB We investigated which factors determine cooperative behaviour of common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, in an instrumental task. During the approach phase each of eight individuals of a family group learned in isolation to pull a handle moving a bowl with attractive food towards its reach. In the following two experimental phases we used 16 dyads. In a dyadic training phase we assessed whether the partners were willing to manipulate the apparatus and to share food. In the subsequent cooperation test we examined whether they were willing to cooperate at a slightly modified apparatus whose solution required one individual (the producer) to pull the handle and the other (the scrounger) to grasp the bowl. Although all individuals were willing to cooperate with at least one partner, only half of the dyads solved the task in the cooperation phase. Examination of the factors that correlated with success in this phase revealed that primarily those dyads cooperated in which the dominant subject took the role of the scrounger and the subordinate took the role of the producer. However, in ' these successful dyads the dominant animal did not force the subordinate partner to pull the handle. Rather, the partners of cooperative dyads shared the reward and pulled equally often in both the dyadic training and the cooperation test. Thus, cooperation of marmosets in an instrumental task seems to depend on a specific distribution of roles and the tolerance of higher-ranking individuals., (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB According to Lack's principle, older mice should invest more in their offspring than younger ones. I tested this principle with pairs of CRL:NMRI BR mice protecting their young against an intruder, an unfamiliar same-stock male or female. The intruder was presented within a small wire-mesh cage in an extension, a cage the same size as the pair's home cage. The dam, her mate and the young in the nest were present in all tests. Although both parents had full access to the intruder, only the male interacted with it. Young breeding pairs and young intruders were 6 months old, the old pairs and old intruders 12 months. Each breeding pair was tested with both young and old male intruders. Older males defended their pups more vigorously than younger ones. The old males showed a higher preference to stay near (to interact with) the opponent; they also showed more tail rattling and biting attempts than the young ones. This indicates that older males take greater risks in defending their offspring than younger males. Older intruders also elicited a stronger brood defence in older males and a weaker response in younger ones. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examined the effect of body and egg mass, clutch size and incubation period on the occurrence of intraspecific nest parasitism (INP) in Anseriformes and Galliformes, taking into account the phylogenetic relationships of the species concerned. INP has been reported for 46.0% of Anseriformes but only 11.3% of Galliformes, but these rates seem to be underestimates. In both orders INP appears to have multiple origins. Clutch size is significantly larger among INP species and among cavity nesters (all of which are Anseriformes). The length of the incubation period does not differ between INP and non-INP species. After controlling for body mass, we found that the Anseriformes have significantly larger clutches, longer incubation and larger eggs than the Galliformes. We suggest that the large difference in the rate of INP between the two orders is related to the significantly larger clutches of Anseriformes, which increase the period during which clutches are susceptible to parasitism. Furthermore, the larger eggs of the Anseriformes mean that their chicks are more precocial than those of the Galliformes, so that parasitism is less costly in terms of parental care, and less effort is made-by nesting females to drive away potential parasites. Lack of coloniality among the Galliformes also contributes to a lower rate of parasitism in this order, because nests are not concentrated in a small space. Lastly, lack of cavity nesting among Galliformes means that competition for nesting sites is lower in this group. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Passerines maintain low levels of fat in winter even though larger fat reserves would provide better insurance against starvation. This is believed to be a result of predation risk and/or metabolic expenditure increasing with the amount of fat carried. Recent empirical studies indicate that the effect of increased mass on predation risk is small, but the effect on metabolic expenditure is large. Using dynamic modelling, I investigated how mass-dependent costs affect the pattern of fat gain. I found that increases in metabolic expenditure were sufficient to explain strong regulation of the level of fat, but that increases in direct predation risk cannot be excluded. A plausible explanation for the increase in metabolic expenditure is if the extra weight is compensated for by a parallel gain in flight muscle. Such compensation means that an increase in instantaneous predation risk can be avoided, but that costs depending on an increase in energy intake may occur instead. For example more time spent foraging increases exposure to predators, Hence, one form of predation risk (impaired ability to escape from an attacking predator) may be traded for another (more time spent foraging). This will be beneficial if this extended foraging is not risky, whereas failure to compensate for the extra mass would mean the risk of being caught by a predator increasing considerably. Besides the widely recognized trade-off between starvation and predation, this means that there may also be a trade-off between different forms of predation in wintering birds.

AB Foraging decisions are based on a suite of choices that include energetics and physiological constraints. Although travelling farther to harvest a greater net energetic reward is beneficial, many animals opt for a smaller net reward that requires less travel. Recent discoveries of a visual basis for flower constancy in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, led us to examine older reports that colour cues are superceded by energetic considerations. Here we show that when individual bees foraged on pedicellate artificial flowers varying in colour and interfloral distance, their behaviour depended on the colours in the choice test. Colours of similar spectral reflectance (blue versus white), that would be clustered in the bee's visual colour space, elicited more visits to the closest flower when rewards were equal, but individuals travelled a greater distance to harvest a higher energetic reward when reward quality varied. Bees chose the closest flower more often when reward volume decreased while quality remained constant. Yet, even when all flowers were identical (morphology and reward), and only interfloral distance varied, bees did not always visit the closest flower. A dramatic difference was seen when the dimorphism was yellow-blue, colours quite separate in the bee colour space and known to elicit constancy behaviour. Here, bees visited the closest flower only 5% of the time, and varying reward volume did not elicit different behaviour. Animals thus display differential foraging behaviour with respect to environmental cues that must be considered when asking questions about other behavioural parameters.

   paradox in a South American cichlid fish
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

   CONTESTS; PISCES; GAME
AB Several studies have found behavioural differences between the interactions of opponents, early in a conflict. These differences consistently predict which individual will be the winner. Surprisingly, opponents appear not to use this information: they continue fighting and even proceed to highly damaging escalation. We attempted to resolve this paradox in a series of experiments on interactions between male cichlids. First, the cost of fighting and escalating in terms of energy expenditure (oxygen consumption: gill movements) and injuries was high. Second, previous social experience was important but could not explain the occurrence of predictors of conflict outcome. Third, a less artificial conflict set-up, in which territory ownership was asymmetrical and opponents were allowed to see each other before the conflict, resulted in shorter interactions with reduced escalation phases. This suggests that the occurrence of predictors of conflict outcome and the subsequent lack of response of the opponents is the result of unnatural, highly symmetrical designs, as used in many studies. We propose the following mechanism. Prospective winners postpone escalation as much as possible because of the high cost involved. At the same time, prospective losers continue the fight because they lack alternatives. We tested this 'desperado hypothesis' in a fourth experiment, in which losers were offered alternative options. These conflicts were shorter and both predictors of outcome and escalated fighting were absent. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Acoustic signal characteristics that differ strongly between vocalizations of closely related species need not necessarily be the perceptually most important ones. In the dove genus Streptopelia, temporal parameters have been identified as the most distinctive species-specific differences between perch-coo vocalizations. Using synthetic coo model stimuli and an operant design, we tested the perceptual relevance of species-specific differences in temporal structure and amplitude modulation structure for two partly sympatric species, S. decaocto and S. chinensis. The majority of birds used both parameters to classify sound stimuli, although overall, amplitude modulation structure appeared somewhat more important. In an additional experiment, we tested the same birds to examine whether they predominantly used the first element in the classification of coo model stimuli. Our results show that the characteristics of the full signal, rather than the first element, determine classification. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Learning specificity in acquired predator recognition

DT Article
ID TAMMAR WALLABIES; DISCRIMINATION; RESPONSES
AB Predator recognition is often dependent upon experience, This behavioural plasticity can potentially be exploited to enhance the antipredator behaviour of captive-bred animals, but it is first necessary to understand the specificity of learning. We enhanced the responses of tammar wallabies, Macropus eugenii, to a model fox, Vulpes vulpes, by presenting this novel predator in conjunction with a human simulating a capture procedure. A control group had identical total exposure to fox and human, but with no such predictive relationship between these two events. Animals that experienced paired presentations of fox and human behaved more cautiously towards the fox after training than controls. To assess whether this learnt response was specific to the fox, we presented the animals with an array of visual stimuli both before and after training. The tammars generalized their acquired response from the predator with which they were trained to a predator with which they were not trained (cat, Felis catus), but not to a nonpredator (goat, Capra hircus). Tammars also exhibited a transient increase in response to a model wallaby after training. We suggest that this effect is more likely to reflect social behaviour than generalization of the learnt response from predator to conspecific. Two additional controls revealed that changes in behaviour after training were not attributable to the presentation device and were not caused by a general decrease in response threshold associated with training. Our results suggest that tammar wallabies perceive predators as a natural category. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many socially monogamous species have sexually dimorphic traits. The evolution of these traits is puzzling as sexual selection is often thought to be relatively weak in monogamous species. However, sexual selection in monogamous species could be stronger than generally believed if the males possessing more dimorphic traits gain a reproductive advantage by increasing the probability of: (1) gaining a mate, (2) mating with a female of relatively higher quality (more fecund), or (3) gaining extrapair fertilizations. We used a combination of DNA fingerprinting and microsatellite markers to study male traits associated with social and extrapair mating success of males in the common yellowthroat, Geothlypis frichas. In this species the male has a black facial mask that is absent in females. The mask varies almost two times in size among males on our study area. We found that males with larger masks gained both a social and extrapair mating advantage. In terms of social mating success, males with larger masks were more likely to gain a mate. However, there was no clear evidence that these males also gained more fecund mates. In a populationwide analysis, males with larger masks were also more likely to gain extrapair fertilizations and they sired a larger number of extrapair young. Similarly, in a pairwise comparison, extrapair sires had larger masks than the males that they cuckolded. Over the season, males that obtained extrapair fertilizations sired more young (within-pair and extrapair) than males that failed to gain extrapair fertilizations. Most of this difference was due to extrapair rather than within-pair mating success. These results suggest that sexual selection has the potential to influence mask size as a consequence of variation in both the social and extrapair components of mating success.

AB In mammals, reproductive success may be positively correlated with both maternal age and social rank. Because social rank often increases with age, however, the effects of rank and age on reproductive success are difficult to separate. We studied a marked population of mountain goats, Oreamnos americanus, to assess the relative effects of maternal age and social rank on kid production and survival. Adult females formed a linear and stable dominance hierarchy. Kid production increased with both age-specific maternal social rank and age, but decreased slightly after 9 years of age. The influence of dominance was particularly important among 3- to 5-year-old females, and the positive effect of dominance on kid production decreased with increasing female age. Age-specific social rank and maternal age did not affect kid survival to autumn or to 1 year. Kids whose mothers were heavy for their age had a higher probability of surviving to weaning and to 1 year than kids born to light females. When age was accounted for, female survival was not related to social rank. Social rank appears to be an important determinant of reproductive success for female mountain goats, especially among young females. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I investigated the short-term regulation of parental provisioning rate in blue tits by videotaping the parents at the nest. An additional feeding experiment allowed a comparison between the behaviour of parents rearing their brood under normal and supplemented feeding conditions. Videotaping revealed that parents changed their provisioning rate as an immediate response to the absence of begging by chicks. When chicks did not beg for food, the parents solicited them with a particular call to make them open their beaks. Parents spent significantly longer away from the nest immediately after uttering these feeding calls. Provisioning rate returned to the usual levels as soon as the chicks started begging again, but supplemented parents took less time to do so than controls (i.e. parents not provided with additional food). Changes in provisioning rate had effects on both the type and size of prey brought to the brood. Females often responded to low brood demand by returning to the nest without food. Food-supplemented parents, but not controls, took larger larvae when they stayed away from the nest for longer. This suggests that parents in the supplemented group could use more time to reach good feeding sites or, more probably, increase their prey selectivity. Blue tits continually monitored the begging behaviour of their offspring and responded accordingly by adjusting their feeding rate, with immediate consequences for prey choice.

AB Mie successfully trained adult Edith's checkerspot butterflies, Euphydryas editha, to modify their alighting preference for a novel flower and to reduce their handling time when searching for nectar in a flower that was difficult for them to use. Butterflies caught feeding from the difficult flower (manzanita, Arctostaphylos spp., Ericaceae) in the field were able to find its nectar more quickly than butterflies caught feeding from a simpler flower (pussypaw, Calyptridium umbellatum, Portulacaceae), providing evidence that these learning abilities contribute to natural foraging behaviour. The strong role of learning in nectar foraging contrasts with results of prior experiments that failed to show any role of learning in oviposition behaviour by butterflies in the same population that we studied. These butterflies had failed both to improve their finding of host plants with experience and to change their host preferences as a result of exposure to different hosts. Euphydryas editha can learn to prefer and use particular nectar species, but do not learn to prefer or find plants for oviposition. Comparison between oviposition and host feeding is consistent with theoretical predictions that learning should be more pronounced with respect to behaviours whose performance provides information about effects on fitness, or where each of many performances has a small effect on fitness.

   CHOICE; SEX; SYMMETRY; SIZE
AB In the sex-role reversed pipefish Syngnathus typhle females compete for access to males and males are choosy. Females display a temporary ornament, a striped pattern. We show here for the first time in a sex role-reversed species that ornament display predicts how much time a female will devote to competitive behaviours, that males prefer ornamented females over nonornamented ones, and that the ornament is attractive even when female behaviour is held constant. This was demonstrated in an experiment with a male choosing between two females, first with the females separated and then with interactions allowed between the females as well as with the male. Females displaying the ornament for a longer time enjoyed a higher mating success then those displaying the ornament more briefly. Ornament display in the absence of intrasexual competition also predicted the amount of time that females subsequently spent competing. Thus, females initially displaying an attractive trait were also subsequently competing for longer. Furthermore, we manipulated the ornament by painting females and controlled their behaviour by sedating them and moving them in a dance-like fashion by a motor. This experiment showed that males preferred ornamented females, even when female behaviour was standardized. Thus, ornament display accurately predicted the duration of female-female competition and mating success, and was used as a signal by males in their choice of mates.

TI Relic behaviours, coevolution and the retention versus loss of host
   defences after episodes of avian brood parasitism

   REJECTION BEHAVIOR; PUNCTURE-EJECTION; NORTHERN ORIOLES; ADAPTATIONS
AB Most previous studies of brood parasitism have stressed that host defences, such as egg recognition, are lost in the absence of parasitism. Such losses could result in coevolutionary cycles in which parasites shift away from well-defended hosts only to switch back to them later at a time when these hosts have lost much or all of their defences and the parasite's current hosts have built up effective defences. However, the alternative 'single trajectory' model predicts that parasites rarely switch back to old hosts because ex-hosts retain egg recognition for long periods in the absence of parasitism. If true, egg recognition by the host may be a 'relic behaviour', because in the absence of parasitism its adaptive value is close to neutral. Using artificial nonmimetic eggs, I tested for egg recognition in two populations that are currently unparasitized but that are descended from lineages likely to have been parasitized in the past: the grey catbird, Dumetella carolinensis, on Bermuda and the loggerhead shrike, Lanius ludovicianus, in California. Both of these populations showed long-term retention, ejecting nonmimetic eggs at rates of nearly 100%. Because potential present-day selection pressures, such as conspecific parasitism, do not explain this egg recognition, Bermuda catbirds apparently retain recognition from North American conspecifics that were cowbird hosts before colonizing Bermuda and shrikes retain recognition from Old World congeners that were hosts of cuckoos. Retention is also indicated by passerines in California and the Caribbean that had high rejection rates of nonmimetic eggs before coming into contact with cowbirds. These new data suggest that both the coevolutionary cycles and single trajectory models have importance and that rejection behaviour can have insignificant costs, which is consistent with evolutionary lag explanations for the acceptance of parasitic eggs shown by some cuckoo and many cowbird hosts.

AB Research using habituation techniques has shown that rodents from the same kin group, population, or species share similarities in their individual odours that covary with shared genetic similarities between them, that is, the closer their genetic relatedness, the more similar their odours. We assessed similarities in individual odours across four sibling species of subterranean mole-rats from the Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies in Israel. Mole-rats were habituated to the urine odour of a same-sex individual from one species then tested with urine odours of individuals from two different species of the superspecies. Subjects treated urine odours of individuals from more closely genetically related species as similar compared with the odours of individuals from a less closely related species, showing that the covariance between odours and genes Extends across species. These similarities in odour also paralleled genetic similarities determined by molecular analysis: odours of descendent species were perceived as similar to those of their closest ancestral. species, suggesting that some qualities of the odour of the ancestral species persist in the descendent species. It is generally assumed that during speciation incipient species develop species-specific markers, including, for example, odour markers, to facilitate discrimination of conspecifics from close ancestral heterospecifics. Our findings indicate that similarities in odours across species are more salient than species-specific odour markers. Such findings may also have important implications for mechanisms of species recognition. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Video playbacks have been successfully applied to the study of visual communication in several groups of animals. However, this technique is controversial as video monitors are designed with the human visual system in mind. Differences between the visual capabilities of humans and other animals will lead to perceptually different interpretations of video images. We simultaneously presented males and females of the peacock blenny, Salaria pave, with a live conspecific male and an online video image of the same individual. Video images failed to elicit appropriate responses. Males were aggressive towards the live male but not towards video images of the same male. Similarly, females courted only the live male and spent more time near this stimulus. In contrast, females of the gynogenetic poecilid Poecilia formosa showed an equal preference for a live and video image of a P. mexicana male, suggesting a response to live animals as strong as to video images. We discuss differences between the species that may explain their opposite reaction to video images. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Trivers Sr Willard (1973, Science, 179; 90-92) developed an economic theory of parental investment to explain how the relative profitability of sons and daughters varies under specific ecological conditions. In their maternal condition hypothesis they proposed that in polygynous species, the sex of an offspring should be associated with the amount of parental care likely to be made available to it. In these species, the amount of parental investment directed towards offspring may differentially influence the fitness of male and female offspring because males in better than average condition as adults may enjoy larger fitness gains than a female would if she were in better;than average condition, while the reverse may be true when conditions are poor. I tested this hypothesis by determining the sex of specific offspring within house wren broods. Because hatching is asynchronous and hedging is synchronous in this polygynous species, last-hatched young fledge having received less parental care than their broodmates. I predicted that last-hatched offspring would be more likely to be female. I found that these young were indeed more likely to be females, were more likely to have hatched from last-laid eggs and were hedging in poor condition relative to their broodmates. I propose that female house wrens behave in a manner consistent with the predictions of the Trivers Sr Willard hypothesis by producing female offspring last in the laying sequence of their clutches.

AB Studies of the social dynamics in foraging groups have focused primarily on birds, rodents and nonhuman primates. We extended the study of animal social tactics to the domestic pig, Sus scrofa, by using an experimental analogue of natural foraging skills, the 'informed forager' paradigm. We investigated the behaviour of 16 pigs foraging in pairs in an arena in which food had been hidden in one of eight monopolizable buckets. Before each pair trial, one of the pigs, the 'informed' pig, was given privileged knowledge about the location of the food during a solitary search trial. The 'noninformed' pig was naive about the location of the food during pair trials, but heavier than its informed partner and thus able to displace the latter from the baited bucket. By first focusing on the informed pigs' behaviour, we show that pigs are able to remember and relocate the food site. They found the food in relocation trials, using fewer bucket investigations than expected of a random searcher. Second, by focusing on the noninformed pigs, we show that pigs are able to exploit the knowledge of others by following them to a food source. They investigated more buckets immediately after their informed partners significantly more often than expected by chance and required fewer bucket investigations to find the food in pair trials than expected from a random searcher, but not in solitary search trials. We discuss these latter findings with reference to social foraging tactics. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Two intertidal fish species use visual association learning to track the
   status of food patches in a radial maze
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB We tested fifteen-spined sticklebacks, Spinachia spinachia, and corkwing wrasse, Crenilabrus melops, for their ability to associate visual spatial cues with food sources in a radial maze and so to track renewal frequencies and productivity. When all locations contained food or were empty, subjects displayed win-shift or lose-shift behaviour by avoiding recently visited locations; this behaviour therefore appeared to be a basic trait. Both species readily learned food-cue associations, although with less efficiency as the diversity of cues increased. They used this information to distinguish food sources renewed within and between daily foraging bouts from those that remained empty. Moreover, both species distinguished between renewable food sources differing in productivity, preferentially visiting those containing more food. Reversal of cue roles caused an immediate decline in foraging efficiency, followed by rapid recovery as new food-cue associations were learned. Evidently, therefore, subjects tracked the status of potential food sources by continued sampling and could switch from win-shift to win-stay behaviour, when preferred locations were persistently revisited, as appropriate. The formation of food-cue associations, together with sampling and flexible use of win-shift and win-stay behaviour, would enable these rocky intertidal fish species to exploit patchily distributed food sources whose status changes during the tidal cycle.

AB When matings are frequent and received sperm are digested, hermaphrodites should trade sperm when mating. We investigated sperm trading in the flatworm Schmidtea (Dugesia) polychroa and manipulated mating interests to investigate its possible causes. In 106 mating pairs consisting of nonisolated individuals, no sperm donation in either direction (35%) and reciprocal exchange (38%) were more common than expected by chance, whereas unilateral transfer (27%) was less frequent, confirming sperm trading. The amount of sperm donated depended on the availability of self-sperm, not on the amount received. Animals with more allosperm from previous matings had more self-sperm and consequently donated more. This suggests that sperm digestion boosts sperm production. In a second experiment, 'mixed-interest' pairs consisting of a nonisolated (N) and an isolated individual (I), N x I, were compared with I x I and N x N pairs. Whereas I x I pairs were eager and N x N reluctant to mate, N x I pairs showed an intermediate likelihood of mating. Whereas N x N pairs traded sperm, the other two groups did not. The change in behaviour in N individuals in the N x I treatment suggests precopulatory assessment and mating in relation to phenotypic mate quality. Isolated individuals-are attractive, presumably because they donate large sperm clumps unconditionally and contain fewer allosperm, implying reduced sperm competition. The reduced reluctance in N individuals to mate with, and to inseminate, previously isolated partners suggests that female quality is an important factor in male sperm donation decisions. Hence, S. polychroa may be choosier than previously assumed. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The optimum maternal investment per offspring is determined by the relationship between the investment per offspring and offspring fitness. In the European beewolf, Philanthus triangulum, a solitary mass-provisioning sphecid wasp, offspring size correlates with the amount of provisions. We investigated whether the reproductive success of adult males depends on body size in a way that would influence the allocation of parental investment. Since the mating success of P. triangulum males cannot be determined by observation in the field, we assessed the influence of male size on characteristics of their territories, territorial behaviour and life history traits. Territory size was weakly correlated with male size, but a measure of territory quality (number of female nests in the vicinity) was independent of male size. Neither the duration of ownership nor the intensity of scent marking was correlated with male size. Territory owners were slightly smaller than nonterritorial males. The absolute amount of fat was positively correlated with size but, owing to allometric relationships, the energetic equivalent of the fat store appeared to be independent of size. Life span was not significantly influenced by body size under four different conditions (with and without food in the laboratory, in an outdoor flight cage and in the field). We discuss the discrepancy between these results and other studies that have mostly reported advantages to large males. We suggest that in noncontact male-male interactions, as seen in the European beewolf, body size might not be the key determinant for success in contests. We conclude that there is no evidence for a strong size dependence of male reproductive success. Thus the reproductive success of male progeny probably does not depend on parental investment in a way that would influence the investment allocation of females.

AB We determined whether a marine diving bird, the rhinoceros auklet, Cerorhinca monocerata, used different foraging behaviour and collected different prey items for its young than when feeding itself. Foraging behaviour was determined by conducting visual scans, and prey items were sampled by collecting fish delivered to chicks and by collecting fish where auklets were self-feeding, which was verified by two other sources of information. Adult auklets ate small fish (59.1 +/- 0.5 mm, N=547), including juvenile Pacific sand lance, Ammodytes hexapterus, and Pacific herring, Clupea harengus, but collected larger fish to feed their chicks (95.2 +/- 1.3 mm, N=321), including primarily Pacific sand lance, Pacific herring, Pacific salmon species, Oncorhynchus spp., and surf smelt, Hypomesus pretiosus. In addition, auklets collected fish for themselves primarily by diving in mixed-species feeding flocks before 1600 hours, whereas they collected fish to feed their chicks by diving solitarily after 1600 hours. This suggests that auklets switched both foraging behaviour and prey selection when collecting fish for self-feeding, compared with when collecting fish for chick provisioning. Several avian studies have documented different diets of adults and chicks, but this is the first research to observe directly and document different foraging behaviour used in adult and chick provisioning. We emphasize the importance of distinguishing between self-feeding and chick provisioning in foraging and life history studies. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI The geometry of stimulus control
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many studies, both in ethology and comparative psychology, have shown that animals react to modifications of familiar stimuli. This phenomenon is often referred to as generalization. The majority of modifications lead to a decrease in responding, but to certain new stimuli an increase in responding is observed. This holds for both innate and learned behaviour. Here we propose a heuristic approach to stimulus control, or stimulus selection, with the aim of explaining these phenomena. The model. has two key elements. First, we choose the receptor level as the fundamental stimulus space. Each stimulus is represented as the pattern of activation it induces in sense organs. Second, in this space we introduce a simple measure of 'similarity' between stimuli by calculating how activation patterns overlap. The main advantage in this approach is that the generalization of acquired responses emerges from a few simple principles that are grounded in the recognition of how animals actually:perceive stimuli. Many traditional problems that face theories of stimulus control (e.g. the Spence-Hull theory of gradient interaction or ethological theories of stimulus summation) do not arise in the present framework. These problems include the amount of generalization along different dimensions, peak shift phenomena (with respect to both positive and negative shifts), intensity generalization and generalization after conditioning on two positive stimuli.

AB Perceptual range, or the distance at which habitat 'patches' can be perceived, constrains an animal's informational window on a given landscape. If such constraints are great, they may limit successful dispersal between distant habitat patches. On dark nights, nocturnal white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, have surprisingly limited perceptual abilities regarding distant forested habitat. In fact, their ability to orient towards such habitat while travelling in a bare agricultural field indicates a perceptual range under 30 m. However, increasing illumination can increase perceptual range. For example, full moonlight extends the perceptual range of mice to about 60 m. Light levels at dusk (twilight) extend perceptual range still further to about 90 m. These results suggest that interpatch dispersal by whitefooted mice would be more successful under greater illumination, but travelling under such conditions entails a considerable risk of predation. These mice might avoid such a conflict by travelling under the cover of darkness with the aid of information gathered remotely during relatively high illumination. We show that mice are indeed capable of such a 'look now and move later' strategy: mice retain directional information gained under bright conditions and maintain a previously determined bearing in conditions under which distant navigational stimuli may be largely absent (e.g. maximal darkness). Ultimately, a better understanding of the behavioural and ecological factors affecting the movements of animals across landscapes should produce a clearer picture of the interaction between landscape structure and population ecology.

AB Previous laboratory studies of Mediterranean fruit flies, Ceratitis capitata (medflies), have identified large size and protein feeding as positive influences on the ability of males to secure copulations. In this study, we investigated whether large and protein-fed males experience additional advantages in terms of amount and distribution of sperm stored by mates. We also examined relationships between copula duration and sperm storage. Mates of large and protein-fed males were more likely to store sperm and to store more sperm than mates of small and protein-deprived males. Probability of sperm storage was associated with copula duration; all copulations lasting less than 100 min failed whereas 98% lasting longer than 100 min succeeded. Copulations involving sperm storage were longer if males were small or protein deprived or if the female was large, although there was no evidence of a relationship between copula duration and total sperm storage. Evidence from related studies suggests that variation in latency until sperm transfer, caused by size and diet, is a likely explanation for varying copula duration. Sperm tended to be stored asymmetrically between the female's two spermathecae, consistent with a mating system in which females maintain isolated populations of sperm from different males and later select between them. Storage was less asymmetric when large numbers of sperm were stored but there was little evidence that male size or diet affected this asymmetry. It is uncertain whether postcopulatory advantages of large and protein-fed male medflies arise from female preferences or male dominance through coercion or force.

AB Previous studies of brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, have shown that social learning and cultural transmission can influence courtship and mating patterns. These earlier studies did not test whether cultural background influenced mate choice in females and therefore whether culture could potentially play a role in sexual selection in this species, as has been suggested by recent theory. Here, we tested whether culture influences female mate choice in brown-headed cowbirds. Female cowbirds from a South Dakota population were housed with adult cowbirds from the same South Dakota population or with adult cowbirds from a behaviourally distinct population from Indiana. We tested the mating preferences of females of the South Dakota culture and females of the Indiana culture in sequential mate-choice trials with males, controlling for intrasexual interactions. The males were South Dakota cowbirds that had also been housed either in the South Dakota culture or in the Indiana culture. Females showed mating preferences for males from their own culture. These results suggest that mate choice in female cowbirds can be influenced by cultural background. We briefly discuss the effect that culture may have on sexual selection and on the evolution of female mating preferences. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The quality of an individual's odour can allow potential mates to discriminate against individuals of low social class, poor health status or unsuitable genotype. Competitive scent marking provides a further mechanism which could allow mates to discriminate between individuals of apparently high quality. The presence or absence of fresh countermarks from competitors within an owner's territory or area marked by a dominant animal provides a reliable indicator of the owner's ability to defend its territory or dominate competitors. This could be used by potential mates to discriminate between individuals advertising their apparently high competitive ability through their scent-marking behaviour and odour quality. We tested this by manipulating scent marks in the neighbouring territories of wild-caught male house mice, Mus domesticus. As predicted, oestrous females used scent marks to select males apparently able to defend exclusive territories over those unable to exclude intruders. Females were more strongly attracted to the odour of owners of exclusively marked territories and showed more sexually related behaviour when interacting with these males. Furthermore, while females preferred a territory containing a better protected nest site regardless of the owner's apparent competitive ability, they still used the presence or absence of intruder countermarks when selecting a potential mate. This suggests that females use scent marks as a reliable signal of the best-quality mate among neighbouring males independently of their nest location. Since assessment depends on both the territory holder's own marks and those of competitor males, countermarking is likely to be an important mechanism of competition for mates between neighbours.

ID GUPPY POECILIA-RETICULATA; HABITAT SELECTION; EVOLUTION; PISCES; MATE
AB I studied the fighting behaviour of a small South American cichlid fish, Nannacara anomala, in relation to predation risk. In this species,which reduces vigilance during escalated fighting, differences in fighting ability are most accurately assessed during mouth wrestling. Thus, there is a potential trade-off between agonistic behaviours that are effective for assessing differences in fighting ability between contestants and agonistic behaviours that minimize the risk of being killed by predators. I investigated whether breaks between bouts of mouth wrestling improved the contestants' ability to flee from an approaching model fish predator. During the breaks-between mouth wrestling the contestants had a significantly longer escape distance than males that were actively mouth wrestling. Fighting males also changed their fighting behaviour after the introduction of the model predator compared with males that were not exposed to it. Low-intensity behaviours such as lateral display and tail beating were preferred to mouth wrestling. In addition, both the number and duration of bouts of active mouth wrestling decreased significantly after the introduction of the model predator while the duration of the breaks between bouts of active mouth wrestling increased significantly compared with the control. Including predation risk in the costs of intense fighting may increase our understanding of both the temporal structuring of fighting behaviour and the evolution of fighting behaviour in general.

AB Recent models suggest that begging vocalizations are honest signals communicating a chick's nutritional needs to its parents. We investigated the effects on begging of short-term food deprivation ('hunger') and long-term reduction in body condition under controlled laboratory conditions in ring-billed gulls, Larus delawarensis. We tested two condition groups (high: fed to satiation; low: fed 75% wet mass of high-condition diet) at three levels of short-term food deprivation (1, 4 and 12 h). Begging call rate,intensity and peck rate were significantly greater in the low-condition chicks. Begging in both high- and low-condition groups increased with short-term deprivation, tending to asymptotic levels by 12 h of deprivation. Overall level of begging was graded according to both short- and long-term need for food, with steep slopes at the beginning of the begging curves providing a strong basis for parental discrimination of signalling level. The system appears to agree with the design requirements of a homeostatic control system, and with predictions of current game-theoretic models of honest signalling. Possible effects of sibling competition and parent-offspring conflict are discussed. These issues require further study under natural conditions in this species.

AB Recently, some empirical studies have shown an effect of body mass on take-off ability in birds, supporting the theory that birds with increased fat loads face a greater predation risk. Small wintering birds accumulate fat reserves of about 10% of their fat-free body mass during the day to survive long, cold, winter nights. Theoretically, mass-dependent predation risk could be an important factor affecting their daily foraging routines. I studied the take-off ability of wintering willow tits, Pants montanus, in relation to their fat load. Willow tits were on average 7.7% heavier at dusk than at dawn but there was no measurable effect of body mass on take-off ability. The results indicate that the relatively small fat loads accumulated during a day by willow tits do not increase the risk of predation as a consequence of reduced take-off ability.

AB By repeatedly presenting an alien scent to territory-owning beavers, Castor canadensis, we tested two competing hypotheses about the function of scent marking: scent fer.ce and scent matching. The scent-fence hypothesis predicts that territory owners should respond increasingly strongly over time towards a recurrent alien scent because of the ineffectiveness of previous responses. The scent-matching hypothesis predicts that the intensity of response should be the same or decrease because, without the presence of the intruding signaller coupled with the chemical signal, the presence of the scent itself does not advertise the ownership of a territory. The response level of resident beaver families was stable to strangers' anal gland secretions (AGSs) and decreased to strangers' castoreum during a period of 6 days. These results support the scent-matching hypothesis but not the scent-fence hypothesis. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT; SIBLING COMPETITION; NEED; BROODS; SIGNALS;
   HONEST; FOOD
AB Recent models of parent-offspring communication suggest that nestling begging reliably reflects food requirements, and therefore should increase with nestling need. Need may be affected by short-term variations in hunger, as well as by long-term factors such as relative size, growth rate and body condition. In the present study, the brood sizes of barn swallows were manipulated to create differences in nestling growth rate and body condition. The extent to which begging behaviour reflects these differences was tested. I measured begging behaviour by removing nestlings from the nest for three laboratory tests in which temporal variations in hunger were controlled, and four target nestlings (small and large, from small and large broods) were tested simultaneously. Small nestlings and nestlings from large broods had lower growth rates and poorer body condition than large nestlings and nestlings from small broods, respectively. Begging was positively correlated with both short- and long-term determinants of need. However, when nestlings grew older (second test), the trend was mixed, mainly because begging levels dropped in the neediest nestling category (small nestlings from large broods). After nestlings had been exchanged between broods for 24 h, small nestlings from large broods improved their growth rate and body condition, but still begged less than expected from their long-term need. The results suggest that nestling begging strategies vary with brood size and with nestling rank. However, these variations may reflect not only long-term need, but also nestling response to past experience or to variations in the cost and effectiveness of their begging efforts.

AB Studies of resource allocation strategies have concentrated on the influence of natural selection on the evolution of life history traits. To a lesser degree, the effects of trade-offs between natural and sexual selection on the evolution of allocation strategies have also been considered. Trade-offs between sexually selected traits that are important to females but that appear to differ in cost, however, have not been considered. Female green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri, prefer males with longer swords to males with shorter swords, and in this study they demonstrated a preference for larger males to smaller males. Furthermore, sexually mature males invested differentially in body and sword growth depending on resource availability; males that had an unlimited amount of food invested in both body and sword growth, but males shifted to a food-restricted regime halted investment in body growth and invested only in sword growth. These results suggest that males shift their pattern of investment in two sexually selected traits when food becomes restricted. In general, variable environmental conditions may favour such conditional investment strategies in species in which there is more than one preferred male trait and the costs of the traits differ.

AB In some altricial birds with biparental care, it is the female, and in others the male, that provides more food to the smallest offspring within the brood. Many hypotheses have been proposed to account for such puzzling patterns of parental care. A parsimonious explanation is that no difference exists between the parents in priority of care but that differences arise simply from sibling rivalry, with dominant chicks trying to position themselves closest to the parent that provides most care (the sibling rivalry hypothesis). A refinement of the idea is that parents use the way they approach the chicks to counter selfish offspring and in this way control allocation of care (the parental approaching hypothesis). A comparison across species suggested that female care of the smallest chick within a brood is the ancestral and most common pattern. However, strong variation exists within single populations. In one species, the American robin, Turdus migratorius, the sibling rivalry hypothesis and the parental approaching hypothesis were both supported because in broods where males provided more care than females, the largest chick was predominantly fed by the male whereas the smallest chick was predominantly fed by the female. When the male provided less care than the female, an opposite result was found. The same patterns of allocation of care also seemed to exist when chicks were quite immobile just after having left the nest and when their positions were experimentally controlled, suggesting parental control.

AB We examined conspicuous signalling displays in the context of predator-prey interactions. To determine in which context Puerto Rican crested anoles, Anolis cristatellus, perform conspicuous signals, we exposed wild lizards to a model of a natural snake predator. The lizards gave six behavioural responses to the model: immobility, predator inspection, flight, lateral face-off, dewlapping and push-ups. They displayed significantly more push-ups and push-up bouts in the presence of the snake model. Alternative theories regarding the function of conspicuous signals in A. cristatellus, the flash concealment and predator deterrent hypotheses, were also tested. The flash concealment hypothesis proposes that the sudden display exhibition of signalling behaviour followed by the flight of the animal may confuse the predator about the position of the prey, thus causing the predator to abort the attack. The pursuit deterrent hypothesis contends that because the chances of the predator successfully attacking its prey decrease when the prey is aware of the incoming predator, prey have evolved signalling behaviours that communicate to the predator that it has been detected, therefore discouraging the attack. Results supported the use of push-ups, dewlapping, lateral face-off and predator inspection as predator deterrent signals. During the recognition phase of a predatory encounter, A. cristatellus may rely more on behavioural signals than on flight to avoid predation. Because the predator deterrent signals are the same as the signals used in social interactions, it is suggested that predation pressure may have reinforced the effects of sexual selection in the evolution of Anolis signalling displays.

AB Division of labour among workers was investigated in the lower termite, Reticulitermes fukienensis. Workers were separated into three age groups based on size, small workers being the youngest, medium workers intermediate and large workers the oldest. Workers were then compared in behavioural assays for the degree to which they would carry out specific tasks, which included: (1) foraging-related tasks; (2) care of eggs, larvae and the queen; and (3) some other important behaviours including burying corpses, alarm-giving and time spent stationary. All tasks were performed by two or all three of the size-groups of workers. Hence evidence does not support the hypothesis of tasks being discretely allocated among different instars in termites and this having evolved towards the extreme of one caste for every task. The oldest workers (i.e. large workers) carried out the highest frequencies of all tasks investigated. This contrasts with the social Hymenoptera, where younger workers specialize in some tasks (especially brood and queen care). The results suggest a new pattern for social insects for division of labour among workers. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Artificial visual stimuli in the form of photographs, video sequences and computer-generated images are increasingly being used to explore the visual world of birds but their use is controversial as it is still not clear whether birds see them in the same way that humans do. While differences between bird and human colour vision may be one problem with using such artificial images, another and potentially even more important difficulty is the distance at which stimuli are presented. An experiment is described in which hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, were trained to move towards one of two real objects viewed at two different distances. Even for:real objects, discrimination levels were better when the hens were allowed to view the stimuli from 5-25 cm than when they were forced to choose at 120 cm and this correlated with their ability to transfer to photographs of the same objects at different distances. In a colour discrimination at a short distance, five out of seven hens showed 100% correct responses when first shown photographs of real objects that they had previously learnt to discriminate. The results suggest that photographs can be used as substitutes for real stimuli but that care should be taken over the distance at which they are presented. The results are discussed in relation to the visual behaviour of birds and differences in functioning of their frontal and lateral visual fields.

AB When presented with an artificial flower patch of blue and yellow pedicellate flowers, individual honey bees, Apis mellifera L., became constant to one of the two Bower colours, rarely even sampling the alternative colour. Some bees visited only blue flowers while others visited only yellow flowers. This paper describes the onset of constancy for bees that had had no experience with the experimental apparatus. In 3020 visits, bees failed to land on or drink from the flower colour on which they first landed only 17 times. This behaviour was not modified by quality or quantity of reward, training to the experimental site, group effects or presence of odour during trials. However, when we trained bees to a target painted with two colours and then forced them to sample monomorphic flower patches in sequence, all bees visited the only colour present: yellow or blue. When we subsequently offered these same bees yellow and blue flowers simultaneously (rewarded choices), they became constant. Eleven of 23 bees showed constancy to the less rewarding flower morph without even sampling the alternative. Those bees failed to sample even though they had previously been forced to visit the alternative flower morph, which offered a reward with twice the calories/volume. Constancy is thus spontaneous in honey bees, but it can be hidden by some experimental protocols designed to study learning. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We describe a new assay for measuring the acquisition phase of song learning in birds and compare it with the standard method of comparing a pupil's imitation to his tutor's song. Juvenile male and female white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys, give call notes in response to playback of species-typical song. After 10-day periods of tape tutoring conducted in the first 50 days of life, subjects gave significantly more calls in response to tutor songs than to novel songs. An identical procedure conducted at a later age yielded a different result. Birds did not distinguish tutor from novel songs in winter, after the sensitive phase for song acquisition. Males gave significantly more calls to those tutor songs that they subsequently sang the next spring than to tutor songs they did not reproduce. Assuming that the call assay correlates with long-term storage of songs in females as it does in males, these results also indicate that the sensitive phase for song acquisition is shorter in females than in males of this species.

AB During mating, male smooth newts, Triturus vulgaris, showed a population bias for turning left during spermatophore transfer. This is the first demonstration of asymmetrical sexual behaviour in an amphibian population. An experiment with a perfect female model showed that it was due to male rather than female lateralization. Left turning bias decreased progressively as more spermatophores were deposited, and no significant bias was detectable by the third deposition. The hypothesis that this was due to neuromuscular fatigue was tested but not supported. Turning orientation had no influence on the probability of the female picking up the spermatophore in her cloaca. The left turning bias has not been found in the great crested newt, T. cristatus.

AB When searching on Scots pines, females of the aphid parasitoid Pauesia silvestris responded to differences in mortality risks, host distribution and host quality by changing foraging tactics. They foraged more successfully (i.e. they laid more eggs per unit time) on the pine aphid Cinara pini than on Cinara pinea. Therefore, the former species was considered to be of higher quality. However, P. silvestris suffered from a high mortality (19.5%) from ant aggression when foraging for C. pini, while mortality was zero on pines with C. pinea. All females that were killed were foraging on the bark, while females searching on needles were safe from ant attacks. When searching for C. pinea, P. silvestris spent significantly mon time on needles if the aphid colonies were ant-attended. On pines with C. pini, in contrast, females spent more time on bark in ant-attended colonies. The high adult mortality risk on bark was counterbalanced by a significantly higher foraging success in ant-attended colonies. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male tiger salamanders, Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum, are slightly larger in body size and have considerably higher and longer tails than females. To determine how these dimorphic traits affected reproductive performance and success, we conducted breeding trials using 12 males and six females per trial and monitored male-female and male-male interactions. Larger males had an advantage in most aspects of mate competition investigated. Males with higher tails had no advantage in either mate competition or mate choice. Males with longer tails also had no advantage in mate competition but were preferred as mates by females. Larger males interrupted courting males more often than smaller males did. The form of male-male interference was conditional on body size and not on either tail dimension. Lf the intruder was larger than the courting male, it would shove the female away from the courting male and initiate courtship; if the intruder was smaller, it adopted a female mimicry tactic in which it positioned itself between the courting male and female and performed female behaviours to the courting male while simultaneously courting the female. Our trials indicated that the two components of sexual selection may influence the evolution of different male morphological traits in tiger salamanders. Mate competition may favour increased male body length; mate choice may select for greater male tail length. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Three predictions arising from the proposal that infant-carrying serves as a form of courtship in callitrichid primates were tested, using data from captive common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus and cotton-top tamarins, Saguinus oedipus. The first prediction, that males would be more likely to successfully copulate while carrying infants than while not carrying infants, was not supported in either species. In common marmosets, males were less likely to copulate while carrying infants. This relation may reflect the lower activity levels and increased vigilance required by those individuals transporting infants. The second prediction, that the overall percentage of time that males spent carrying infants would be related to overall frequency of copulations during fertile periods, was also not supported for either species. The third prediction was that, if females selected mates relative to their infant-care 'performance', males should be more solicitous of the breeding female's efforts to relinquish the infant to another carrier than to the efforts of other group members. If so, then males should retrieve harassed infants from mothers more frequently than from other group members; this prediction was not supported. The results of this study offer no support for the contention that infant care serves as a form of courtship in callitrichid primates. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Data on adult female Dall's sheep, Ovis nalli dalli, were used to assess how predation risk factors combine to affect vigilance. An interactive factors hypothesis was proposed, and whether predation risk factors have interactive (or multiplicative) effects on vigilance was tested. Because most studies have implicitly assumed additivity, for illustrative purposes the alternative but less plausible independent factors hypothesis, in which predation risk factors have independent (or additive) effects on vigilance, was also tested. It was predicted that natural selection would favour interactive relationships because, rather than making redundant investments in anti-predator behaviour, animals that are already 'safe enough' can make greater investments in foraging (i.e. an animal in a very large group need not have a strong vigilance response to increasing distance to refuge). Results supported the interactive model and did not support the independent model. Sheep became less vigilant as group size increased, but this relationship became weaker as they got closer to cliffs. Sheep also became more vigilant as distance to cliffs increased, but this relationship became weaker as group size increased. Finally, a posteriori analysis suggested that when sheep were within 20 m from obstructive cover, the interaction between group size and distance to cliffs affected vigilance more strongly than when sheep were further from obstructive cover. Rather than implicitly assuming that predation risk factors have additive effects, as most previous studies have done, generating predictions with the interactive factors hypothesis may be a more realistic approach for understanding vigilance and other anti-predator behaviours.

AB The usual evolutionary and ecological approaches to foraging in social insects often lack an investigation at the level of both individual behavioural complexity and social mechanisms ruling the emergence of adaptive collective strategies. The prey scavenging behaviour of the dimorphic ant Pheidole pallidula was used in this study to investigate (I) how individuals estimate the size of prey, (2) how they modulate their behaviour and communication and (3) how these modulations generate the diversity of collective foraging patterns. For a pile of small prey (fruit flies), the recruitment of foragers was slow because of the weak intensity of individual trail-laying behaviour and the long time spent by ants wandering around the food. In contrast, for a large prey item (a cockroach), strong recruitment was induced by ants that dashed back to the nest laying a more continuous chemical trail. Experiments with small immovable prey showed that the tractive resistance of prey was the key parameter the foragers used to estimate prey size and that it ruled their trail-laying intensity. These data allow us to generate a model about decision making in scavenging. The rules leading to collective choice in a foraging or an agonistic context are discussed. On the basis of these findings, some theoretical stances in sociobiology and some shortcomings in current approaches to cooperation in social insects are considered.

AB Sperm release and sperm storage were examined in the spiny orbweaver, Micrathena gracilis. This species shares characteristics with other spiders that show a first-male advantage for egg fertilization. Male M. gracilis differentially released sperm to virgin females. Sperm release was not related to female age or copulatory duration. In this species, a complete mating between a pair requires two copulations that are separated by a dismount. The second copulation is twice as long as the first. After manipulating the duration of the second copulation, it was found that sperm were released early in the copulation. When a female copulated twice, storage of sperm in the female's first side was influenced by the prolonged second copulation. Considering that males often do not obtain two copulations, and that a female may alternate copulations when two males are present, it was experimentally determined that the copulatory stimulation provided by a second male does facilitate the storage of the first copulating male's sperm. It is concluded that sperm release and sperm storage are two separate processes. Copulation does not necessarily result in sperm release by the male. Not all sperm released are stored within the female, and the number stored is influenced by copulatory duration. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A brightly coloured mutant may suffer increased predation (by being conspicuous) or may be favoured by reduced predation (if predators avoid novel or rare varieties). These alternatives were examined in a 2-year study of great tits, Parus major, by painting and ringing 1655 fledglings near 27 pairs of nesting sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus. A minority (<10%) of the great tits in each hawk territory were manipulated. On average, 40.7% of the fledglings in each brood were bright red, the others controls (yellow). Based on ring recoveries at hawk nests, the percentage of red tits taken was 5.5%, compared with 4.0% for controls, indicating an increase in predation rate by 38% for red birds. The results were similar in both years. However, using hawk pairs as sample units, predation risk was not significantly higher for red tits. Hawks that caught only one painted tit did not take red ones more often than expected, whereas those that caught two or more tits tended to take red ones more often. A predation cost for bright mutants may initially be low or absent, later increasing with the frequency of the mutant. In addition, tit parents fed red fledglings more often than controls, indicating a possible parental preference for red.

AB When individuals differ in competitive ability, ideal free distribution theory predicts that animals should be distributed between habitats such that the distribution of their relative competitive abilities (or 'weights') matches the distribution of resources. At equilibrium, the unequal competitors model predicts that the payoff per unit of competitive weight will be the same in all habitats, such that no individual can increase its payoff by moving. These predictions were tested in juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, by allowing 15 groups of eight individuals to compete for drifting prey in a two-patch stream channel environment. Competitive weights were quantified a priori as the proportion of prey obtained by each individual when competing with all other members of the group in a single patch. At equilibrium, the distributions of competitive weights did not differ significantly from the distributions of resources; although in most groups, slightly too many competitive weights were in the poor patch relative to that predicted by the model. The mean payoff per unit of competitive weight did not differ between patches. In the good patch, however,'poor' competitors tended to receive higher payoffs per unit of competitive weight than 'good' competitors, which suggests that competitive abilities did not remain constant across patches as assumed by the model. Although evidence exists for the original, equal competitors ideal free distribution model (i.e. total competitor numbers match the distribution of resources) despite the presence of competitive inequalities, the present results suggest that this will not always be true. Distributions of coho salmon numbers were significantly different from both the distributions of resources and the distributions of competitive weights. These results suggest that the incorporation of competitive inequalities into habitat selection models will enhance our abilityto predict animal distributions.

AB Factors influencing the likelihood that a coyote, Canis latrans, will disperse or remain in its natal pack are not well understood. The social and nutritional factors influencing the dispersal of resident coyotes in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming were examined by observing 49 coyotes from five resident packs for 2456 h from January 1991 to June 1993. One of two strategies was adopted: disperse or remain in the natal pack (philopatry). Dispersing coyotes were low-ranking pups, or low-ranking betas, who spent little time with other pack members and were typically subordinate during interactions with other members of their pack. Dominant (alpha) coyotes and higher-ranking betas did not disperse. Dispersers had little or no access to ungulate carcasses during winter compared with higher-ranking, philopatric individuals in the pack. The ability to capture small mammals also became important in determining which animals remained or dispersed. When pack size increased in the winter of 1992-1993, possibly intensifying competition at ungulate carcasses, philopatric pups and betas captured small mammals at a higher rate than dispersing coyotes. Individuals that remained in the pack were dominant and higher-ranking, typically had greater access to carcasses in their respective packs and captured small mammals at a higher rate than dispersing individuals when pack sizes were largest. Philopatric coyotes remained within their pack with the objective of advancing to the alpha breeding position. Low-ranking, subordinate coyotes left their natal pack and attempted to establish themselves in either adjacent or distant territories. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The purposes of this study were to assess whether homosexual behaviour promotes alliance formation between sexual partners and whether individuals engage in homosexual behaviour to form alliances. Data were collected during pre- and post-consortship baseline periods and during 21 of 28 different homosexual consortships observed ad libitum. These consortships involved 14 female Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, living in a captive, bisexual group of 37 individuals. Non-kin females intervened for each other significantly more when in homosexual consortships than during the baseline periods. Consort partners did not intervene for other sexually mature, non-kin females in this manner. Interventions were not performed as sexual solicitations. Subordinate consort partners were equally likely to receive alliance support against dominant and subordinate targets, and they routinely received support against targets with whom they had ambiguous dominance relationships. Compared to the baseline periods, subordinate partners directed more agonistic behaviour to other group members, who, in turn, avoided agonistic interactions with these females. Some consorting females, especially subordinate partners, temporarily increased in dominance upon receiving support against dominant targets, or targets with whom they shared an ambiguous dominance relationship. Absence of preference for high-ranking consort partners, coupled with the bi-directional flow of most affiliation within consortships, suggested that choice of same-sex partners was principally based on mutual sexual attraction and not on their potential utility as allies. These data suggest that homosexual behaviour promotes alliance formation between sexual partners, but that individuals do not engage in homosexual behaviour for the express purpose of forming alliances.

AB Alderley Park (Wistar-derived) rats, Rattus norvegicus, were maintained in single-sex groups of eight for 9 weeks under open-room conditions. Both sexes could be categorized into more or less discrete social classes based on the directionality of aggression within dyads. The difference in the number of aggressive acts initiated and received (agonistic score) provided a measure of social pressure for each rat. Males and females differed in the relationship between social class and social pressure and thus in the behavioural and pathophysiological effects of social pressure. Differences in the relationship both between and within sexes can be interpreted in terms of the degree of frustration of different social strategies. The effect of social pressure on behaviour was most obvious in time spent sleeping, exploring and attempts to escape; dominant individuals slept more and low status individuals, especially females, spent more time moving around the enclosure and stretching up the walls. Individual and sex differences in social strategy and time budgeting were reflected in levels of hormone and antibody concentrations during the period of grouping, and in changes in organ histology suggestive of early pathology. Corticosterone (but not testosterone) concentrations correlated significantly with aggressive behaviour, but with aggression subsequent to, rather than preceding or concurrent with, blood samples. Individual differences in aggression initiated and received during introductions did not reflect those recorded in established groups of either sex. The results are discussed in the light of other studies of relationships between social strategy and pathophysiology in rats and the selection pressures likely to be acting on free-living animals leading to a new interpretation of the welfare implications of previous work.

AB Kin recognition has been reported in many animal taxa, but rarely in lizards. Newly born clutches from two viviparous Australian skink species, Tiliqua rugosa and Egernia stokesii, were either left with their mothers, separated at birth and kept with a foster mother, or kept completely isolated from any adults. In experimental trials mothers were presented with their own and with non-related young in gauze bags, and their attention to each young lizard was measured by the number of directed tongue flicks and the time in contact. There was a consistent tendency in both species for mothers to direct more attention to their own young, whether they had been kept together or apart. Foster mothers directed more attention to their own non-familiar young than to their familiar foster young. In reciprocal experiments, young lizards of both species consistently directed more attention to their own mothers than to unrelated females, even when they had been isolated from their mothers from birth. Olfactory cues are probably important for recognition. Using these cues, lizards can recognize kin, and discriminate between kin and non-kin even if the latter have been in close association. It was not possible to determine if the discrimination was genetically based, or if it was acquired during or shortly after birth. The presence of mother-offspring recognition suggests that family groups may be a component in the social organization of these species. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The honeydew-producing treehopper, Guayaquila xiphias, is frequently tended by ants on shrubs of Didymopanax vinosum in the Brazilian savannah. Field experiments showed that the flicking of accumulated honeydew by untended treehoppers provides cues to ground-dwelling ants. Upon finding scattered honeydew droplets on the ground, the ants climb onto the host plant and start tending activity. Honeydew-soaked filter papers placed beneath unoccupied host plants induced significantly more ants to climb onto the plant than water-soaked papers. Because predation and parasitism on G. xiphias can be severe at early stages, and tending ants protect the homopterans against predators and parasitoids, the capacity to attract ants early in life can be crucial for treehopper survival.

AB This paper reports the first investigation of the mate attraction function of song in a tropical resident wood-warbler. Male Adelaide's warblers, Dendroica adelaidae (Emberizidae: Parulinae), which sing two categories of song (A and B), maintain territories and monogamous pair bonds year-round. Males that were naturally or experimentally unpaired delivered A songs at significantly higher rates than did paired males during both breeding and non-breeding periods. In contrast, use of B songs and singing at dawn did not vary with pairing status. The dawn chorus, characterized by intense and versatile displays of the B song category by neighbouring males, was absent from the non-breeding season. Dawn singing and the B song category thus appear relatively unimportant in mate attraction in this species. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that the A song category functions in mate attraction in wood-warblers. Furthermore, data from the non-breeding season show that the mate attraction function of song is not narrowly tied to the breeding season in a resident species. These data provide evidence for honest signalling of male pairing status in a socially monogamous species. Throughout the year, male Adelaide's warblers reveal their pairing status honestly, with a comparatively higher rate of A song delivery signalling that a male is unpaired. Paired and unpaired males were distinguishable based on their singing behaviour. Honest advertisement of pairing status may have been favoured in this species by female defence of mates and a habitat saturated with territories, which would limit opportunities for polygyny or polyterritoriality.

TI Value of food aggregates: Parallel versus serial discounting
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID MARGINAL VALUE; DELAY; CHOICE
AB Rats' choices for food sequences were studied in a titration paradigm. Three models of time discounting and a model of rate maximization were tested with choice between a sequence of five pellets delivered closely in time, and a sequence of five pellets with an inter-pellet delay. To estimate the delay at which rats were indifferent to either alternative, a fixed delay to the first pellet in the spaced sequence was maintained, and the time to the first pellet in the dense sequence was titrated. The results are contrary to a rate-maximization account, and favour a parallel discounting model of aggregate food value in which the sequence value is the simple sum of the discounted value of the individual items.

ID REPLETA GROUP; SONG; EVOLUTION
AB The two saguaro-breeding Drosophila, D. nigrospiracula and D. mettleri, share striking morphological similarities even though they are not closely related. Drosophila mettleri is a member of the eremophila species complex, whereas D. nigrospiracula is a member of the anceps species complex. Both the courtship songs and courtship behaviour of the six species in these two complexes were examined. The objectives were (1) to investigate whether courtship behaviour follows the same evolutionary trend as the morphological traits and (2) to provide further insight about the evolution of courtship behaviour in these species. Results showed that the courtship song is a phylogenetically conservative trait within both species complexes. The pattern observed in the song parameters measured can be interpreted in terms of the degree with which hybrids can be formed in the laboratory and the extent to which sympatry occurs in the geographical distribution of the species within each species complex. Compared to many other species of Drosophila in the repleta group, those of the eremophila complex possess unique features, whereas those in the anceps complex have song characters that are commonly found throughout the species group.

TI GUSTATORY HABITUATION TO DETERRENT ALLELOCHEMICALS IN A HERBIVORE -
   CONCENTRATION AND COMPOUND SPECIFICITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID GRASSHOPPER SCHISTOCERCA-AMERICANA
AB The stimulus specificity of habituation was examined in the gustatory system of a polyphagous grasshopper, Schistocera americana. Gustatory habituation is thought to be an important mechanism in herbivores for inhibiting taste-rejection of foods containing allelochemicals at deterrent but non-toxic concentrations. Experiment 1 determined taste threshold concentrations for three deterrent alkaloids (lobeline, nicotine, and hyoscyamine). Experiment 2 examined the concentration specificity of gustatory habituation by pre-exposing (via the diet) grasshoppers to the taste threshold concentration of one alkaloid for 3 days, and then assessing their taste responsiveness (as indicated by meal duration during an acceptability test) to the same alkaloid at either the taste threshold or a supra-threshold concentration. Compared to grasshoppers pre-exposed to a control diet, those pre-exposed to a diet containing one of the alkaloids were significantly less responsive to (1) the taste threshold concentration of the same alkaloid, and (2) the supra-threshold concentration of the same alkaloid in all cases except lobeline. Experiment 3 explored the compound specificity of gustatory habituation by pre-exposing grasshoppers to the taste threshold concentration of one alkaloid, and then assessing their taste responsiveness to taste threshold concentrations of the two other (i.e. novel) alkaloids. Whereas habituation to hyoscyamine generalized to nicotine and lobeline, that to lobeline generalized to nicotine but not hyoscyamine, and that to nicotine failed to generalize to either novel alkaloid. Thus, habituating to a deterrent compound can have complex and asymmetric effects on a grasshopper's gustatory responsiveness to higher concentrations of the same compound and/or to threshold concentrations of novel deterrent compounds.

ID POECILIA-RETICULATA; SEXUAL SELECTION; COLOR PATTERNS; MATE CHOICE;
   EVOLUTION; HERITABILITY; POPULATION; SUCCESS
AB Models of inter-sexual selection generally assume heritable variation in mating preferences among females within populations. However, little is known about the nature of such variation. The aim of this study was to characterize quantitatively the phenotypic variation in female preference for a sexually selected male trait, body colour pattern, within a population of the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Significantly more female guppies preferred the more brightly coloured of two similar-sized males presented simultaneously as potential mates. Mating preference scores for individual females were significantly and positively correlated between two repeated trials on successive days. Females were thus individually consistent in their particular choice of mates, and the calculated repeatability of their mating preference was relatively high. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, significant variation existed among females in the degree of their preference for brightly coloured males. Individual mating preference scores were not normally distributed, but were rather skewed to the right (i.e. towards greater values). These results suggest that additive genetic variation for mating preferences based on male colour pattern is maintained, and the opportunity for the further evolution of both bright male colour patterns and female preference for this trait appears to exist in the study population from the Quare River, Trinidad.

   CUCULUS-CANORUS; REED WARBLERS; COWBIRD PARASITISM; MATE DESERTION;
   RECOGNITION; REJECTION; BIRDS; MECHANISMS
AB To understand the co-existence of rejection and acceptance of cuckoo eggs within a host population, the mechanism of egg discrimination and the cost-benefit balance of rejection behaviour were investigated. At a study site in central Japan, rejection rate of cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, eggs by great reed warblers, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, was 61.5%. An analysis of host response to natural and experimental parasitism with real cuckoo eggs, cuckoo egg models and painted host eggs indicated that: (1) hosts are more likely to reject eggs that look different from their own; (2) almost all individuals (94%) can reject highly non-mimetic eggs, suggesting that there are few, if any, true accepter genotypes in the host population; (3) hosts usually reject by egg ejection; (4) during the host-laying period, the day of parasitism does not affect host response; (5) egg types that were rejected at lower rates also took longer to be rejected; (6) acceptance was more likely to occur among mid-season breeders which consist of a higher proportion of younger females in the host population. Two experiments indicated that previous exposure of a host to its own eggs affects its rejection behaviour, suggesting that a learning mechanism (an imprinting-like process) is involved. Parasitized nests from which the cuckoo egg was experimentally removed, or ejected by hosts, fledged more host young than nests in which the cuckoo egg was accepted. Hosts that deserted parasitized nests were likely to re-nest, and the success of re-nests was high. Costs due to breakage of host eggs occurred in only 3.5% of successful cuckoo egg ejections. a cost-benefit model of egg rejection suggests that under some circumstances, the cost of recognition errors may exceed that of parasitism. Egg variability within a clutch was higher among younger females. Some hosts rejected painted eggs and conspecific eggs based on differences that may occur naturally within variable clutches of other individuals. It is suggested that host egg variability is a major constraint on the learning mechanism of egg recognition. Accordingly, the cost of mistakenly rejecting an odd egg from the nest selects for greater tolerance towards divergent eggs in young breeders, and justifies a prolonged learning mechanism in which a host can learn to recognize the variation range of its own eggs. The co-existence of rejection and acceptance within the host population can therefore be explained as a compromise between the cost of parasitism and the cost of recognition errors, rather than as an evolutionary lag. This explanation is particularly pertinent where the cuckoo has evolved mimetic eggs and where the parasitism rate is low.

AB White stork, Ciconia ciconia, chicks were observed to abandon their natal nests prior to independence and to be adopted by neighbouring foster parents in approximately 40% of broods at three breeding colonies. Nest switching coincided with a decrease in feeding rates by parents and an increase in aggression by siblings triggered by the flight exercises of nestmates, and mainly affected the eldest chicks in larger broods. Chicks that abandoned their natal nests moved into broods containing both fewer and younger chicks, and thus experienced a decrease in aggression rate compared with their natal broods. Adopted chicks may also have increased their food intake as a consequence of nest switching. Resident chicks suffered from lower feeding rates during adoption and had lower mass increments than chicks in non-fostering broods of comparable age and size. Both adults and chicks were highly aggressive against trespassing chicks. The probability of aggression was a good predictor of the extent of fostering across different brood sizes, suggesting that defence by residents was effective at preventing adoption. Residents appeared not to recognize kin but were capable of aggressive discrimination against non-familiar chicks. Fostering behaviour in this species can be understood as the equilibrial outcome of an intraspecific 'co-evolutionary' arms race between kleptoparasitic chicks and fostering host adults with weak selection pressures for both parties.

AB The hypothesis that plasticity in honey bee, Apis mellifera, division of labour can be influenced by genotypic differences in worker behaviour was tested in colonies with electrophoretically distinct subfamilies. Undertaking behaviour (removal of dead bees from the nest) was studied because it is possible to vary the level of corpse-removal stimuli in a precise way. Subfamilies of workers with low thresholds of response to corpses were predicted to be overrepresented as undertakers relative to subfamilies with higher thresholds, and this difference was predicted to be reduced under higher stimulus conditions (more corpses). Allozyme analyses revealed that the genotypic composition of the undertaker group that responded to a low stimulus was significantly different from the composition of the whole colony. Contrary to predictions, the genotypic composition of the undertaker group that responded to a high stimulus was just as different from the composition of the whole colony. A second experiment examined the effects of undertaker depletion (about 2-3% of each colony's population): there were significant decreases in rates of corpse removal for several days following the removal of undertakers. These results suggest that strong genetic influences on the likelihood that an individual worker will perform a particular task, such as undertaking, may constrain a colony's ability to respond to changing conditions.

   BEHAVIOR
AB Two, not mutually exclusive, hypotheses for how female choice of males could explain male territory settlement patterns on leks have recently been proposed. First, the 'temporal spillover hypothesis assumes that females return to previously popular mating sites. If the previous owner of such a popular site disappears it will pay other males to defend such areas of the lek. Second, the spatial spillover hypothesis assumes that unsuccessful males gather around the most successful males to achieve copulations from females with which top males for some reason fail to mate. In the black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, there were no indications of temporal spillover between successive years. While individual males retained their popularity to some degree, there was no consistency in the popularity df the same locations per se. Instead, some spatial spillover is suggested by the fact that new territories in each season were established closer to the copulation centre than to the lek centre of the previous year. Furthermore, males close to the preferred males seemed to achieve copulations because of their proximity to such males. Successful males did not change their territorial position, but less preferred males tended to move closer to the lek centre filling the vacancies arising from any yearly mortality of males. While spatial spillover explains only a minor proportion of matings, most females choosing males independent of their site, it may be the only chance for poor quality males to obtain matings.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PYRROLIZIDINE ALKALOIDS; ITHOMIINE BUTTERFLIES; SPIDER PREDATOR
AB Defence of leaf beetles in the genus Oreina is chemically diverse. Some (e.g. O. gloriosa) rely on the secretion of small quantities of a concentrated mixture of cardenolides that are biosynthesized de novo and stored only in special glands. Others (e.g. O. cacaliae) lack cardenolides but sequester pyrrolizidine alkaloid N-oxides (PAs) and store them both in their body and in their glands. First, the impact of the defensive secretions on the palatability of the beetles to wild-caught red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, was tested. The reactions of the birds to these two different types of chemicals were then compared to determine whether they grant equal protection to the beetles. Oreina gloriosa, with their secretion of cardenolides intact, were eaten in 55% of the trials. When the secretion was physically removed, 95% of the now undefended O. gloriosa were eaten. The mean handling time by the birds also decreased from 41 to 26 s. This shows that the small quantity of highly concentrated secretion produced on the surface of the beetle's body affords substantial protection against avian predators. Oreina cacaliae, with PAs in their secretion and in their body, were eaten in only 21% of the cases. When the secretion was removed, leaving PA only in the body, the number eaten rose to 36%. The time to peck and then reject the beetles with their secretions intact was less in O. cacaliae than in O. gloriosa. PAs therefore seem to provide the beetle with better protection from the birds than do cardenolides. The experiment raised the possibility that the birds may have the ability to reject beetles with PAs olfactorily.

AB Sexual selection on male size and calling behaviour was studied for 2 years in one population and for 3 years in a second population of the Gulf Coast toad. A large-male mating advantage was detected only at one site during 1 year. Measures of calling behaviour were available for 3 years at one of the sites: on a nightly basis in 2 years, males with higher call rates were significantly more likely to mate than males with lower call rates. However, there was no relationship between mating success and either call duration or calling effort on a nightly bias in any year. In discrimination experiments, females preferred higher call rates and calls of longer duration, but not calls of lower frequency. Biased male mating success with respect to call rate therefore appears to have been partially a consequence of female mate choice. Call duration is positively correlated with male size, while dominant frequency is negatively correlated with male size in this species. Because females did not discriminate between high- and low-frequency calls, and because there was no bias in mating success with respect to call duration, it appears unlikely that female choice resulted in the large-male mating advantage observed in 1 year. Despite a nightly bias in mating success with respect to call rate that appears to have resulted from female mate choice, there was no detectable sexual selection an average call rate in any year. Instead, the number of nights of chorusing activity was the only detectable direct target of selection in all 3 years at one of the sites. The repeatability of call rate within males was low, ranging from 0.08 to 0.33. Simulations suggest that within-male variation in a trait can reduce the strength of sexual selection on the trait. Lack of selection on call rate, despite female choice based on call rate, may thus have been partially a consequence of within-male variation in this trait.

AB Willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus, possess red supra-orbital combs. If this secondary sexual structure is important in attracting mates or in male-male competition, then colour banding males with red or orange bands (RO) could influence their pairing and reproductive success, survival and the amount of aggression directed towards them. Males with RO bands did not have more mates than those without RO bands, nor did males unbanded in year x improve their pairing success in year x+1 when they were given RO bands. In a female removal experiment, males with RO bands did not have more females settling on their territories than males with other band colours. Number of chicks fledged from successful nests and annual survival did not differ for RO and non-RO males. Monogamous and polygynous males had similar comb areas, which were larger than the combs of unmated males. When pairing status was controlled, comb area was not related to annual survival or number of chicks fledged. Males with RO bands did not have larger combs than non-RO males. Area of comb was correlated with territory size in years of high breeding density, but not in years of low breeding density. Radiotagged non-territorial males did not preferentially intrude upon the territories of males with RO bands and song rates, number of border disputes, mean length of border disputes, and territorial intrusion rates did not differ significantly for RO and non-RO males. These results suggest that colour-banding willow ptarmigan with red colour bands does not have a negative or positive effect on reproductive success or survival, and thus the data do not support the coverable badge hypothesis.

AB Two-day-old chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, were tested in a detour situation requiring them to abandon a clear view of a desired goal (a small red object on which they had been imprinted) in order to achieve that goal. The chicks were placed in a dosed corridor, at one end of which was a barrier with a small window through which the goal was visible. Two symmetrical apertures placed midline to the corridor allowed the chicks to adopt routes passing around the barrier. After entering the apertures, chicks showed searching behaviour for the goal and appeared able to localize it, turning either right or left depending on their previous direction of turn. Thus, in the absence of any local orienting cues emanating from the goal, chicks were aware of the existence of an object that was no longer visible and could represent its spatial localization in egocentric coordinates.

AB Capybaras, Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris, live in groups of varying size averaging 10 adults of both sexes. Vigilant behaviour was studied in capybaras under natural conditions, using focal-animal sampling on individual females, dominant males and subordinate males from groups of different sizes. There was a significant negative correlation between group size and individual alert rate, and a positive correlation with total group alert rate. Although the reduction in individual rates of vigilance levelled off at group sizes of 9-10, total alert rate continued to increase. The behaviour of the females accounted for most of the variation in individual alert rate and the behaviour of subordinate males accounted for most of the variation in total alert rate. These results suggest that females benefit the most from being in larger groups due to reduced vigilance required, while subordinate males 'pay' for their group membership by the vigilance they perform.

AB Burying beetles, Nicrophorus defodiens, reproduce on vertebrate carcasses, and the number of beetles of either sex on a carcass is known to be highly variable. Field and laboratory studies were conducted to examine how sexual advertisement by males is affected by resource quality and number of mates, and to determine the reproductive output of males in different breeding associations. Carcass size had a strong influence on the reproductive benefits of polygyny to males, and on male sexual advertisement. In the field, polygynous groups produced more young and a greater brood mass than monogamous or polyandrous groups when using a large carcass (40-60 g). On a small carcass (15-18 g), however, no differences in reproductive output between the three breeding associations were found. In light of these findings, advertisement for mates was monitored when males were provided: (1) a small carcass and one female; (2) a large carcass and one female; and (3) a large carcass and four females. Most males that were paired with a female on a large carcass released pheromone even after copulating with the resident female. Pheromone emission was rare, however, in males that were paired with a single female on a small carcass, or in males that were given access to four females. Male N. defodiens thus assess both resource quality and number of mates when deciding whether to emit pheromone, and this decision appears to agree with the reproductive interests of males but not necessarily that of resident females.

TI TAIL FLAGGING BY YOUNG CALIFORNIA GROUND-SQUIRRELS,
   SPERMOPHILUS-BEECHEYI - AGE-SPECIFIC PARTICIPATION IN A TONIC
   COMMUNICATIVE SYSTEM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID ONTOGENY
AB This report describes a field study of tail flagging by young California ground squirrels, and compares their behaviour to that of adults. Focal and scan samples of marked animals were used to determine the context of signalling, and to establish the behavioural concomitants of flagging in the signaller and potential perceivers. Both pups and adults invariably use this signal when encountering a snake, but both tail flag more often when there is no obvious elicitor (Hersek & Owings 1993, Anim. Behav., 45, 129-138). When no snake was present, pups used tail flagging in tonic communication, as adults did. Although tail flagging by adult females was related to the vulnerability of pups, signalling by both adult males and pups reflected their own vulnerability. Tail flagging by adult males and pups differed, however, in its effects on perceivers. Adult males induced nearby animals to maintain higher levels of snake vigilance, while tail flagging by pups induced others to remain nearby. Pups distinguished more clearly between contexts of tail flagging than did adults. Both pups and adults tail flagged more frequently on days when snakes were on the site (than when snakes were absent), but this difference was greater for pups than for adults. Pups were also more likely than adults to pair tail flagging with calling while dealing directly with snakes (as contrasted with flagging when no snake was present). Overall, the differences between pups and adults appear to fit an age-specific interpretation of ontogeny. Pup use of tail flagging seems appropriate for their developmental stage, and does not simply reflect an incompletely developed signalling system.

DT Article
ID REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES; MUSCULUS; BEHAVIOR; YOUNG; INTRUDERS
AB This study investigated whether maternally aggressive female mice can discriminate between infanticidal and non-infanticidal males. The effect of maternal experience and of the presence or absence of pups on this discrimination were also tested, in a factorial design. Parental experience of the mothers did not influence their responses or those of the males. When pups were present, but not when they were absent, females were more likely to attack infanticidal males than non-infanticidal males.  Females were more likely to attack infanticidal males in the presence of pups than in the absence of pups but the reverse occurred with non-infanticidal males. When pups were present, females were more likely to adopt a defensive posture to non-infanticidal males than to infanticidal males. Infanticidal males were more likely to attack the female in the absence of pups than in their presence and this may be because females were less likely to attack them in the former situation. Female attack was initiated by the presence of the male not by his action towards the pups. These data indicate that females discriminate between males of the same reproductive status but of different infanticidal tendencies and respond according to the risk to their young.

The donor was placed into a group of six familiar and six unfamiliar workers of various degrees of relationship to the familiar bees. Unrestricted trophallaxis was allowed for 2 h. The amount of food transferred was photometrically determined. The majority of workers were able to discriminate between unfamiliar related and  unrelated workers and preferentially fed related workers. Donor workers of different patrilines of the same colony showed a significant variability for kin discrimination. A sibling analysis on workers of sister queens revealed a substantial additive genetic variance for this character (39% of total variance) which is higher than heritability estimates of characters related to fitness known for other organisms.

TI ALARM CALLING BY INDIVIDUAL WILLOW TITS, PARUS-MONTANUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Alarm responses of wild-captured individual willow tits to model sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, flying over a test chamber were studied. Tits did not usually give alarm calls if the apparent predator was passing nearby (at a height of 10 m), while over half of the individuals responded by alarm calling for a more distant predator (40 m). This suggests that alarm calling involves a risk to the caller. Second, there was individual variation in the responses, with older males giving the call more frequently than females or young males. The greater responsiveness of adult males may indicate that different individuals in a flock gain different benefits by warning the others. The tendency to give alarm calls increased over the autumn, which could be related to the establishment of cohesive flocks at that time.

TI THE ANALYSIS OF REPEATED LATENCY MEASURES IN BEHAVIORAL-STUDIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is concerned with the appropriate analysis of experiments in which latencies are recorded in repeated tests on a common set of subjects. The period of observation in each test is assumed to be limited to a fixed time, and the time of occurrence (if any) of the behaviour may be recorded either exactly or as falling in one of a number of intervals. A method is proposed for combining the information on each subject into a score which may be used to relate latency to other variables recorded on the subjects, or to compare different strains or the effect of different treatments. The presence of a trend in behaviour over the tests may also be investigated.

TI PRIOR-RESIDENCE AND COAT-TAIL EFFECTS IN DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIPS OF MALE
   DARK-EYED JUNCOS, JUNCO-HYEMALIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Captive male dark-eyed juncos from two different aviaries were combined either in one group''s original aviary (seven replicates) or in a third aviary (two replicates). These experiments controlled for effects of handling the subjects during transfers between aviaries and, in statistical analysis of the results, took into account constraints on the dominance relationships within combined groups. The results (1) confirmed the influence on dominance of prior residence in an aviary and (2) revealed a lack of independence in the dominance relationships between individuals from different original groups. This lack of independence probably resulted from an influence of dominant individuals on the relationships of their familiar subordinates, a ''coat-tail'' effect. (3) The results further indicated that previous experience with dominance or recognition of previous opponents outweighed the effect of prior residence. Consequently, prior residence might represent a last resort in the settlement of contests in this species, as predicted on theoretical grounds for the use of conventional asymmetries in the settlement of contests. The coat-tail effect, if it applies in the field, would create an advantage for subordinates associating with familiar dominants.

TI RESPONSES OF DOMESTIC CHICKS TO ARTIFICIALLY COLORED INSECT PREY -
   EFFECTS OF PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AND BACKGROUND COLOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, which had no previous experience of insect prey were given a choice between red- and brown-painted mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae) on differently coloured backgrounds and after different types of prior exposure to similar colours in their home cages. When prey were presented on a white background, naive chicks preferred brown to red mealworms. This preference was not affected by prefeeding the chicks on red rather than brown chick crumbs but was reversed by rearing the chicks in red cages. When chicks had been given no deliberate exposure to either red or brown in their home cages they preferred brown to red prey on both brown and red backgrounds; but chicks previously exposed to both colours in their home cages preferred red prey on a brown background and brown prey on a red background. The results suggest that the relative aversion of chicks to red prey is specific to that colour, rather than reflecting a general aversion to novel colours or to colours that contrast with the background.

TI SPRING MIGRATION AND DISPERSION OF WOODLAND CARIBOU AT CALVING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Each spring from 1975 to 1985, a small herd of caribou, Rangifer tarandus, migrated in April to the islands in Lake Nipigon, Ontario [Canada] where they remained for the summer. Three hypotheses for this migration were: (1) to reduce insect harassment, (2) to seek more abundant or nutritious forage, or (3) to reduce predation risk. The food and insect relief hypotheses were neither necessary nor sufficient explanations for the spring migration of the animals. Caribou used the shoreline of the two largest occupied islands even in the absence of insects. There was less green forage on the islands than on the winter range and the smaller islands were overgrazed. The dispersed nature of the population, the use of shorelines useful for escape, and the avoidance of islands travelled by wolves, Canis lupus, suggest that the migration of this herd was a spacing tactic to reduce predation risk. In other woodland caribou herds in North America, animals are also widely spaced in relatively safe habitats after spring migration, which suggests that migration and dispersion may be a common tactic to reduce predation risk especially for females and neonates.

TI SIGNALING SYSTEMS FOR INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION - AN INFORMATION-THEORY
   APPROACH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper develops a quantitative method for measuring the information capacity of an animal''s ''signature system'', i.e. the set of cues by which individuals are didentified. The information measure (Hs) is derived by applying Shannon''s measure for the information in a continuous variable to a simple linear model. The model is essentially the analysis of variance model II (random effects), and is implicit in the many ANOVAs and discriminant function analyses that have been done on the  signature systems of animals. For multivariate measurements, a principal components transformation of the data permits the information in the independent components to be added to give the total information. An analysis of illustrative data sets reveals a close correlation between Hs and the probability of a correct classification of an individual (P) obtained by discriminant function analysis. Hs has the advantage, however, that it is a population estimate whereas the value of P is tied to the number of individuals in the sample. The informaion analysis approach may prove valuable for comparative analyses where evolutionary hypotheses predict one species to have a better developed signature system than another.

TI STATUS SIGNALING IN DARK-EYED JUNCOS, JUNCO-HYEMALIS - PLUMAGE
   MANIPULATIONS AND HORMONAL CORRELATES OF DOMINANCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Status signalling in dark-eyed juncos was investigated by using plumage mainpulations and observing interactions within pairs of birds. Plumage manipulations included darkening of the hood and mantle and the addition of white tail feathers to mimic the appearance of adult males. Plumage characteristics predicted dominance relationships within pairs of first-year males when body size and prior residence in cages was controlled. These characteristics were also strong enough to reverse previously established intra-class relationships within pairs of first-year males and first-year and adult females. The results fail to support the incongruence hypothesis (Rohwer: Behaviour, 1977, 61, 107-129; Rohwer and Rohwer: Anim. Behav., 1978, 26, 1012-1022). In contrast to recent studies using exogenous testosterone to investigate dominance behaviour, circulating plasma levels of testosterone were measured and a comparison made between those of dominants and those of subordinates. Plasma levels  of corticosterone were also analysed as a measure of stress. No correlation between either hormone and dominance status was found. Hypotheses are proposed to explain the absence of a relationship between circulating levels of testosterone and winter aggression in flocking birds.

TI INTRASPECIFIC NEST PARASITISM AND EXTRA-PAIR COPULATION IN LESSER SNOW
   GEESE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Review
AB Intraspecifc nest parasitism and extra-pair fertilization contributed significantly to individual reproductive success in a colony of plumage polymorphic lesser snow geese, Chen caerulescens caerulescens, studied for 14 years in northern Manitoba, Canada. Parasitic females preferred to lay in or adjacent to occupied, defended nests, rather than undefended nests. Nesting females usually rolled eggs that had been laid nearby into their nests. Nest-attendant males typically attacked the intruding female''s mate, who usually remained at a short distance, thereby drawing the resident male away from the nest. Plumage genetics were used to estimate rates of both nest parasitism and extra-pair fertilization. Nests of homozygous dominant blue morph pairs produced 4.03% homozygous recessive white goslings (N = 4938), which must have been unrelated to both parents, providing information on the rate of nest parasitism. Nests of homozygous recessive white morph pairs produced 2.12% blue goslings (N = 45,777) which must have been unrelated to either one or both parents, providing information on the rate of nest parasitism plus extra-pair fertilization. Using colony-wide estimates of the colour ratio of goslings produced (28.5% blue) and of the blue allele frequency in males (21%), it was calculated that nest parasitism accounted for 5.6% of hatching goslings, and that 2.4% of goslings were fathered by extra-pair fertilization.

TI SEXUAL CANNIBALISM IN THE GARDEN SPIDER ARANEUS-DIADEMATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In natural populations, courting males of Araneus diadematus are often consumed by females before they have successfully copulated. Despite the possible nutritional benefits of sexual cannibalism for females, the male can derive no benefit by being consumed before copulation. In this study, females that consumed a single male significantly increased their body mass, regardless of the quality of their diet. The implication is that, for A. diadematus, sexual cannibalism increases female  fecundity. In experimentally controlled courtship sequences, larger males were less likely to be cannibalized than smaller males, but female size had no effect on male mating success. The mating success of males was not influenced by the age of the male, indicating the cannibalism is not the result of male senility.

TI THE CONTROL OF MEAL TERMINATION IN THE LOCUST
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relationship between the amount eaten during a meal, meal duration and ingestion rate was investigated in the locust, Locusta migratoria (L.). The results suggested a relatively simple model for the control of meal termination whereby a variety of exogenous and endogenous factors, including chemosensory stimuli provided by the food, the presence of other locusts nearby, age and deprivation-related factors, are integrated within the central nervous system and together contribute to the  level of excitation present at the start of a meal. The amount of excitation determines both the mean rate of ingestion during the meal and the amount of inhibition needed to end the meal. Since much of the inhibitory feedback comes from gut stretch, meal size and mean ingestion rate are positively correlated, in fact increasing proportionally, and, hence, meal duration remains constant. At high levels of excitation, however, ingestion becomes rate limited and meal duration subsequently increases proportionally with meal size. Changes in the rate of ingestion throughout a meal were also investigated. The rate declined exponentially but, unlike in the rat, the initial ingestion rate remained constant with changes in excitation and the decay function varied such that small meals began at the same ingestion rate as large meals but the rate of decline was subsequently faster.

TI INTERSPECIFIC ACOUSTIC INTERACTIONS AMONG KATYDIDS NEOCONOCEPHALUS -
   INHIBITION-INDUCED SHIFTS IN DIEL PERIODICITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of the katydid Neoconocephalus spiza stridulate in a loud, chirping manner, but they are inhibited from singing during the uninterrupted songs of three sympatric congeners. Playback experiments using natural and synthetic stimuli showed that inhibition can be caused by any continuous or rapidly pulsing sound presented at an intensity greater than 40 dB sound pressure level and from 8 to 16 kHz in frequency, the approximate spectral range of the N. spiza chirps and the continuous songs of the congeneric species. In specific habitats where inhibiting species are absent, N. spiza sings primarily at night, but diurnal singing prevails where the inhibitors, all nocturnal, are found. Removal of the inhibiting species in a field experiment resulted in a rapid shift of the periodicity of N. spiza signalling from diurnal to nocturnal. This is the first reported case of a reversal in diel periodicity of singing caused by signal interference. It is argued that in a noisy environment, long-term temporal adjustments may be the most effective means of avoiding the problem of acoustic interference.

TI INCUBATION FEEDING AS A MALE TACTIC FOR EARLY HATCHING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male marsh tits, Parus palustris, regulary feed their mates from the beginning of nest building until hatching. Over three periods (the 15 days preceding egg formation, egg formation/laying and incubation) the number of food passes by the male to the female increased significantly. There was a significant negative relationship between the frequency with which the male fed the female in the nest during incubation and the length of the incubation period. Female blue tits, Parus caeruleus, experimentally supplied with food in the nestbox during incubation had a significantly shorter incubation period than control females. Clutches of experimentally fed females also tended to hatch more successfully. It is concluded that feeding of the female by the male is a nutritional contribution and that the shorter incubation period and increased hatching success enhance the fitness of both parents. However, the male should balance the benefits against the costs in time and energy and  therefore not necessarily work at a maximal level. In accordance with this is the finding that the male''s provisioning rate increased when ambient temperatures decreased. Adverse weather may jeopardize the whole or large proportions of the clutch, thereby significantly reducing the benefit from the current breeding attempt.

TI MECHANISMS OF AVIAN EGG RECOGNITION - ADAPTIVE RESPONSES TO EGGS WITH
   BROKEN SHELLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Avian eggs may be broken when winds jar nests and by other disturbances. The presence of broken eggs can threaten the survival of remaining intact eggs, but possible behavioural responses to this selection pressure have received little attention, especially in passerines. Experiments with both real and artificial eggs demonstrated that red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, eject eggs that simulate broken eggs despite the fact that this accepter species does not eject non-mimetic eggs of the brood parasitic brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater. The artificial and real egg experiments showed that an egg with a shell fragment pointed up elicited more rejections than an egg with a shell fragment flat against the shell. Experiments with artificial eggs showed that redwings used visual and possibly tactile perception to differentiate between eggs. Rejection of broken eggs declined abruptly on the day before hatching, as shown by experiments with real eggs conducted throughout the  incubation period. Such a decline was predicted since it would be maladaptive for birds to reject their own pipped, and therefore ''broken'', eggs. Experiments with three other accepter species, as well as anecdotal observations of other species, suggested that ejection of broken eggs is widespread in passerines, which was an a priori prediction. However, the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, and black phoebe, Sayornis nigricans, which nest on unmovable substrates (caves, bridges, etc.), may lack responses to broken eggs. These species probably experience little egg breakage because their nests are relatively well protected.

TI TRACKING A FLUCTUATING ENVIRONMENT - A STUDY OF SAMPLING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The problem of how animals keep track of unpredictable changes in the profitability of foraging sites was studied. An optimality model was used to predict the frequency with which a forager should sample a foraging site in which the probability of reward fluctuates randomly between high and low. The alternative foraging site is stable and offers an intermediate probability of reward. The model was tested with pigeons in a shuttle-box the two ends of which represented the two foraging sites. The  pigeons succeeded in tracking the changes in the fluctuating site and the payoff attained was close to the optimum. Variations in the frequency of sampling between experimental treatments were in qualitative agreement with the model for some treatments but not others. The quantitative details of sampling behaviour were not as predicted by the optimality model, but many features could be accounted for by a mechanistic model of choice. The pigeons'' choice rule, although different from that of the optimality model, is one that produces near-optimal payoffs under the conditions of this experiment.

TI BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES OF LAYING HENS FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF SPATIAL
   RESTRICTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six laying hens were housed singly in small cages (area 847 cm2) and six were housed singly in large cages (2310 cm2) for a period of 4 weeks. Many significant differences were found between the behaviour of the birds in the two groups. In addition, the frequency of performance of some activities, e.g. wing stretching and preening, over the 4 weeks declined in both groups, although these were most pronounced for the hens in small cages. After this period in the home cages the birds were  observed simultaneously, as matched pairs, in a pair of large test cages (2310 cm2). Wing stretching, feather raising, tail wagging, leg stretching and wing flapping performed at a low frequency in the small home cages, were performed at a high frequency ''rebound'' rate in the test cages. When the experiment was replicated, this rebound was even more pronounced for birds that had undergone a second period of 4 weeks in the small home cages. In contrast to the gradual decline in activity  performance observed in the home cages, this rebound was virtually instantaneous. The possibilities are discussed that this rebound may result either from an increase in motivational tendency during the period of spatial restriction or from a response to an increase in novelty.

TI CONFLICT OF CHOICE WITHIN PAIRS OF BEWICKS SWANS REGARDING THEIR
   MIGRATORY MOVEMENT TO AND FROM WINTERING GROUNDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The migratory Bewick''s swan Cygmus columbianus bewickii is highly traditional: the same individuals may return to a favourable wintering site over many years. A conflict of allegiance is likely to arise, therefore, upon mating or remating (believed to occur in spring) as the new mate will usually have formed an attachment to a different wintering area. A study of the dispersal of ringed birds in the wintering range demonstrated that males predominated in determining the wintering site for  the new pair. Males also maintained their normal time of arrival in the wintering grounds when accompanied by a new mate, whilst females did not show such consistency. Evidence from the pre-flight behaviour in pairs of swans confirmed that males tended to lead the movements of the pair in autumn, but a shift of responsibility within the pair-bond was noted as the winter progressed, and flight initiation by the female proved more common after 1 January. This accords with observations in other  species of waterfowl, which have shown that females dominate in movements to the breeding grounds.

TI COSTLINESS AND RELIABILITY IN THE SINGING VIGOR OF IPSWICH SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The aim of this study was to see whether song rate provides reliable information about a male''s energetic condition in Ipswich sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis princeps. Singing and foraging were mutually exclusive and, in the morning (when males sang most), singers foraged less than non-singers. Morning was a profitable time to feed, so that singing in the morning entailed a cost. This cost was reflected in the effect of energetic stress on song rate; after cold nights, males weighed less and sang less. Providing extra food both increased song rate and decreased foraging. Therefore, song rate was energy-limited, and so provided reliable information about a male''s energetic condition. However, this reliability was reduced in warmer weather, such as at midday and in midsummer, and in an unusually mild year.

TI TRACKING VARYING ENVIRONMENTS - SAMPLING BY HUMMINGBIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Predictions from a model of how foragers might track changes in profitability of food types or foraging sites were tested in a laboratory experiment, using rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus. The birds were presented with two feeders, one constant and one varying. The varying feeder switched between a good and a bad state; how soon a bird maximizing its net rate of energy intake should visit the varying feeder after finding it bad depended both on the probability of the varying feeder  switching and on the value of its two states relative to the constant feeder. The experiment yielded limited qualitative support for the tracking model, but the quantitative predictions failed. As predicted, the hummingbirds sampled with low frequency when the probability of switch was low, and sampled more frequently when the probability of switch was higher. However, none of four birds avoided the varying feeder when low mean amount and low predictability made it so unprofitable relative to  the constant alternative that a rate maximizer should not have visited it at all.

TI CASTRATION AFFECTS TERRITORIAL AND SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR OF FREE-LIVING MALE
   LIZARDS, SCELOPORUS-JARROVI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Most of our knowledge of the importance of hormones in regulating behaviour comes from experiments conducted under laboratory conditions where the effects of non-hormonal cues in the social and physical environment have been intentionally minimized. The present study examined the effects of castration in free-living male mountain spiny lizards, Sceloporus jarrovi, that remained on their natural territories where the full complement of non-hormonal cues from the social and physical environment was present. Castration reduced dramatically, but did not abolish, territorial and sexual behaviour of experimental males when compared to sham-operated controls. These results emphasize the importance of hormonal cues in regulating the behaviour of experienced adult animals subjected to the entire spectrum of cues from their natural social and physical environment. Certain behaviours, however, such as occupation of territories, were relatively unaffected by castration. This suggests that, in some cases, non-hormonal cues can either override or substitute for hormonal cues when the latter are removed.

TI THE IMPORTANCE OF SPECTRAL AND TEMPORAL PROPERTIES IN SPECIES AND CALL
   RECOGNITION IN A NEOTROPICAL TREEFROG WITH A COMPLEX VOCAL REPERTOIRE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hyla microcephala males use both single and multi-note advertisement and aggressive calls. Aggressive call introductory notes are more variable and have higher pulse repetition rates than those of advertisement calls. In two-choice experiments, female H. microcephala preferred synthetic conspecific advertisement calls to synthetic calls with pulse repetition rates characteristic of H. ebraccata and H. phlebodes advertisement calls and conspecific aggressive calls. Additional experiments  indicated that spectral cues are also sufficient for species discrimination, but temporal information may be more important. Secondary notes of both advertisement and aggressive calls have pulse repetition rates similar to primary notes of advertisement calls. During vocal interactions, males add secondary notes to both advertisement and aggressive calls, and females preferred such complex calls to single-note calls. Hence, males can continue to give calls which will attract females even during  aggressive interactions.

TI THE SEXY SON HYPOTHESIS - DATA FROM THE PIED FLYCATCHER
   FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sexy son hypothesis has been proposed as a possible explanation for polygyny in territorial birds. Females mated with polygynous males are assumed to derive benefits in future generations through their ''sexy'' sons, and hence they can afford to produce fewer offspring than simultaneously breeding monogamous females, the polygyny threshold thus being reduced. In the pied flycatcher, secondary females are not fully aided by males in feeding the nestlings, and they produce only 65% as many  fledglings as do simultaneous monogamous and primary females. We have proposed male deception through polyterritoriality as the explanation for females ending up as secondary females, while some authors have advocated the sexy son hypothesis as an alternative. However, secondary females do not achieve benefits in future generations in this species. Repeatability of male mating status is far too low to grant any significant benefits through grandsons. In fact, offspring hatched in secondary  female nests suffer from food shortage and therefore are of poor phenotypic quality with low fledging weight and short tarsus length. Therefore they are likely to enjoy lower reproductive success than offspring born in monogamous nests, as is illustrated by data on the relation between lifetime reproductive success and tarsus length. Altogether the applicability of the sexy son hypothesis is limited since it is based on the unrealistic assumption of relatively high heritability for a character  with great influence on male fitness.

AB The bowl-and-doily spider, Frontinella pyramitela, is a common inhabitant of low vegetation throughout most of temperate North America. All instars build concave-upward, bowl-shaped, nonviscid webs supported above and below by meshworks of silk. Previous studies of this species have revealed that chemical(s) on the silk of adult females elicit both courtship behaviour and positive geotaxis from adult males that contact the silk. This study demonstrates (1) that two different contact pheromones are responsible for the dual action of the silk of adult females and (2) that the webs of different age and sex classes of bowl-and-doily spiders (including the webs of adult males) contain fuctionally different mixtures of the two pheromones.

DT Article
AB Male domestic chickens produce ''food calls'', when they are presented with food. Experiments, conducted under controlled conditions, on the responses of cockerels to the presentation of various foods in the presence of a hen indicate that the rates and numbers of foods calls vary with the preference ranking of the food. A hen is more likely to approach a male when he is calling than when he is silent. The probability of a hen approaching is greater when the male is calling to a highly preferred food than to a low-preference food. We conclude that male food calling communicates information about food quality to a female chicken, the signal receiver.

AB An experiment was designed to investigate whether guarding females of the cichlid Aequidens coeruleopunctatus adjust their parental behavior in response to changes in brood size. Females were easier to scare away from their broods when threatened, and stayed away for longer, after some of their fry had been removed, and the reverse occurred when broods were experimentally augmented with foreign fry. Brood size manipulations change the expected benefits of future investment. Parental care strategies in A. coeruleopunctatus reflect future prospects for reproductive success rather than past investment.

AB The title of Darwin''s book implies that emotional behavior is a direct expression of a relatively simple internal state. However data from both animals and humans indicate that neither emotional states nor emotional behavior can be considered independently of the factors that give rise to them, and may involve complex affective-cognitive interactions. Such expression of emotion often involves processes of negotiation between 2 or more individuals. An attempt to grasp the nettle of the  difficulty of defining emotion may aid understanding of the processes involved, and facilitate liaison between studies of signal movements in animals and human emotions.

AB Two previous studies found that simulating aspects of early weaning, starting 5 wk after birth, increased the frequency of object play and, to a lesser extent, social play in kittens. The present study further investigated this finding, using the lactation-suppressing drug bromocriptine to simulate a component of early weaning (a reduction in maternal milk production). The experimental manipulation was started a week earlier in ontogeny than in the previous studies. The subjects were 14 litters of domestic kittens (Felis catus), living with their mothers in large indoor pens. Each litter consisted of 2 kittens. Seven Experimental (E) mothers were injected with bromocriptine on the 28th, 30th and 33rd days after their kittens were born. Seven Control (C) mothers were injected with saline. Observations of the kittens'' social play, object play and locomotor play were carried out in each 3-day period from 36 to 60 days after birth. The kittens showed significantly higher frequencies of a social play measure (Cat Contact) than the C kittens. However, object play was not significantly affected by the manipulation, in contrast to the previous studies. The E kittens also scored higher on a measure of locomotor play and fell off a climbing frame more often than the C kittens. E mothers played less then C mothers. Absolute frequencies of Cat Contacts and Object Contacts were higher in the present study than those previosly reported.

TI MATING-BEHAVIOR OF MALE ORANGUTANS IN THE KUTAI GAME RESERVE, INDONESIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mating behavior of male orangutans was investigated during a 16-mo. field study at the Kutai Game Reserve, Indonesia. Males competed for access to mates during interactions involving females. The highest-ranking male in the study population consistently displaced lower-ranking adult and subadult males when females were present. Adult males regularly supplanted subadults during similar interactions. Both adult and subadult males forcibly copulated with females. Subadult males, however, achieved more matings than adult males by copulating frequently during prolonged associations with females. Adult males mated with a few females within a defined area, or searched for mating opportunities with more females over larger regions. In this and other studies, individual male reproductive success could not be determined, and therefore remains a critical area for future research.

TI DYED BIRDS ACHIEVE HIGHER SOCIAL-STATUS THAN CONTROLS IN HARRIS SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The status-signalling hypothesis has been proposed to explain color variation among individuals in flocking birds. Its fundamental assumption is that color may affect the determination of an individual''s social rank in a flock. Here I show for winter Harris'' sparrows (Zonotrichia querula) that birds dyed to resemble adults dominate control birds within experimental flocks of young males and young females. The domination of controls by the dyed birds was achieved by a two-step process in both experiments: immediately after the two groups were combined, the controls avoided the dyed birds; then, shortly thereafter, the dyed birds began actively to displace the control birds.

TI BROOD-DIRECTED PARENTAL AGGRESSION AND EARLY BROOD LOSS IN THE
   CORAL-REEF FISH, ACANTHOCHROMIS-POLYACANTHUS (POMACENTRIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Brood-directed parental aggression, in which parents attack and even kill their own young, is described for the coral reef fish Acanthochromis polyacanthus. This behavior involves both parents, occurs on days 7-16 post-hatching, and is characteristic of all broods early in the spawning season. Such parental aggression appears to underlie widespread early brood loss in the species, i.e. disappearance of young before they reach an age at which they are viable in the absence of parental defence.  Simultaneously, there is also a high frequency of sudden increases in the sizes of some tended broods. The data suggest that some brood-tending parents are forcibly expelling their broods from parental territories, and fostering them on to adults still tending broods. By expelling their young and re-spawning, pairs may realize a 7% increase in annual fecundity over pairs that do not expel their young, despite a low survival rate of expelled young.

TI A DECLARATION OF INTENT IN THE KITTIWAKE GULL (RISSA-TRIDACTYLA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB During the breeding seasons 1979-1982 observations were made of the vocal behavior of the kittiwake gull (Rissa tridactyla). Attention was directed at the vocal behavior emitted immediately preceding a bird''s departure from the nest and partner. The data indicate that the kittiwake consistently makes only one type of vocalization (the Pre-departure Call) prior to departure and that the behavior communicates intention to leave nest and partner. An analysis of the behavioral interactions  reveals that the Pre-departure Call given by one bird elicits 5 different categories of response in the other. The data reveal that consequent partner behavior either sanctioned or prevented absence.

TI ON LACTATION AND ASSOCIATED BEHAVIOR IN A NATURAL HERD OF HORSES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Developmental changes in time spent suckling and related mother-foal behavior are described in an unmanaged herd of Camargue horses. Male foals spent about 40% more time suckling than females during the first 8 wk. Body weight did not differ between the sexes but time-budgets did: males grazed less and were more active. If pregnant, the typical multiparous mare nursed her foals for 35-40 wk, males and females alike, and weaned them 15 wk before the next foaling. Primiparae lactated longer and weaned closer to the next foaling by 5 wk. The mares played an active role in regulating the time spent suckling in early, and particularly in late lactation.

AB The potential importance of observational learning has been discussed for many orders of animals, but experimental evidence of this phenomenon in undomesticated mammals other than primates is rare. In this study 3 spp. of insectivorous vespertilionid bats (Myotis lucifugus, Eptesicus fuscus and Antrozous pallidus) acquired a novel feeding behavior through interaction with a knowledgeable conspecific or a bat of another species. The response was not acquired through trial-and-error learning and conditioning the response took significantly longer than acquisition by observing another bat.

DT Article
AB Predation risk from fish and bird predators was assessed at 7 Scottish [UK] G. L. sites. Samples of adult male and female sticklebacks and fry from each site were tested with either a model heron or a live pike to measure anti-predator responses. Principal Component Analyses were then used to describe the responses, the 1st factor to emerge from each multivariate analysis providing an index of overall level of response toward the predator. Significant sexual and inter-population differences in behavior are described. Sticklebacks from populations at high risk from either predatory fish or birds showed higher fright response scores than fish from low risk sites. In general, adult male sticklebacks are bolder than adult females during interactions with predators.

TI HILLTOP TERRITORIALITY IN A SONORAN DESERT BOT FLY (DIPTERA,
   CUTEREBRIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of an undescribed species of Cuterebra bot fly defend territories along ridge tops in the Sonoran desert of central Arizona [USA]. The most consistently occupied site, an 18 m2 territory at the peak of a ridge, was usually defended by a single male for the entire (2-2.5 h) flight period of the morning. An average of 5 other males visited the peaktop territory each day from mid-Feb. to early June and engaged in chases with the resident before departing. The resident male was very likely to return the next day but was generally ousted by a successful usurper on this or the 3rd day of his tenure. The behavior of males of this species of Cuterebra resembles that of several other members of the genus, especially C. latifrons. The landmark-based territoriality of these flies is similar to lek territoriality as defined from mammalian and avian examples.

TI SOCIAL TRANSMISSION OF FOOD-PREFERENCES IN ADULT-RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three experiments were carried out to investigate the social transmission of food-related information in adult rats. Experiment 1 showed that when 1 member of a group of rats (the leader rat) was exposed to a novel artificially-flavored food, a preference for that food developed in other members of the group (follower rats), despite the fact that they themselves had not had direct access to the food source. Experiment 2 showed that development of a preference in follower rats was only partly abolished by washing the leader rat after it had been exposed to the novel food. A preference developed in follower rats if a novel food odor was presented on a cotton swab in the home cage or if the odor was painted onto the body of the leader rat. Experiment 3 showed that when the leader rat was allowed to eat food bearing one odor, while a different odor was presented in the home cage, follower rats subsequently showed enhanced consumption of food bearing both odors. Behavior of rats towards a new food source can be influenced by particles of food adhering to a conspecific''s pelage; by food odors transmitted by a conspecific in some other way, such as through the feces; and by simple exposure to a novel odor not directly associated with food. The most likely mechanism underlying these effects is that experience of an odor reduces the rat''s neophobia towards any object (including food) contaminated with that odor.

AB Within a honey bee (A. mellifera) colony there are individuals who specialize in the removal of the dead (necrophoresis). Necrophoric behavior is an essential adaptation to social life in enclosed nests and the rapidity of corpse removal distinguishes it from general nest-cleaning behavior. Worker bees probably use chemical cues appearing very rapidly after the death of a bee to recognize a corpse: thoroughly extracted or paraffin-coated bees are removed slowly. The bees specializing in  necrophoric behavior comprise 1-2% of the colony population.

AB Two series of aviary experiments with white-crowned sparrows (Z. leucophrys) are reported. The 1st series attempts to mimic foraging choices between microhabitats. The 2nd series examines foraging choices made within a single artificial patch, a design intended to resemble dietary selection. In all experiments subjects chose between a constant food reward and a variable reward, the mean of which equaled the constant reward. Each experiment allowed the bird to feed at an overall rate greater than that minimally required for daily energy balance. In both series of experiments, the birds usually preferred the constant reward. Results of the 1st series do not differ significantly from previously reported preferences of dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), birds weighing 10 g less than the white-crowned sparrows.

AB The effects of air temperature on some spatial and temporal subcomponents of the male wave display were investigated under laboratory conditions in the fiddler crabs, U. minax and U. pugnax. Also investigated were the stereotypies of these subcomponents. In general, wave duration, ascending and descending wave times decreased significantly with increasing air temperatures between 13 and 26.degree. C. These decreases were generally not significant at air temperatures greater than 26 and 30.degree. C. Wave frequency and the number of cheliped jerks (U. minax) increased with temperature; the interwave time showed no systematic change with temperature. U. pugnax had waves with discrete cheliped jerks at temperatures less than 20.degree. C; the wave appeared relatively smooth at higher temperatures. Temperature effects on waving varied between species and among behavioral contexts. Stereotypies of the wave subcomponents, as measured by the coefficient of variation, underwent no systematic change with temperature, but stereotypies were different within and between species. Behavioral context also had an effect on subcomponent stereotypy. Comparisons of stereotypies yielded predictions concerning communication functions of waving subcomponents.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Headbob displays play an important role in the social behavior of male green iguanas (I. iguana). Four types of headbobs were identified, and the variability in form and context were determined from quantitative analyses of displays filmed in the field. The Roll is a conspicuous advertisement display. The Shudder, the most variable in form, occurred during close contact between males and females. The Roll-shudder is intermediate between the Roll and Shudder in its form and use. The Signature Bob, the most stereotyped display in form, punctuates much activity and is the most variable in contextual use. This display encodes species identity, and possibly individual identity. The conspicuous nature of the headbob displays was enhanced by the intensified color of territorial males, and by the selection of highly visible display posts. This system of visual displays is viewed as the product of related sets of constraints, including the iguanas'' physical capacities, the forest environment, and the social environment.

AB To examine the concept of female courtship summation in D. melanogaster, 2 experiments previously reported in the literature, the first involving repeated matings of females and the 2nd progressive removal of the males'' wings, were repeated. The present results do not convincingly support the concept of female summation of stimuli provided by the males'' courtship. The results of the 1st experiment also refute the idea that low male courtship intensity leads to long courtships. These results also fail to support an earlier suggestion that females summate the sine rather than pulse song component of the males'' wing vibration. Instead, the variation in courtship duration appeared to result from the inverse hyperbolic relationship between the male latency to courtship and the subsequent courtship duration. Thus short males latencies led to longer courtship durations. This is interpreted as resulting from a female latency period during which the female is too agitated to receive the male''s courtship, and after which she mates upon recognizing the male as conspecific. Very long courtships largely resulted from additional agitation of the female by the male''s courtship. Long courtships thus appear to be an artifact of the experimental situation and the established concept of female courtship summation, which is supposed to explain them, is unnecessary. The implications of this conclusion are discussed.

TI EVASIVE BEHAVIOR OF A FROG IN RESPONSE TO BAT PREDATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Chorusing frogs (P. pustulosus) visually detect hunting bats (T. cirrhosus) and models of T. cirrhosus on all but the darkest nights. Detection is apparently communicated rapidly, since all frogs in the area can quit calling within less than a second of a T. cirrhosus arrival at the pond. P. pustulosus choruses remain silent longer following trials when a T. cirrhosus model is passed overhead than following normal shutdowns or those caused by a model of a small insectivorous bat. They often do not reduce calling in response to the normal activities of small bats.

TI DISRUPTION OF IMPRINTING BY MEMORY INHIBITORS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Several amnestic drugs were administered intracranially to day-old chicks at selected times around a 10 min exposure to an imprinting stimulus. The drugs used were monosodium glutamate, ouabain, cycloheximide and amino-iso-butyrate. The chicks were tested for 10 min in the same apparatus 2 days later and the time spent following the stimulus was recorded. The index of memory retention was the difference between the time spent following on test and the time spent following on the initial exposure. When compared with saline-injected controls, glutamate administered 5 min before the beginning of the initial exposure was effective in producing a reduction in following times and hence amnesia. Ouabain was effective when injected before the beginning and immediately after the end of the initial exposure; while cycloheximide was effective when administered as late as 5 min after the initial exposure. The effective times of administration for the drugs to produce a reduction in following times were similar to that observed for amnesia in passive avoidance memory tasks. The increase in following shown by the control chicks was not a development effect due to the increase in age on test. Experiments involving a choice of stimuli on test support the involvement of a memory-related phenomenon in these experiments.

TI FEEDING STRATEGIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOOD RECOGNITION IN YOUNG
   CHICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Young chicks were observed in a series of 10 min tests in which a dish of food and a dish of sand were simultaneously available. Most chicks learned to ingest primarily food, but all chicks continued to ingest at least some sand. The pattern of ingestion varied widely among individuals. The relative increase in food ingestion probably was due to an appetite for food that developed as a result of an association between the visual and the tactile/gustatory stimuli from the food and the positive long-term after-effects of food ingestion. Sand remained an attractive particle. Evidence is given for a number of short-term motivational factors: positive feedback from stimuli from the mouth, short-term after-effects of food ingestion and a mechanism for switching attention. These motivational factors determine a pattern of sampling behavior that ensures that chicks continue to ingest different types of particles and sets up the conditions necessary for the development of an appetite for particular particles.

TI A DESCRIPTION OF RELATIONAL PATTERNS OF MOVEMENT DURING RITUALIZED
   FIGHTING IN WOLVES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Schenkel (1947, 1967) was the 1st to describe ritualized fighting in wolves. A set of movement patterns employed during such interactions is identified. The relations between the interactants movements and the contribution of each individual to these relations are emphasized. Three relational variables are employed to describe interactions: relative distance, relative orientation and the points of opposition between the interactants. These variables in combination form a 3-dimensional interaction space in which a single point describes the momentary state of the configuration of the wolves. The maintenance of 4 relative configurations plus 5 transitions between such configurations comprised a consistent set of behavioral patterns. These regular patterns of relational movements indicate that each interactant''s movements are constrained in part by a set of rules related to the simultaneous movements of the social partner. The description of the actual movements in the environment by the individual interactants revealed role-dependent individual contributions by the 2 interactants to the coordination and management of the relational variables.

TI INFERRING KINSHIP FROM BEHAVIOR - MATERNITY DETERMINATIONS IN YELLOW
   BABOONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Kinship is commonly inferred from behavior in primate field studies, but the validity of such inferences has not been documented. A comparison of the relationships of six 3 yr old yellow baboon (P. cynocephalus) females with 14 adult females showed that when a juvenile''s mother was living she could easily be identified from behavioral data. The most useful behavior in this context was Presenting For Grooming. When the mother was not living, the juvenile compensated by forming a strong relationship with a less closely related or unrelated adult female. If compensation also occurs in other populations and other species, past attempts to infer kinship from behavior have probably included a few cases in which a female was incorrectly identified as a juvenile''s mother. Multivariate statistical techniques revealed differences between mother-daughter relationships and strong relationships based on compensation among other individuals. These differences involved comparisons of the frequencies of certain behaviors (frequency of Grooming by adult vs. frequency of Grooming by juvenile, frequency of Grooming vs. frequency of aggression) as well as the magnitudes of frequencies (amount of Grooming, number of Interventions).

AB Variation in reproductive success among adult red deer stags was related to harem size and the duration and timing of breeding access. All 3 factors were affected by dominance (fighting success) during the rut. The number of hinds using a stag''s rutting area and the duration of individual rutting activity also affected breeding access. Dominance rank in bachelor herds, which may affect access to hinds conceiving after the rut, was correlated with rank in the preceding but not the following rut.

TI A QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE BEHAVIOR OF WILD JUVENILE PLAICE
   (PLEURONECTES-PLATESSA L)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior of young plaice (P. platessa L.) as they migrate up and down sandy beaches [in Scotland, UK] with the tide is described. Their behavior during this migration consists mainly of swimming and feeding interspersed with rarer behavioral acts. Over short periods swimming behavior can be described by a random model in which the probability of a swim occurring remains constant. This probability varies markedly from hour to hour. Two types of swimming movement are recognized: one of very short duration represents searching for food; the other, of longer duration, serves to transport the fish up and down the shore. Variations in the feeding rate and in the frequency, duration and direction of swimming movements over the tidal cycle are described, behavior being related to the changing physical and biological conditions that the fish experience during their intertidal movements.

AB Two experiments were conducted with lemmings to determine which of 2 spp., Lemmus trimucronatus and Dicrostonyx groenlandicus, was capable of exercising aggressive social dominance over the other in staged, dyadic encounters, and which was able to outcompete the other for a single shelter. Agonistic behavior occurred in all dyadic encounters, but dominance was not established by either species. A sequential analysis of encounters revealed that each species had a distinct fighting strategy. In shelter competition, prior residence was a crucial factor in the outcome. One species did not completely exclude the other. Further evidence to support species differences in fighting strategies was derived from the shelter experiments. Ecological considerations are discussed.

TI PATTERNS OF FEEDING IN THE DOMESTIC CHICK .2. OPERANT SITUATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Data are presented on the patterning of meals in chicks in an operant situation requiring key pecks for continued access to food during the course of a meal. As the operant requirement is made more difficult, meal size decreases, rather than increasing as in the rat. Patterns of pecking within a meal reveal no evidence for positive feedback operating over the first few bouts of a meal as seen in mice. A hypothesis is presented that explains both the increase in meal size with increasing operant requirement seen in the rat and the absence of such an effect in the chick. Further predictions of this hypothesis are outlined. A brief discussion of functional implications in relation to search patterns is given.

TI SEASONAL-CHANGES IN THE SOCIAL-STRUCTURE OF A MOTTLED SCULPIN
   (COTTUS-BAIRDI) POPULATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Adult male mottled sculpins (C. bairdi) were solitary during the breeding season (April-June) and the following summer. Gravid females were randomly distributed with respect to one another, but were most frequently found with males that had previously mated. In addition, the number of egg masses found at certain sites was far greater than expected on the basis of chance matings. These patterns suggest that females visited several spawning sites before breeding, and that certain sites or males were more attractive than others. Although unsexable individuals were randomly dispersed they were rarely found at sites occupied by adult males. This pattern may reflect the influence of intraspecific predation of larger sculpins on smaller conspecifics.

AB The marginal value theorem of Charnov is extended to a simple model covering the case of mammalian carnivores hunting underwater, in which situation their total search time and pursuit effort is constrained by the limited O2 capacity of their lungs. In the mink M. vison hunting rudd in an experimental tank the duration of dives, of giving-up times, of the pursuit phase of underwater hunts and the frequency of dives were consistent with the usual marginal value predictions. Giving-up times were also essentially constant within bouts, as expected. An interaction between foraging economics and O2 reserves derived from the extended model was confirmed experimentally.

TI FORAGING AND REINFORCEMENT SCHEDULES IN THE PIGEON - OPTIMAL AND
   NON-OPTIMAL ASPECTS OF CHOICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pigeons were trained in Skinner box on a reinforcement schedule that simulated a foraging situation. Pecks on a central key occasionally illuminated a side key which, if pecked, led to food reward after a delay that varied with the side key color. Reward durations, post-reward detention intervals, the probability of occurrence of the 2 side-key colors, and the time between side-key illuminations were all varied between conditions. The schedule allowed the pigeons to accept or reject any reward. They always accepted the side-key color associated with less pre-reward delay, but accepted the other color with a probability that varied between conditions. These variations were qualitatively but not quantitatively consistent with predictions from optimal foraging theory.

TI ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL PLAY IN POLECATS (MUSTELIDAE) WITH COMMENTS ON FORM
   AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF OPEN MOUTH PLAY FACE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Social play in polecats (Mustela putorius L.), based on frame-by-frame analysis of cine film, is described. Social play more closely resembles fighting than any other form of adult behavior, but biting is inhibited, occupying only 2% of the polecats'' time as opposed to 40% in fighting. A metacommunicatory function can be ascribed to behavior occupying 48% of the time spent in social play; the open mouth play face is displayed for 16% of the time. It is postulated that the play face has evolved by a ritualization of inhibited biting. Mink (M. vison Schreber) differ from polecats in showing aquatic social play, both on the surface and under water.

TI EFFECT OF FOOD-DEPRIVATION ON DRINKING AND RUNNING IN MONGOLIAN GERBILS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three experiments are reported in which adult male Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) were subjected to various degrees of partial food deprivation, with or without simultaneous access to a running wheel. Restricted feeding caused drinking to increase and running to decrease, and no support for the idea that running might substitute for drinking is offered. Running declined, and then at least partly recovered, as a function of body weight loss, in gerbils that were not allowed to become hyperdipsic. Drinking remained at a high level during prolonged exposure to restricted feeding, but reverted to baseline level more rapidly than did body weight when free feeding was reinstated. The idea that drinking and running may be interchangeable members of a set of activities facilitated by food deprivation is discussed. Neither drinking nor running is related to degree of body weight loss in a simple manner.

TI EFFECT OF SPATIAL CONTEXT ON THE MOBBING REACTION OF PIED FLYCATCHERS TO
   A PREDATOR MODEL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Seven pairs of breeding pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) were repeatedly presented a stuffed owl from a specific location until their mobbing response had waned. Subsequent change in the location of the predator evoked renewed responsiveness from the birds, as measured by their increased calling rate. Predator recognition incorporates an evaluation of the spatial context, and the view that the relative lack of habituation to recurring predators in nature is due, in part, to ever-changing spatial relationships of the predator relative to the inanimate environment was discussed.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An automated method is described for quantifying the variation in temporal pattern of the frequency components in animal vocalizations. The tape-recorded signals are electronically pre-processed to enable direct analysis by a digital computer. Several examples of temporal parameter analysis are shown for the mating call of a neotropical frog Eleutherodactylus coqui. The principal advantage of this technique is that it provides a continuous measurement combined with a statistical measure and fine temporal resolution.

TI BEHAVIOR OF CALIFORNIA GROUND SQUIRRELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The general behavior patterns, spacing patterns and alarm vocalizations of California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) are described. Functions are suggested for most behavior patterns. Males maintain home ranges relatively exclusive of other males via site-specific aggression. Female home ranges overlap extensively with those of other females, and defense is confined to the immediate vicinity of the burrow. Both sexes respond to avian and mammalian predators with relatively predator-specific vocalizations.

   THEIR HABITATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Results in the literature suggest that blue tits and coal tits survive better in their usual habitats of broadleaved and conifer woods, respectively, and that the higher mortality in the wrong habitat may be attributed in part to an inability to acquire an adequate supply of food. Field observations show that wild coal tits and blue tits use different feeding techniques. Laboratory experiments show that each species is best at the feeding techniques which it uses in the wild, and that each species prefers to use the feeding techniques at which it is best. The feeding techniques of coal tits may be adapted to exploit the type of food supply found in conifers, while those of blue tits may be adapted for feeding in broadleaved trees.

TI RESPONSE TO EYE-LIKE SHAPES BY BIRDS .1. EFFECT OF CONTEXT - PREDATOR
   AND A STRANGE BIRD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Laboratory reared 40 day old white leghorn chicks were placed individually in an arena with a dummy bird. The dummy was either a predator (kestrel Falco tinnunculus) or a strange, non-predatory species (kiwi Apteryx spp.), further distinguished by the conspicuousness of the eye region. The hawk''s eyes were either left intact (conspicuous) or covered. The kiwi''s eyes were untouched (inconspicuous) or accentuated. Birds approached the unaltered kiwi but strongly avoided the hawk. Obscuring the eyes diminished hawk avoidance. Enhancement increased aversion to the kiwi. These results indicate the potential importance of the eyes as a stimulus feature of non-conspecifics.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB The courtship behavior of 4 species of fiddler crabs found in Florida was described. Males of all species increased their rates of waving and often produced sounds when approached by females during the day. Males of all species produced sounds during nocturnal low tides, and increased their rates of sound production when touched by females. Uca speciosa produced sounds by rapping their major cheliped against the substrate; U. mordax, U. rapax and U. pugnax, by vibration of the ambulatory legs. The latter mechanism, in addition to other criteria, indicated close relationship between the 3 species. Rates of sound production by lone males at night were quite variable, but in most cases characterized by an early evening peak after sunset.

AB No significant differences in the latency of first approach, or the length of excursions towards a moving object were found between male and female chicks, tested for the first time at 24 hr., 48 hr., 72 hr. and 8 days, and dept visually isolated until testing. Since male chicks, unlike female, will commonly copulate if sufficiently excited, this result argues against a significant involvement of copulation attempts in the following response. Following is still elicitable in the test runway after 8 days isolation.

TI EFFECTS OF PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE ON MATERNAL RETRIEVING BY RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations were made of the retrieving of 5 pups by 20 female rats on each of 7 days following parturition of the 1st and 2d litter. All the time measures recorded (total time, latency, dispersed activities and retrieving) decreased during each of the 2 experimental periods and were lower on each day of the biparous than of the primi-parous period. Percentage of successful retrieving performances (i.e. without dropping the pup on the way to the nest) increased gradually on successive days in both periods, and was higher during the biparous phase of the experiment. This may have been due to the parallel increase in the grasping of pups by a central part of their body, rather than by an extremity. Furthermore, "central" grasps induced less frequent squeaking in the retrieved pups than did "extremity" grasps. Practice induces long-term changes (which involve an improvement) in maternal retrieving by rats.

TI EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIAL FACILITATION OF FEEDING IN DOMESTIC
   CHICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three- and 7-day old chicks were given 10-min. tests for amount of feeding behavior following ''-8 hrs. food deprivation in 6 experimental conditions representing degrees or kinds of social contact with companions in order to test whether social facilitation of feeding required physical contact or could be accounted for by reduction of emotional behavior due to visual presence of a companion. The results confirmed the latter hypothesis. This finding was discussed in terms of earlier results which had led to the rejection of an emotion hypothesis. It was concluded that social facilitation of feeding could be accounted for by emotion reduction where the test period is brief and the test surroundings unfamiliar With longer test periods which allow adaptation, however, a physical contact-behavioral interaction explanation appears to be more pertinent.

TI SIZE CONSTANCY AS FUNCTION OF AGEING + X-RAY IRRADIATION IN RHESUS
   MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Size constancy was studied in 9 old (4 chronic survivors of 1100 r whole-body X-ray radiation and 5 nonirradiated controls) and 4 adolescent rhesus monkeys. During preliminary training subjects were reinforced for selecting the larger of 2 squares with both stimuli equidistant from the subject at positions ranging from 1.5 to 10.0 ft away. Critical trials pitted cues of size and distance against each other, and all subjects, but the young animals in particular, made more errors on critical than noncritica trials in which these cues did not conflict. However, every monkey learned rapidly to utilize the available visual cues of distance in order to select the large object occupying the smaller visual angle. The distance between animals and the large square had nearly as much error producing potential as the size of the visual angle. Size constancy was discussed in terms of learning sets.

TI FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON CORRECTING BEHAVIOUR IN BOXELDER BUGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB After a forced turn on a causeway, boxelder bugs (Leptocoris trivittatus (Say)) make an opposite turn upon arrival at a platform; the amount of opposite turning increases sigmoidally as start to forced turn distance increases. The behavior is unaffected by delays of 40 seconds or more just prior to the forced turn. Bugs also made opposite turns after traversing a circular causeway; this effect increased as the radius of the circle decreased. Two important factors thus seem to be distance travelled and rate of change of direction. Blinding reduces, but does not eliminate, the above effects. Events at the forced turn probably interact with an excitatory state, dependent on start to forced turn distance, to cause opposite turning.

AB This paper deals with rutting behavior in 2 groups of reindeer studied at the Reindeer Research Station in Swedish Lapland. First visible signs of rutting are described as well as the establishment of the harem and its ruler. Old bulls copulate more often than younger ones owing to the earlier occurrence or rut in these, their stronger fighting ability, and the fact that old bulls are more polygamous than their younger rivals.

LA English
DT Article
AB Experiments with Oniscus asellus L., Porcellio scaber Latr. and Armadillidium vulgare Latr. using various kinds of artificial shelter show that thigmokinetic reactions form part of the behavior pattern and are distinct from humidity reactions though their effects may be similar. Thigmokinetic behavior varies with species and relative humidity, generally being most marked at low humidities and in the species least adapted to land life; individuals also vary widely in intensity of response. Increase in either the area or roughness of the surface in contact with the woodlouse tends to inhibit locomotion. Thigmokinesis plays a part in determining trivial movements, usually complementary to humidity and light reactions and to endogenous rhythms but sometimes opposing them, and is therefore ecologically important.

AB Alternative reproductive tactics typically involve males aggressively competing for access to females coexisting with males using nonaggressive, often sneaky tactics. When tactics are heritable, game- theoretic models are commonly invoked to explain such coexistence. These models, including the classic Hawk and Dove model, assume that a tactic's success decreases with its frequency in a population; however, evidence supporting this assumption is scarce. In this study, we investigated the frequency dependence of male reproductive success in an acarid mite, Rhizoglyphus robini, where heritable male morphs exhibiting alternative reproductive tactics, aggressive fighters and benign scramblers, coexist. We placed focal fighter or scrambler males in populations dominated by scramblers or fighters or containing even proportions of both morphs and, using the sterile male technique, determined the number of progeny they sired and the number of females inseminated. Although we found that focal male reproductive success differed depending on mating tactics between competitive mating environments, these differences do not support our predictions and the role of negative frequency-dependent selection in this system. These results question the Hawk-Dove model as an explanation and indicate other mechanisms are required to explain the coexistence of alternative reproductive tactics in R. robini.

AB Voice-based individual level recognition facilitates efficient navigation in the social environment for vocal species. Previous studies have indicated that certain species responded differently to calls of different individuals. Investigating individual level recognition in animals is, however, challenging, as distinguishing it from class level recognition (e.g. familiar/unfamiliar) is difficult. Previous studies showed that dogs, Canis familiaris, can choose their owner's voice from among strangers' voices, but whether this performance reflects class or individual level recognition remained unclear. Here, dogs had to choose the vocalizer from among three familiar speakers (owners) based on prerecorded speech in a cross-modal match-to-sample task. We predicted that if dogs are capable of voice-based individual level recognition, they will successfully match the voice to the vocalizer. Dogs' behaviour and its association with acoustic distance between speakers were analysed. Our results showed that, on the group level, dogs' choosing success and the proportion of the time dogs spent looking at the target owner were significantly above chance. Dogs' performance, however, was not significantly correlated with speakers' acoustic distance in either of the measured cues. The performance of choosing the speaker from among familiar people provides evidence for individual level recognition in dogs. Further research will have to reveal the contributions of specific acoustic cues to this performance. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Dominance hierarchies are a key feature in the dynamics of animal social groups, playing a crucial role in fostering group stability. Despite often being viewed as static, persistent linear structures, hierarchies are fundamentally dynamic and can change over time due to ecological conditions, demographic changes and ontogenetic development. There are numerous methods used to construct hierarchies and quantify individual dominance rank, but methods to capture the dynamics of a hierarchy across time have only recently been developed. As such, relatively little is known about the longitudinal hierarchy dynamics in many social species, including nonhuman primates, and the timescale at which these hierarchy dynamics play out. Here we consider the longitudinal hierarchy dynamics across a 4-year period in a large group of rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta. We investigated group and individual level predictors of active rank dynamics, or dynamics that arise from rank reversals. We found that, despite rhesus macaques being considered to have relatively stable hierarchies, there was significant active rank mobility in both males and females, even in the face of limited resource competition. Female rank change was not solely driven by matrilineal structure or demographic processes as females also opportunistically ascended in rank. Furthermore, we found strong links between rank certainty and hierarchy dynamics with periods of high hierarchy instability associated with low mean dominance certainty. Lastly, we found limited evidence of associations between periods of high active rank dynamics and social global network structure. This suggests more localized dynamics during hierarchy instability are at play rather than widescale network reorganization. Together, these results stress the importance of considering social context in rank dynamics, illustrate the dynamic nature of macaque dominance rank and further highlight the opportunistic nature of the species.

AB Ungulate species are classified as 'hiders' rather than 'followers' when neonates tend to remain separated from their mother and hidden within vegetation during the early postpartum period. Among species, hiding is associated with the availability of cover habitat; however, our understanding of these behaviours often has been limited to relatively coarse and infrequent observations. We leveraged modern technologies, including GPS collars affixed to neonates, LiDAR, fine-scaled encounter risk with predators, accelerometers and multiscale temperature readings, to complement these observations in evaluating how predation risk, thermoregulation and nutritional attributes of habitat contribute to hiding behaviour and its consequences for survival in mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus. Hiding decisions by mule deer were nuanced and counter to prevailing notions that suggest hiding is associated with increasing availability of cover. In support of the risk hypothesis, mule deer were most likely to hide in areas where vegetation height was low and encounter risk with predators was high, and behavioural shifts were prominent relative to variation in time of day, with hiding behaviour increasing at night during periods of predator activity. Nutrition and thermoregulatory hypotheses were supported in that hiding was more likely and neonate and mother were in closer proximity in areas with greater resource availability, and neonates adjusted hiding behaviour to minimize thermoregulatory costs. Variation in hiding indicated the importance of activity and interaction with the mother for neonate survival. Broad-scale habitat patterns have proven useful for defining hiding behaviour across species and may play an important role in setting the bounds that define individual variation; however, we encourage considering local conditions as drivers of hiding and following behaviour in ungulates. Together, patterns across multiple scales are more likely to describe the nature of neonate behaviour, relative to considerations at one scale alone.

AB Intraspecific variability in parasite virulence holds significant ecological and evolutionary implications as it can result in uneven costs incurred by individuals of a host species. Obligate brood parasites, birds that lay their eggs in the nest of another species and do not raise their own young, differ in interspecific virulence, as some species kill all host nestmates directly while other species do not. However, variation in the intraspecific virulence of a brood-parasitic species has rarely been investigated. One source of this variability could arise through sexual size dimorphism, because many brood-parasitic species are sexually dimorphic in size starting at the nestling stage, and nestling size often impacts competitive ability in the brood. Here, we investigated the sex-specific effects of nestling brood-parasitic brown- headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, on one of their hosts, the prothonotary warbler, Protonotaria citrea. We predicted that larger male cowbird nestlings would cause host chicks to have lower survival and size and altered life history in the form of delayed fledging. Using experimentally parasitized broods, we found that although male brood-parasitic cowbird nestlings are heavier than females, there was no effect of cowbird sex on the survival, size or fledging phenology of the host nestlings. Furthermore, there were no differences in fledging phenology between the male and female cowbird chicks. Instead, we found that wing length, which was similar between the parasitic nestlings' sexes, was an important predictor for age and order of fledging. These findings show that the extent of development is critical for the timing of fledging of both parasitic and host species. Notably, the lack of effect of cowbird nestling sex on host chick survival and fledging suggests that the presence of a parasite is more influential for host nestlings than the size of parasites.

AB The cultural transmission of behaviour patterns across animal populations and between generations has been rigorously demonstrated in diverse vertebrate species and also in insects, but controversies continue about exactly what distinguishes nonhuman from human cultural learning. A contentious contemporary debate concerns a hypothetical 'zone of latent solutions' (ZLS), conceptualized as all that members of a species can acquire by individual learning. The ZLS hypothesis proposes that cumulative culture is restricted to humans because of a unique ability to copy behavioural innovations beyond our species' ZLS. Apes and other taxa are argued instead to be limited to copying only behaviours that are already within their ZLS, thus constraining their capacity for cumulative culture. Here I suggest that empirical tests of this hypothesis are scattered through the research literature covering social learning experiments and I collate relevant instances. Over 20 such studies spanning mammals, birds, fish and insects demonstrate social learning of novel actions new to the species that no individual acquires through its own efforts. Many offer particularly compelling refutation of the ZLS hypothesis because in addition to documenting an absence of individual level learning, they incorporate designs showing that observers match whichever of two alternative forms of action they witnessed or include multistep actions that are clearly challenging for individuals of the species studied to acquire by individual learning.

AB Social foraging can be beneficial, but it can also disrupt optimal foraging strategies. Animals possess limited capacity for attention allocation and distractions may impact their rates of food acquisition. Attention to conspecific food competitors can prevent kleptoparasitism but likely affects food intake in multiple ways. We used two field experiments to assess the impact of nearby competitors on urban eastern grey squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis, foraging in a forest setting on the University of Toronto Scarborough campus. We used a tube apparatus in the first experiment to examine foraging efficiency and a tipping container apparatus in the second experiment to examine foraging speed (handling time) and accuracy. Competing squirrels within 1 m or having just been involved in chasing or aggressive physical contact with competitors led to decreases in foraging efficiency, speed and accuracy. Competitors within 5 m of focal squirrels did not impact foraging measures. Over the course of the experiments, squirrels adapted to solving foraging apparatuses in the presence of competitor(s) and improved their efficiency and accuracy but not their speed. Vigilance rates were greater for squirrels that had competitors nearby; thus, decreases in foraging efficiency, accuracy and speed seemed to be caused by the need to allocate attention to conspecifics. These experiments show that social foraging impairs optimal food acquisition for individual eastern grey squirrels. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Asymmetric information transfer can shape the social structure of animal groups. Birds in mixed-species flocks can gain antipredation benefits by relying on both personal and social information, ultimately increasing their survival. However, not all species in a flock contribute danger-related information equally, leading to complex patterns of information flow between species. Understanding these differences in information flow and usage among species is key to exploring the mechanisms underlying the formation of such social assemblages. In this study, we combined mixed-species flock surveys with playback experiments to investigate the asymmetric information transfer about danger between leader and follower species in the montane forests of Taiwan. The playback experiments included four treatments: predator calls (personal information), leader and follower mobbing calls (social information) and control. We predicted that leader species would be better at detecting threats than follower species and that the mobbing calls of leader species would elicit stronger antipredator responses in mixed-species flocks than those of follower species. As predicted, and more striking than anticipated, leader species were always the first to initiate mobbing calls in response to predator calls, suggesting strong asymmetry in predator detection and/or danger communication between the two species' roles. Moreover, our results showed that birds responded much more strongly to the playback of predator calls than to playback of mobbing calls. Contrary to our prediction, there was not a greater antipredator response to mobbing calls given by leader compared to follower species. Here, we propose that larger conspecific group sizes and associated kin-selected behaviour could drive leader species to develop superior antipredator signalling systems, potentially leading to asymmetric information transfer about predation risk between species. We also suggest that mutual antipredator benefits may be common in mixed mobbing flocks, promoting positive interactions among bird species, and ultimately strengthening the cohesion and formation of mixed flocks.

AB The inheritance of structural characteristics and individual note parameters is often studied in oscine passerines. However, other song features, such as the temporal characteristics of song, are less well studied. Inheritance of these features could be influenced by a range of factors, including social inheritance, mechanical constraints, genetic relatedness and the developmental environment. Using archived song data, we examined patterns of inheritance of temporal song features, relating to song duration, song tempo and internote intervals, in a laboratory population of Java sparrows, Padda oryzivora, some of which had been cross fostered. Overall, we found strong evidence for cultural inheritance of temporal song features, that is, temporal song features were learned from the social father. We found that song duration was, at most, weakly socially inherited and constrained by a correlation between song tempo and number of notes. Internote gap durations were also influenced by other song features, in particular the duration of the preceding and following notes, although social learning was still apparent when controlling for these features. Across all measures, we found no evidence that temporal song features were affected by genetic relatedness or the developmental environment. Our findings, and those in other species, suggest that temporal song features are likely to be inherited through a combination of the learning of song structure and spectral structure of notes, and specific learning of temporal song features during development.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Humans readily recognize familiar rhythmic patterns, such as isochrony (equal timing between events) across a wide range of rates. This reflects a facility with perceiving the relative timing of events, not just absolute interval durations. Several lines of evidence suggest this ability is supported by precise temporal predictions arising from forebrain auditory-motor interactions. We have shown previously that male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, which possess specialized auditory-motor networks and communi-cate with rhythmically patterned sequences, share our ability to flexibly recognize isochrony across rates. To test the hypothesis that flexible rhythm pattern perception is linked to vocal learning, we ask whether female zebra finches, which do not learn to sing, can also recognize global temporal patterns. We find that females can flexibly recognize isochrony across a wide range of rates but perform slightly worse than males on average. These findings are consistent with recent work showing that while females have reduced forebrain song regions, the overall network connectivity of vocal premotor regions is similar to males and may support predictions of upcoming events. Comparative studies of male and female songbirds thus offer an opportunity to study how individual differences in auditory-motor connectivity influence perception of relative timing, a hallmark of human music perception. & COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Pair bond duration is usually associated with reproductive success in long-lived monogamous species, yet pairs sometimes divorce. Possible explanations for divorce include having access to a higher-quality partner or territory, selecting a more compatible partner, asynchronous arrival at the breeding site or displacement of one member of a pair by an intruder. Factors influencing the occurrence of divorce are still unknown for many bird species, although divorce is often associated with low reproductive success in the preceding year. The thick-billed murre, Uria lomvia, is a colonial long-lived seabird species that has biparental care and undergoes occasional divorce. In this study, we investigated factors influencing the occurrence of divorce as well as the impact of divorce on subsequent reproductive success using data collected over 24 years at a breeding colony on Coats Island (Nunavut, Canada). Yearly divorce rate averaged 9%. The probability of divorce decreased with breeding experience/age, nest site quality and successful fledging in the previous year. Both sexes initiated divorce. Divorced birds did not obtain a better partner or improve their nesting site quality. Divorce seemed to be triggered by low reproductive success rather than a new partner or nesting site opportunity. Finally, an initial reduction of reproductive success was found for birds that divorced. Our findings help to understand the triggers and consequences of mate changes in long-lived monogamous species. & COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals face many perceptual challenges early in life, including in some cases the need to recognize members of their own species. Early species discrimination abilities are especially well documented for songbirds, with nestlings and even embryos responding preferentially to conspecific vocalizations. It remains unknown, however, whether and how such preferences may be altered by early acoustic experience. In the first field study to intentionally manipulate the sound environment of wild nestlings, we here exposed nestling swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, in the field to playback of song from their own subspecies or from another subspecies that breeds in a different habitat and differs in morphology and song traits. Following an average of 4 days of exposure, we temporarily removed nestlings from their nests and tested them, individually, with unfamiliar consubspecific, heterosubspecific and heterospecific probe songs. We found that nestlings previously exposed to consubspecific songs did not show song type discrimination. By contrast, nestlings previously exposed to heterosubspecific songs chirped more often in response to consubspecific songs as compared to heterosubspecific songs. These results suggest that nestling song discrimination is influenced by auditory experience within their first week of life, that exposure to diverse sets of songs might enhance song discrimination abilities and that perceptual conspecific biases in songbirds are precise to the subspecies level. More broadly, our study implies that events immediately following hatching have the potential to guide later song learning, stimulus categorization and premating isolation among diverging populations. & COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sperm production is physiologically costly; therefore, males that mate multiple times are expected to allocate sperm prudently to maximize their fitness. Sperm allocation theory has been widely tested in internally fertilizing animals; however, few studies have investigated whether males adjust the number of sperm released according to their premating experience and cues from rival males. Here, we investigated sperm allocation strategies in an externally fertilizing fish, the medaka, Oryzias latipes, in controlled conditions. We used three treatments: direct interaction with a rival (two males were allowed to interact directly with each other), visual cue only (presenting a male in a separate compartment) and no rivals (control). In the direct interaction treatment, two types of alternative male mating behaviour, simultaneous sperm release and postspawn sperm release, were observed. Premating experiences affected subsequent mating behaviour: males that were more aggressive and exhibited more prominent courtship behaviour mated females without any disturbance from the other males, whereas simultaneous sperm release frequently occurred when both males exhibited similar levels of aggression and courtship behaviours. We also counted the sperm released per mating from the water tank. There was no change in the number of sperm released in the presence of visual cues of competition or direct interaction with the other males before mating. However, males (focal and/or rival) released more sperm only when sperm competition was high, that is, when a rival male successfully disrupted mating before simultaneous sperm release. Our results indicate that medaka males may adjust the number of sperm released per mating in different mating environments.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Polygynous males allocate substantial resources to sexual traits and behaviours to improve their chances of winning competitions for mates often at the cost of body maintenance. However, the degree to which males experience these trade-offs can be influenced by external conditions. Studies are needed that assess whether polygynous male resource allocation decisions about life history traits are density dependent. We tested for an influence of density on age-specific life history traits in male southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, using a 34-year data set collected at Marion Island. Specifically, we determine whether life history varied with density-related factors for survival, improved breeding success (measured as social status) and recruitment age. This was done by selecting linear models that tested biological hypotheses about density-dependent covariates related to competition intensity during breeding and natal conditions, while accounting for known intrinsic effects such as age and social status. Baseline mortalities were higher for males that had accumulated above average reproductive costs for their age than males with below average costs. This reproductive cost was determined by the number of females per harem relative to the population average. Thus, males likely allocated more resources to reproduction and less to body maintenance at all ages when defending and servicing relatively large harems, and this cost was compounding for males that dominated large harems at a young age. Males born in years with few pups were more likely to be dominant breeders and recruit at an earlier age than males born in years with many pups. Thus, breeding success and recruitment age likely depended on the population density experienced during early life, suggesting lasting effects of natal conditions in a long-lived animal. We show how density-dependent factors interact with intrinsic determinants of resource allocation to determine variation in polygynous male life history with long-term consequences.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Polygamous species vary in alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in relation to individual or environ-mental factors. Individuals may adopt fixed ARTs consistently across years, or may show flexible behaviour, changing tactic in different years. Different cost-benefit trade-offs should occur in relation to the adoption of each ART, possibly also influencing spatial behaviour and thus leading to alternative spatial tactics. Fixed ARTs are rare in mammals, whereas environmental variability is expected to favour flexibility in ARTs. We evaluated the potential for fixed versus flexible ARTs, and their correspondence with different spatial tactics, in a polygynous herbivore, the Alpine chamois, Rupicapra rupicapra rupi-capra. We collected data on mating behaviour of 31 individually recognizable adult males during five rutting seasons and on their spatial behaviour throughout the same years. Fifteen males were classified as territorial and 16 as nonterritorial. No individual changed ART during our research. Moreover, we report a previously undocumented occurrence of different patterns of spatial behaviour across territorial males. Half of these individuals had overlapping or continuous winter and summer ranges, whereas the others moved between different areas (in winter, immediately after the rut, or between summer and autumn). No differences between males adopting diverse ARTs were found in age or body mass, or in their respective frequencies of intrasexual aggressive interactions. On the other hand, territorial males, dominant over nonterritorial individuals in aggressive interactions, had more mating opportunities than nonterritorial ones. Further work should test for the consistency of our results across broader spatial and temporal scales, as well as species. Differences in key aspects of behaviour (e.g. space use) and life history (e.g. reproductive success) would help explain ART evolution and coexistence in a population. If ARTs were fixed in male chamois, neither ART should have been selected against long enough to determine its extinction, over evolutionary times.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Even though personality is a major determinant of individual survival, the development of animal per-sonality traits is still poorly understood. Beyond an individual's genetic background, personality may be shaped by the conditions experienced during embryonic development. Light is a salient and variable ecological factor that can affect organismal physiology, establish brain asymmetries and ultimately modulate postnatal phenotypes across multiple taxa. Exposure to light is known to vary among avian embryos due to changes in parental incubatory constancy, but whether differences in the prenatal light environment can influence offspring personality development has rarely been explored. Here, we investigated whether the prenatal light environment shapes a key dimension of animal personality, the shy-bold axis, in hatchlings of a semiprecocial seabird, the yellow-legged gull, Larus michahellis. In gulls, the prenatal light environment may be especially important for last-laid eggs, as parental attendance during late incubation is more variable for last-laid than for senior eggs. We manipulated the levels of embryonic exposure to light (within the natural range previously documented in the wild) during the last stages of egg incubation and assessed differences in boldness in newly hatched junior chicks. We then used structural equation modelling to explore whether the effect of prenatal light exposure on the shy-bold axis is linked to the establishment of brain asymmetries (lateralization) and/or changes in plasma corticosterone levels. Prenatal light exposure promoted bolder phenotypes in gull chicks, which may improve their individual performance when competing for parental resources. Prenatal light also promoted the lateralization of the begging behaviour in newly hatched chicks, which was negatively associated with boldness. Finally, light induced changes in glucocorticoid levels, but these changes did not impact chicks' personality. Our findings unambiguously confirm that the prenatal light environment strongly affects the development of shy-bold phenotypes in gull hatchlings through a complex multi -path mechanism.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Living in groups has many benefits including predator protection and information sharing that can outweigh the associated costs. African savannah elephants live in a matriarchal fission-fusion social structure where groups merge or split depending on the relative costs of group living. However, elephants are also nonsynchronous breeders which may cause optimal movement patterns to differ between group members, particularly around parturition. Both the mother and the group must assess whether the benefits outweigh the costs of group cohesion. Understanding the impact of gestation, parturition and the presence of a newborn calf on the mother's movement patterns could provide key insights into the drivers of fission-fusion social dynamics. Here, we examined the relationship between reproductive state and movement using GPS tracking data collected during 23 parturitions from multiparous elephants (> second calving) and three from primiparous females. We analysed daily mean speed before, during and after parturition, and used a three-state hidden Markov model to determine whether parturition results in a distinctive change in speed. The results show that, although speed decreased on the estimated parturition date, parturition could only be detected in four of 23 multiparous parturition events when placed in the context of speed over a 2-month period. Furthermore, the speed on the day before and the day after parturition (i.e. first complete day of the calf's life) was not significantly different from the yearly mean. By contrast, a speed decrease was detected in the limited sample of primiparous females but was of short duration. Our results indicate that the precocial abilities of calves facilitate the maintenance of group cohesion within the matriarchal fission-fusion social structure of elephants. We speculate that, alongside cognitive development, elephants may have evolved a long gestation period to facilitate an advanced stage of fetal physical development.

AB How infected hosts behave critically affects both their fitness and the transmission, and thus fitness, of their parasites. Understanding host-parasite coevolution therefore requires understanding the factors affecting infected host behaviour. This can usefully be decomposed into the current behavioural expression level and any infection-induced changes in that expression: each of these may have different implications for host and parasite fitness. For example, from the perspective of socially transmitted parasites, the more contacts infected hosts make with susceptible conspecifics, the better, regardless of their pre-infection contact behaviour. For social hosts, however, minimizing infection-induced changes to fitness-enhancing behaviours ('behavioural tolerance') may reduce the risk of social exclusion and its associated costs. Here, we tested how the presence of conspecifics ('social context') affects the behaviour and behavioural tolerance of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, infected with the socially transmitted ectoparasite Gyrodactylus turnbulli. In the absence of a stimulus shoal of three females, males that lost the most mass over the course of infection (i.e. had lowest tissue-specific tolerance) were significantly less active, whereas in the presence of the shoal, male activity levels were high and not correlated with tissue specific tolerance. Females were consistently active, regardless of their tissue-specific tolerance or social context. Behavioural tolerance, quantified as the per-parasite change in activity level, also differed between the sexes in the absence of the shoal: among females, behavioural tolerance was negatively correlated with tissue-specific tolerance, whereas in males the correlation was strikingly positive. In the presence of the shoal, however, tolerance components were not correlated in either sex. Overall, these sex differences in behaviour and behavioural tolerance indicate that females are highly competent at transmitting this parasite, and that males can conceal their disease when in the presence of females. Our results contribute to the growing literature on factors affecting variation between infected hosts, which fundamentally affects epidemiological predictions.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Recent increase in climate instability and unpredictability can pose challenges to the behaviour and survival of animals. Effective cognitive mechanisms could provide adequate responses for individuals to adapt to changing habitats and should be selected for. Studying the direct impact of the unpredictably changing environment on learning performance is particularly important in juvenile animals, because their learning abilities are in development and any impairment can affect their fitness. In this study, we bred zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in stable or variable ambient temperature conditions. At hatching, half of the birds in each family were cross-fostered to a different condition while the other half remained in their original one. Just prior to their independence, we assessed their associative learning performance of 209 juveniles. Using a novel colour associative test apparatus, we compared the participation rate, latency to choice and learning performance between the experimental groups. We found that the juveniles that originated from the stable condition and that experienced environmental instability after hatching had the highest participation rate and the shortest latency to choice. Our results also showed that individuals that made quicker choices performed significantly better in the learning test than the slower birds. This finding was opposite to the often-postulated speed-accuracy trade-off, usually manifested by more accurate learning of slower individuals. There was no direct effect of temperature variability on the learning performance. However, we suggest that the differences in activity and latency (measures often used as proxies of personality traits) could be attributed to personality bias which may indirectly affect the outcome and interpretation of cognitive research. We discuss our results in relation to the long-term effects of environmental variability on animal activeness and cognitive abilities as well as the mechanisms responsible for the variation in learning performance.

AB Neophobia is defined as the avoidance of novel or unknown stimuli, including unknown predators, and can be induced by exposure to uncertain ecological conditions. In addition to uncertainty related to predation risk, uncertainty may also arise from increased foraging competition. Prey forced to spend time and energy competing for limited resources may not have enough time available to devote to predator identification and hence benefit from increased neophobia. Here, we tested the potential interaction of reduced foraging opportunities and elevated predation risk on the strength of neophobia (the anti predator response towards a novel chemical cue). In our first experiment, shoals of juvenile convict cichlids, Amatitlania nigrofasciata, were exposed to high (10% total body weight/day) or low (1% total body weight/day) relative food abundance for 7 days. During the final 3 days, we exposed the shoals to high versus low background predation risk, resulting in a 2 x 2 design. We found that while low food abundance alone and risk alone induced a weak neophobic response to a novel cue (versus water control), cichlids pre-exposed to high risk and low food abundance exhibited significantly a stronger neophobic response, in an additive pattern. In our second experiment, we exposed shoals of cichlids to a fixed amount of food distributed on a single (high competition) patch or across five (low competition) patches for 7 days, with the same risk manipulation as above for the final 3 days. As in experiment 1, we found that high competition alone and risk alone elicited a weak neophobic response to novel cues and that high risk and high competition had additive effects on the strength of induced neophobia among juvenile cichlids. Together, our results indicate that uncertainty of risk and of foraging opportunities exert additive effects on the phenotypically plastic neophobia among prey populations.

AB Emotional contagion refers to the mechanism of aligning with conspecifics' emotional states and is thought to be highly beneficial in social group living. While emotional contagion is well studied in humans, most studies in nonhuman animals fail to clearly distinguish between behavioural and emotional contagion. Furthermore, evidence for positive emotional contagion in nonhuman animals is almost entirely restricted to the context of play. In the present study, we aimed at adding observational evidence of contagion in a positive context, while separating aspects of behavioural and emotional contagion. In a group of nonbreeder common ravens, Corvus corax, we investigated whether witnessing conspecifics in positive social interaction, namely allopreening, would influence a bystander's behavioural and, possibly, emotional state. We recorded behavioural expressions of bystanders in postpreening observation phases and compared them to those in matched-control observation phases. We found effects of witnessing others' allopreening on the bystanders' subsequent affiliative interactions but not on their self-directed behaviours (e.g. autopreening) or agonistic interactions. Specifically, bystanders were more likely to engage in allopreening themselves in the postpreening observation phase than in the matched-control observation phase, which could be explained via behavioural and emotional contagion; however, bystanders also showed elevated levels of nonpreening affiliative interactions and spent more time close to conspecifics after observing others allopreening, which hints towards a more general effect on the bystanders' emotional states. Whether these nonpreening affiliative interactions are indeed an indication of emotional contagion needs to be tested in further studies that measure, and manipulate, emotional states.(c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Kin selection theory predicts that genetic relatedness between group members can reduce the asym-metry in resource partitioning between superior and inferior competitors. In social groups, access to resources is often regulated by dominance hierarchies; thus, the degree of relatedness within a group may have a substantial impact on hierarchy structure. However, evidence of such effects is scarce. This study investigated how genetic relatedness and food competition affect dominance hierarchies in adult female Pelvicachromis taeniatus, a biparental African cichlid that shows kin-directed cooperation during juvenile shoaling and parental care. We compared triads of unfamiliar females, consisting of either a sister pair and an unrelated female ('mixed' groups) or three unrelated females ('nonkin' groups), and measured food monopolization and hierarchy characteristics (linearity, hierarchy steepness and short -term stability). To determine dominance relationships, we used an automated analysis of approach-avoidance events based on video-tracking data. The females formed hierarchies that remained stable over 2 days and were linear or near linear with one clear alpha female dominating the other two group members. Higher-ranking females tended to have prior access to food and could better sustain their body mass. The steepness of these hierarchies decreased after feeding, showing that dominance behaviour changed plastically depending on the intensity of competition over limited resources. Mixed groups consumed food slower than nonkin groups, but the treatments did not differ in food monopolization or hierarchy characteristics. In conclusion, kin-biased behaviour was highly dependent on life stage and social context: Within the same species, juveniles and mating partners showed increased cooperation, whereas female-female competition and dominance remained unaffected by genetic relatedness.

AB Acoustic signals have been presumed to show high evolutionary divergence levels, with similar constraints and selective pressures often leading to convergence among distant lineages. However, few studies have applied a rigorous phylogenetic approach to investigate historical changes in anuran vocalizations. Here, we investigated which factors may be shaping acoustic signals in Neotropical leaf frogs by testing correlations among acoustic variables, species body size and habitat structure. The study was conducted in a comprehensive sampling, composed by the clade formed by treefrogs of the genera Callimedusa, Phyllomedusa and Pithecopus (Phyllomedusidae). We found a significant inverse correlation between body size and the dominant frequency of calls, but not between body size and call duration. Unexpectedly, no acoustic variable was significantly correlated with habitat type. However, habitat type showed a high phylogenetic signal. We suggest that the influence of different spatial scales should be appropriately addressed in broader tests with anurans and that more studies focusing on the evolution of calls in particular clades should be conducted instead of seeking general rules across clades.

AB Anthropogenic noise pollution is an emerging global threat to fish populations. Among a suite of deleterious effects, noise can potentially impede reproductive success in some fishes by masking their mate advertisement vocalizations. Using the plainfin midshipman fish, Porichthys notatus, a marine toadfish that produces a distinctive 'hum' during courtship, we investigated how noise affects male vocalizations and spawning success in the wild. We recorded nesting males for 3 days and measured the frequency (i.e. pitch), amplitude and duration of their vocalizations before, during and after exposure to artificial noise (similar to 118 Hz tone). We also counted eggs in nests exposed to 10 days of artificial noise versus control nests that were not exposed to artificial noise. Males exposed to noise produced fewer vocalizations, reduced the frequency of vocalizations and increased the amplitude of their mating hum (Lombard effect). However, chronic artificial noise exposure did not significantly affect spawning success, suggesting that the Lombard effect allowed males to sustain clear advertisement signals when competing with a relatively weak artificial noise source. Future studies are needed to determine whether such vocal adjustments incur costs for males, and how common anthropogenic noises, such as boat engines, affect spawning and reproductive success.

AB Many species exhibit selective foraging behaviour, where consumers use a nonrandom subset of available food types. Yet little is known about how selective foraging behaviour varies with environmental conditions and the community level consequences of such selection dynamics. We examined selective foraging by wolves preying primarily on elk in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) over a 12-year period and on moose in Isle Royale National Park (IRNP) over a 47-year period. Specifically, we assessed how selection for calves and senescent adults varied with their frequency in the environment, wolf abundance and winter severity. Selection for senescent adults decreased as the relative abundance of senescent prey increased (i.e. negative frequency-dependent selection) in both study sites. In IRNP, selection for calves was also negatively frequency dependent and declined with increasing wolf abundance. These results are inconsistent with the pattern of positive frequency-dependent selection expected under the prey switching hypothesis. These results suggest that selection is primarily driven by intraspecific differences in prey vulnerability and wolves' interest in minimizing their risk of injury, as opposed to maximizing intake rates. Lastly, we ran simulations to evaluate how predator-prey dynamics were influenced by dynamic patterns of selection, like those observed in YNP and IRNP. The simulations indicated that predators are more efficient (i.e. steeper slope of the numerical response) when selection for calves is negatively frequency dependent, which results in a lower mean abundance of prey. More importantly, predation is a stronger destabilizing force when selection for calves is negatively frequency dependent. That stronger destabilizing force is indicated by greater variability in the abundance of prey and predators, prey populations being less resilient and a steeper negative slope of the relationship between predation rate and prey population growth rate. As such, our simulation analyses suggest that some of the observed patterns of negative-frequency dependent selection may have important consequences for predator-prey dynamics.

AB Variation in behavioural traits is especially important in novel habitats where selection forces determine successful colonizers. Prey species must constantly balance the risk versus reward of remaining in an area with threats while gaining possible fitness benefits. Flight initiation distance, the distance at which an animal flees when approached by a human, is a common metric used to assess habituation to stressors and risk behaviour. Here we examine the flight initiation distance of 519 feral pigeons (Columba livia) across New York City, U.S.A. We examined this behavioural response across the metropolitan landscape with respect to multiple urbanization factors related to human activity, the abiotic environment and the ecological community. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to transform landcover characters and then liner models to test various anthropogenic variables including landcover, pedestrian traffic and human population size. We found that flight initiation distance in pigeons decreased with increased human activity (measured by pedestrian traffic and human population size) and more urban landcover (specifically longer road length and greater amounts of impervious surface). We also found that flight initiation distance was shorter in areas with more peregrine falcon, Falco peregrinus, sightings, but longer in areas with more red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis, sightings. Overall, this research demonstrates that feral pigeon behaviour varies with urbanization, human activity and ecological attributes. Since behavioural changes are often the most rapid phenotypic response to change, this study demonstrates that pigeons are responding to anthropogenic stressors, which may set the stage for adaptive changes.

AB Grooming is the most common cooperative behaviour in primates. It has helped advance our understanding of how animals achieve reciprocal cooperation without using precise counting strategies. For example, attitudinal reciprocity refers to recipients making short-term adjustments like reciprocated grooming or tolerance at food sources based on a change in emotional states. Here, we used an experimental set-up to investigate in unprecedented detail the building blocks of attitudinal reciprocity that govern wild dominant females' tolerance around food after a grooming interaction with a subordinate female partner in vervet monkeys. We measured the tolerance of dominant females towards the previous grooming partner within 4 h after a grooming interaction. Tolerance levels remained elevated compared to baseline for the entire period, decreasing with time and predicted to fall to baseline levels after approximately 6 h. The decline in tolerance was not affected by the relationship quality between females, further grooming received from other group members or the surplus grooming that the dominant received relative to what she gave. However, the duration of grooming by the subordinate influenced the dominant's tolerance positively. These results suggest that the temporal dynamics of tolerance are best described as grooming triggering the start of a partner-specific 'hourglass', where the amount of remaining 'sand' equates to the dominant's current tolerance level above baseline. The results challenge the notion that dominants use scorekeeping regarding their grooming debts towards subordinates to make decisions about reciprocating with tolerance. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB Intense sexual selection on males may drive the evolution of exaggerated weaponry, typically used in contests for females or reproductive sites. In some species, males have discontinuous variation in weapon morphology that is accompanied by alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). Major males with enlarged weapons usually exhibit a mating tactic based on female or resource defence, which makes them relatively sedentary. Minor males with reduced or absent weapons may exhibit a scramble competition mating tactic, which involves increased movement in search of females. Thus, the main costs paid by majors involve the expression/maintenance of exaggerated structures and potential injuries during contests. In turn, the main costs paid by minors are likely related to increased exposure to predation during mate search, yet this cost has rarely been considered for minors. Harvestmen are an arachnid group with diverse male weaponry, including many cases of male polymorphism associated with ARTs. Species of the suborder Eupnoi use leg autotomy as a common antipredator defence. Here we investigated whether leg autotomy (a proxy for predation risk) is more frequent in minors of the weapon polymorphic harvestman Forsteropsalis pureora, which has three male morphs with drastically different cheliceral size and morphology. Leg autotomy was very common, with 54% of wild-caught individuals missing at least one leg (mostly leg II), but we found no evidence for differential predation risk between male morphs during adulthood. In a predator simulation experiment, we found no difference in the likelihood or latency to autotomize a leg between male morphs or leg types (legs I, II, III or IV). However, males already missing legs were more reluctant to autotomize an additional leg. Our results suggest that while leg autotomy is a common antipredator strategy, with no difference between male tactics, costs are compounded as additional legs are autotomized and males may strategically decide not to autotomize in future predator encounters.

AB Parental care has evolved to increase offspring fitness. Burying beetles, which breed on small vertebrate carcasses, engage in extensive parental care, including prehatch carcass preservation using oral and anal secretions and direct posthatch care by regurgitating food for offspring. Aspects of parental care, such as regurgitation, may also act as a means of transmitting beneficial microbes to offspring. To explore the contributions of parental care to microbial transmission, we used Illumina high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize bacterial communities found on prepared carcasses and in the digestive tracts of wild-caught and laboratory-reared adults and in the digestive tracts of larvae that either received or did not receive parental care. We found that the digestive tract bacterial communities of larvae receiving parental care were similar to those of their parents, whereas digestive tract bacterial communities of larvae not receiving parental care were dissimilar to those of their parents. All larval digestive tract bacterial communities were dissimilar from those found on prepared carcasses. Furthermore, we found that the digestive tract bacterial communities did not differ significantly between wild-caught nonreproductive adults and F1 and F2 laboratory-reared nonreproductive adults or between laboratory-reared nonreproductive and reproductive adults. While previous work showed that a pre pared carcass may serve to inoculate some larval digestive tract bacteria, the results of the present study suggest that this role may be relatively minor and that parental care is crucial in shaping the gut microbiome of offspring, with aspects of this care, such as parental regurgitation, likely being an important component of the transmission process. Furthermore, as wild-reared and laboratory-reared adults did not vary significantly in their digestive tract bacterial communities, our findings suggest that gut microbiome transmittance within our Nicrophorus defodiens model is likely germane to the natural system.

AB Numerous studies have examined social learning in different contexts on the one hand and sex-specific differences in a number of cognitive tasks on the other. The present study on Atlantic mollies, Poecilia mexicana, is among the first to link behavioural flexibility and social learning to cognitive sex-specific differences. We investigated sex-specific differences in the ability to exploit knowledge previously obtained through observation of experienced male demonstrators trained on different colours on how to find and access a hidden food reward. To do so, Atlantic mollies were initially trained to discriminate differently coloured stimuli. Upon successfully learning their task, they were introduced as demonstrators to tutor their conspecifics in subsequent observer test sessions. During these sessions, a male or female observer initially attended the foraging routine of the demonstrator performing the task. Green and yellow as the rewarded colours varied randomly within each observer test session. Thus, the observing individuals had to pay close attention to both the demonstrated behaviour and rewarded chip colour to maximize choice accuracy. Male observers performed significantly better, although significantly slower than their female conspecifics within all observer test sessions. However, female and male observers made either decision at virtually the same speed. Male observers decided correctly significantly more often than females. Our study is one of the first showing that fish exhibit remarkable sex-specific behavioural flexibility in a social context when reward contingencies change unpredictably.

AB Predators regulate prey abundance (direct predation) as well as influencing their metabolism and behaviour (indirect effects) through the perception of risk. Antipredator traits are informed by individual experience of risk, which may vary over environmental gradients and through ontogeny. As prey grow, individual vulnerability generally diminishes, and the reduction in individual vulnerability with onto genetic growth can potentially lead to size refugia, ultimately nullifying the impacts of direct predation. Despite the ecological importance of the indirect effects of predation and the disproportionate influence larger individuals have on ecological level processes, there has been little focus on the potential indirect effects of predation risk on invulnerable prey. Using a combination of field and laboratory experiments, we measured the changes in routine oxygen consumption of vulnerable and invulnerable size classes of the intertidal snail Nucella lapillus (dogwhelk), exposed to effluent from its crab predator Carcinus maenas. To test the potential influence of prior experience of predation risk, measurements were conducted on populations naturally exposed to different levels of predation pressure. Field results showed that only invulnerable snails modified their routine oxygen consumption in the presence of risk, and this occurred across all populations. Oxygen consumption rates in the laboratory, however, contradicted the pattern, with only vulnerable prey responding to the perception of risk. Metabolic responses of both vulnerable and invulnerable prey under field and laboratory conditions are discussed in the context of asset protection and prey energetic state. Observations of snail behaviour in the laboratory showed that dogwhelks from exposed shores, where predatory risk is higher, were more likely to exhibit antipredator behaviour. Importantly, our findings provide evidence that the indirect effects of predators remain influential even after prey are no longer susceptible to direct predation and add to the growing body of evidence highlighting the ecological importance of indirect predation.

AB In many brood-rearing species, suitable nesting resources are needed for nest construction. Here, we used males of a small marine fish, the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, to study the associations between the nest owner's phenotype (i.e. body size), the characteristics of the nesting resource used for nest construction (i.e. resource size and shape) and nest-building behaviour (i.e. eagerness to build a nest and extent of nest elaboration). We found that male body size was associated with nesting resource size and resource architecture in the field, with the smallest males occupying small flat resources and the biggest males occupying large arched resources. In the laboratory, the type of resource occupied in the field had a limited effect on the level of nest elaboration, but not on other nesting behaviours. Large body size, in turn, was associated with preference for larger resources and, in some circumstances, also the level of nest elaboration. Body size did not affect the eagerness to initiate nest building. Furthermore, males chose arched nesting resources more often than those that were flat, and this preference was also reflected under a 'no-choice' scenario, based on the time taken for males to initiate nest building. Overall, the results indicate that the importance of male size in nest building is context dependent, while nesting behaviours can also be affected by resource size, resource architecture and, under some circumstances, the nest builder's experience with resource use.

AB Interspecific competition is expected to occur between phylogenetically closely related species when sharing resources. In birds, interspecific competition often occurs by song-mediated interference and frequently implies asymmetrical outcomes between the species pairs involved. Habitat loss resulting from agricultural intensification is expected to have aggregated bird species in the remaining suitable habitats, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecific competition. However, this process has rarely been considered as a potential factor limiting population recovery in farmland birds. We investigated whether interspecific competition occurs between grey, Perdix perdix, and red-legged, Alectoris rufa, partridges, two phylogenetically related species. Originally parapatric, they have suffered an artificial increase in their contact zone due to huge human-mediated gamebird releases. We analysed territorial behaviour through a playback stimuli experiment and investigated shifts in habitat niche in the absence and presence of a hypothetical competitor. Results showed that the grey partridge appeared less territorial when co-occurring with the red-legged partridge and shifted its habitat niche away from the latter, while no such change was detected for the red-legged partridge. These asymmetrical patterns in behaviour and ecology are predicted under an interspecific competition scenario beneficial to the red legged partridge, and therefore suggest that they are competitively dominant to grey partridges where they co-occur. This result has potentially strong implications for the management of grey partridges as gamebirds, and for their conservation in areas where they are almost extirpated.

AB Human-generated noise pollution is of global concern, as designated by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2011, Burden of disease from environmental noise: Quantification of healthy life years lost in Europe. https://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/e94888/en/). Increases in shipping, sonar use, pile driving, and more have all contributed to a rise in ambient underwater sound levels. Unfortunately, continuous low-intensity sounds, like shipping noise, are pervasive in shallow-shore environments where many social species live and correspond to the frequency ranges at which many fishes produce and detect acoustic stimuli. Noise has the potential to alter the sender's production of the signal, mask the signal itself (if acoustic), or change the receiver's physiology. We hypothesized that continuous tonal noise would impair social interactions and communication. To test this, we used highly social African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, to examine inter- and intrasexual interactions that occurred in a control or noisy environment (pure tones of 100-2000 Hz). During reproductive interactions, we found that males changed the location of their courtship behaviours. Instead of producing courtship quivers (and associated sounds) immediately next to gravid females, males produced these behaviours inside their spawning shelter. This change in location decreases the likelihood of the female detecting it. Also detrimental to acoustic communication, we found that noise-exposed gravid females had lower hearing sensitivity at 100-200 Hz, a major component of male courtship sounds. In addition, males changed their visual displays during male-male territorial interactions such that they spent more time with their eyebar displayed, suggesting an increase in visual signalling. Together, these data indicate that noise may impact all three components of social communication: signal production, signal reception and the signal itself, and highlights a possible cross-modal impact of noise on visual signalling. Subtle changes to social behaviours and communication, rather than dramatic effects such as injury or mortality, are important to evaluating sublethal impacts of noise on reproductive success and species survival.

AB Social relationships can have important fitness consequences. Although there is increasing evidence that social relationships carry over across contexts, few studies have investigated whether relationships formed early in life are carried over to adulthood. For example, juveniles of monogamous species go through a major life history stage transition, pair formation, during which the pair bond becomes a central unit of the social organization. At present, it remains unclear whether pair members retain their early life relationships after pair formation. We investigated whether same-sex associations formed early in life carry over into adulthood and whether carryover was dependent on season, in a monogamous species. We also investigated the role of familiarity, genetic relatedness and aggression on the perseverance of social associations. We studied the social structure before and after pair formation in captive barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, a highly social, long-lived, monogamous species. We constructed association networks of groups of geese before pair formation, during the subsequent breeding season and in the following wintering season. Next, we studied how these associations carried over during seasonal changes. We found that early life associations in females were lost during the breeding season but resurfaced during the subsequent wintering season. In males, the early life associations persisted across both seasons. Association persistence was not mediated by genetic relatedness or familiarity. The high level of aggressiveness of males, but not females, in the breeding season suggests that males may have played a key role in shaping both their own social environment and that of their partners. We show that early life social relationships can be maintained well into later life. Such relationships can be sustained even if they are temporarily disrupted, for example due to reproductive behaviour. Our findings therefore highlight that the early life social environment can have lifelong consequences for individuals' social environment. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB An optimal foraging strategy often requires identifying and choosing the larger amount of food in the presence of multiple options, in order to maximize food intake. Food quantity estimation frequently depends on the perceptual ability to segregate food from the surrounding background. In human and nonhuman animals, it has recently been shown that the perception of food size is affected by the size of the background on which food is presented, with a tendency to overestimate food items encircled by a small background. This perceptual bias resembles an illusory effect known as the Delboeuf illusion. We investigated whether this bias occurs in five fish species: zebrafish, Danio rerio, redtail splitfin, Xenotoca eiseni, angelfish, Pterophyllum scalare, Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, and three-spot gourami, Trichopodus trichopterus. In control trials, we observed their spontaneous preference for choosing the larger of two amounts of food. In test trials, two same-sized food amounts were presented on a small and a large plate, a pattern that causes the Delboeuf illusion in humans. Similarities in subjects' choices between the five species were greater than differences, with a significant bias towards selecting the food amount on the large plate. This suggests the existence of a perceptual bias, although one operating in the opposite direction from that of humans, which might interfere with the accurate food size estimation necessary for an optimal foraging strategy.

AB Encountering and adaptively responding to unfamiliar or novel stimuli is a fundamental challenge facing animals and is linked to fitness. Behavioural responses to novel stimuli can differ strongly between closely related species; however, the ecological and evolutionary factors underlying these differences are not well understood, in part because most comparative investigations have focused on only two species. In this study, we investigate behavioural responses to novel environments, or exploratory behaviours, sampling from a total of 20 species in a previously untested vertebrate system, Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, which comprises hundreds of phenotypically diverse species that have diverged in the past one million years. We show generally conserved behavioural response patterns to different types of environmental stimuli in Lake Malawi cichlids, spanning multiple assays and paralleling other teleost and rodent lineages. Next, we demonstrate that more specific dimensions of exploratory behaviour vary strongly among Lake Malawi cichlids, and that a large proportion of this variation is explained by species differences. We further show that species differences in open field behaviours are explained by microhabitat and by a major evolutionary split between the mbuna and benthic/utaka radiations in Lake Malawi. Lastly, we track some individuals across a subset of behavioural assays and show that patterns of behavioural covariation across contexts are characteristic of modular complex traits. Taken together, our results tie ecology and evolution to natural behavioural variation, and highlight Lake Malawi cichlids as a powerful system for understanding the biological basis of exploratory behaviours.

AB In many mammalian species, males are selected to kill unrelated infants and/or fetuses in order to cause lactating and pregnant females to begin cycling sooner than they otherwise would. As a result, females have evolved numerous counterstrategies to prevent infanticide and feticide. One such proposed counterstrategy is the Bruce effect, an apparently costly strategy in which inseminated or pregnant females cease reproductive investment in a developing embryo or fetus following exposure to nonsire males. Here I present a quantitative model that seeks to explain under what conditions females will be selected to exhibit the Bruce effect (i.e. to block or terminate pregnancy) rather than risking future infanticide or feticide. I first present an analytical model of the costs of the Bruce effect relative to the costs of potential feticide or infanticide. I then test the resulting predictions using an individual-based model operating under ecologically relevant conditions. The individual-based model predicts that moderate and high, but not low, levels of infanticide can produce selection for the Bruce effect. In contrast, feticide risk alone is unlikely to lead to selection for the Bruce effect, although feticide risk coupled with a substantial risk of female mortality following feticidal attack can. The model correctly predicts the evolution of the Bruce effect in geladas, Theropithecus gelada, and correctly predicts the absence of a Bruce effect in chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, and yellow baboons, Papio cynocephalus. Finally, I present a framework by which researchers can predict whether they expect to find infanticide, feticide and/or the Bruce effect in their study species.

AB Variation in transmission characteristics of signalling environments is hypothesized to influence the evolution of signalling behaviour, signal form and sensory systems of animals. However, many animals communicate across multiple signalling environments, raising the possibility that some displays have evolved explicitly to enable communication across heterogeneous signalling environments. In the present paper, we explored multiple potential impacts of the signalling environment on courtship displays in the wolf spider Schizocosa retrorsa. Males of this species court females on a range of substrate types using a combination of vibratory and visual signals. Through a series of experiments, we investigated (1) activity patterns and male microhabitat use, (2) component-specific vibratory signal transmission across natural substrate types and (3) copulation success across substrate types and light levels. We found that, in the laboratory, (1) female and male S. retrorsa are most active during daylight hours, and mature males resided and courted most on leaf litter, as compared to their natural habitat types of pine litter or sand; (2) male vibratory courtship signals transmitted best on leaf litter, yet (3) males obtained the highest copulation success on sand, regardless of light level. Our results demonstrate that copulation in S. retrorsa is more likely to occur in environments with suboptimal vibratory signal transmission, irrespective of visual signal transmission. We suggest that these results point to (1) a minor role of bimodal (vibratory and visual) courtship signalling in S. retrorsa, (2) the importance of an additional signalling modality (most likely air particle movement), (3) a role of other substrate-dependent factors (e.g. predation risk), and/or (4) a reversed female preference for vibratory signalling.

AB Mating with close relatives often causes a decline in offspring fitness, termed inbreeding depression. Consequently, pre- and postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance mechanisms are likely to evolve, especially in females due to their relatively high levels of reproductive investment. If precopulatory inbreeding avoidance mechanisms are absent or unreliable, females may exploit postcopulatory sexually selected inbreeding avoidance mechanisms by mating with multiple males (polyandry). Despite this expectation, few studies have tested whether females alter their propensity to mate multiply in an inbreeding avoidance context. Here, we tested whether the perceived risk of inbreeding promotes polyandrous behaviour in guppies, Poecilia reticulata, a species susceptible to inbreeding depression. Virgin females were assigned to either a sibling or nonsibling mating and subsequently presented with three unrelated males simultaneously. Consistent with previous studies, we found that females did not discriminate between initially encountered males based on relatedness. However, females increased their propensity to mate multiply after mating with a brother. Subsequent paternity tests were performed to determine whether polyandry minimizes inbreeding through a dilution effect (i.e. greater number of sires in the related treatment) or through postcopulatory biasing mechanisms (i.e. greater paternity skew towards unrelated males). Surprisingly, our results supported neither scenario; we detected no significant difference in paternity skew or the number of sires between treatments. Overall, our study provides a rare example of females responding to an increased risk of inbreeding by increasing their propensity to remate, but the postcopulatory processes arising from this behaviour, along with the mechanisms underlying kin recognition, await further investigation.

AB Animals ranging from mammals to fishes and even invertebrates play. Although this behaviour has been shown to improve the physical condition and survival of juveniles, we do not know exactly how these benefits are achieved. The motor training hypothesis suggests that play helps animals develop their motor skills. The self-handicapping hypothesis suggests that animals build cognitive and emotional skills to prepare for the unexpected, by using play as a way to practise losing and regaining postural control. We conducted focal observations and recorded videos of play to examine the specific form and timing of locomotor play in mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus, and white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, fawns, so as to test predictions associated with these two hypotheses. Consistent with the motor training hypothesis, play peaked early in life (>= 3 weeks), which should coincide with development of the cerebellum and motor skills. These closely related species differ in antipredator tactics, so we predicted that they should display different motor patterns during play if it serves a motor training function. Although some characteristics reflected species-typical antipredator tactics (e.g. more 'signal bounds', leaps with long and high suspension, in white-tailed deer; more social play in mule deer), both species engaged in a similar amount of fast travel and similar rates of turns, traits that we expected to differ in line with their antipredator tactics. Consistent with the self-handicapping hypothesis, fawns of both species displayed high rates of nonfunctional manoeuvres, which were similar in form. However, these manoeuvres did not become more common as the fawns aged as expected if these help to develop the prefrontal cortex and cognitive skills. Our results suggest a refinement and blending of both hypotheses. Juveniles may play to develop similar motor skills rather than species-typical antipredator tactics, with nonfunctional manoeuvres to further promote the development of cognitive and motor skills during the early juvenile period.

AB Social cognition involves a wide range of processes, including the ability to recognize group members, to remember past interactions with them and to influence their behaviour strategically. Key arguments and findings in studies of the evolution of social cognition revolve around individuals flexibly and adaptively influencing the behaviour of others. One of the most effective ways of influencing the behaviour of others is through communication. Curiously, however, research focused on the evolution of social cognition rarely addresses communication in the species being studied. Here we describe four major hypotheses to explain the evolution of social cognition and, for each, raise specific predictions regarding communication and how it relates to social cognition. We argue that because communication is foundational to social cognition, studies of communication should be a core feature of future work on the evolution of social cognition.

AB The age of potential mates has been proposed to be an important target for mate choice by females. Alternative hypotheses predict preferences in either direction. Females might be expected to prefer older males because such males have demonstrated their capacity to survive. Alternatively, they might prefer younger males that have not accumulated deleterious mutations. Preferences in both directions have been observed in laboratory experiments, suggesting that this is an issue that needs to be understood within its ecological context. We measured individual behaviour and reproductive success in a natural population of the field cricket Gryllus campestris over 10 years. We found that in this annual insect, a male's age relative to his peers was poorly correlated with his life span. This suggests that there is limited potential for selection to favour female choice for older males because a strategy of choosing older males would not significantly increase a female's likelihood of mating with a long-lived male. Older males were more successful at pairing up with females at a burrow, but once paired they were less likely to mate with them. By genotyping the next generation of adults we confirmed that observations of both pairing up with a female and matings were associated with successful offspring production. However, there was no relationship between how old a male was at mating and how many adult offspring he had. This lack of evidence for any fitness benefits to females from mate choice in relation to male age was consistent with the observation that the age of males had opposite effects on their success in pairing up with females compared to their success in mating with them.

AB Reciprocal cooperation may evolve if the costs of help are reliably compensated for by delayed returns provided in future interactions. The associated probabilities and cost-benefit ratios may vary system-atically between the sexes, which often display different dispersal strategies and interaction patterns. Whereas female Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, are known to apply direct and generalized decision rules of reciprocal cooperation, the rules according to which males reciprocate favours are less well under-stood. Therefore, we investigated the cooperation propensity of male wild-type Norway rats. Male test rats experienced cooperating partners that provided food to them, or defecting partners that refused to provide help. Afterwards, test rats could donate food to previously experienced or unknown partners, resembling direct and generalized reciprocity paradigms, respectively. Male rats cooperated according to direct reciprocity, suggesting that this decision rule is similarly important for both sexes. However, whereas females additionally help according to generalized reciprocity, males did not apply this rule. These results suggest a sex difference in reciprocal decision rules, highlighting the potential importance of different interaction patterns and cost-benefit ratios between the sexes.

AB To resolve conflicts of interest, animals can vocally signal their resource-holding potential and motivation to compete. This allows conspecifics to adjust their behaviour to each other without fighting physically. Making sure that competitors correctly assess each other's vocal information requires mechanisms to prevent signal interference. Alternating calls with those of an opponent (i.e. waiting until the opponent's call has ended before starting to vocalize) is widely observed in animals and could be partly acquired through learning. Regardless of whether competitors interrupt conspecifics as a signal of dominance or by accident, the information transferred by the interrupted individual is likely to be partly blurred. Interrupted individuals would hence benefit from counterattacking by calling more intensely, indicating to their competitors that calling simultaneously is counterproductive. We tested this 'social feedback' hypothesis in the barn owl, Tyto alba, in which young siblings negotiate vocally over which individual will have priority access to the next food item delivered. It has already been shown that nestlings actively avoid interrupting each other, but it remains untested whether nestlings give social feedback when interrupted. To test this, we developed an 'automated interactive playback' which broadcast calls that either interrupted or did not interrupt the calls of a singleton nestling. When a playback call interrupted a nestling, this individual immediately intensified vocal communication by quickly producing a long call and by producing more calls. As previously shown, this reaction tends to silence competitors and thereby increases the individual's likelihood of obtaining the next food item. Such social feedback could reinforce the evolutionary stability of vocal sibling negotiation as a nonaggressive way to share food.

AB Predator-prey arms races ensure that a prey's defences are well matched with the predator's ability to overcome them. Scorpions have a formidable defensive capacity due to their venomous stinger. Mammalian and squamate scorpion predators overpower scorpions by making repeated attacks. We tested here how scorpions, Hadrurus arizonensis, apply their venom defensively during a simulated repeated attack, consisting of 10 consecutive challenges. Since the persistent repeated attack of a predator, even when stung in the process, seems to indicate its resolve, we expected defensive effort to increase with the number of challenges. We also expected that, owing to the life-and-death nature of a predatory attack, scorpions would be liberal in the use of their venom. We found, however, that stinging behaviour, venom use and venom volume all decreased as the number of challenges increased. Scorpions used only 7.8 +/- 9.6% (mean +/- SD) of their total venom volume during an attack consisting of 10 consecutive challenges. We conclude that a repeated attack seems an effective strategy for scorpion predators to reduce the defensive investment of scorpions. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ambient temperature varies on several timescales such as year, season and day and affects many reproductive traits of ectotherms. Thus, the direction and intensity of sexual selection should be affected by thermal conditions. However, the effects of temperature variation during mating events have sometimes been overlooked. We assessed traits associated with pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection in the cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne, using three thermal mating conditions: 19 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 31 degrees C. Thermal conditions did not affect precopulatory traits (mating rate, mating latency and courtship intensity). Mating duration increased with decreasing temperature, whereas the number of sperm transferred and female fecundity were greatest at 25 degrees C. To investigate whether these thermal differences affected the risk of sperm competition (remating rate) and fitness consequences for both sexes, we conducted double-mating experiments using a black colour mutant. Females that had first mated at low or high temperatures were more likely to accept remating and exhibited higher fecundity compared to females that rejected remating; when females remated, the paternity of the first male was highest at 25 degrees C. Thermal conditions at the first mating event affected the fitness consequences for both sexes, irrespective of the females' remating acceptance. Changes to the thermal conditions for the female remating event caused no difference in the female remating rate or fecundity; however, the paternity of the second mate was highest at the intermediate temperature, and this could be attributed to the decreased sperm transfer at low and high temperatures. Our results suggest that temperature conditions during mating affect postcopulatory processes in L. serricorne. In particular, when females first mated at extreme temperatures, polyandry was promoted, potentially favouring males with higher sperm competitive ability through increased likelihood and intensity of sperm competition.

AB In some ways, social spiders are a biological novelty item. They are not extraordinarily successful either evolutionarily or ecologically, and their societies suffer a variety of disadvantages that render them more brittle than other social systems. Yet, from an empiricist's perspective, these attributes make them uniquely poised for addressing a variety of research questions. Here we provide a brief overview of the biology of social spiders for the general reader. We then highlight a variety of ecological and evolutionary challenges suffered by these animals that renders them at risk of extinction in the short and long term. We finally discuss how these hardships have given rise to a variety of individual and group level adaptations that are rare or entirely absent in other spiders, as well as in most other social animals. Throughout this article, we highlight gaps in our current understanding of these creatures and draw attention to some of the more promising frontiers for future research. To this end, we have two goals. First, we would like to draw the attention of general behavioural ecologists interested in social evolution to the biology of social spiders, and emphasize a variety of reasons why one might consider these animals for their next research question. Second, for those already inculcated in the social spider literature, we hope that this article will raise the reader's consciousness to various underexplored but promising avenues for future research. With the right research question, social spiders promise to be a high-profile and high-throughput model system.

   FORMICIDAE; ENVIRONMENTS
AB Cooperatively foraging groups have two sequential goals: to find food and thereafter efficiently exploit or retrieve it. Previous research has largely focused on searching behaviours of individuals or organization of food retrieval processes, rather than on how groups initially distribute themselves to find ephemeral food items that are unpredictable in time and space. In the present study, we examined how Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, search environments in anticipation of food appearing briefly in areas with differing spatial complexity. Nests were connected to three foraging arenas containing 1, 9 or 25 cells. Food appeared briefly in one cell each day, either randomly or more predictably in distant cells (but equally often in each arena). We recorded the number of ants in cells when food had not been recently present, and thereafter whether ants successfully located the food when presented. Surprisingly, as food location became more predictable, ants found it less frequently. Foragers were located more often in cells closer to the nest (i.e. at information 'choke points' that returning foragers needed to traverse), and in cells with higher connectivity and greater centralness within foraging arenas. Such distributions reduce search coverage area but likely increase information transmission. Thus, it appears that L. humile foragers distribute themselves to favour rapid recruitment when food is found rather than maximizing food encounter rates. Although the reduced foraging success with more predictably located food suggests that ants did not adjust expectations in a Bayesian manner within arenas towards individual cells, they did appear Bayesian across arenas. Because foragers missed food more often in higher-complexity arenas than in lower-complexity arenas, this could increase perceptions that the latter are more rewarding. Shifts in distributions were consistent with such biased perceptions. Future studies to determine whether other group-foraging species use analogous solutions would be highly useful.

AB Learned aspects of song affect female mating preferences in a number of species of songbirds, including swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana. One explanation for why female songbirds attend to such song features is that these song attributes convey information on the general cognitive ability of singers. The fact that song attributes and cognitive ability are affected during development by the same stressors makes a connection between the two plausible. Here we test the hypothesis that song is a signal of cognitive ability by relating five measures of song quality to five measures of cognitive performance in 49 captive male swamp sparrows. The five song measures are repertoire size, mean and minimum vocal deviation (measures of vocal performance), and mean and maximum typicality (measures of song learning). Cognitive performance was measured as the speed with which five cognitive tasks were mastered: a novel foraging task, a colour association, a colour reversal, a spatial learning problem and a detour-reaching test. In general linear mixed models controlling for neophobia, none of the song measures were predictive of any of the cognitive performance measures. Thus the results do not support the hypothesis that song attributes signal general cognition in swamp sparrows. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Female copulation calls are species specific, distinct vocal signals sometimes given during or shortly after mating. Despite being common in primates and despite much empirical work, their function remains largely unclear for most species. Here, we used an information-theoretic approach to examine simultaneously three main competing hypotheses for the evolution of copulation calls. Two of the three hypotheses predict that female copulation calls function to incite competition between males, either directly (the male-male competition hypothesis) or indirectly (the sperm competition hypothesis), while the third predicts that females use calls to choose mating partners (the female choice hypothesis). We collected data on copulations of wild female olive baboons in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to compare the relative support for these hypotheses by modelling whether or not females produced copulation calls after mounts. Our analytical approach enabled us to objectively rank models corresponding to the three hypotheses according to how well our data fitted the models. Our data favoured the sperm competition hypothesis over the female choice hypothesis although much variation in calling remained unexplained. The maleemale competition hypothesis seems unlikely given our data. We also discuss the possibility that copulation calls have no function, functions not included in our analysis, or that they are multifunctional, a reflection of the species' social evolution history.

AB The response of prey to predation threats is often plastic and can vary with the individual's perceived level of threat. To determine whether prey escape responses can be modulated by background levels of risk or short-term acute risk, we maintained juvenile damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, under high-or low-risk background conditions for several days and then exposed them to an acute risk (high-risk alarm cues or a low-risk saltwater control) minutes prior to startling them with a mechanical disturbance. Fish responded in one of two ways: they either made a C-start escape response or backed away from the threat. While exposure to either background high risk or acute high risk increased the proportion of C-starters, surprisingly the frequency of C-starters decreased when background high risk and acute risk types were combined. Exposure to an acute high-risk cue increased the escape performance for both types of escape responses. However, when the acute high-risk cue occurred within high-risk background conditions, this only increased the performance of C-start escape responses. Non-C-starters reacted similarly in both background risk conditions. Background risk and acute risk acted in a simple additive manner, as seen by the lack of interaction between the two factors. Results showed that escape responses are amplified as the level of perceived risk increases. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pair bonds can provide social benefits to long-term monogamous species alongside their benefits for reproduction. However, little is known about when these bonds form, in particular how long they are present before breeding. Previous studies of pair formation in long-term monogamous birds have been rather data-limited, but for many migratory birds they report pair formation on the wintering grounds. We provide the first systematic investigation of prebreeding association patterns of long-term monogamous pairs by examining entire life histories based on tracking data of migratory whooping cranes, Grus americana. We found that a substantial portion (62%) of breeding pairs started associating at least 12 months before first breeding, with 16 of 58 breeding pairs beginning to associate over 2 years before first breeding. For most pairs, these associations with future breeding partners also became unique and distinguishable from association patterns with nonpartner individuals 12 months before first breeding. In addition, 60% of pair associations began before at least one partner had reached nominal sexual maturity. Most pairs began associating in the late spring upon arrival at the summer grounds, while associations beginning at other times of the year were rare. Patterns in the associations of pairs prior to breeding can point to the potential benefits of prebreeding relationships, for instance providing support in competitive interactions or increasing partner familiarity.

AB Characterization of the phenotypic differentiation and genetic basis of traits that can contribute to reproductive isolation is an important avenue to understand the mechanisms of speciation. We quantified the degree of prezygotic isolation and geographical variation in mating behaviour among four populations of Sepsis neocynipsea that occur in allopatry, parapatry or sympatry with four populations of its sister species Sepsis cynipsea. To obtain insights into the quantitative genetic basis and the role of selection against hybrid phenotypes we also investigated mating behaviour of F-1 hybrid offspring and corresponding backcrosses with the parental populations. Our study documents successful hybridization under laboratory conditions, with low copulation frequencies in heterospecific pairings but higher frequencies in pairings of F-1 hybrids signifying hybrid vigour. Analyses of F-1 offspring and their parental backcrosses provided little evidence for sexual selection against hybrids. Longer copulation latencies in heterospecific pairings indicate species recognition, probably due to surface or volatile chemicals. The frequency of male mating attempts did not differ greatly between species or hybrid pairings, suggesting no male discrimination of mating partners. Female shaking duration, signifying female choice and/or reluctance to mate, differed strongly between the species and appears to contribute to avoiding heterospecific males; this trait is partially maternal inherited. Importantly, females of both species discriminated more strongly against males in areas of sympatry than allopatry indicating reinforcement. Shorter copulations in heterospecific parental pairings and longer copulations in F-1 hybrids suggest mechanistic difficulties with sperm transfer. Overall, our study highlights an important role of character displacement affecting mating behaviour of hybridizing sepsid species in geographical areas of coexistence.

AB Many animals rely on movement for survival and reproduction. Directed movements incur metabolic costs, however, and animals adjust their behaviour to optimize energy expenditures in different abiotic conditions. Physical flows and solar radiation vary over time and space and influence animal behaviour at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Here, I quantify the effects of wind speed, wind direction, ambient temperature and sun position on the fine-scale movement ecology and perch orientation of a widespread damselfly, Enallagma doubledayi. Through field observations, I found that damselflies fly, forage and engage competitors in territorial interactions more often in calm rather than windy conditions. Furthermore, perched damselflies exhibit rheotaxis, in which individuals typically face into the wind, presumably to minimize biomechanical costs associated with drag and possibly to detect inbound prey on the water surface and in the air column. In contrast, ambient temperature and the position of the sun were largely unassociated with activity levels and damselfly orientation. At higher ambient temperatures, however, perched odonates faced the sun with increasing consistency, perhaps to thermoregulate by minimizing exposure to solar radiation. Taken together, these findings suggest that damselflies preferentially fly when the ratio of animal speed to wind speed is high and adjust their perch orientation to minimize energy loss. These findings strengthen conceptual links between activity budgets and perch orientation strategies among animals in variable abiotic conditions.

AB Most songbirds learn their songs through imitation. However, what a male sings as an adult is not necessarily a complete inventory of what he memorized at some earlier point in time: songbirds commonly memorize more material than they eventually sing as adults. Work with swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, first confirmed that males rehearse many of the song models to which they are exposed during the sensory phase of song acquisition but subsequently include only a subset of those rehearsed songs in their adult repertoire. This process of overproduction and selective attrition has since been demonstrated in other species as well. More recently, the persistent memory of tutor songs rehearsed but not included in the adult repertoire has been demonstrated at the neural level. Furthermore, memories of song models heard during the sensory phase of acquisition but never detected during rehearsal in the sensorimotor phase also may persist into adulthood. Here we review behavioural and neural studies of overproduction and attrition in song learning. We discuss factors that may trigger the persistence of some models and the rejection of others in an individual's repertoire and possible functional consequences of this phenomenon. Data from human speech research indicates that humans also may unconsciously retain memories of features of languages heard early in life but never spoken.

AB Hot tropical environments constrain ectotherm mating opportunities when mate selection occurs on the surface. Thus, microhabitats and refugia can become a qualitative trait in mate selection. In fiddler crabs, the enlarged claw of males can act as a heat sink, which becomes advantageous when surface temperatures reach 50 degrees C during the day and crabs are actively seeking to mate. Uca mjoebergi females prefer male burrows found in the shade; therefore, we investigated the thermal constraints imposed on males and females in shaded and unshaded habitats. Crab surface activity decreased and body temperature increased as the day progressed, with more crabs active in shaded than sunny microhabitats. Body temperature was lower in male crabs found in burrows relative to crabs on the surface. Male claw size explained 10% of body temperature. Our results add further support to the hypothesis that thermal constraints imposed on males can be overcome by the large claw acting as a heat sink and the burrow acting as a refuge from heat. Classic sexually selected traits, including ornaments and behaviours, can have a secondary purpose in thermoregulation. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Recent studies have suggested that parasitic cuckoos have evolved laying behaviour resulting in matching of host and cuckoo eggs by choosing to lay eggs in host nests with host eggs that match the cuckoo eggs as an adaptation against egg recognition by the hosts. However, previous studies provided weak and indirect evidence with mixed results, leaving this question unresolved. Here, for the first time, we developed a robust methodology to provide unambiguous evidence that egg recognition in the host does not select for optimal egg matching during laying by the cuckoo. By using experiments that attracted parasitism, we showed that cuckoos, Cuculus canorus, indiscriminately laid eggs in oriental reed warbler, Acrocephalus orientalis, host nests containing real host eggs, egg-shaped models, stick models or coin models without any preference. Furthermore, cuckoos only selected to lay their eggs in nests with active hosts. These experiments provide evidence of cuckoos being indiscriminate in their choice of host nests, implying that coevolution of the egg phenotype of host and cuckoo eggs must have arisen from mechanisms other than matching of host eggs and those of the parasite.

AB Both maternal and offspring fitness would be higher if the offspring develop in a high-quality habitat than in a low-quality habitat. In animals without direct maternal care, it seems reasonable that either mothers or offspring should invest in finding the best habitat. Recent research, however, suggests extensive maternal and offspring exploration in fruit flies. We considered two hypotheses that could resolve this paradox, first that mothers do not choose oviposition sites that maximize larval success but rather sites that maximize their own fitness or egg survival, and, second, that the winged mothers make decisions over a larger spatial scale than the less mobile larvae are capable of. In a set of experiments, we found that larvae were more likely to explore when they hatched in poor patches lacking protective cavities and live yeast. Egg-laying females, however, also showed strong preferences for ovipositing in cavities with live yeast. These results provided no support for the first hypothesis. We then considered whether females are sensitive to larval travel costs between cavities and live yeast as suggested by the second hypothesis. We found no effect of the distance between the two patches on female oviposition choice, but we did find an effect of the intervening substrate. Females overwhelmingly preferred to lay in the cavity when the intervening substrate was an agar medium, but not when the intervening substrate was bare plastic that discourages larval travel. Therefore, we resolve the paradox of extensive exploration by both mothers and offspring by showing that larvae that hatch in habitats that are desirable to ovipositing females, but not to the larvae, can reasonably assume that there are better food patches within a safe travel distance. That is, there is an adaptive sharing of exploration between mothers and offspring. The exploration sharing hypothesis is pertinent for a large variety of species in which mothers oviposit in sites suboptimal for larval growth.

AB Adaptive performance of social behaviours requires the temporally precise activation of the relevant neural circuits based on the state of the environment. The actions of steroid hormones such as testosterone and its metabolites are critical in this activation for many social behaviours, especially those related to reproduction. Androgens, specifically androgenic action in the periphery, have been strongly implicated in regulating features of social behaviours that are considered to be especially important in mate attraction. Nevertheless, we currently have a relatively poor understanding of the different roles of steroid hormones in the regulation of social behaviour and its relevance to sexually selected traits. Here, we treat male canaries, Serinus canaria, with bicalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, we isolated androgen action to the periphery in order to target the syrinx, the avian vocal production organ. Bicalutamide treatment reduced song complexity but not song acoustic stereotypy. Bicalutamide-treated birds also showed reduced performance of 'special trills' and disrupted special syllable morphology. The performance and complexity of special trills in particular are able to stimulate copulation solicitation displays in female canaries to a substantially higher degree than any other component of canary song. These results highlight the nonredundant actions of steroid hormones in coordinating features of a complex behavioural pattern into an adaptive response, and suggest that androgen receptor expression in the relevant peripheral organs acts as a substrate on which sexual selection acts to amplify features of reproductive behaviours directly related to mate attraction.

AB In captive conditions (e.g. zoos), some Carnivora species typically show negligible stereotypic behaviour (SB) and reproduce successfully, while others tend to reproduce poorly and be very stereotypic. We used comparative methods to identify species level risk factors for SB and captive infant mortality (CIM). Candidate predictor variables were natural ranging behaviour, territoriality, aspects of natural foraging, wild activity levels, cranial volume and IUCN Red List status. Previous research had identified naturally long daily travel distances and being large-bodied and wide ranging as SB risk factors. We nearly doubled the size of this original SB database, and then imposed stricter quality controls (e.g. on minimum sample sizes for inclusion). Analysing the resulting 23 species data set confirmed naturally large ranges and travel distances as risk factors. It also showed that the range size effect is independent of body mass (although body mass and range size together predicted SB most strongly), is stronger for stereotypic route tracing (e.g. pacing) than for all SB forms combined, and explains the apparent daily travel distance effect (which vanished when range size was controlled for). Furthermore, naturally long chase distances during hunts now also predicted more severe route tracing. Previous research had also identified naturally long travel distances and large home ranges as risk factors for CIM. We failed to replicate this, or to confidently identify any species level risk factor (despite CIM significantly varying between related species, at least for Canidae and Ursidae). Understanding what underlies high species-typical CIM thus requires more data and further research. Overall, naturally wide-ranging Carnivora with long chase distances are thus most prone to extensive stereotypic route tracing in captivity. This suggests that captive carnivores cannot relinquish aspects of ranging and pursuit hunting, even when their homeostatic needs are met, and also suggests new strategies for environmentally enriching their enclosures more effectively.

AB Same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) represents an emergent trait of two interacting same-sex individuals. Although empirical studies have investigated how social environments can influence SSB, little is known about the effect of the interacting partner and its associated phenotype on SSB. In species where females are larger than males or males express male-specific behaviour, a male's morphology or behaviour can serve as a way for other males to recognize its sex and express SSBs. Here we used both a trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test for the effect of the interacting male's identity and his multivariate phenotype on SSB, using water striders, Gerris lacustris, as a model. We repeatedly subjected males to dyadic interactions with the same and different partners and measured their SSBs. We used the variance-partitioning approach to estimate the partner's identity effect, and the trait-based approach to assess which trait of the partner explains changes in SSB. We found that the partner's SSB reduced the tendency of males to show SSB. SSB was affected by their interacting partner's identity, but the partner effect was not due to the repeatable components ('personality') of the partner's SSB. Males also did not differ in their responses to variation in the partner's SSB at different levels (between-partner, or partner 'personality', and within-partner levels, or partner 'plasticity'). Taken together, these findings provide the first empirical evidence that SSB can be plastically expressed in response to traits in social partners. We also highlight the usefulness of combining the trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test whether partners represent a component of the social environment affecting the expression of labile traits.

AB Recent studies have shown that fertilization success in external fertilization systems is influenced by differences in the temporal and spatial positions of competing males at ejaculation, as is the case for internal fertilization systems. Little is known about how these positions differ between competitors. We tackled this issue in the triplefin fish Enneapterygius etheostoma, which spawns in turbulent flow environments, and which employs external fertilization and alternative reproductive tactics (i.e. sneakers and territorial males). A frame-by-frame analysis of video images of sneaking behaviours recorded in the wild revealed that sneakers ejaculated later, and further from the spawning female, than territorial males. The majority of sneaking attempts failed because of attacks by territorial males. Successful sneakers mostly hid behind shelters around the spawning sites and then rushed into the site (i.e. were undetected), or were detected and attacked as they approached the site or hid near it, but rushed in anyway (attack-initiated sneaking). Of the undetected successful sneakers, a minority rushed in when the spawning female was being ignored by a territorial male that was attacking other sneakers (induced sneaking) and the others rushed in when there was no territorial attack (attack-free sneaking). Attack-free sneaking was carried out by sneakers that hid closer to the spawning female for longer, and were spatially and temporally closer to territorial males at ejaculation. Altogether, we conclude that the abilities to get past territorial vigilance and observe gamete release of spawning pairs at a hiding place are key factors that helped sneakers to improve their position at ejaculation, and thus perhaps their fertilization success.

AB Investigations of the mechanisms underlying the process of sexual selection historically have focused on female mate choice and male competition. More recently, however, male mate choice has been demonstrated to be an important mechanism in a variety of taxonomic groups, yet our understanding of the role of male age in male mate choice decisions has lagged behind. Here we examined the age-related mate choice decisions of young and old male wolf spiders (Schizocosa retrorsa). We observed male courtship behaviour during encounters with female dragline silk deposited by either virgin female spiders or less receptive and potentially more sexually cannibalistic mated females. Young male spiders were choosy in their deployment of courtship efforts, courting and engaging in grooming chemo-exploration more in response to silk deposited by virgin females than to silk deposited by mated females and spending less time on silk of mated females. However, these preferences for virgin female silk were absent in trials with males in the old age class. Our results suggest that male age and variation in the costs of courtship and reproductive behaviour interact to generate age-related changes in male mate choice behaviour.

AB The process of seed dispersal is influenced by animals' responses to seeds with different traits. Seed size/mass is one of the key seed traits affecting animal-mediated seed dispersal. Although seed size is usually positively correlated with seed mass, it is not clear whether the two seed traits show similar effects on seed choice and seed dispersal by animals. In the present study, we artificially manipulated nuts of Juglans mandshurica to create two types of seeds: (1) seeds of the same size but different mass and (2) seeds of the same mass but different size. Our aim was to explore whether food-hoarding animals respond differently to seed size and mass. Our results showed that seed size was more important than seed mass in determining seed removal by wood mice, Apodemus peninsulae. However, the larger red squirrels, Sciurus vulgaris, evaluated seed profitability based on mass rather than size. Moreover, seed mass showed consistent positive effects on seed dispersal distances of J. mandshurica by both A. peninsulae and S. vulgaris. Our results indicate that the effects of seed size and mass on seed dispersal processes are not always consistently correlated. In addition, seed dispersers of different size show different responses to given seed traits such as size or mass. More effort should be made to investigate the role of seed traits and seed dispersers in seed dispersal systems. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Because collective movements have fitness consequences for all participants, group travel can impose conflicts of interest when group-mates vary. Challenges associated with coordinating activities of group-mates, such as during travel, may potentially be mitigated through the use of simple rules governing leadership and other behaviours to minimize conflict. Although individuals living in groups with fission-fusion dynamics may temporarily separate, leadership determination at subsequent reunions, and events occurring during reunions, are poorly understood. Here we investigate leadership during travel prior to reunions of spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, living in one large social group in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Whereas individuals often arrived at dens or joined hunting parties alone, those joining others to participate in group defence of shared resources typically did so when accompanied by group-mates. Although most hyaenas led processions, the attributes of members within each travelling party consistently predicted leadership roles. The highest-ranking adult within each travelling subgroup, often a lactating female, typically assumed the vanguard position prior to reunions. Reunions promoted conflict, particularly at kills. However, as predicted by the conflict mitigation hypothesis, individuals that greeted conspecifics were significantly less likely to fight at reunions than were hyaenas that failed to greet at reunions. Thus, whereas temporary separations may reduce immediate conflicts of interest in fission-fusion societies, hyaenas pay consensus costs at subsequent reunions, particularly in the context of feeding competition, and greetings appear to reduce such costs. Finally, we propose a novel scheme for leadership categorization in which leadership depends on whether or not leadership is based on specific attributes of individual group members. We apply this attribute-based framework to quantify the patterns and mechanisms of leadership during group travel for 52 species of mammals, including the spotted hyaenas studied here, and place findings in a broad evolutionary context.

AB Many species are able to learn to associate behaviours with rewards as this gives fitness advantages in changing environments. Social interactions between population members may, however, require more cognitive abilities than simple trial-and-error learning, in particular the capacity to make accurate hypotheses about the material payoff consequences of alternative action combinations. It is unclear in this context whether natural selection necessarily favours individuals to use information about payoffs associated with nontried actions (hypothetical payoffs), as opposed to simple reinforcement of realized payoff. Here, we develop an evolutionary model in which individuals are genetically determined to use either trial-and-error learning or learning based on hypothetical reinforcements, and ask what is the evolutionarily stable learning rule under pairwise symmetric two-action stochastic repeated games played over the individual's lifetime. We analyse through stochastic approximation theory and simulations the learning dynamics on the behavioural timescale, and derive conditions where trial-and-error learning outcompetes hypothetical reinforcement learning on the evolutionary timescale. This occurs in particular under repeated cooperative interactions with the same partner. By contrast, we find that hypothetical reinforcement learners tend to be favoured under random interactions, but stable polymorphisms can also obtain where trial-and-error learners are maintained at a low frequency. We conclude that specific game structures can select for trial-and-error learning even in the absence of costs of cognition, which illustrates that cost-free increased cognition can be counterselected under social interactions.

AB Animal activities, such as foraging and reproduction, are constrained by decisions about how to allocate energy and time efficiently. Overall, male moths invest less in reproduction than females, but they are thought to engage in a scramble competition for access to females that advertise readiness to mate by releasing sexual pheromones. However, before male moths can follow the pheromone, they often need to heat their flight muscles by shivering to produce sufficient power for sustained flight. Here, we show that Helicoverpa zea males that sense the female pheromone at high ambient temperatures take off with higher thoracic temperature, shiver for less time and warm up faster than males tested at lower ambient temperatures. These higher take-off temperatures translate into higher airspeeds, underscoring the importance of thoracic temperature for flight performance. Furthermore, shorter combined duration for warm-up and pheromone-mediated optomotor anemotaxis is consistent with the idea that males engage in scramble competition for access to females in nature. Our results strongly suggest that male moths minimize the time between perceiving the female's pheromone signal and arriving at the source by optimizing thermoregulatory behaviour and temperature-dependent flight performance in accordance with ambient temperature conditions. Our finding that moths engage in a trade-off between rapid flight initiation and suboptimal flight performance suggests a sensorimotor control mechanism that involves a complex interaction with the thermal environment.

AB Social organization is widespread; even largely solitary species must organize themselves to enable contacts with mates and reduce competition with conspecifics. Although the forms of social structure can be subtle in solitary species, understanding the factors that influence them may be important for understanding how different forms of social organization evolved. We investigated the influence of genetic relatedness and spatial structure on social associations in a solitary living Australian scincid lizard, Tiliqua rugosa. We derived the genetic relatedness of 46 lizards from analysis of genotypes at 15 microsatellite DNA loci, and described social networks from GPS locations of all the lizards every 10 min for 81 days during their main activity period of the year. We found that connected male dyads were significantly more related than expected by chance, whereas connected male-female and female-female dyads had lower relatedness than expected. Among neighbouring male-male and male-female dyads, the strongest social relationships were between lizards that were the least related. Explanations of this pattern may include the avoidance of inbreeding in male-female dyads, or the direction of aggressive behaviour towards less related individuals in male-male dyads. Observed social associations (inferred through synchronous spatial proximity) were generally lower than expected from null models derived from home range overlap, and many close neighbours did not make social contact. This supports our hypothesis for the presence of deliberate avoidance between some neighbouring individuals. We suggest that lizards can discriminate between different levels of relatedness in their neighbours, directing their social interactions towards those that are less related. This highlights differences in how social associations are formed between species that are solitary (where associations form between unrelated conspecifics) and species that maintain stable social groups structured by kinship.

AB Single walking bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, were trained in an arena to localize a feeding site using a local cue (blue cardboard) and/or extramaze visual signals, in this case a panorama. The bees reliably chose the local cue in combination with the panorama location. When the local cue and the panorama location were dissociated by rotating the panorama by 90 degrees they preferred the local cue, and they travelled preferentially from the local cue to the quadrant of the panorama location. Training the bees to a location defined only by its spatial relation to the panorama led to a choice preference for the respective quadrant within the first minute of active time, indicating that the panorama was sufficient for spatial guidance although it was not as salient a stimulus as the local cue. The bees steered towards the respective locations from any direction. We interpret our results as evidence for spatial learning with reference to both a local visual cue and a pattern of extramaze signals although the local cue was a more salient stimulus. This laboratory procedure for studying two basic forms of navigation should be useful for future attempts to unravel neural correlates of navigation in a central place foraging insect.

AB A male-specific major urinary protein named darcin is attractive to female mice, Mus musculus, stimulates a learned attraction to volatile components of a male's urinary odour and induces spatial learning. In this article we show that darcin also induces learned attraction for a previously neutral olfactory stimulus (the odorant isoamyl acetate), acquired by repeated presentation of both stimuli together. We hypothesize that this is a case of olfactory-vomeronasal associative learning, in which darcin acts as the unconditioned reinforcer. However, the presence of darcin is not always attractive to adult female mice. Urine from males parasitized by the nematode Aspiculuris tetraptera has no attractive value for females, despite apparently normal presence of darcin. The loss of attractive value may be due to unknown infection-derived chemicals whose detection overrides the attraction induced by darcin, or prevents detection of darcin by other (unknown) mechanisms. Other cases in which male urine (and thus the presence of darcin) does not induce attraction are discussed, namely in lactating females, which respond with aggression towards intruder males, and in prepubertal females, which show aversive responses towards unfamiliar male urine. Thus, although the darcin sex pheromone induces attraction in adult female mice that does not need to be learned, such innate pheromonal responses can be modulated by the physiological or health status of the sender and receiver. This provides a degree of flexibility in response to pheromonal signals, but such that individuals of the same class or status still share consistent predictable responses to improve their reproductive fitness. Further, by readily inducing the same response towards other odorants through associative learning, pheromones can also target responses flexibly towards odour signatures at an individual-specific level.

AB In some insects, eusociality has evolved independently more than once, such that closely related species differ in the presence or absence of altruistic traits. Such groups offer opportunities to study the ecological and evolutionary drivers of transitions to sociality. In Pemphigus aphids, for example, eusociality has evolved independently multiple times, but most species are assumed to be nonsocial. Eusocial aphids thus typically have close relatives that are nonsocial, indicating a rapid and distinct transition to sociality. However, there has been only limited study of the behaviour of nonsocial species that permit direct comparisons with eusocial species. In this study, we characterized three aphid species along two axes of social behaviour: housekeeping and defence. Previous evidence suggested that these three species differ in the presence or absence of social traits. We found that for the ecological and behavioural traits we tested, there were quantifiable differences between social and nonsocial species. However, there was no clear threshold that differentiated social from nonsocial species, meaning that definitions of sociality in aphids depend in part on the traits that are measured. If sociality is measured by defence, for example, the eusocial species, Pemphigus obesinymphae clearly expressed the greatest degree of aggressive and effective defence. However, some defensive behaviour was also present in the species traditionally defined as nonsocial. Conversely, if sociality in aphids is measured by traits related to homeostasis and housekeeping, then the species traditionally considered nonsocial expressed nearly the same behaviours as the eusocial species. These results imply that sociality in aphids evolves as a collection of uncorrelated traits. Clear analogues or antecedents of more derived social characters can be identified in species that are nominally nonsocial. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Food-for-protection mutualisms can provide resources that subsidize ecological dominance, although their stability often depends on the nutritional match between the traded food and traits to which it is allocated. A well-studied food-for-protection mutualism is the protection by Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, of hemipteran mutualists in return for honeydew, which is generally assumed to be a nutritionally imbalanced food, high in carbohydrates and low in protein. We tested an alternative hypothesis, that the nutritional value of honeydew depends on the composition of life history traits related to survival (worker maintenance) and colony growth (brood production). Using a factorial design, we manipulated ant colony access to aphids, baseline levels of nutritional deprivation, and, by adding or subtracting queens, the ability to invest in growth. We found that aphid access primarily benefited colonies on high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets, suggesting colony nutritional state influences the value of aphid associations. Unexpectedly, we found that worker survival and brood production were positively correlated across treatments, and both decreased with the ants' percentage of nitrogen mass, a proxy for body protein. Moreover, the workers' percentage of fat mass was generally lower in brood-producing colonies, particularly in high-protein treatments, suggesting strong competition among investments for limited carbohydrates. These results suggest that carbohydrate access generally constrains Argentine ant life history and clarifies the links between the nutritional composition of food rewards and the stability of ecologically important mutualisms.

AB Prey species have to balance their foraging and vigilance behaviour in order to maximize nutritional and energetic intake while avoiding predation. Anthropogenic noise, a ubiquitous form of human disturbance, has the potential to influence antipredator behaviour through its effects on predator detection and perceived risk. Noise might increase perceived risk as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis, reduce risk by providing protection from disturbance-sensitive predators, or have no effect on antipredator behaviour if animals are tolerant of nonlethal forms of human disturbance. Road traffic is a pervasive source of anthropogenic noise, but few studies have experimentally isolated the effects of road noise on behaviour. Using systematic playback experiments, we investigated the influence of traffic noise on foraging and vigilance in a keystone species in North American prairie systems, the prairie dog, Cynomys ludovicianus. Exposure to road traffic noise significantly lowered aboveground activity, reduced foraging and increased vigilance, as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis. These effects were prevalent irrespective of temperature, a strong influence on such behaviours, and they were consistent across the 3-month study period, providing no evidence of habituation. Our results provide the first experimental investigation of the potential costs of this ubiquitous disturbance in a free-ranging mammal, demonstrating that road noise can alter key survival behaviours of this ecologically pivotal species. These findings highlight that the presence of animals in a location is no guarantee of population and ecological integrity, while also underlining the potential synergistic impacts of noise on a species that has already experienced severe declines across its historic range due to human disturbance. Globally, roadways have profound impacts on biodiversity, and quantifying the behavioural and fitness costs associated with different forms of disturbance such as noise is crucial for mitigation.

AB Divorce and breeding dispersal are key life history parameters that can be influenced by, and in turn have an influence on, the structure of populations. Variation in these parameters in small populations can potentially play an important role in the colonization of new areas, yet to date there has been little empirical investigation of this process. We studied the circumstances surrounding divorce in a newly established population of black sparrowhawks, Accipiter melanoleucus, on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa over an 11-year period between 2001 and 2012. Divorce was more likely following breeding failure and individuals that divorced and dispersed improved their subsequent breeding success. Territory quality had no influence on the frequency of divorce, and dispersing individuals did not move to territories of higher quality. During the study period the population size increased approximately three-fold, but because the range expanded, nest density did not increase significantly. In the first half of the study (2001-2006), divorce rates were low (4%) compared with rates previously reported for raptors and other birds. In the latter half (2007-2012) divorce rates were 14%. Although there was weak support for a difference in divorce rates between these two periods there was no evidence that divorce rates varied with population size or nesting density. Our results suggest that adaptive hypotheses ('better option' or 'incompatibility') best explain patterns of divorce in this expanding population and that potential feedbacks between divorce and population processes were unlikely to have played an important role during the growth of this recently established population.

AB The hypothesis that obligate eusociality always evolved from ancestral states of strict lifetime monogamy implies that (1) facultatively eusocial lineages had to abandon multifemale breeding to achieve permanent morphologically differentiated castes, and (2) lineages of obligatorily eusocial insects had to independently re-evolve multifemale breeding when that served the inclusive fitness interests of nursing workers. Multiqueen nesting (eusocial polygyny) is known to be common across the ants, but rare in the corbiculate (eusocial) bees, the vespine wasps and the higher termites, but we show that this difference is mostly due to cases of obligate polygyny being restricted to the ants. This pattern is remarkably similar to the distribution of inquiline social parasites that use stealth rather than aggression to invade host colonies, which also repeatedly evolved in ants only. We explore the lineage-specific selection forces that have allowed or constrained de novo evolution of stable eusocial polygyny in Hamiltonian inclusive fitness terms. We argue that perennial life histories, male survival as stored sperm rather than as lifetime mates, and sib competition are possibly sufficient to explain the general prevalence of secondary polygyny across the obligatorily eusocial insects. We infer that obligate polygyny compromises eusocial 'soma' and 'germ-line' segregation in ways known to decrease developmental stability in metazoans, and we briefly evaluate the selection forces that reduce queen life span in highly, but probably not facultatively, polygynous species. We conclude that secondary polygyny in its obligate (ant) form resembles cooperative breeding with multiple 'tragedy of the commons' aspects, but in a peculiar manner because breeding females are selected to exploit the services of unmated workers rather than each other's. This breeding system has likely been maintained in ants because it allows modular extensions of colonies in directly adjacent habitat of similar quality without the re-emergence of sexual conflicts or unproductive local competition with kin.

AB Personality change in nonhuman primates is a topic that warrants more research attention. Many studies focus on intraindividual repeatability, but few note population-wide trends in personality change. In part, this results from the large sample size that is required to detect such trends. In the present study, we measured personality in a large sample (N = 293) of adult, mother-reared pigtailed macaques, Macaca nemestrina, over a period of 3 years. We looked at four personality components (sociability towards humans, cautiousness, aggressiveness and fearfulness) derived from behavioural observations at two to four time points per subject. We found these components to have repeatabilities similar to those reported elsewhere in the literature. We then analysed population-wide changes in personality components over time using a linear mixed effects model with three predictors: entry age at the current primate facility, tenure at the primate facility at the time of the first personality test and time elapsed since the first personality test. We found that adult personality changed with life experiences (here, tenure at the facility where tested) and age. Throughout adulthood, pigtailed macaques became less cautious and more aggressive. At the same time, subjects became less cautious and more sociable with increasing time in individual caging at the current primate research facility. We also found that individuals differed significantly in their personality consistency. Other researchers may benefit by applying similar methodology to that described here as they extrapolate about personality measures over time.

AB The effect of sexual selection on nonsexual fitness is a major unanswered question in evolutionary biology that may have important implications for adaptation, diversification and the evolution of mate preferences. If reproductive success is condition dependent, the resulting sexual selection will tend to align with natural selection, promoting adaptation. One prediction under such a scenario is that adaptation to a novel environment should increase male mating success and hence sexual fitness. Environmentally induced plasticity in mate preferences could also contribute to an alignment of natural and sexual selection if the changes cause females to prefer locally adapted males as mates. We tested for both forms of alignment using a set of 10 independent populations of Drosophila melanogaster that were adapted to one of two environments. Competitive mating trials were performed between pairs of populations adapted to these two environments, with the trials designed to separate the effects of local adaptation on male mating success from plasticity of female mate preferences in response to these environments. Contrary to expectations under an alignment of natural and sexual selection, males did not have higher mating success when competing in the environment to which they were adapted. Furthermore, there was no evidence that females altered their mate choice based on their rearing environment, indicating the absence of any adaptive plasticity in mate preferences. Overall, despite previous evidence of reciprocal adaptation to these different environments, increased nonsexual fitness did not translate into higher mating success, indicating a lack of any alignment with natural selection of this component of male sexual fitness.

AB Plastic behavioural strategies may help individuals maximize reproductive success in varying environments, but it cannot be assumed a priori that behavioural responses to environmental changes are adaptive. To quantify the fitness consequences of plastic behavioural strategies in a paternal care fish, we observed the intrasexually competitive and intersexually solicitous behaviours of male fantail darters, Etheostoma flabellare, under varying adult sex ratios (ASR) for six observational periods over the course of two full mating seasons. At the end of each observational period, eggs present in each male's nest were counted. Behavioural and egg count data were used to construct linear and generalized linear mixed models predicting male reproductive success by two proxies: presence and number of eggs in the nest. Lower adult sex ratios (the ratio of males to females) and greater male length positively predicted egg presence. Greater intrasexual aggression increased a male's chances of having eggs in high ASR groups. Intrasexual aggression and solicitation of females positively predicted final egg count regardless of ASR. Our results support the hypothesis that some behavioural responses to changing adult sex ratio are adaptive, and that other traits, such as larger male size and high mate solicitation rates, may increase reproductive success regardless of ASR.

AB Scent marking is often assumed to be a secondary sexual trait that increases males' mating and reproductive success, although direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. We conducted a study with wild-derived house mice, Mus musculus musculus, to test whether scent marking increases males' reproductive success when females can freely choose between two territorial males. We also experimentally manipulated males' competitive scent marking by exchanging scent-marked tiles between the neighbouring males' territories (intrusion treatment) or relocating males' tiles within their own territory (control). Experimental animals were tested twice and we examined whether individual males were consistent in their marking. We found that males marked more in the intrusion treatment than controls and more at shared territorial borders than elsewhere. We found high day-to-day variation in most individuals' scent marking, and yet the sum of individuals' scent marking was consistent over time and across different social conditions. Genetic paternity analyses revealed that males' scent marking significantly increased their reproductive success in both the intrusion treatment and the controls. Surprisingly, however, female social preference was not positively correlated with male scent marking. These results provide direct evidence that scent marking increases males' reproductive success when females can choose their mates, even though it did not increase females' social preferences.

AB Body size and metabolic rate both fundamentally constrain how species interact with their environment, and hence ultimately affect their niche. While many mechanisms leading to these constraints have been explored, their effects on the resolution at which temporal information is perceived have been largely overlooked. The visual system acts as a gateway to the dynamic environment and the relative resolution at which organisms are able to acquire and process visual information is likely to restrict their ability to interact with events around them. As both smaller size and higher metabolic rates should facilitate rapid behavioural responses, we hypothesized that these traits would favour perception of temporal change over finer timescales. Using critical flicker fusion frequency, the lowest frequency of flashing at which a flickering light source is perceived as constant, as a measure of the maximum rate of temporal information processing in the visual system, we carried out a phylogenetic comparative analysis of a wide range of vertebrates that supported this hypothesis. Our results have implications for the evolution of signalling systems and predator-prey interactions, and, combined with the strong influence that both body mass and metabolism have on a species' ecological niche, suggest that time perception may constitute an important and overlooked dimension of niche differentiation.

AB Hosteparasite interactions are a key determinant of the population dynamics of wild animals, and behaviours that reduce parasite transmission and infection may be important for improving host fitness. While antiparasite behaviours have been demonstrated in laboratory animals and domesticated ungulates, whether these behaviours operate in the wild is poorly understood. Therefore, examining antiparasite behaviours in natural populations is crucial for understanding their ecological significance. In this study, we examined whether two wild rodents (white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, and deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus), selectively foraged away from conspecific faeces or avoided faeces altogether, and whether faecal gastrointestinal parasite status affected their behaviour. We also tested whether wild mice, when nesting, avoided using material that had previously been used by healthy or parasite-infected conspecifics. Our results, in contrast to laboratory mouse studies, suggest that wild mice do not demonstrate faecal avoidance, selective foraging or selective use of nesting material; they preferred being near faeces and did not differentiate between faeces from parasitized and uninfected conspecifics. Behavioural avoidance to reduce parasite infection may still represent an important strategy; however, mice in our study population appeared to favour the opportunity to feed and nest over the risks of coming into contact with faecal-transmitted parasites. Furthermore, the presence of conspecific faeces may actually provide a positive cue of a good foraging or nesting location. Ultimately, balancing the trade-off of performing antiparasite behaviours to reduce infection with missing an important feeding or nesting opportunity may be very different for animals in the wild facing complex and stochastic environments.

AB When animals are observed on multiple occasions, consistent between-individual differences in behaviour, often referred to as animal personality, may be observed. However, this does not mean that the behaviour of a given individual is readily predictable. While some individuals show low levels of variation around their behavioural mean, others show high levels of variation, and there may be significant between-individual differences in this intraindividual variation ('IIV') in behaviour. While it has been suggested that IIV might reduce susceptibility to predators, little is known about the functions or causation of IIV. We investigated the effects of temperature on the startle response duration of hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus. For poikilothermic animals, temperature has a direct and multiplicative influence on metabolic rate, which in turn is expected to influence behaviour because of its effect on energy requirements. At the level of mean startle response durations, the effect of temperature was dependent on treatment order; within treatment orders, individuals showed different reaction norms. In contrast, at the level of IIV, while the presence of significant between-individual differences was dependent on treatment order, there was a clear unidirectional effect in both treatment orders for individuals to be less predictable at higher temperature. Thus, predictability in behaviour appears to vary with a key environmental variable that is known to influence energy requirements and potentially the level of risk that individuals are willing to accept.

AB Punishment of cheaters is a widespread means of promoting cooperation in social groups. In the eusocial Hymenoptera, punishment (i.e. 'policing') of reproductively active workers is thought to have been essential for the evolution of near-sterile worker castes. Many studies have investigated the evolutionary origin of policing behaviour in social insects, but few have considered the factors that affect the expression of policing behaviour in extant species. One factor that is predicted to affect the expression of policing behaviour is colony age. Specifically, policing is expected to be strongest at early stages of colony growth, when the cost of worker reproduction is high, and weaker at later stages. In a previous study, we found that egg-eating behaviour (i.e. 'policing', where workers eat worker-laid eggs) is not expressed in early stages of colony growth in the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus, contrary to theoretical predictions. Here we test two other mechanisms of policing in incipient colonies: queen policing and destruction of male larvae. We found no evidence of either. We also found that workers from incipient colonies were capable of activating their ovaries and laying eggs. In the absence of evidence of policing in incipient C. floridanus colonies, we suggest that reproductive restraint by workers in early colony stages can arise because the inclusive fitness benefits of helping outweigh the direct benefits of reproducing.

AB Behavioural transitions between territoriality and parental care are necessary for many seasonally breeding vertebrates. Among birds, such transitions can be mediated by the steroid hormone testosterone (T), resulting in a T-mediated behavioural trade-off. This theory is supported by many implantation studies with birds demonstrating that the administration of exogenous T during parental phases can negatively affect offspring care. However, little is known about relationships between naturally circulating levels of T and parental behaviour in wild bird populations. We examined covariation in circulating levels of T (before and after injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)) and nestling provisioning rates in male and female northern cardinals, Cardinalis cardinalis, a highly aggressive, biparental resident songbird. Results indicate that both sexes had detectable levels of initial T when providing parental care, but only males produced significantly higher elevations of T following GnRH injections. Furthermore, T levels (both initial and following GnRH injections) and nestling provisioning rates did not covary for either sex, and these measures were not correlated between members of breeding pairs. When results of this study are considered with prior work indicating that elevations in T might not be necessary to support male or female aggression in this species, it appears that relationships between circulating T and reproductive behaviour could be more complex for the cardinal than for many others birds similarly examined. Such findings warrant additional examination of interrelationships between T, aggression and other forms of parental care to assess whether this species engages in T-mediated behavioural trade-offs. Possible alternative mechanisms influencing behaviour in the cardinal and future directions for research are discussed. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Olfactory communication may be particularly important to black rhinoceros, Diceros bicornis, because they are solitary living and have comparatively poor eyesight but their populations are structured by inter-and intrasexual relationships. Understanding olfactory functions and processes might achieve better conservation management but their study in rhinoceros remains anecdotal or descriptive. Experimental approaches are required but rarely possible as rhinoceros are difficult to observe and manipulate. We measured the olfactory investigation behaviour (duration and frequency of sniffing) of black rhinoceros in four experiments designed to determine the function of chemosignals in dung and urine. A habituationedishabituation trial demonstrated that black rhinoceros discriminated individually distinctive odours from faecal signals (experiment 1). When adults (>6 years old) were presented with dung from conspecifics of different sex and age classes (adult, and subadult from 2 to 4 years old), male dung was investigated more by both sexes, and females investigated subadult dung more (experiment 2). Both dung and urine from the same adult donors were investigated by both sexes, but male dung was investigated more than female dung and female urine more than male urine, although differences were statistically weak (experiment 3). Lastly, fresh faecal samples and those aged 1, 2, 4, 16 and 32 days were similarly investigated, indicating that they still function as olfactory signals. Together the results indicate that dung or urine signalled age, sex and identity to conspecifics and signals may persist as dung decays. Chemosignals are likely to be important to the social and spatial organization of black rhinoceros. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Trade-offs are inherent to alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs), and identifying the costs and benefits of tactics is essential to understanding their evolution and maintenance within a population. Male horseshoe crabs exhibit two condition-dependent ARTs: males that are in better condition arrive on spawning beaches attached to a female, while males in poorer condition join spawning pairs as satellites and engage in sperm competition. Previous research has identified several benefits to the attached tactic, but the costs are less well understood. We examined a previously uninvestigated potential cost to the attached male tactic: nutritional stress caused by a restricted ability to feed. We found that field-caught attached males produced 57% less faeces in a 12 h period than satellite males, and had 2.5 times emptier digestive tracts than satellite males. We further examined this cost using stable isotopes because nutritionally stressed animals are predicted to have higher delta N-15 levels. We found that field-caught attached males had higher delta N-15 values than satellite males. However, higher delta N-15 values could result from nutritional stress or from feeding on higher trophic levels. We tested this experimentally and found that starved animals had higher post-treatment delta N-15 values compared to animals that were fed. Furthermore, the digestive tracts of field-caught attached males contained three times more sea grass (lower tropic levels have lower delta N-15 values) than satellite males. These findings mean that the higher delta N-15 values of field-caught attached males likely result from fasting rather than differences in diet. Taken together, our results indicate that a period of nutritional stress caused by reduced food consumption is a novel cost of the attached tactic. This study provides a key piece of information to explain why ARTs in horseshoe crabs take the form they do and provides a novel method for studying costs associated with ARTs in other species.

AB Source-filter theory provides a framework to interpret the acoustic structure of vertebrate vocalizations in relation to biophysical production, and it predicts that specific acoustic parameters can encode information about callers. Because formant frequencies are determined by vocal tract dimensions, with longer vocal tracts producing lower formants, they can be reliable indicators of body size, as well as other important traits. In polygynous species, reliable acoustic cues to fitness-related traits are expected to be under strong sexual selection pressure through male competition and/or female choice. This study investigates whether formant frequencies of male North American bison bellow vocalizations encode information about fitness-related caller attributes. Bison exhibit male-dominance female-defence polygyny, with dominance displays involving bellows. We hypothesized that physical attributes (mass, age) would predict formants and that formants would in turn predict quality indices (dominance, copulations, offspring sired). Our results showed that heavier bulls produced lower formants and that lower formants predicted higher mating success (copulations), even when controlling for mass. Given positive associations between mating success, dominance and reproductive success (offspring sired) in bison, we conclude that bellows with lower formants reflect greater fitness in bulls. We discuss the importance of reliable acoustic cues to size and quality indices in sexual selection contexts. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Precopulatory sexual cannibalism may represent the most extreme form of sexual conflict because it necessarily truncates the reproductive potential of the victim. Three of the most prominent mechanisms invoked to explain incidence of precopulatory sexual cannibalism are the 'adaptive foraging', 'aggressive spillover' and 'mate choice' hypotheses. These hypotheses argue that sexual cannibalism is either (1) the result of female choice, where females gauge the benefits of suitors as perspective mates versus prey, (2) a neutral (or deleterious) by-product of selection on aggressiveness in nonreproductive contexts, or (3) a mechanism by which females express their mating preferences, respectively. We tested the predictions of these hypotheses in the funnel-web spider Agelenopsis pennsylvanica using staged laboratory encounters. We then tracked numerous fitness proxies of cannibalistic versus noncannibalistic females to determine whether cannibalism was associated with increased female performance. We found that more aggressive females and those deprived of food were more likely to engage in precopulatory cannibalism. Cannibalism was not associated with male condition, male body size or female body size, nor with the mass of females' egg cases, the number of eggs therein, or the mass of individual eggs. In contrast, there was a positive association between the mass of the egg case and the number of offspring that emerged in cannibalistic females, but not in noncannibalistic females. Thus, offspring of cannibalistic mothers appear to have increased hatching success in heavier egg cases. This may represent a novel advantage associated with sexual cannibalism.

AB Identification of family members plays a primary role in the evolution of social behaviours such as nepotism, altruism and mate choice. The process is particularly important for philopatric species in which the encounter rate of kin-related conspecifics is high. Olfactory-based recognition of individual kin has been identified in most species, with the exception of birds; historically, birds were thought to have poor olfactory abilities, so the use of olfactory cues was ruled out a priori. Here, we show that European storm petrels, Hydrobates pelagicus, are able to distinguish kin from nonkin odours. Using special cotton swabs, like those used in forensic police procedures, we offered birds a binary choice in a Y-maze. Birds significantly preferred odours of unrelated individuals. Olfactory imprinting on a 'family olfactory template' or self-referent phenotype matching may be the mechanism underlying this effect. This choice behaviour may allow these highly philopatric birds to avoid inbreeding and select an appropriate mate. Our results suggest that sophisticated olfactory communication is relevant in birds, and leads to important behavioural traits such as philopatry.

AB The behavioural response of animals to unfavourable climatic conditions has received increased attention recently. While many studies have examined the behavioural responses of endotherms to cold temperatures, thermoregulatory behaviour may also occur in response to heat stress. We evaluated whether a heat-sensitive northern ungulate, the moose, Alces alces, showed thermoregulatory behaviour in response to ambient temperature in two populations in southern Norway. We quantified the seasonal habitat use of GPS-collared adult females, as well as fine-scale habitat selection patterns, in relation to time of day and critical temperature thresholds thought to induce heat stress. We also assessed whether temperature-associated changes in spatial behaviour led to a shift in the availability of thermal cover and forage at the chosen location. Frequent exposure to temperatures above critical thresholds occurred in both summer and winter and in both study areas. Moose responded by seeking thermal shelter in mature coniferous forest and avoiding open habitat types, leading to a decrease in local forage availability in summer but not in winter. Differences in habitat choice in response to temperature were most pronounced at twilight. We found that fine-scale habitat selection analyses, using step-selection functions, more effectively revealed thermoregulatory behaviour in both seasons and populations than did habitat use. This is because habitat selection analyses are better able to identify limiting factors operating at different spatiotemporal scales than is habitat use. Our results clearly show that ambient temperature affected fine-scale behavioural decisions of moose with consequences for forage accessibility, especially during summer. As the climate changes, the limiting effect of ambient temperature (cold and high) on animal behaviour is likely to increase, potentially influencing individual fitness and population dynamics.

AB In breeding birds, acoustic signalling is often an important cue for reunion between sexual partners. However, in spite of its potential interest, mate recognition has rarely been examined by comparing the two sexes. We studied the blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, a socially monogamous seabird, with a dramatic call sexual dimorphism suggesting two different strategies for identity coding: the female call is an amplitude-modulated sound with a harmonic series slowly modulated in frequency, while the male call is a noisy whistle strongly modulated in frequency. To compare acoustic strategies between the sexes, we (1) recorded calls of both males and females, (2) searched for an individual signature and characterized it, and (3) tested, using a playback experiment, whether the calls of males and females were equally efficient for mate recognition. Results showed that an individual signature was present in the calls of both sexes. However, the acoustic parameters involved differed: female individual identification was principally achieved by a spectral analysis of the call whereas males' identity relied mostly on temporal cues. More than 70% of both females and males tested in playback experiments successfully recognized their mate. This suggests that the coding strategies are equally efficient in terms of individual recognition between mates. From a broader point of view, our results underline the importance of assessing both males and females within the same investigative framework.

AB The remarkable navigational abilities of social insects are proof that small brains can produce exquisitely efficient, robust navigation in complex environments. Because social insects produce specialist foragers that are amenable to field and laboratory studies, they have been productive model systems for studies of navigation. Ideas derived from these studies of insect navigation have shown how simple mechanisms can produce robust and seemingly complex behaviour. This is important for a general understanding of spatial cognition as these 'insect-like' navigational behaviours are probably phylogenetically widespread. Current insect research is helping to show how simple panoramic views, without the need for cognitive processes such as object identification or labelling, can provide explanations for many findings, including behaviours that in the vertebrate literature have traditionally drawn conclusions about sophisticated high-level spatial modules or learning rules. Recent insect navigation research has only been possible because of techniques enabling the recording of visual scenes from the perspective of the insect. Without such techniques one has to intuit an animal's point of view (its Umwelt) and we discuss how this may lead to unhelpful assumptions about the cues available for navigation.

AB The discovery of melanopsin, the nonvisual opsin present in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), has created great excitement in the field of circadian biology. Now, researchers have emphasized melanopsin as the main photopigment governing circadian activity in vertebrates. Circadian biologists have tested this idea under standard 12: 12 h light: dark cycles in the laboratory that lack the dramatic daily colour changes of natural skylight. Here we used a stimulus paradigm in which the colour of the illumination changed throughout the day, thus mimicking natural skylight, but luminance, sensed intrinsically by melanopsin containing ganglion cells, was kept constant. We show in two species of cichlid, Aequidens pulcher and Labeotropheus fuelleborni, that changes in light colour, not intensity, are the primary determinants of natural circadian activity. Moreover, opponent-cone photoreceptor inputs to ipRGCs mediate the sensation of wavelength change, and not the intrinsic photopigment, melanopsin. These results have implications for understanding the evolutionary biology of nonvisual photosensory pathways and answer long-standing questions about the nature and distribution of photopigments in organisms, including providing a solution to the mystery of why nocturnal animals routinely have mutations that interrupt the function of their short-wavelength-sensitive photopigment gene.

AB Abedus herberti is an aquatic bug that carries a subalar store of atmospheric air for use during submersion. When submersed, adult bugs routinely show two patterns of behaviour we call gaping and dynamic gaping. We studied these behaviours to determine when they are expressed and tested the hypothesis that the behaviours serve a respiratory function. Gaping and dynamic gaping occurred when bugs were positioned sufficiently deep in water that they could not refresh air stores without releasing their hold on the substrate and floating to the surface. Gaping and dynamic gaping occurred more frequently as water depth increased, and bugs performing these behaviours remained submersed longer than bugs that did not express these behaviours. Bugs permitted to express gaping and dynamic gaping remain submersed longer than bugs that were experimentally prevented from performing the behaviours. Bugs also remained submersed longer in high oxygen water than in low oxygen water. We conclude that gaping allows the subalar air store to function as a physical gill and that dynamic gaping is a form of behavioural ventilation. Adult A. herberti are buoyant and must swim or hold onto a substrate to remain submersed. Extending submersion time increases predatory efficiency, reduces the frequency of surfacing, saves energy and reduces predation risk. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Ecological conditions can influence decisions relating to antipredator behaviour through impacts on the likelihood of detecting predators and the ability to hear vocalizations. Previous studies of antipredator behaviour have tended to focus on foragers, whose vigilance behaviour may be confounded by the type of food they are eating, and on receivers in vocal communication networks. We examined the impact of habitat and wind conditions on the behaviour of sentinels, individuals that suspend their own foraging to adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates continue feeding, and that produce a variety of calls used by foragers to adjust their antipredator behaviour. Sentinels of the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding bird, started guarding sooner and guarded for longer in long grass compared to more open habitats, and also initiated sentinel bouts sooner in high wind, probably because of the increased predation risk in such circumstances. Sentinels also selected positions that were both lower and closer to the foraging group when it was windy, potentially improving transmission of vocal signals that are valuable to foragers. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour can be influenced by extrinsic factors, as well as the intrinsic factors previously shown, and suggest that ecological variation may affect decisions bearing both selfish and cooperative benefits.

AB Aggressive interactions in animals are often resolved in favour of the individual with superior fighting ability, or resource-holding potential (RHP). A recent revival of studies of aggressive behaviour has focused on the assessment strategies used in animal contests. Strategies of dispute resolution through mutual or self-assessment of RHP differ in the predicted relationship between interaction duration and each competitor's relative and absolute RHP. We studied potential components of RHP (mass, length, body condition) and their relationship to contest duration and the level of escalation in the grey treefrog, Hyla versicolor, using a novel method to stage aggressive interactions in the laboratory. Overall, large males were more likely to win than small males, but they only had an advantage in less escalated interactions and were not more successful in physical fights. There was limited evidence for an effect of body size on interaction duration or the level of escalation. Specifically, the body condition of both the smaller and larger contestant was weakly negatively related to the duration and level of escalation of contests. This relationship is the opposite of what would be expected under any assessment strategy. Given these data, coupled with the lack of relationships between other size measures and interaction duration, we conclude that assessment of body size does not occur in contests in H. versicolor. Other unmeasured components of RHP may play a role in determining interaction duration, and the relatively weak and ineffective fighting abilities of this species may limit the dominance of larger individuals. Relatively little is known about aggressive behaviour in frogs. Our method for staging aggressive interactions allows us to address predictions of game theory models in an important group for studies of animal communication.

AB Vocal duetting occurs in diverse animal groups. Members of a mated pair may duet to communicate with each other or with other individuals. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of duets, and studies often provide support for the joint resource defence or mate-guarding hypotheses. We evaluated these hypotheses for the happy wren, Pheugopedius felix, using a two-speaker playback experiment. We observed the responses of happy wren pairs to playback of solo male, solo female and male/female duet songs, and compared these with heterospecific song control trials. Happy wrens responded aggressively to conspecific song playback by moving closer to their mate, approaching the playback speakers and increasing singing rates. Both sexes increased singing and especially duetting rates in response to conspecific playback. There were no differences in which sex initiated or terminated duets nor did birds vary the proportion of their partner's songs answered across conspecific treatments. Furthermore, neither sex treated unmated intruders (solo playback) as more threatening than mated intruders (duet playback). Together, these results argue against the mate-guarding hypothesis and instead indicate that duetting in happy wrens functions primarily in cooperative territory defence. Overall, males sang more than females, moved closer to the speakers and were more likely to answer their partner's songs, suggesting that males take a primary role in territorial defence. However, females also responded strongly, especially when female intruders were present (duet or female solo playback), which suggests a sex-specific division of labour in their territorial defence.

AB Chimpanzees engage in a number of group activities, but it is still unclear to what extent they prefer mutualistic collaborative strategies over individual strategies to achieve their goals. In one experiment, we gave chimpanzees the choice between pulling a platform to within reach either individually or collaboratively with a tolerant partner, both strategies having equivalent payoffs. Overall, chimpanzees preferred the individual option, and this preference was independent of the type of reward for which they were working (food or tool). In a second experiment, chimpanzees switched to the collaboration option as soon as the payoff was increased for this option. These results suggest that chimpanzees prefer to work alone in foraging-like situations and choose collaboration only if it maximizes their reward. These results thus make a strong case for the hypothesis that differences between humans' and chimpanzees' collaboration are to a great extent due to motivational differences.

AB The decisions that animals make are based on information gathered from their environment, and can have consequences for their fitness and survival. Such processes can be disrupted by environmental change. Hermit crabs find and select the gastropod shells they inhabit using chemical and visual cues, and tactile assessment. The choice of an optimal shell is important since it provides shelter against environmental extremes and protection against predators; inhabiting a suboptimal shell can also reduce fecundity. Hermit crabs are subject to cyclical reductions in the pH of the water in the intertidal rock pools that they inhabit, and such reductions may be further exacerbated by climate change. Reduced sea water pH, a consequence of ocean acidification and leaks from geological storage sites, has already been shown to disrupt the behaviour of marine animals. We investigated the effects of reduced sea water pH on the shell assessment and selection behaviour of the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. Under highly reduced pH conditions (pH 6.8) crabs were less likely to change from a suboptimal to an optimal shell than those in untreated sea water; those that did change shells took longer to do so. Crabs in the reduced pH treatment also showed significantly lower antennular flicking rates (the 'sniffing' response in decapods) and reduced movement. Thus, a reduction in sea water pH disrupts the resource assessment and decision-making processes of these crabs, indicating that the ability to acquire a vital resource may be influenced by both naturally occurring environmental cycles and anthropogenically induced environmental change.

AB Combining movement behaviour with other ecological information of predators and their prey is essential for an adequate understanding of ecosystem dynamics. The movement patterns of broadnose sevengill sharks, Notorynchus cepedianus, were monitored with acoustic and satellite technology in coastal areas of southeast Tasmania, Australia. Individuals were tagged in two habitats (Norfolk Bay and the Derwent Estuary) for which we had ecological information such as diet, population structure and abundance. Notorynchus cepedianus showed seasonal site fidelity in the use of the coastal habitats. The general pattern was for sharks to exit coastal areas over winter and females to return the following spring and males in summer. Their movement into these coastal areas coincided with high seasonal abundance of their known prey species during summer, suggesting feeding site fidelity. Individuals tagged in two coastal areas showed low spatial and dietary overlap, suggesting localized site fidelity and fine spatial scale resource partitioning. This has rarely been reported for large mobile predators. Both satellite and acoustic methods showed that males make northerly migrations during winter to distances of at least 1000 km. The combined use of tracking, diet and abundance information demonstrated that N. cepedianus are likely to exert significant predation pressure on prey inhabiting these areas during summer. Overall, this study highlights the benefit of complementing movement data with other ecological information to understand the habitat use of large mobile predators and their potential influences on ecosystem structure and function.

AB Brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, and red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, are frequently used as model systems for communication and vocal learning; however, relatively little is known about their auditory processing. Although auditory space and acoustic signal space are assumed to coevolve, it is less clear when, or even if, sex differences are expected in auditory processing. Here we explored frequency-specific auditory responses using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). We generated sex-specific audio-grams using two methods: visual detection and cross-correlation. We also measured the amplitude and latency of ABRs to stimuli over a range of frequencies (0.5-6 kHz) and intensities (8-72 dB sound pressure level). Thresholds generated by both methods were good predictors of behavioural thresholds in the best frequency range (2-4 kHz). The visual detection method resulted in a slightly better correspondence with behavioural thresholds than the cross-correlation method above and below best frequencies. We found no significant differences between red-winged blackbird and brown-headed cowbird ABR thresholds; however, overall, females had lower thresholds than males. Sex differences were larger than species differences for ABR amplitude, while latency differences were greater between species than between sexes. Taken together our results suggest that despite high-frequency vocal elements, brown-headed cowbirds do not have enhanced high-frequency auditory sensitivity when measured with auditory evoked potentials. Moreover, we show that females have greater auditory sensitivity than males, which is generally not seen in other passerine species. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social learning is the basis for the formation of traditions in both human and nonhuman animals. Field observations and experiments provide evidence for the existence of traditions in animals but they do not address the underlying social-learning mechanisms. We used an established laboratory experimental paradigm, the artificial fruit design, to test for copying of a sequence of actions and local enhancement in six groups of wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops. We introduced a two-step task where models had to remove a bar to untie a rope that blocked a single door of a box. The models were high-ranking individuals that monopolized the box early on and discovered by trial and error how to open it. We obtained successful models in three groups, while the other three groups acted as controls. After 20 successful demonstrations, we tested subjects with a box that had a rope in the same position but the rope was not functional. Under these conditions, sequential copying of the two-step opening did not occur. Only individuals that were exposed to models were likely to touch the bar if door opening was not immediately successful, providing evidence for local enhancement. When we presented the boxes with the functional rope, we found no effect of having been exposed to a model on the probability that subjects solved the task. We conclude that the social-learning abilities of wild vervet monkeys are relatively limited and discuss potential problems concerning the technical difficulty of the task.

AB The process of nest leaving (fledging) in hole-breeding passerines is largely unexplored, although it is potentially an important facet of reproduction. We used the great tit, Parus major, to investigate whether fledging timing and order were affected by nestling development and sex, as well as the sex ratio in the brood the nestlings were raised in. Because of the difference in size and competitiveness between male and female nestlings, we expected to find an effect of sex and brood sex ratio (BSR) on the process of fledging. To explore its effect on fledging experimentally, we manipulated BSR by swapping 6-day-old nestlings of both sexes. We implanted transponders in all 14-day-old nestlings to determine timing and order of fledging. The brood age at fledging was best explained by average wing length of the brood (negative), average body mass of the brood (positive) and hatching date (negative). In contrast to our hypothesis, BSR did not affect fledging time. Also, the asynchrony of fledging within broods did not depend on BSR. Within broods, fledging order was not affected by sex or by the interaction between sex and BSR. Nestlings with long wings on day 14 fledged earlier than nestmates with shorter wings. Although females were lighter at day 14, they had similar length wings as their male nestmates. Nestlings should keep up with their nestmates during development, because developmental status relative to nestmates, rather than sex-specific competition, influenced the process of fledging.

AB Building structures and aggregating can increase an animal's fitness, but the benefits come at a cost. Some orb web spiders build multiple structures or build in aggregations, which may have the same effect on prey capture success as the addition of a structure. As these structures often appear together, they may bestow interactive benefits not realized if the structures were added alone. We performed field experiments to investigate whether the multiple structures associated with the orb webs of two spider species provide interactive benefits. The orb web spider Nephila clavata adds barrier webs and prey carcass decorations to its webs. We manipulated their webs in the field by removing either, both or neither the barrier webs or the carcass decorations. We found that prey interception rate was greatest when neither barrier webs nor carcasses were present but, for the prey caught, the prey retention rate was greatest with both structures present. Another orb web spider, Cyclosa mulmeinensis, adds prey carcass decorations and forms aggregations. We manipulated the decorations and aggregations of C. mulmeinensis in the field to determine their interactive influences. In solitary webs and webs with decorations, prey capture rates were lower than those without structures. These negative foraging effects, however, did not exist in decorated webs that were in aggregations. Our results thus show that multiple structures, individually, are costly, but interactively they provide substantial benefits. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding the process of colonization of new habitat patches is critical to clarify the proximate mechanisms involved in the distribution of a species and particularly in the formation of breeding aggregations. We studied the process of colony foundation in a long-term monitored population of lesser kestrels, Falco naumanni. For this purpose, we first analysed which habitat/demographic features influence the occupation of empty habitat patches experimentally supplied with nestboxes. Second, we studied the individual characteristics of founders and the reproductive consequences of occupation of new breeding patches in comparison with individuals settled in already established colonies. We found that the probability of occupation of experimental breeding patches increased with the relative cover of cereal crops. Regardless of sex, founders and individuals that settled in pre-existing colonies did not differ in body condition or age. However, there was a higher proportion of unringed kestrels in new than in pre-existing colonies, suggesting that founders are mostly immigrants from distant populations. Founders and nonfounders had similar breeding success, but the former had a lower parasitic burden of feather lice, indicating that occupying new breeding patches could reduce parasite pressure and/or transmission. Our results suggest habitat characteristics influence settlement decisions in the absence of pre-existing social cues, but do not support the idea that founders are suboptimal individuals unable to gain access to previously established colonies.

AB The impact of alien predators on prey populations is well known by conservation biologists, but little attention has been paid to the negative effects that the introduction of exotic predators may have on native predators through competition for food. In the Iberian Peninsula, the red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta elegans, and other exotic freshwater turtles have been introduced, competing and displacing the native endangered terrapins (the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, and the Spanish terrapin, Mauremys leprosa). Although the nature of competitive interactions remains unclear, direct competition for food is likely to occur. Both native and invasive freshwater turtles are common predators of amphibian tadpoles. Naive amphibian tadpoles are known to recognize and respond to local predators with no prior experience, but tadpoles might not recognize new predatory species, since they have not shared a long evolutionary history with them. We examined the ability of four species of Iberian anuran tadpoles to recognize and respond to chemical cues from invasive and native freshwater predatory turtles. Three of the four tadpole species tested reduced their swimming activity when cues from native turtles were present in water, but not when cues belonged to exotic turtles. This inability of tadpole prey to respond innately to chemicals from introduced predatory turtles might be one of the causes that explains the displacement of native populations of Iberian terrapins by invasive exotic turtles, and may help clarify why alien predators sometimes prosper better in new habitats than locally adapted predators.

AB Using spotted cucumber beetles and their epicuticular hydrocarbon signatures, we examined two hypotheses about how females may use signals that describe a potential mate's immune system to identify high-quality males. Females may find males to be acceptable mates when (1) a male's immune system complements or matches the immune system of the receptive female (immunocompatibility), or (2) a male successfully signals that it has a strong immune system (immunocompetence). The first experiment used gas chromatography to compare the epicuticular hydrocarbon signature of a female beetle with that of a male she rejected and a male she accepted as a mate. We also compared the hydrocarbon signatures of a male and two fertilized females, one that had voluntarily accepted his spermatophore and one that was forced to accept the spermatophore. In both experiments the immune response to an implant inserted in the insect's abdomen was compared in males and their offspring. The hydrocarbon signature of males accepted as mates in the first experiment differed more from that of their female partners than did the hydrocarbon signature of rejected males. There was no significant difference in the immune response of accepted and rejected males. Offspring from forced matings had significantly lower immune responses than offspring from voluntary matings. This study suggests that females use immunocompatibility rather than immunocompetence as a trait to identify quality mates, which fosters stronger immune systems in offspring. Female choice of mates in this species may be self-referenced using the cuticular hydrocarbon signature of the female as a standard. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The temporal relationship between signals often has strong and repeatable influences on receiver behaviour. While several studies have shown that receivers prefer temporally leading signals, we show that the relative timing of signal elements within overlapping signals can also have repeatable influences on receiver responses. Female grey treefrogs, Hyla versicolor, preferred overlapping conspecific advertisement call alternatives in which pulses were in the leading position relative to pulses in an alternative. The preference was maintained even when the first pulse of the stimulus with leading pulses began after that of the call with following pulses. To rule out the possibility of masking interference of the pulse pattern, we used a split-pulse design in which the playback of two nonoverlapping pulse elements were synchronized from spatially separated speakers. Females were attracted to the source of the short (6 ms) leading pulse element, which did not attract females in isolation, even though its amplitude was 24 dB lower than the long (24 ms) following element, which did attract females in isolation. Taken together, our results fall within a range of phenomena that have been classified as precedence effects. However, to our knowledge, showing localization based on successive leading pulses rather than the very first-arriving pulse is a novel discovery for nonhuman animals.

AB The quality of a social relationship represents the history of past social interactions between two individuals, from which the nature and outcome of future interactions can be predicted. Current theory predicts that relationship quality comprises three separate components, its value, compatibility and security. This study is the first to investigate the components of relationship quality in a large-brained bird. Following methods recently used to obtain quantitative measures of each relationship quality component in chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, we entered data on seven behavioural variables from a group of 11 ravens, Corvus corax, into a principal components analysis. The characteristics of the extracted components matched those predicted for value, compatibility and security, and were labelled as such. When the effects of kinship and sex combination on each relationship quality component were analysed, we found that kin had more valuable relationships, whereas females had less secure and compatible relationships, although the effect of sex combination on compatibility only applied to nonkin. These patterns are consistent with what little knowledge we have of raven relationships from aviary studies and show that the components of relationship quality in ravens may indeed be analogous to those in chimpanzees.

AB Males typically have greater variance in reproductive success than females, so mothers should benefit by producing sons under favourable conditions. Being paired with a better-than-average mate is one such favourable circumstance. High-quality fathers can improve conditions for their offspring by providing good genes, good resources, or both, so females paired to such males should invest preferentially in sons. Ornamentation has been linked to male quality in many birds, and, in support of differential allocation theory, females of several avian species invest more in entire broods when paired to attractive mates. Additionally, the females of some bird species apparently manipulate the primary sex ratio of their broods in relation to the attractiveness of their mates. However, empirical support for a link between mate ornamentation and preferential feeding of sons (another form of biased investment) is lacking. We tested for correlations between sex-biased parental investment and mate plumage colour in the eastern bluebird, Sialia sialis, a species in which juveniles have sexually dichromatic UV blue plumage. We found that the proportion of maternal feeding attempts to fledgling sons (versus fledgling daughters) was positively correlated with structurally coloured plumage ornamentation of fathers. Additionally, paternal feeding attempts to sons were correlated with plumage ornamentation of mothers and increased in fathers that had breast plumage characteristics typical of older males. These results provide further support for the idea that parental strategies are influenced by mate attractiveness and provide the first evidence that mate ornamentation can influence parental behaviour even after offspring have left the nest.

AB Theory suggests that if secondary sexual characteristics (or signals) are costly and females choose between mating partners, males should display more vigorously in the presence of competition. We investigated the use of chemical signals during courtship in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. Males of P. xylostella have a hair-pencil gland on the tip of their abdomen, which allows for the release of chemical signals during courtship. Males detected potential competitors using chemical signals, but male investment in sexual signalling did not increase linearly in the presence of increasing numbers of competitors. The patterns of male display and mating behaviour among the parental population were not necessarily replicated among the next generation of males. Males of the parental generation that were exposed to one male competitor were more likely to display their hair-pencil than males exposed to zero or two competitors, but the display behaviour of the next generation of males (while higher overall) did not vary significantly across these treatments. Furthermore, males of the parental generation that acquired matings displayed their hair-pencil at a higher rate than males that did not obtain matings; again this pattern was not evident among the next generation of males. Finally, sons tended to be more likely to display their hair-pencil, and were significantly more likely to achieve a successful mating, than the previous generation of males. These intergenerational patterns suggest that the tendency to achieve copulations may have a genetic component.

AB Vocalizing nestlings are vulnerable to eavesdropping by predators, but may reduce risk through behavioural tactics such as responding with silence to adult alarm calls. Nestlings may also assess danger independently, although there has been little investigation of this possibility. Additionally, nestlings might use parental signals to modify their response to possible cues of danger to reduce the likelihood of going silent to harmless stimuli. Nestling white-browed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, cease calling in response to both parental alarms and the acoustic cues of a predator. However, it is unknown whether their response to the predator cue (a pied currawong, Strepera graculina, walking on leaf litter) is specific to the predator's sound, or whether it is a response to broadband, atonal sounds in general, to a 'walking tempo', or simply to any novel sound. Using field playback experiments of synthetic and natural sounds we show that nestlings are finely tuned to cues of danger. Nestlings suppressed calling most strongly to the sound of a real predator, and less strongly to broadband sounds. They did not respond to either novelty or a 'walking' tempo alone. Nestlings responded just as strongly to the predator's sound if they first heard the sound of a parent nearby, suggesting that they could discriminate predator cues from the sound of parental arrival, or that their interpretation of sounds was 'adaptively pessimistic'. Overall, scrubwren nestlings showed specific and independent assessment of predator sounds, which appeared unaffected by cues of parental presence.

AB Time constraints can limit an animal's potential to survive in a given habitat and the maximum size of its group. Many studies have, therefore, investigated the ecological correlates of time allocated to travelling, foraging and vigilance. However, animals spend more time inactive than active, and understanding the determinants of this resting time may provide new insights into the habitat-specific time-budgeting problems that animals face. We analysed the environmental constraints that determine the minimum amount of daytime an average primate has to spend resting, using data from a wide range of ecologically different species. However, total resting time consists of two components: enforced resting time (imposed on the animal by ecological constraints) and free resting time (the time available for allocation to ecologically functional activities). We show that the ecologically important enforced resting time is determined by diet and annual temperature as well as by temperature variation. Our tests of the biological significance of this relationship show that enforced resting time distinguishes between locations that are suitable or unsuitable for particular genera. We show that an annual temperature increase of 2-4 degrees C would greatly increase enforced resting time, leading to serious time-budgeting problems for many species. The effect of changes to enforced resting time on the biogeographical distribution of species is especially strong for folivorous primates. This study shows that resting time is an important component of animal behaviour that can help us understand extinction risk and geographical distribution of taxa.

AB Individual variation in stable behavioural traits may explain variation in ecologically relevant behaviours such as foraging, dispersal, anti-predator behaviour, and dominance. We investigated behavioural variation in mountain chickadees, a North American parid that lives in dominance-structured winter flocks, using two common measures of behavioural profile: exploration of a novel room and novel object exploration. We related those behavioural traits to dominance status in male chickadees following brief, pairwise encounters. Low-exploring birds (birds that visited less than four locations in the novel room) were significantly more likely to become dominant in brief, pairwise encounters with high-exploring birds (i.e. birds that visited all perching locations within a novel room). On the other hand, there was no relationship between novel object exploration and dominance. Interestingly, novel-room exploration was also not correlated with novel object exploration. These results suggest that behavioural profile may predict the social status of group-living individuals. Moreover, our results contradict the idea that novel object exploration and novel-room exploration are always interchangeable measures of individuals' sensitivity to environmental novelty.

AB Cooperative provisioning dynamics between members of a pair in biparental systems has received a lot of attention, both empirically and theoretically. The dynamics of provisioning in cooperatively breeding groups, however, remains poorly understood. Such groups often include unrelated helpers that may have very different provisioning rules from related helpers and parents, since they accrue different types of fitness benefits from helping. The bell miner, Manorina melanophrys, provides an ideal system in which to investigate cooperative provisioning, because substantial levels of care are provided by a number of unrelated helpers per nest. We experimentally increased brood demand via targeted begging playbacks during nest visits of either breeding males or unrelated male helpers. Both types of males used similar behavioural investment rules, significantly increasing food delivery rate during playback relative to control periods. Surprisingly, all other provisioners also increased their visit rates during playbacks, although to a lesser extent. This could only have been in response to the increase in visits by the target individuals, suggesting an additional indirect mechanism by which individuals in this cooperative setting assess brood demand. The resultant overall increase in food delivery during the playback periods caused nestlings to show the expected reduction in their own begging and an increase in body mass gain. It is therefore interesting how similar the evolved provisioning responses are for all types of group member, irrespective of whether such benefits of investment in the brood are derived via kin selection (fathers) or some future direct increase in fitness (helpers).

AB When foraging in groups, foragers in producer mode search for food independently and foragers in scrounger mode search for opportunities to join the food discoveries of other companions. Producer-scrounger ( PS) models predict that at equilibrium scrounging will increase with group size and with patch richness but will be independent of food patch encounter rate. Earlier PS models assume that foragers arrive instantaneously at scrounged food patches, which is not realistic at the habitat level, at which food patches can be far apart. Here, I develop a spatially explicit model of producing and scrounging in which individuals pay a time cost when travelling to scrounged food patches and may join patches with little or no food left when they arrive. Using a genetic-algorithm approach, I confirm that scrounging increases with patch richness and add several novel predictions. In particular, scrounging is expected to increase with a decrease in food patch encounter rate and can actually decrease when forager density is high. In habitats in which food intake rate increases with the number of foragers at food patches, scrounging at low forager densities is actually predicted to increase success. The spatial model also highlights the self-organizing nature of scrounging. Because scrounging reduces the average distance between foragers, thus reducing the costs of joining, attempts to scrounge make further scrounging more likely to evolve. The spatial model of producing and scrounging provides novel insights into the evolution of group foraging. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We videotaped behaviour in four litters of domestic dogs to explore social play and the development of relationships within litters. We collected data when the puppies were between 3 and 40 weeks of age, but collection times varied by litter. We divided data analysis into three time periods to coincide approximately with critical periods in the early social development of dogs. Early play-partner preferences were associated with preferences in later time periods, and the tendency for puppies to prefer specific partners increased over time. Play did not conform to 50-50 symmetry of roles between partners, which some researchers claim is necessary to sustain play. In the later juvenile period (time 3), dogs who engaged in high rates of offense behaviours (e. g. chasing, forcing partners down) also initiated play at higher rates, implying that winning during play may become more important as puppies mature. Self-handicapping behaviours were positively associated with play signalling, suggesting that, like play signals, self-handicapping may function to indicate playful intent. In mixed-sex dyads, males initiated play, engaged in offense behaviours, and self-handicapped more than females. Females were more likely to initiate with females across all time periods, but males were more likely to initiate with males only in time 3. We discuss results from mixed- and same-sex interactions with reference to inter- and intrasexual competition. The types of offense and self-handicapping behaviours displayed were similar across litters, suggesting that the expression of these behaviours may follow a similar ontogeny in puppies in general.

AB The reproductive biology of social Hymenoptera is characterized by lifelong sperm storage by queens and sperm limitation in males. Both sexes are therefore expected to be especially choosy about their mating partners. In particular, sexuals should avoid sibmating because of the resulting risk of producing sterile diploid male offspring. Colonies of the ant Leptothorax gredleri are specialists of patchy habitats and often live in subpopulations of fewer than a few dozen colonies with restricted gene flow between patches. Sexuals therefore have a high probability of mating with a related partner. Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, we found that the blend of cuticular hydrocarbons, which is generally thought to be important in nestmate recognition in social insects, was colony specific in both sexes. In principle, this might provide sexuals with a chemical cue for the avoidance of sibmating. When allowed to choose among equal numbers of mating partners from their own and another nest insight cages, sexuals had only a weak although significant preference for mating with non-nestmates. Other characters might therefore be more important than relatedness in mate choice. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patterns of agonistic relationships among group-living mammalian females are suggested to reflect differences in feeding competition. Socioecological models predict that within-group contest (WGC) competition leads to despotic relationships that are linear, consistent, and stable, in which subordinate individuals use formal submission to acknowledge rank. Between-group contest ( BGC) competition and risk of infanticide are predicted to add tolerance, as evidenced by frequent reconciliation, low-intensity aggression and counteraggression. We examined the predicted effects for formal submission and two criteria of tolerance for a group of Hanuman langurs ( Semnopithecus entellus) in a population known to experience WGC and BGC as well as high rates of infanticide. Results were based on focal animal sampling of eight of 13 adult females ( 419 h) and ad libitum sampling of all 13 females ( 711 contact hours) in the group Kailana I ( Jodhpur, India). The behaviour 'presenting' ( N= 281) qualified as formal submission, adhering to most proposed criteria ( e. g. linear, consistent, predictive of other agonistic relationships and hierarchies, 40.9% spontaneous). Thus, regarding formal submission, the predicted effects of WGC hold, and support the explanatory value of this aspect of socioecological models. In contrast, agonistic relationships were nontolerant, with frequent high-intensity aggression ( 48.9% of N= 231) and almost no counteraggression (< 1%). This suggests that either the criteria used in assessing BGC require reconsideration or the predicted effects of BGC on tolerance should be revisited. The latter adds to growing evidence of BGC as a weak predictor of within-group relationships. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In theory, sex roles are determined by the potential reproductive rates of males and females, which are constrained by parental investment. Thus the sex that invests least in offspring typically competes most for matings and is most subject to sexual selection, whereas the caring sex is most choosy when selecting mates. Here I show that ecological variables, rather than patterns of parental investment, can be influential in determining sex roles and the direction of sexual selection. In the polyandrous eclectus parrot, Eclectus roratus, both sexes care for offspring, yet despite traditional parental care patterns, both sexes are competitive and both are subject to sexual selection. The bright red and blue females compete for scarce nest hollows and the iridescent green males for mates. Using data from an 8-year field study, I show that the major ecological variable driving this system is nest hollow quality. Females with drier hollows had higher reproductive success and more males feeding and competing to mate with them. Females with nest hollows that were prone to flooding had fewer fledglings in years with higher dry season rainfall, confirming that hollow quality was a primary determinant of reproductive success. Comparisons of females before and after they changed hollows during the study provided further evidence that these trends were due to hollow quality rather than individual female quality. Thus competition for a scarce resource can lead to high variance in female reproductive success, and promote competition for high-quality mates among males.

AB The small societies of primitively eusocial wasps have provided interesting testing grounds for reproductive skew theory because all individuals have similar reproductive potential, which is unusual in social insects but common in vertebrate societies. Aggression is a key parameter in testing the theory, but empirical studies have seldom quantified aggression together with the entire array of other relevant variables. The few studies that have done so were recently criticized for failing to control for the overall level of social activity. We analysed behaviour and reproductive partitioning patterns in the stenogastrine wasp Parischnogaster mellyi. We used aggression of the subordinate (beta) breeder as key variable and analysed how relatedness, body size, number of breeders and productivity affect the interaction between the reproductive skew and the aggression while controlling for nest activity and actual interaction time between alpha and beta. We showed that (1) more even reproductive partitioning (lower reproductive skew) is associated with higher levels of aggression initiated by the beta subordinate independent of colony activity and (2) none of the currently available reproductive skew models is convincingly supported. Comparison of our results with earlier studies suggests that a common aggression-based mechanism for reproductive partitioning may apply across all primitively eusocial wasps despite complications arising from variable activity levels; however, currently available models may not apply.

AB Recent studies on birds show that two steroid hormones, testosterone and corticosterone, stimulate nestling begging and growth. Here, we seek to investigate whether juvenile hormone, a major regulatory insect hormone, has similar effects on larval begging and growth in insects. To this end, we experimentally elevated larval juvenile hormone levels by topical application of methoprene, a potent and stable synthetic juvenile hormone analogue, and monitored effects on larval begging and growth in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. In this species, larvae feed partly by begging for predigested carrion from parents and partly by self-feeding. We showed that elevated juvenile hormone levels stimulate larval begging, suggesting that juvenile hormone in insects could have a similar function to that of testosterone and corticosterone in birds. We also showed that elevated juvenile hormone levels have a negative effect on larval growth and that this negative effect occurs regardless of whether larvae forage by begging or by self-feeding. This finding shows that the effects of juvenile hormone on larval growth are independent of the effects on begging, suggesting that the mechanisms by which juvenile hormone affects offspring growth in insects differ from those by which testosterone and corticosterone affect growth in birds.

AB The ability of bystanders to assess the intrinsic fighting ability of potential opponents with and without contest information was examined in an experimental study using rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Behavioural and heart rate responses were monitored for bystanders observing size-matched conspecifics before and after a staged contest with an opponent. The results suggest that bystanders can rapidly and accurately assess the intrinsic fighting ability/quality of a potential opponent. Within 10 s, bystanders increased their visual exposure towards opponents subsequently becoming subordinate and decreased their exposure towards opponents becoming dominant. Male bystanders showed higher visual exposure towards opponents than did females, regardless of the sex of the opponent. This immediate behavioural response was subsequently (24 h after the first exposure) followed by elevated heart rate in bystanders exposed to dominant opponents, probably reflecting a physiological stress response. Apparently, bystanders used reliable size-independent cues allowing a rapid behavioural response. The delayed physiological response probably arises from the chemical cues associated with the presence of a dominant opponent, or a combination of initial visual cues and subsequent continuous exposure to chemical cues. The results suggest that bystanders are able to rapidly assess the intrinsic fighting ability of a similarsized potential opponent without information about its contest success against other individuals. This ability can be utilised by bystanders to withdraw from costly contest with low winning probability. Thus, escalated conflicts may be less common in nature than previously suggested by laboratory studies. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although it is established that many species of fish release hormonally derived sex pheromones in their urine, whether these cues are unspecialized metabolic by-products or specialized communicatory signals is not known. Here, we addressed this question in the goldfish, Carassius auratus (a leading model of hormonal sex pheromone function) by conducting two experiments. We first monitored urine release by sexually receptive females that were placed with a sexually active male, an inactive male, another female, or no other fish. Sexual receptivity was induced using prostaglandin F-2 alpha, a hormone also known to evoke release of 15-keto prostaglandin F-2 alpha (15K-PGF(2 alpha)), a potent urinary pheromone. We found that sexually receptive females increased the frequency with which they urinated when placed with males (regardless of male sexual activity) but not females. Furthermore, females showed a strong tendency to urinate when rising into spawning substrate, suggesting they might be using urine as an attractive lure. This hypothesis was confirmed by a second experiment, which found that 15K-PGF(2 alpha) attracted males to specific locations. We conclude that goldfish, and likely many other fish, control the release of urinary prostaglandin pheromones to advertise their condition and location, perhaps exemplifying an early step in the evolution of a chemical communication system.

AB In animal groups whose focus is on juvenile growth, prey attributes and the way in which individuals have access to those prey influence the level of sociality. Models examining the evolution of group foraging predict that, if an individual is able to monopolize a prey item, it should not permit collaboration in the capture of or feeding on that prey. If monopoly is not possible, individuals should allow others to join because of the high cost of prey defensibility. Hunger stress can affect the above predictions through its effect on the perceived value of a prey item. An increase in the individual tendency to attack prey could result in more group captures at higher hunger levels when the resident spider fails to monopolize a prey item. I conducted a study on the foraging behaviour of the colonial,spider Parawixia bistriata in habitats with different insect availability. I offered prey items of known size to spiders at their web sites and determined frequency of group capture and feeding relative to prey size. I also recorded the number of individuals participating in capture and feeding groups and interactions between the resident and other foraging spiders. Individuals showed a higher tendency to capture prey and feed in a group as the size of the prey increased. In addition, spiders from habitats with lower levels of prey (dry sites) had a higher tendency to attack prey collectively than did spiders from wet sites where prey levels were higher. Although there were no between-habitat differences in tendency to feed in groups, group sizes of foraging spiders were larger at dry sites. Levels of aggression between the resident and other foraging spiders were low over all trials, but behavioural acts involving direct interactions were more frequent in groups from dry sites.

AB We compared the songs of young male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, in the early 'plastic' phase (while the songs may still be modified, or dropped altogether) and in the later 'crystallized' phase. Birds in this sample dropped 1-3 songs from their plastic repertoire on their way to a crystallized repertoire of 8-11 songs. Consistent with theory of selective attrition, the songs the young birds tended to drop were songs that matched fewer neighbours and matched them more poorly than the songs they retained. At the same time, however, the birds often modified the songs they retained so that these crystallized versions were less similar to the songs of their neighbours than the plastic versions had been. They were more likely to do this for songs they shared with more neighbours. Thus, the song learning process appears to consist of two opposing processes: a tendency to copy and retain the songs of the birds who will be the young bird's neighbours in the first breeding season; and a tendency to modify at least some of these songs so that they are more individually distinctive.

AB The ability of an organism to find new habitat is likely to contribute to dispersal success in different landscapes. We compared the ability of male speckled wood butterflies from two types of landscape to orientate towards forested habitat as a behavioural assay of the ability to perceive forested habitat at a distance ( 25-e 200 m). This field release-experiment showed that butterflies of fragmented agricultural landscape origin were better able to orient towards habitat at a greater distance than butterflies of continuous woodland landscape origin. They followed more linear tracks, displayed flight angles that deviated less from orientation towards habitat, and showed orientations that were significantly directed towards habitat at greater distances than butterflies of continuous landscape origin. Attraction was facilitated when target habitat had a high pro. le. Our behavioural experiment provides novel insights into landscape connectivity and points to interpopulation differences in the ability to find habitat associated with landscape type.

AB When confronted with a swarm of their prey, many predators become confused and are less successful in their attacks. Despite the general notion that this confusion effect is a major reason for prey swarm formation, it is largely unknown how widespread it is and which predator or prey traits facilitate or impede it. We carried out experiments with four predator-prey systems: Aeshna and Chaoborus larvae, but not Libellula and Triturus larvae, became confused when confronted with high Daphnia densities. When combining this result with literature data, we found that predators became confused in 16 of the 25 predator-prey systems studied to date. Tactile predators appear to be generally susceptible, whereas visual predators are susceptible mainly when their prey is highly agile. This difference probably results from the superiority of the visual sensory system. However, while our study is an important step towards the mechanistic understanding of predator confusion, it also reveals how poor this understanding currently is.

AB In polyandrous species, females may influence paternity by biasing sperm usage in favour of particular males. In the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, the number of sperm inseminated in a copulation depends on the female's perception of male attractiveness. We videorecorded copulations in the laboratory to test the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between the number of sperm inseminated and the duration of the copulation. Duration was positively correlated with the number of sperm retrieved from the female's gonoduct. Once copulation duration was statistically controlled for, more sperm were retrieved from the gonoduct in courtship copulations than in coercive copulations, and in postpartum females than in virgin females. Copulation duration was positively correlated with the degree of carotenoid coloration of the male, suggesting that copulation duration might be the proximate mechanism of cryptic female choice in this species. The intensity of 'jerking', a postcopulatory behaviour of male guppies, was positively correlated with the number of sperm inseminated, suggesting a possible signalling function of this display.

AB Many theoretical models have been proposed to explain and predict the behaviour of air-breathing divers exploiting a food resource underwater. Many field observations of the behaviour of divers do not fit with the prediction that to maximize energetic gain divers should dive close to their aerobic diving limits. In an attempt to explain this paradox, Thompson & Fedak (2001, Animal Behaviour, 61, 286-297) proposed a model of diving behaviour that takes into account patchily distributed prey patches of varying quality. We tested this model experimentally in a simulated foraging set-up. We measured the diving behaviour of grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, diving to patches of varying prey density and distance from the surface. Our results were equivocal with respect to the model predictions. Seals responded to prey density, leaving low-quality patches earlier. However, this pattern was still evident at long dive distances, contrary to the prediction that during deep dives seals should stay at a patch regardless of prey density. While seals maximized dive durations at high prey densities and long distances, they did not do so at short distances. The apparent quitting strategy of the seals always produced higher net rates of energy gain than would have been achieved if they had remained at the foraging site up to their aerobic dive limit on every dive. These results indicate that seals' diving behaviour, particularly bottom duration, may indicate the relative prey availability in their environment.

AB In many species, males and/or females produce advertisement calls before, during or after mating. Responsiveness to these calls may vary by sex because of underlying perceptual, motivational or attentional systems. I conducted playback experiments on free-ranging adult rhesus monkeys to examine whether males and females differentially respond to calls from the same male or to calls from different males. In the within-male condition, subjects were habituated to multiple exemplars from the same male and then tested with a novel exemplar from this male. In the between-male condition, subjects were habituated to multiple exemplars from one male and then tested with a novel exemplar from a different male. For both conditions, females habituated more quickly (i. e. required fewer trials) than males. In the within-male condition, females were significantly more likely to orient towards the speaker in the test trial and to spend more time orienting than males. In the between-male condition, males and females showed no differences either in their probability of responding in the test trial or in their duration of response. Although both males and females used the available acoustic information to discriminate between male callers, females showed a heightened capacity to perceive or a stronger motivation to attend to differences between call exemplars from the same male, suggesting sex differences in the peripheral and/or central mechanisms that enable call discrimination.

AB Research on the costs of nest reuse is central to understanding the population ecology and evolution of cavity-nesting birds. We explored the consequences of nest reuse by offering blue tits three types of nestboxes in which to breed: nestboxes with an old nest (O), empty nestboxes (E) and nestboxes with an old nest fumigated with insecticide (F). The experimental groups differed in ectoparasitism level: the O nestboxes had the most and the F nestboxes the fewest ectoparasites. Blue tits using nestboxes that contained old nests from the previous season paid a cost caused by the presence of nest ectoparasites: both reproductive success and female body mass at the end of the nestling period were reduced. Haematozoan infections in females also increased with the level of ectoparasitism. The costs of nest reuse would be reduced in areas and/or seasons with few ectoparasites, as shown by the results from the group with fumigated old nests.

ID SANDHOPPER TALITRUS-SALTATOR; SUN COMPASS; AMPHIPODA; ADULT; LIGHT
AB The sandhopper Talitrus saltator is known to use sun and moon compasses to return to the band of wet sand on a beach. The two compass systems are based on separate chronometric mechanisms that compensate for the azimuthal movement of the two astronomical cues. The aim of our research was to test whether the sandhopper's time-compensating mechanism for lunar compass orientation continues to work during the new moon phase (i.e. when the moon is not visible). Our tests were carried out in a confined environment under the natural sky and in the laboratory under artificial light, in both the full and new moon phases. Sandhoppers released in sea water headed towards the expected land direction of their home beach using the natural or artificial moon as a compass cue independently of the moon's natural phase, including the new moon phase. The sandhoppers' chronometric mechanism that compensates for the moon's azimuthal motion thus works continuously, even during the phase when the actual moon is never visible. This could be based on spatiotemporal interpolation between visible moon positions. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Kin selection theory predicts that the evolution of social behaviours will be promoted if these behaviours increase the inclusive fitness of the individuals that perform them, for example by positively affecting relatives. The ability to identify relatives may thus be crucial in maximizing overall fitness. In primate species, whether individuals discriminate paternal relatives and the mechanisms that might permit such discrimination are still the subject of debate. Some researchers have suggested that primates are not able to discriminate relatives in the absence of familiarity. However, recent studies have shown that paternal kin discrimination could emerge from both age proximity and phenotype matching. We investigated the effects of paternal and maternal kinship on the affiliation index of juvenile mandrills, in a semifree-ranging setting. Juveniles biased their behaviour according to kinship. First, when interacting with adult females, both paternal and maternal half-siblings showed more affiliation than unrelated dyads. Affiliation between juveniles and males was also higher among both father-offspring and maternal half-sibling dyads than among unrelated dyads. While these results suggest that juvenile mandrills are able to discriminate paternal relatives, other results do not. Maternal half-siblings had a higher affiliation index than paternal half-siblings and distant kin, the latter showing no significant differences. Finally, when the mechanisms involved in discrimination of paternal kin were analysed, we found no evidence to confirm either the phenotype-matching or the age proximity hypotheses.

AB Nectarivorous birds are known to make choices at the landscape, plant species and individual plant levels when selecting foraging sites. However, little attention has been given to the fine-scale foraging choices that nectarivorous honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) make, such as those between individual flowers. We examined the variability in nectar availability between individual flowers of mountain correa, Correa lawrenciana, and used this information to predict the foraging behaviour of the eastern spinebill, Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris, a small (10-15 g) member of the Meliphagidae. Eastern spinebills preferentially foraged upon mountain correa flowers that were at the developmental stage offering the greatest volume of nectar. They did not discriminate between the flowers on the basis of corolla length (size), but this was not unexpected as nectar production was not correlated with flower size. Eastern spinebills were significantly less likely to forage at flowers with visual evidence of having been robbed of nectar by vertebrate and invertebrate competitors. They did not discriminate against flowers containing the flower mite, Hattena floricola, even though the flowers produced significantly less nectar when mites were present. This is the first study to show that a member of the Meliphagidae is capable of discriminating between individual flowers, favouring those most likely to contain most nectar.

AB We undertook three experiments to investigate the hypothesis that as the potential costs of individual learning increase, reliance on social learning also increases. We found no effect of indirect cues of predation risk on use of previously acquired social information by Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, choosing between unfamiliar foods (experiment 1). We also found decreased (not increased) use of socially acquired information by rats choosing between unfamiliar foods when exposed to direct cues of predation risk (experiment 2). Furthermore, experiences of gastrointestinal upset following ingestion of unfamiliar foods (intended to act as a cue to the presence of toxic potential foods) failed to increase rats' use of social information when choosing between additional unfamiliar foods (experiment 3). The results of our experiments thus failed to confirm predictions of several formal models of the effects of costs of individual assessment of alternatives on use of socially acquired information.

AB Competition among females represents an important but rather neglected variable in studies of sexual selection. Probably to avoid injury to self and offspring, competition among females is often displayed without much physical interaction and therefore remains harder to observe. Here, we show for the first time in a teleost fish, the zebrafish Danio rerio, that females can use waterborne pheromones to suppress reproduction by other females. Female zebrafish that had been exposed to another female's pheromones for 4 days prior to mating spawned significantly fewer viable eggs than females held in isolation or exposed to male pheromones. Male pheromones not only stimulated female reproduction but also increased the quality and viability of eggs. In grouped females, reproductive success correlated with dominance rank. These results indicate that fish pheromones function to control mates and competitors in addition to serving as reproductive timing signals. Differences in female reproductive success observed in many fish species might be explained by this mechanism. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Else-vier Ltd.

AB Acoustic signals attenuate with the distance over which they travel, but a vocalizing animal might maintain signal transmission by increasing vocal amplitude when addressing a distant receiver. Such behaviour is well known in humans as speakers vary vocal amplitude with changing distance from an audience, a phenomenon that has been interpreted as resulting from our higher cognitive abilities. However, whether nonhuman animals are capable of this form of vocal adjustment appears to be unknown. We investigated whether birds are also able to regulate the amplitude of their vocal signals depending on receiver distance. Male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, increased their song amplitude with increasing distance to addressed females, indicating that songbirds, like humans, respond to differences in communication distance and that they adjust vocal amplitude accordingly. Our findings show that animal communication is flexible in a previously unsuspected way, and that human speech and bird song share a basic mechanism for ensuring signal transmission. We suggest that this behaviour can be accounted for by simple proximate mechanisms rather than by the cognitive abilities that have been thought necessary in humans.

AB Differentiating kin from nonkin enables organisms of many species to allocate resources or altruistic behaviour towards related conspecifics and to avoid mating with close relatives. Kin recognition mechanisms can vary among species and may reflect the social environment. Learned familiarity with nest or shoalmates may serve as a good indication that individuals are related, as long as the social system is sufficiently stable to avoid intermingling of unrelated individuals with siblings. Phenotype matching allows for recognition of even unfamiliar kin because individuals establish an olfactory, visual or acoustic template for their kin during early development and compare this template to cues from unfamiliar individuals later in life. We tested which kin recognition mechanism is used by zebrafish and we found that the preference for kin changes with sexual maturity. The olfactory preference of laboratory-bred juveniles and reproductively active adults were tested in an odour choice flume. juveniles of mixed-sex groups spent more time on the side of unfamiliar kin than unfamiliar nonkin, indicating that kin recognition and preference are based on a phenotype matching mechanism. They also preferred familiar kin to unfamiliar kin, showing that familiarity with individuals enhances kin preference. Preference changed with sexual maturity. Adult females preferred the odour of unfamiliar, unrelated males to unfamiliar brothers, indicating inbreeding avoidance. Adult male zebrafish showed no preference for the odour of related or unrelated females. To our knowledge, this is the first study testing different kin recognition mechanisms and switching of kin preference in the same species of fish.

AB Aposematic insect species are thought to gain protection from avian predators by advertising their unpalatability with bright or conspicuous coloration. However, individuals within a population may differ in their level of chemical defence. Since the speed and strength of avoidance learning are often assumed to be determined by the degree of defence, the presence of more palatable individuals in a population is thought to decrease the value of the warning coloration. Using chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, as model predators and coloured crumbs flavoured with different concentrations of quinine sulphate solution for unpalatable prey, we tested these learning assumptions using a colour discrimination task. The mean level of prey defence was positively correlated with the speed of avoidance learning, and negatively correlated with the ease with which learned aversions were reversed. However, it was unclear how prey palatability influenced the strength of avoidance learning, since the number of unpalatable crumbs attacked at asymptote was not correlated with the mean level of prey defence, although the reluctance to attack an unpalatable crumb within a trial was positively correlated with prey defence. We also found that the proportion of the attacked unpalatable crumbs that were subsequently rejected was positively correlated with the mean level of prey defence. Our results show the importance of the level of prey defence in determining both the attack and ingestion rates of avian predators. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Models of sexual selection predict that mating competition within a population will increase with a biased operational sex ratio (OSR). However, these models do not consider any influence of the individuals' capacity for additional matings. Using the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, we tested whether intensity of mating competition (measured as the fraction of time spent displaying) is influenced by a male's imminent capacity for additional matings (nest capacity, i.e. additional space available for egg laying in the nest). We manipulated nest size and number of females (zero to three) allowed to spawn in each male's nest, and then used display rate to estimate the male's intensity of mating competition. The nests were never filled completely, but always had room for eggs from at least one more mating. We found no significant difference in display rate between males with large or small nests, whether nest size was measured as nest capacity or area already covered by eggs. In fact, males with many eggs in their nests displayed as much as males with empty nests. However, male display decreased significantly with time. As male display behaviour was not influenced by whether the nest was empty or was partially filled, the number of males and females ready to mate (i.e. the OSR) provides a good estimate of the intensity of male mating competition. Nevertheless, many other species may adjust mating competition to their capacity for additional matings, which may thus influence the accuracy of OSR-based estimates of mating competition and sexual selection.

AB Bumblebees leave scent marks on flowers, and use these marks to avoid recently depleted resources. We tested whether the response to such scent marks is fixed, or whether bees can adjust their responses flexibly, depending on floral complexity. Complex flowers require longer handling times and, when foraging on these flowers, bees show spatial foraging patterns that make revisits more likely. Therefore, we examined whether bees responded to scent marks more strongly if they were found on complex flowers, in order to reduce these revisits. To do this, we used two types of artificial flowers that differed in handling time. Bees preferred foraging on short flowers, but accepted both types. However, when they approached flowers, bees were more than twice as likely to reject scent-marked long flowers than short ones, and the effect of scent marks lingered for 60% longer in long flowers. Bees most often rejected long flowers in flight, without direct access to tactile cues indicating floral handling time. Therefore, they solved the task by using the current visual input to recall a memory of floral handling time, and they combined this information with a current olfactory cue, that is, the scent mark.

AB Sexual cannibalism, where a female kills and consumes a courting male, represents an extreme form of sexual conflict and has been proposed as a mechanism of mate choice. We evaluate the evidence for mate choice through premating sexual cannibalism via mate rejection, other indirect mechanisms of mate 'choice' and choice in postmating sexual cannibalism. We highlight a paucity of investigations, particularly of field studies, and note gaps in our knowledge. There is empirical support for the size-dependent sexual cannibalism predicted by mate choice through premating sexual cannibalism. This may represent mate choice operating on absolute male size but it could be a by-product of female foraging behaviour and greater vulnerability of relatively smaller males. Thus, indirect mate choice is as plausible an explanation of size-dependent sexual cannibalism as is direct mate choice based on discrimination of male traits. Direct female choice, mediated through premating sexual cannibalism, has yet to be demonstrated. We suggest a framework for distinguishing direct and indirect choice and note an absence of information on which to test it. There is evidence for sequential mate choice in postmating sexual cannibalism, but the nature or basis of the female's discriminatory behaviour remains unclear. Costs and long-term fitness benefits of the putative mate choice have been largely ignored. Reversed sexual cannibalism, in which the male eats the female, presumably occurs when the gain from food is high and potential gain from mating low and probably has little to do with mate choice.

TI Changing territories, changing tunes:: male loons, <i>Gavia immer</i>,
   change their vocalizations when they change territories
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID INDIVIDUALITY
AB Male common loons produce a territorial vocalization called the yodel. Each male loon has a characteristic yodel that is stable from year to year and differs from that of other male loons on other lakes. Of 13 male loons whose yodels we recorded before and after they changed territories, 12 substantially changed their yodels either the first or second year on the new territory. Furthermore, this change increased the difference between the new resident's yodel and that of the previous resident. This result implies that loons not only change their vocalizations as the birds change territory, but also that the new owner is familiar with the yodel of the resident that it replaces.

AB Extrapair paternity occurs in many bird species and males use mate guarding, aggression or frequent copulations to reduce the risk of losing paternity. Because paternity assurance behaviour is likely to be costly, it should be adjusted to varying levels of perceived risk. We evaluated experimentally the adjustment of paternity assurance behaviour to risk in a raptor in which courtship feeding occurs: the Montagu's harrier, Circus pygargus. We used decoys with or without prey to simulate territorial intrusions by adult or first-year males. Inexperienced first-year males should represent a lesser risk than adult males and decoys with prey should represent a greater risk than those without prey, because courtship food could be traded for extrapair copulations. Aggression was less intense towards first-year than adult males during the female's fertile period. However, when decoys were presented with prey, aggression was similar towards first-years and adults. Males increased their short-term copulation rate in response to male decoys, particularly those presented with prey. Males also increased copulation duration, but only in response to adult male decoys. Our results show that male Montagu's harriers can fine-tune their paternity assurance behaviour to varying levels of risk, in this case the type of territorial intrusion. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the adaptive significance of delayed maturation in plumage colour in this species. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Division of labour in social insect colonies relies on behavioural functional differentiation (specialization) of individuals with similar genomes. However, individual behavioural traits do not evolve independently of each other (behavioural syndromes). A prime example is the suite of behavioural differences in honeybee workers that has evolved in response to bidirectional selection on pollen hoarding of honeybee colonies (pollen-hoarding syndrome). More generally, these differences reflect functional differentiation between nectar and pollen foragers. We demonstrate here that this pollen-hoarding syndrome extends to drones. Similar to what has been shown in workers, drones from the high-pollen-hoarding strain had a higher locomotion activity after emergence, and they initiated flight earlier than did males derived from the low-pollen-hoarding strain, with hybrids intermediate. However, these two behavioural traits were unlinked at the individual level. We also found that social environment (the colony) affects the age at which drones initiate flight. The indirect selection responses of male behaviour suggest that male and worker evolution are not independent and may constrain each other's evolution. Furthermore, we identified three distinct peaks in the probability of flight initiation over the course of the experiment and a decreased phenotypic variability in the 'hybrid' males, contrary to quantitative genetic expectations.

   CONTESTS
AB Territorial songbirds frequently challenge each other with intrusions and close-range singing interactions. The timing of songs in such interactions may signal aggressive intentions and experiments have shown that song overlapping may indicate a higher willingness to escalate an interaction than song alternating. A territory owner should therefore perceive an intruder overlapping its songs and staying inside its territory as a greater threat than one alternating and exiting the territory quickly. To test this hypothesis we used playback to interact with territorial male blue tits, Parus caeruleus, by varying the amount of overlap of a subject's song; we also used multiple loudspeakers to simulate an intruder changing song posts. The territory owners approached and followed simulated intruders that changed song post inside their territories more slowly when more of their songs had been overlapped at the first loudspeaker, and they did not follow an intruder outside their territory. Nevertheless their responses remained high throughout playback and interaction terms between proportion of songs overlapped and loudspeaker position inside or outside the territory indicated that male blue tits combined and used information from both singing and intrusion patterns.

AB The current popularity of traditional herbal supplements, coupled with recent findings that add scientific legitimacy to the use of some medicinal herbs, prompts a question about the origins of herbal medicine in animals and ancestral humans. Medicinal herbs are used by animals and humans with the apparent prophylactic effects of reducing the likelihood or severity of illness from pathogens or parasites in the future. Medicinal herbs with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and/or analgesic properties are used in a therapeutic way to treat acute infections and inflammatory conditions, particularly in humans, and could have proven lifesaving to individuals living in nature. Was the origin of such types of herbal medicine the result of animals and humans learning that specific plant parts are effective for preventing or treating certain maladies, or was the origin a result of natural selection for a behavioural. predisposition to seek out and use plant parts with particular physical or chemosensory markers of efficacy? Examining the predictions and requirements of both the learned and evolutionary explanations points primarily to an evolutionary model for the origin of herbal medicine that was expanded and enhanced by learning and social transmission. The evolutionary explanation accounts for the continued use of ineffective, as well as effective, medicinal herbs and the use of medicinal herbs with toxic effects. In animals one can point to origins of the practice of herbal medicine, as well as other behavioural defences against pathogens and parasites, as analogues of many aspects of modern human medicine and health care.

AB We tested whether nestlings of a generalist brood parasite, the brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater, had special adaptations for tuning into host parent food and alarm calls. We compared the responses of 7-day-old cowbird nestlings reared by eastern phoebes, Sayornis phoebe, with those of a related, nonparasitic icterid, the red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus, reared experimentally in phoebe nests. Cowbirds begged readily to manual stimulation but not to playbacks of either phoebe or red-winged blackbird food calls, irrespective of whether they had been reared alone, or together with phoebe nestlings (and so had experience of nestmates which responded strongly to phoebe food calls). Red-winged blackbirds reared by phoebes did not differ from those reared by conspecifics. They responded as readily as cowbirds to manual stimulation, but also (surprisingly) begged most strongly to phoebe food calls, whose rapid chatter might act as super-normal red-wing food calls. Both cowbirds and red-winged blackbirds reared alone by phoebes reduced begging most to red-winged blackbird alarms, suggesting that they share an innate icterid response, although this selective response was less marked in cowbirds reared alongside phoebe young. We conclude that cowbirds do not tune into phoebe host parent vocalizations. Given the problem of attending to such a variety of host species food and alarm calls, it may be most adaptive for generalist brood parasites simply to respond to general vibrational or visual cues likely to be encountered across all hosts.

AB We investigated how the behaviour of domestic foals, Equus caballus, living at pasture with their dams was associated with foal gender, mare rank and the development of abnormal oral behaviour, both during the preweaning period, and over a period of up to 4 years postweaning. A population of 186 foals belonging to private owners and commercial studs was studied. The behaviour of male and female foals hardly differed, but mare rank affected patterns of foal social interaction and suckling behaviour, with foals of subordinate mares involved in more affiliative interactions. These foals also spent more time in perisuckling activities such as teat nuzzling than foals of other mares. During the study, 18 foals developed abnormal oral behaviour before weaning and 42 foals developed abnormal oral behaviour after weaning. The development of abnormal oral behaviour was associated with suckling behaviour in a variety of ways. Foals that had already developed abnormal oral behaviour at the time of the preweaning observations were involved in more suckling terminations within bouts than normal foals or foals that developed future abnormal behaviour, and pushing the udder with the muzzle was most frequent in these foals. Foals that had no current abnormal oral behaviour, but that would develop this in the future, spent more time suckling and twice as much time teat nuzzling as other foals. The results add to the growing evidence of associations between digestive function and abnormal oral behaviour in horses. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The optimal acceptance threshold model predicts that kin/nestmate discrimination is context dependent and that, in a fluctuating environment, the action component of nestmate discrimination is plastic, rather than static. We examined changes in intraspecific aggression among colonies of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, in various discrimination contexts, and found that aggression occurred at higher rates when either nestmates or familiar territory indicated nest proximity, but not when social context was absent, thereby providing additional support for the optimal acceptance threshold model. Context-dependent aggression in the Argentine ant appears to result from a shift in acceptance threshold in response to fitness costs associated with accepting nonkin. The change in the action component of Argentine ant nestmate discrimination was explained to some degree by the hypothesis that the presence of nestmates indicates nest proximity and denotes a fitness payoff for active defence (nest indicator hypothesis) and by the hypothesis that nestmates share the cost of nest defence in groups, but not singly (cost minimizer hypothesis). Isolated nest referents (familiar territory, conspecific brood, or single familiar nestmates), however, had no effect on aggression thresholds. We provide mixed support for the hypothesis that workers from genetically less diverse colonies attack workers from more diverse colonies. We found that, in the context of nest defence, genetically more diverse colonies initiated attacks on colonies with lower genetic diversity. Therefore, the role of asymmetrical aggression in reducing genetic diversity within introduced populations of L. humile remains unknown and other extrinsic factors such as nest status and/or colony size may affect the outcome of aggressive interactions in the field. Finally, our finding that colonies reared under uniform conditions showed diminished intraspecific aggression only when assayed in a social and/or ecological context underscores the importance of using appropriate aggression assays for testing patterns of intercolony aggression in L. humile, and that the use of different rearing regimes, source colonies and collection times may produce contradictory results.

AB Autotomy, found in multiple taxa, is the voluntary shedding of limbs and other appendages in response to predation, intraspecific conflicts and infection or damage. In a wild population of the field cricket, we found that 36% of 110 individuals of both sexes were missing at least one limb. We examined the speed to autotomize an entrapped limb and the costs of this autotomy in both sexes of a first-generation laboratory population of known age. We induced autotomy of either the two hindlegs or the two middle legs over 2 subsequent days. We found no sex differences in speed of autotomy, but hindlegs were autotomized faster than middle legs, and first legs were shed faster than second legs. Escape speed was significantly reduced by the loss of either middle or hindlegs, and number of jumps in the escape sprint was reduced. We found no significant effect of loss of two legs on male-male competitive ability, but loss of two legs in females significantly reduced mating ability by pairs. Males with autotomized middle leas showed reduced longevity, but neither sex showed a significant effect of autotomy on body mass. Gryllus bimaculatus, therefore, appears to incur both direct and indirect fitness costs from limb autotomy. This study has implications for understanding the general biology of crickets and contributes to our understanding of the role of autotomy as an evolutionary mechanism.

AB We investigated benefits of polyandry and phenotypic correlates of male mating success in black ratsnakes. We used 10 microsatellite loci to identify the sires of 375 hatchlings from 34 clutches with known mothers. Multiple paternity occurred in 88% of clutches, despite the fact that ratsnakes mate when dispersed. The incidence of multiple paternity did not vary with female size or with clutch size. Hatching success tended to be higher in multiply sired clutches, but offspring from these clutches were not longer or heavier. We identified 34 males as the sires of 144 hatchlings. Most instances where sires could not be identified resulted from exclusion of all 426 potential sires that we screened. Unidentified sires were probably males that hibernated outside our study area and thus were not included in the intensive sampling at hibernacula in the study area. Among males that sired offspring, body size but not tail length contributed to success, consistent with male-biased sexual size dimorphism and made-male combat shown by this species. Large males were more successful primarily by siring more offspring per clutch rather than by siring offspring in more clutches. This may be a result of greater success in sperm competition. Neither body condition nor genetic similarity to the female was related to male mating success. Our results, in conjunction with published data on movement patterns, suggest that snakes of both genders can benefit from actively seeking multiple matings.

AB Although many factors have been shown to influence the evolution of species recognition signals in a wide variety of taxa, it is difficult to draw general conclusions because of fundamental differences in the morphologies and ecologies of the animals considered. In this study, two morphologically and ecologically similar lizard genera (Sceloporus and Liolaemus) are used to provide replicate examples of the evolution of a complex visual display. New data on the headbob displays of 16 Liolaemus species are presented. As in other taxa, phylogenetic analyses show that evolutionary changes in display structure have been rapid, leaving little, if any, phylogenetic information in the display structure. Evolutionary changes in display structure also do not appear to be closely associated with any major habitat characteristics. Despite this rapid evolution, Liolaemus lizards produce headbob displays that are remarkably simple in structure in comparison to those produced by Sceloporus, perhaps compensating for lower complexity by frequent use of other visual displays such as forelimb and tail waves.

AB Reproductive consequences of male spacing patterns have received relatively little attention in nonterritorial mammals, in particular in group-living species, where most studies have focused on the relation between social rank and reproductive success. We investigated the effects of spacing pattern on male reproductive success within a social, nonterritorial, promiscuous population of stray cats, Felis catus. Male home ranges overlapped home ranges of many females, consistent with a promiscuous mating system. Furthermore, males with the largest home ranges included the most female home ranges; they successfully reproduced with these females and had the highest reproductive success. Home range size predicted male reproductive success even when controlling for the effect of social rank. However, males also reproduced with females whose home range did not overlap their home range, suggesting that,males can make quick excursions outside their home range to find new mating opportunities. We conclude that, in group-living situations, a male's ability to maintain a large home range may be one of the principal causes of variation in mating success in the stray cat. 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Central-place foragers organize their feeding trips both to feed themselves and to provide their offspring with food. In seabirds, several long-range foragers have been shown to alternate long and short trips to balance these dual needs. However, the strategies of short-range foragers remain poorly understood. We used a precise, miniaturized motion sensor to examine the time budget of 20 breeding Cape gannets, Morus capensis, foraging off the coast of South Africa. Birds stayed at sea for 5.5-25.3 h, occasionally spending the night at sea. The large number of isolated dives and extended flight time observed during these overnight trips suggested that birds either experienced poor foraging conditions or exploited more distant, yet more profitable prey patches. Conversely, birds that stayed at sea for less than 1 day had relatively consistent activity patterns. Most of these birds (88%) foraged actively at the beginning and at the end of the foraging trip. These feeding bouts were separated by protracted periods of sitting on the sea surface. Such resting periods probably allow birds to digest the food ingested during the first part of the foraging trip, so they initially feed themselves, and then obtain food for their chick on the way back to the breeding site.

   CHIMPANZEES; SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; NON-RELATIVES; EVOLUTION; RECIPROCITY;

AB Many animal species, from arthropods to apes, share food. This paper presents a new framework that categorizes nonkin food sharing according to two axes: (1) the interval between sharing and receiving the benefits of sharing, and (2) the currency units in which benefits accrue to the sharer (especially food versus nonfood). Sharers can obtain immediate benefits from increased foraging efficiency, predation avoidance, mate provisioning, or manipulative mutualism. Reciprocity trade, status enhancement and group augmentation can delay benefits. When benefits are delayed or when food is exchanged for nonfood benefits, maintaining sharing can become more difficult because animals face discounting and currency conversion problems. Explanations that involve delayed or nonfood benefits may require specialized adaptations to account for timing and currency-exchange problems. The immediate, selfish fitness benefits that a sharer may gain through by-product or manipulative mutualism, however, apply to various food-sharing situations across many species and may provide a simpler, more general explanation of sharing.

   POECILIOPSIS; MECHANISM
AB Two species of the endangered Sonoran topminnow, Poeciliopsis occidentalis and P. sonoriensis, occur in two isolated drainage systems in southeast Arizona, U.S.A., and are allopatric throughout their range. Although these two taxa are morphologically very similar, and have been previously described as the same species or subspecies, several molecular studies have since indicated that they differ more than their morphology suggests. To determine whether the behaviours of the two species function as premating barriers to reproduction, we investigated their mating preferences and behavioural patterns in a laboratory setting. Results from no-choice mating observations showed that the mating behaviours of the two species differ. Observations conducted during multiple-choice mating trials provided evidence of assortative mating, suggesting an early stage of premating reproductive isolation.

TI Habitat-related aggressive behaviour between neighbouring colonies of
   the polydomous wood ant <i>Formica aquilonia</i>
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SUCCESSION
AB Ant species of the late succession stages usually have several queens and a polydomous colony structure, where several colonies occupy the same territory without competing. The wood ant Formica aquilonia is a good example of such a species in boreal forests. In this species, the lack of intraspecific competition,may be caused by the stable environment and abundant food resources (e.g. excretions of tree-living aphids). We studied how habitat destruction, in the form of clear-cutting, affects aggressiveness between neighbouring colonies in F. aquilonia. Intercolonial relationships were more hostile in clear-cuts than in forest interiors. This aggression may be the result of increased intraspecific resource competition or alienation of neighbouring colonies caused by the loss of visual orientation cues. We suggest that the original polydomous relationships between colonies decline and colonies may start aggressive competition for the remaining resources.

AB Studies of geographical variation in animal signals generally focus on breeding-season behaviour but, in many species, signalling persists throughout the year. In passerine birds, patterns of variation in the nonbreeding season might provide opportunities for vocal learning that have been neglected by a historic focus on breeding-season behaviour. This study provides the first example of dialect variation outside of the breeding season. Quantitative analysis of acoustic similarity showed discrete differences between the songs of bronzed cowbirds, Molothrus aeneus, in four winter flocks. Most songs produced by members of a given flock were classified as belonging to the same dialect. Songs from one of the four winter dialects were indistinguishable from songs recorded in the breeding season in the same region. Depending on migratory patterns, dialects in one season may be a consequence of dialects in the other season, or the two seasonal patterns may be the result of independent social or evolutionary forces. Because the nonbreeding season is an important period of vocal learning in some bird species, winter dialects might limit the range of signals available for individuals to learn to produce.

AB Avian brood parasitism often has multiple negative effects on the reproductive success of the host. Most studies have focused on one or two of these effects, but rarely have they all been studied simultaneously for one species. I studied prothonotary warblers to quantify the effects of different intensities of (i.e. multiple) brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, on the production of host and cowbird young and on the between-year returns of adult warblers. Host clutch size decreased with an increase in the number of cowbird eggs laid in nests. The hatching success of warbler and cowbird eggs decreased with increased cowbird eggs in nests, but was always higher for cowbird eggs than warbler eggs. The survival of warbler nestlings, but not cowbird nestlings, decreased with increased cowbird nestlings in the brood. An increase in the number of cowbird nestlings in broods resulted in a reduction in the average mass of warbler nestlings but not cowbird nestlings. The number of cowbird eggs or nestlings present did not affect nest predation, and the fledging of cowbirds did not influence the renesting interval of female warblers. In addition, the between-year returns of adult warblers were not negatively affected by brood parasitism. Decreased hatching success and nestling survival reduced the reproductive output of the warblers the most. These effects were substantial and appear to favour the evolution of behavioural responses that reduce the effects of brood parasitism on prothonotary warblers.

AB We examined orientation responses of juvenile salmonids to a polarized-light stimulus under laboratory conditions. juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, steelhead (anadromous), O. mykiss, and brook char, Salvelinus fontinalis, were trained using an operant conditioning methodology to orient relative to the axis of a linear-polarized light field. On average, rainbow trout responded correctly relative to the orientation of the light stimulus approximately 70% of the time within five training sessions. The proportion of correct responses increased further under an intermittent reinforcement schedule. We released trained and untrained fish individually in a circular tank and quantified orientation responses using a digital image-tracking system. Experimentally naive rainbow trout had no directional tendency, in contrast to trained rainbow trout, steelhead and brook char, which oriented relative to the plane of polarized light. Trained fish showed no orientation response when a diffuser was used to depolarize the light source. Rainbow trout trained to orient parallel to a polarization axis in the laboratory were tested under natural skylight before sunset. These fish oriented parallel to the bearing of maximally polarized light in the celestial hemisphere.

AB When African honeybees, Apis mellifera scutellata, migrate into an area, substantial hybridization occurs with existing European bee populations. However, over time European traits disappear until the populations become predominantly or entirely African. European patrilineal traits could be lost when hybrid colonies raise virgin queens if African-patriline queens have a survival advantage during reproductive competition. We examined queen competition in observation colonies that contained an African (A) or European (E) matriline, and both patrilines. In colonies of either matriline, the virgin queens that survived the elimination process were those that emerged sooner, piped more, eliminated more rivals and received more vibration signals from workers. Hybrid queens had increased piping and vibration rates and greater fighting success than did purebred queens. However, the effects of hybridization were expressed differently in the two matrilines, resulting in significant matriline-by-patriline interactions. In the E-matriline colonies, African-patriline queens emerged sooner, piped more, killed more rivals, were vibrated at higher rates and were more likely to survive the replacement period than were their European-patriline sister queens. In contrast, in the A-matriline colonies, the behaviour of African- and European-patriline queens was highly variable, and the two queen types did not differ for any of the characters examined or the ability to survive the rival elimination period. Thus, African paternity potentially conveys a competitive advantage to queens of European maternity, which would contribute to the spread of African alleles and the loss of European traits in hybrid zones. Furthermore, we observed that vibration signals were produced predominantly by African-paternity workers. The vibration signal may influence the spread of African traits, and this effect may be mediated largely by the behaviour of African-paternity workers.

AB During field studies on a wild population of Arctic foxes, Alopex lagopus, on the Commander Island Mednyi (Northern Pacific) we examined whether acoustic long-distance signals were used for individual recognition. Barks of 10 individually known animals from five neighbouring groups were tape recorded. The spectral characteristics of the barks were described in terms of averaged 1/12 octave spectra. With a discriminant function analysis, more than 90% of the calls could be assigned to the correct individual on the basis of the spectral parameters. Discrimination was only slightly improved when we added temporal parameters to the analysis. We carried out playback experiments with eight foxes near the territory boundary of their family groups. The foxes were significantly more likely to respond with territorial behaviour and longer barking bouts to playbacks of neighbours or strangers than to playbacks of group members. We conclude that individuals can distinguish between barks of members of their own social group and those of other foxes.

AB The period of territorial settlement is critical for territorial species, and the initial disputes to fix the boundaries can be energetically expensive. Territorial residents may be able to reduce defensive costs during settlement by selecting territories with landmarks at the sites of potential boundaries. We examined the effects of landmarks on defensive costs in a laboratory study of a cichlid fish, the blockhead, Steatocranus casuarius. In the landmark treatment, we placed a row of flat rocks across the centre of the aquaria; trials in the control treatment were identical but lacked landmarks. When landmarks were present, blockheads spent significantly less time in territorial defence, as they had fewer and shorter aggressive interactions with their neighbours. In addition, fights in landmark trials tended to be of lower intensity than fights in control trials: most fights in landmark trials included only low-level displays but most fights in control trials included physical contact. Both of these measures thus indicated that defensive costs were lowered by landmarks. In addition, in landmark trials typically both pairs of fish successfully established territories; in contrast, in control trials generally only one pair was able to establish a territory, with the other pair being evicted. The presence of landmarks appeared to make possible the division of the area available for settlement, with pairs establishing smaller territories than when there were no landmarks.

AB Females of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus avoid adding eggs to seeds that already bear eggs. Geographical variation in this behaviour has been thought to depend on differences in host size. In populations that attack small-seeded legumes, only one or two larvae can develop within a seed, and females are especially adept at detecting and rejecting occupied (egg-laden) seeds. We performed a mass-selection experiment in which replicate lines of a population associated with a small host (mung bean, Vigna radiata) were either maintained on this host or were transferred to a larger host (cowpea, Vigna unguiculata) that can support several larvae per seed. After more than 40 generations, we estimated the strength of host discrimination by presenting females a choice of egg-free and egg-laden seeds, and by quantifying how uniformly females spread their eggs among egg-free seeds. Compared to females maintained on mung bean, females from cowpea lines were more likely to accept occupied seeds in choice tests. They also distributed their eggs less uniformly, especially when cowpea served as the test host. Cowpea lines thus evolved to resemble populations that have long been associated with the larger host. A separate study showed that weaker host discrimination in the cowpea lines was accompanied by a decline in larval competitiveness, which may have further relaxed selection for avoidance of occupied hosts. Our results demonstrate that switching to a novel resource can produce rapid and predictable changes in a fitness-related insect behaviour.

AB Temperament traits in animals may have important fitness consequences, but have received little attention from ecologists or evolutionary biologists. A few studies have linked variation in temperament with fitness, but none has measured selection on temperament traits. We estimated the strength of selection on female boldness and docility on bighorn sheep ewes, Ovis canadensis. The Ram Mountain population experienced little predation pressure during the first 25 years of study, then 2 years (1997 and 1998) of frequent predation by cougars, Puma concolor, during which adult ewe mortality almost tripled over the long-term average, to 27% a year. During years of high predation, we found moderate selection favouring bold ewes, and age-specific selection on docility. Old ewes appeared more vulnerable to predation than young ewes. In contrast, no evidence of selection on temperament traits was observed during 2 years of low predation (1996 and 1999). These results suggest predator-induced selection favouring bold and nondocile ewes. Leadership was highly correlated with age and may increase the risk of predator encounter. Leadership alone, however, could not explain the higher vulnerability of old ewes to predation. Cougar predation on bighorn sheep occurs sporadically and unpredictably, probably because individual cougars often are prey specialists. Cougar predation may have limited microevolutionary effects on temperament in bighorn sheep, because it mostly affects ewes near the end of their reproductive life span and because of potential countervailing selection on boldness and docility.

AB We report the results of two field experiments assessing whether exposure to mobbing calls, which usually indicates the presence of a predator, elicits changes in. risk, perception as measured by the willingness of forest birds to enter or cross gaps in forest cover. In the first experiment, we tested the prediction that wintering black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapilla, will travel less in open areas to seek food from a feeder during a simulated mobbing event than they will under control conditions. The number of visits to feeders decreased at increasing distances from forest edges (0-10 m) when mobbing calls were played. Mobbing calls increased the overall rate of visits to feeders, but lowered the rate of visits to feeders located at 10 m from forest edges. By contrast, when a stuffed merlin, Falco columbarius, was placed near the feeder, chickadees rarely visited the feeder, regardless of the distance to forest edge. In the second experiment, we tested the prediction that breeding male red-eyed vireos, Vireo olivaceus, would be less attracted to the song of a nearby red-eyed vireo after a playback of a mobbing event than after a 'neutral' sound stimulus, especially if they had to cross an open area. Vireos were as willing to enter or cross gaps in forest cover following exposure to mobbing calls, although they responded more frequently to conspecific song under forest cover than across gaps. Our results suggest that forest birds under cover assess the risk of a mobbing situation largely on the basis of the distance to the cause of mobbing. It follows that a trade-off between risk and reward may not occur with mobbing birds, unless mobbing occurs far outside forest cover and/or at very close range (<5 m) to a predator.

AB The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, is a widespread invasive species characterized by reduced intraspecific aggression within introduced populations. To illuminate the mechanisms underlying nestmate recognition in Argentine ants, we studied the spatial and temporal fidelity of intraspecific aggression in an introduced population of Argentine ants within which intraspecific aggression does occur. We quantified variation in the presence or absence of intraspecific aggression among nests over time both in the field and under controlled laboratory conditions to gain insight into the role of environmental factors as determinants of nestmate discriminatory ability. In addition, we compared levels of intraspecific aggression between nest pairs to the similarity of their cuticular hydrocarbons to determine the potential role of these compounds as labels for nestmate discrimination. In both field and laboratory comparisons, nest pairs behaved in a consistent manner throughout the course of the experiment: pairs that fought did so for an entire year, and, pairs that did not fight remained nonaggressive. Moreover, we found a negative relationship between cuticular hydrocarbon similarity and the degree of aggression between nests, suggesting that these hydrocarbons play a role in nestmate discriminatory ability. In contrast to the prevailing pattern, ants from one site showed a marked change in behaviour during the course of this study. A concomitant change was also seen in the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of ants from this site. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Individuals that dare approach. predators (predator inspection behaviour) can reduce their overall risk of predation by, engaging in attack cone avoidance. Under laboratory conditions, we investigated the interaction between predator diet, and prey experience with predators in attack cone avoidance during predator inspection visits by glowlight tetras, Hemigrammus erythrozonus (Characidae, Ostariophysi). Shoals of,predator-experienced versus predator-naive glowlight tetras were exposed to live Jack Dempsey cichlids, Cichlasoma octofaciatum, that had been fed a diet of tetras (possessing an alarm pheromone) or swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri (lacking a recognizable alarm pheromone). Naive tetras exposed to tetra-fed predators significantly increased their. antipredator response (increased shoaling, dashing and freezing) and altered their predator inspection behaviour (increased, latency to respond, decreased rate of inspection and decreased inspecting group size) compared with naive tetras exposed to swordtail-fed predators. In addition, naive tetras exposed to tetra-fed predators directed significantly greater proportions of their inspection visits towards the tail versus the head of the predator (attack cone avoidance) versus naive tetras exposed to swordtail-fed predators. Experienced tetras, regardless of predator diet, also significantly increased antipredator responses and altered their inspection behaviour. Experienced tetras also displayed significant attack cone avoidance. These data suggest that both predator diet and prey experience play a significant role in the threat-sensitive mediation of predator inspection behaviour in prey fish.

AB Scent marking is common among male and female rodents and might be used in male-male competition and as a mechanism for mate attraction. I tested the hypotheses that females would choose males based on their frequency and placement of scent marks, and that a female would. advertise interest in a particular male by placing her scent marks on or near those of a preferred mating partner. In a series of experiments conducted with prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, females did hot choose mates based on the frequency or placement of scent marks by males nor did they advertise their interest in a particular male through the frequency or placement of scent marks. The number of males chosen that scent-marked more than their opponents did not differ significantly between females exposed (11 of 15) and not exposed (10 of 15) to scents of males. Females exposed and not exposed to scents of males preferred seven of the same males that had scent-marked more than their opponents. When a third group of females was exposed to four times more scent of the less preferred than preferred males, they still chose the preferred males. Thus, the frequency and placement of scent marks by males were not used to assess males for mate choice nor did female prairie voles use scent to advertise their preference for a mating partner. In that scent marking is common in male and female mammals, scent quality might be more important than quantity in male-male competition and mate attraction.

AB Animals living in environments of different quality will have different expectations of their future reproductive success and survival. This may affect the individual's risk-taking behaviour as manifest in the cost of predation. We investigated the foraging behaviour of starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, when perceived predation risk varied between patches. Short-term food availability varied between treatments and long-term differences in perceptions of environmental quality varied between groups of individuals. This corresponds to variation in the three components of the cost of predation (P): the predation risk (p); the change in reproductive value with energy gain (partial derivativeF/partial derivativee); and the reproductive value or fitness factor (F). The birds showed that they experienced a higher cost of predation while using the risky food patches (mu component) and in the high food treatment (partial derivativeF/partial derivativee component). Furthermore, birds from a high-reward habitat revealed a higher P than birds from a poor habitat (F component). The results show that the costs of predation are possible to tease apart by using behavioural indicators. The method presented allows measurement of fitness prospects of individuals, which may have consequences for conservation, for example, to identify low-quality habitat.

AB Female green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri, possess a preference for the multicomponent male sword. Previous work suggests that this female preference is a result of a pre-existing receiver bias favouring a sword and has contributed to sword evolution via intersexual selection. We use video presentations to investigate how females respond to components of this composite trait. Complete swords in this species have at least four individual components. Based on female response to video stimuli depicting males with intact swords and males in which sword components were digitally manipulated, it appears that males possessing complete swords elicit the strongest female response. Additionally, we found that females prefer stimuli with black sword coloration to those lacking black coloration. The results suggest that multiple components of the sword stimulate females, and that these components operate in conjunction to make the sword structure more attractive to females. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We compared measures of laterality obtained by two observational sampling procedures (a 15-min focal-dyad sampling with continuous recording, and a scan and instantaneous sampling), using 10 mother-infant dyads of captive olive baboons. The two measures of lateral biases for maternal cradling, infant nipple preference, infant head position and maternal carrying, but not those for infant retrieval, were positively and significantly correlated. Our results clearly show that the two sampling procedures produce equally sensitive measures of lateral bias for both the maternal and the infant behaviours. They also provide evidence of asymmetries in mean bout length and therefore suggest that recording bouts is not necessarily the best measure of lateral bias. Taken together, these results show empirically that the scan and instantaneous sampling procedure does not lead to a lack of independence of data points, as previously assumed. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In fish with paternal care, males often eat their offspring (i.e. filial cannibalism). This is regarded as a male's adaptive strategy to maximize lifetime reproductive success by enhancing his own survivorship or the survivorship of the remaining offspring at the cost of current reproductive success. Although the parental energy reserve has been considered a primary factor influencing filial cannibalism, the possibility that mate availability may also be an important factor has been overlooked. When many mates are available, males may receive a surplus of eggs, which can be treated as an energy reserve and reallocated to future breeding attempts. We present a game theoretical model for the evolution of filial cannibalism, incorporating intrinsic parental condition and extrinsic breeding system components which determine mate availability. The model predicts that filial cannibalism is favoured under the following conditions: (1) the male's energy reserve is low; (2) mate search efficiency is high; (3) the population density is high; (4) the sex ratio is female biased; (5) the male care period is long; and (6) the female's refractory period is short. Conditions 2-6 facilitate filial cannibalism through an increase in mate availability. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The brown ghost, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, produces electric organ discharges (EODs) distinguished by their high degree of regularity. Transient modulations of these discharges occur spontaneously in two forms, chirps and gradual frequency rises (GFRs). Fish kept under a 12:12 h light:dark cycle showed a pronounced variation in the rate of spontaneous production of these two types of modulatory behaviours. Chirps were 2.4-5.6 times more frequent at night than during the day, whereas the generation of gradual frequency rises was 1.4-2.0 times higher during the day than at night. Fish subjected to 5 days of constant light, followed by 5 days of constant dark, showed similar light-dark-dependent changes in the production of chirps and GFRs as observed during the normal 12:12 h light:dark cycle. However, fish subjected to 5 days of constant dark, followed by 5 days of constant light, did not reduce chirp rate, or increase GFRs, during the light phase compared with the dark phase. These results suggest that the rate of production of spontaneous EOD modulations is determined largely by the level of light. Furthermore, exposure of the fish to extended periods of dark induces long-term changes in the propensity to produce spontaneous EOD modulations. We hypothesize that these long-term behavioural changes may be caused by structural alterations in the neural network involved in control of these behaviours.

AB We examined social influences on age at first reproduction in female members of 240 litters of Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus. The results indicated that: (1) sisters inhibit one another's reproductive development, although this mutual inhibition is more strongly expressed in the presence than in the absence of an older, reproductively active female, (2) either sexual incompatibility develops between male gerbils and females that they help to rear, or female gerbils need to be exposed to strange males in order for their reproductive development to proceed to sexual maturity, (3) exposure of adult males to young females increases the males' subsequent latency to impregnate females other than those to which the males were exposed. Taken together the results suggest that age at first impregnation of female Mongolian gerbils living in family groups can be influenced by interactions with their sisters, dam and father, as well as with unfamiliar males.

ID PUFFINUS-PUFFINUS; OBESITY
AB In many species of bird, nestlings undergo a period of mass recession, associated with a large reduction in food provisioning, before they fledge. This has been ascribed to parental desertion, although it could equally result from voluntary limitation of feeding (i.e. anorexia) among chicks. We examined the interactions between Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus, parents and chicks, to test whether the prefledging reduction in feeding was controlled by parents, chicks or both. In a cross-fostering experiment, chicks of different ages were exchanged between nests. We predicted that under a parental control model, cross-fostering would have no effect on food provisioning by the parents, but under chick control, the level of provisioning would be adjusted according to the age-specific requirements of the foster chick. Older chicks placed in the nests of younger chicks entered mass recession at an older age and had higher food-provisioning rates than unmanipulated chicks over the 10 days prior to fledging, supporting the parental control model. Younger chicks placed in the nests of older chicks had lower fledging masses than unmanipulated chicks, as a result of lower food-provisioning rates prior to fledging, which also supports this model. However, parents continued to feed younger chicks beyond the date at which their own chick would have fledged. This suggests that chicks also influenced food provisioning, and that mass recession resulted from interactions between a relatively fixed provisioning pattern in parents and age-specific food requirements of chicks.

   VARIANCE
AB Sexual dimorphism is commonly explained as a consequence of selection on traits that increase male attractiveness to females, or simply allow males greater access to females. Here, we consider another explanation for sexual differences in coloration within species of the damselfly family Coenagrionidae (Odonata: Zygoptera). In many of these species, males are more brightly coloured than females and have different patterns. Yet they are nonterritorial and do not engage in displays: indeed, male competition for mates often resembles a scramble. We therefore argue that even if females show a degree of mate choice, then it is unlikely to be based on colour or pattern. Instead, we suggest that sexual dimorphism has evolved in this group primarily as a form of sex-related warning coloration. First, we argue that it is almost inevitable that male-male interactions will incur a small cost to both participants. We then provide some evidence that males are capable of using colour as a clue to sexual identity. Using a simple model, we show that if these conditions hold, then sexual dimorphism will readily evolve. Furthermore, the model shows that if females are selected to avoid excessive harassment by males as is often suggested, then males should evolve much brighter coloration than females. If the assumptions underlying our 'unprofitable mate' model are broadly correct, then not only does it offer a novel explanation for sexual dimorphism, but it also provides the first case example of the evolution of aposematism as a result of intraspecific interactions.

   DETERMINANTS; HUMMINGBIRDS; COMPETITION; AVOIDANCE; EVOLUTION
AB Models of territorial defence tend to omit two characteristics of many territorial systems: repeated intrusions by the same individual and the learning processes of residents and intruders. Here we present state-dependent, dynamic models of feeding territories, designed to investigate temporal patterns of resident aggression towards intruders that are capable of spatial learning. We compare two types of models: (1) a nomadic intruder model, in which intruders never visit the same territory twice, and (2) a single, repeat intruder model, in which an intruder may repeatedly intrude into a given territory but is less likely to do so after being attacked. These two models produce qualitatively and quantitatively different patterns of aggression by residents. For instance, residents with intruders that may repeatedly intrude have high initial attack rates, regardless of initial probability of intrusion, but their attack rates decline over time. In contrast, residents in the nomadic intruder model do not attack intruders if intrusion rates are moderately high, and their attack rates are constant and high for most of the period of territory tenure. In addition, residents of both nomadic and repeat intruder scenarios stopped attacking intruders for a short period before voluntarily abandoning their feeding territories. The results of our models suggest that repeated intrusions and learning processes have a dramatic effect on territorial defence. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   WIND INFLUENCE; FUEL LOADS; TIME; WHITETHROATS; MINIMIZATION; AUTUMN
AB Recent models have worked with the assumption that birds try to minimize either time, energy or predation risk during migration, or some combination of these. The few empirical studies available have suggested that time minimization may be the most common strategy. One way of distinguishing between strategies is to study the departure decisions of migrating birds. We supplied migrating European robins, Erithacus rubecula, with food ad libitum in the field and monitored their changes in body mass prior to departure. The overall mass gain rate (k(tot), the ratio of daily mass increase to lean mass) of 10 birds using the feeding station was on average 0.05 (range 0.03-0.09). Departure fuel loads (f(dep), the ratio of fuel mass to lean mass) were on average 0.53 (range 0.35-0.66). There was no significant correlation between f(dep) and k(tot), which indicates a strategy of minimizing the energy cost of transport, rather than minimizing time but other aspects of the fuel deposition pattern suggest that time minimization may also be important. Whereas the behaviour of the robins was difficult to interpret in the light of optimal migration strategies, the importance of weather was striking. The robins selected the best weather conditions (tail wind, high air pressure and no precipitation) within the likely period of departure. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In callitrichids (marmosets and tamarins), not only the mother but also the father and older offspring (helpers) living in the group take part in infant carrying. As a measure of the costs of infant carrying in callitrichids, we measured the distance individual common marmosets were able to leap without carrying infants and when carrying infants of different weight. We found a significant negative correlation between carrying weight and the distance marmosets could leap. A weight of 65 g (the combined weight of newborn twins) reduced the leaping ability by an average of 17%. We conclude that infant carrying in callitrichids entails significant behavioural costs that can be expected to have great impact on their life in the field, especially on foraging and predator avoidance, that is, behaviours that incorporate leaping ability.

   SELECTION; CRICKETS; BEHAVIOR; COREIDAE
AB Studies of costs and benefits of mate choice are often focused on females. However, direct and indirect benefits in mate choice are important in sexual selection of both sexes and, occasionally, are even larger among males. We studied male choice and costs of courting in the egg-carrying golden egg bug, Phyllomorpha laciniata Vill (Heteroptera, Coreidae). Females lay eggs on the backs of adult conspecifics, both males and females. They copulate frequently during the reproductive period, and are receptive independently of their current fecundity. Males often receive nonpaternal eggs while courting or while in copula. Egg carrying is costly because of an increased predation risk. We manipulated current female fecundity (the number of chorionated eggs in a female ovarium) by depriving half the females of an egg-laying surface, namely a conspecific. A male enclosed with a gravid and a nongravid female preferred the gravid one. Thus, males selected females by their current fecundity. Courting was costly for males: more than half the males (57%) received nonpaternal eggs while courting a female. Gravid females laid more eggs before mating than nongravid females but they were likely to lay eggs soon after mating. Thus, in polyandrous species, such as the golden egg bug, when there is a high risk of females remating before egg laying, males should select females relative to immediate benefits.

ID SOCIAL PLAY; CANIDS
AB Play signals are known to function in the solicitation and maintenance of intraspecific play, but their role in interspecific play is relatively unstudied. We carried out two studies to examine interspecific signalling when humans play with domestic dogs, Cais familiaris. In the first, we recorded dog-owner play sessions on video to identify actions used by 21 dog owners to initiate play with their dogs. Thirty-five actions were each used by three or more owners. These;included postures, vocalizations and physical contact with the dog. The actions varied greatly in their apparent success at instigating play which was, surprisingly, unrelated to the frequency with which they were used. We then did an experiment to determine the effect of composites of commonly used signals upon the behaviour of 20 Labrador retrievers. The performance of both 'Bow' and 'Lunge' by a human altered the subsequent behaviour of the dogs. Both signals caused increases in play, and Lunge produced significant increases in play bout frequency and mean bout duration. The efficiency of both these postural signals was enhanced when they were accompanied by play vocalizations. Thus, specific actions used by humans do communicate a playful context to dogs and san be described as interspecific play signals. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Oviparous species that do not guard their eggs during development may suffer significant embryonic mortality. However, the way females lay eggs may help prevent this. For example, females of several newt species carefully wrap single eggs into leaves of aquatic vegetation in shallow water. Wrapping behaviour may protect eggs from predators and from mechanical damage. We hypothesized that egg-wrapping behaviour also protects newt embryos from the negative effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In field experiments, we tested the effects of ambient levels of UV radiation on marbled newt, Triturus marmoratus, embryos exposed to sunlight. Of these embryos 95-100% died during the first 14 days of exposure. The eggs showed loss of their round shape, skin damage, oedemas and fungal infection. In contrast, during the same period, mortality of embryos protected by UV-blocking filters was only 20%. In laboratory experiments, we exposed marbled newt embryos to an artificially elevated intensity of UV-B radiation and tested the protective effect of leaves. The mortality of eggs wrapped in leaves and exposed to UV-B radiation was low and similar to that of unwrapped eggs that were shielded from UV-B radiation with a UV-blocking filter, whereas 119 of 120 unwrapped eggs exposed to UV radiation died within 5 days.

AB We studied cannibalism in laying hens, Gallus gallus domesticus. From farms experiencing high mortality caused by cannibalism we collected cannibalistic birds, birds with injuries caused by pecking and control birds. All factors such as farm, bird hybrid and age were identical within a set of three birds, but differed between trios. Based on predictions from studies on wild animals, we hypothesized that cannibalistic laying hens would be larger and victims smaller than control birds, and that victims would in some way be less fit than control birds. In addition, since cannibalism in the wild is usually shown by individuals under adverse conditions, we hypothesized further that under commercial conditions cannibalistic individuals would be those that experience the environment as more stressful than others in the flock. Since fluctuating asymmetry is thought to be positively correlated with low stress-buffering capacity, we expected cannibals and victims to be more asymmetrical than other birds. As predicted, cannibals were heavier and taller than other birds and both victims and cannibals were more asymmetrical than control birds. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We used tetra-nucleotide microsatellite DNA typing to estimate the frequency of extrapair fertilization (EPF) in a plural breeding species, the Mexican jay, Aphelocoma ultramarina, in Arizona. We found EPF in 32 of 51 complete broods (63%) and 55 of 139 nestlings (40%) for which the putative father had been identified (one of the highest rates of EPF known for birds). At least 96.1% of EPF fathers came from within the group. This is by far the highest known within-group EPF rate among socially monogamous, communally rearing species. Most (70%) males of breeding age (3+ years) had no genetic paternity in a given year. Social fathers (i.e. those with nests and mated females) rarely obtained EPFs; of 25 social fathers, 23 had young in only one nest and only two had young in two nests by virtue of EPF. Of the 27 males known to be EPF fathers without a nest of their own, none had young in more than one nest. Only 7% of EPF fathers had their own broods reaching banding age (day 14), compared with 29.7% of social fathers. The proportion of EPF young was significantly larger in smaller broods. Breeding females in all age classes were equally likely to have EPF young. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Communal roosting has been studied extensively in birds, but the mechanisms and functions of this taxonomically widespread behaviour pattern remain poorly understood. We studied the roosting behaviour of rubyspot damselflies, Hetaerina americana, in relation to sex and territorial status, and conducted field experiments to test for specific mechanisms of roost formation and maintenance. Both sexes tended to return close to their previous night's roost, but only males were significantly more roost site faithful than chance expectations based on individual day ranges. Males were more roost site faithful when they held mating territories. After acquiring a territory, males usually began roosting closet: to the territory after a delay of a few days. Roosts were not located at sites that reduced the daily commuting distance between hunting areas and territories; males generally hunted closer to their territories than to their roosts. In field experiments, sites 'seeded' with synthetic models of male rubyspots attracted more recruits than vacant control sites and control sites seeded with nonrubyspot (clear-winged) damselfly models. Sites seeded repeatedly with rubyspot models often remained popular for roosting after the models were removed, suggesting that the models established new traditional roosts. These results indicate that conspecific attraction and individual spatial memory together may be sufficient to explain, at a proximate level, the traditional night roost aggregations of this species. We discuss these results in relation to functional hypotheses for roost site choice and fidelity. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mice can recognize one another by individually characteristic phenotypic body odours (odourtypes) that reflect their genetic constitution at the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of genes on chromosome 17. We have shown previously that MHC-determined odours are produced by fetuses: house mice, Mus domesticus, can be trained to discriminate between genetically identical pregnant females carrying 9-18-day-old fetuses of differing MHC type. Theoretically, it should be possible for a mouse to determine the MHC type of the sire based on the odourtype of the pregnant female. In the current study we investigated whether untrained male mice show spontaneous discrimination between such pregnant mice. In experiment 1, sexually inexperienced male mice spent more time near pregnant females that carried fetuses most genetically different from the males themselves. Experiment 2, designed to evaluate possible experiential effects on this preference, tested males that were cohabiting and had impregnated a female that was either genetically identical to the test male (excepting X and Y chromosomes) or differed from him only at the MHC. Males in the former case performed virtually identically to those tested in experiment 1. In contrast males in the latter group did not display this preference. These studies reveal that among untrained male mice, fetal MHC type influences choice behaviour presumably via fetal odourtypes expressed in maternal secretions/excretions and that previous housing and/or mating experience modulates male choice.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Free-living juvenile Florida scrub-jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens, learned to forage in a novel patch (the centre of a ring) when in proximity to other family members that foraged successfully. We were able to distinguish the contributions of social learning and of individual learning, and to show that social learning occurred. The foraging task required individual jays to dig for peanut bits (chopped fragments) buried in sand in the centre of a 33-cm plastic ring. Jays were trained in their family groups to perform the task during a summer season, and were-allowed to perform the task in the presence of juveniles (aged 40-85 days) in later years. Jays living in 18 control families received partial exposure to the training situation, but received no exposure to the ring before being presented with the task in the presence of their young. Juveniles in 16 families with trained jays were able to witness demonstrations and to scrounge peanut pieces from the models as they completed the task. These 41 juveniles learned more of the task than the 33 juveniles in control families. Seven juvenile jays and two older, nonbreeding jays in the trained families completed the task at least once, whereas no jays in control families completed the task. A modified task that prevented snatching also prevented transmission of the complete task, although the 22 juveniles that observed the modified task learned more of the task than the 33 control juveniles. Further analysis indicated that demonstrations had their greatest effect in increasing the probability that juveniles would enter the ring. (C) 2000 The Association far the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   EXHAUSTION
AB Many songbird species with small song type repertoires repeat each type a few times before 'switching to the next. Thus, their singing style may constrain their ability to switch. However, the proximate causation of song type switching is poorly understood. We exposed male chaffinches to (nonoverlapping) playbacks of single renditions of their own songs rather than a series of songs, thus stimulating them with a single external auditory event. The most prominent effect of the playback was an increase in the duration of the current song type bout. If the song type played back was different to that the subject was singing at the time, bout duration increased less than if it was of the same song type. The short-term changes induced by the playback suggest that the auditory input increases the motivational level for a particular song type. In the chaffinch this results in a delayed switch rather than in song type matching as a reaction to acoustic stimulation by conspecific song.

AB By comparing the behaviour of Lasius niger scouts at sucrose droplets of different volumes, we empirically identified the criterion used by each scout to assess the amount of food-available as well as the rules governing its decision to lay a recruitment trail. When scouts discovered food volumes exceeding the capacity of their crop (3 or 6 mu l), 90% immediately returned to the nest laying a recruitment trail. In contrast, when smaller food droplets (0.3, 0.7 or 1 mu l) were offered, several scouts stayed on the foraging area, presumably exploring it for additional food. If unsuccessful, they returned to the nest without laying a trail. The droplet volume determined the percentage of trail-laying ants but had no influence on the intensity of marking when this was initiated. The key criterion that regulated the recruiting behaviour of scouts was their ability to ingest their own desired volume. This volume acted as a threshold triggering the trail-laying response of foragers. Collective regulation of foraging according to food size resulted from the interplay between the distribution of these desired volume thresholds among colony members and the food volume available. We relate some aspects of the foraging ecology of aphid-tending ants to this decision-making process. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB European earwigs are sexually dimorphic in forceps shape and length. Male forceps are thought to be weapons in male contests for access to females, but recent findings suggest that females choose males on the basis of their forceps length. I investigated sexual selection on forceps length and body size and the occurrence of male-male competition. When I controlled for forceps length experimentally and statistically, relatively heavy males had greater copulation success than relatively light males. When I controlled for body size, males with relatively longer forceps had no tendency for greater copulation success than males with shorter forceps. Relatively heavy males more often took over copulations from smaller males than vice versa. Male contests were important for the outcome of mate competition, as males commonly interrupted and took over copulations. My results therefore suggest that intrasexual selection is significant in competition for copulations in male earwigs, and acts on body size. This contrasts with previous findings, which have shown intersexual selection on forceps length to be important. However, both modes of sexual selection may be acting through a two-stage process, where male-male competition first determines which males have access to females, and then through female choice among available males. Morphological measurements supported the conclusion that forceps length and body size are male secondary sexual characters, as these characters had large variance and skewed distributions in males, but were normally distributed in females.

AB Aspects of the environment, including the social environment, can contribute to intrapopulation variation in mating preferences. One example of the effect of social environment on mate preferences is mate choice copying; however, other types of socially influenced (nonindependent) choice might exist. We develop a list of such alternatives based on possible physiological or psychological mechanisms, evaluate the evidence distinguishing one from another and clarify some controversial aspects of mate choice copying. This framework reveals many ways in which one female's mate choice can influence that of another, and suggests a broader array of hypotheses about the selective forces acting on such mechanisms. Because nonindependent choice can occur in a variety of ways, it could be more important for understanding patterns of mate choice than current theory suggests.

AB Song repertoires may be a product of sexual selection and several studies have reported correlations of repertoire size and reproductive success in male songbirds. This hypothesis and the reported correlations, however, are not sufficient to explain the observation that most species have small song repertoire sizes (usually fewer than 10, often fewer than five song types). We examined a second important aspect of a male's song repertoire, the extent to which he shares songs with his neighbours. Song sharing has not been measured in previous studies and it may be partially confounded with repertoire size. We hypothesized that in song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, song sharing rather than repertoire size per se is crucial for male territorial success. Our longitudinal study of 45 song sparrows followed from their first year on territory showed that the number of songs a bird shares with his neighbourhood group is a better predictor of lifetime territory tenure than is his repertoire size, We also found that song sharing increases with repertoire size up to but not beyond eight to nine song types, which are the most common repertoire sizes in the population (range in our sample 5-13). This partial confound of song sharing and repertoire size may account for some earlier findings of territory tenure-repertoire size correlations in this species and other species having small- or medium-sized repertoires, (C) 2000 nle Association for the Shiny of Animal Behaviour.

ID ANIMAL SOCIETIES; DWARF MONGOOSES; GROUP-SIZE; SUPPRESSION; SKEW;
   COMPETITION; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; MODEL
AB Recent theoretical work suggests that the distribution of reproduction, or degree of reproductive skew, in animal societies depends crucially on (1) whether dominant individuals can fully control subordinate reproduction, and (2) how subordinate reproduction affects the fitness of dominants. I investigated these two factors in cooperatively breeding banded mongooses, Mungos mungo. Female packmates entered oestrus together and were closely guarded by dominant males. These males were aggressive to subordinate males who attempted to mate, but females still managed to mate with males other than their mate guard. Older females were guarded and mated a few days before their younger packmates, yet all females usually gave birth on the same day, suggesting that older females may have a longer gestation period. Moreover, older females carried more fetuses. Overall, ca. 83% of adult females conceived in each breeding attempt and 71% carried to term. These results indicate that, among males, dominant individuals did not have full control over the mating attempts of subordinates (since they could not fully control the mating behaviour of the females they guarded), while among females there was little or no attempt to prevent subordinates from breeding (at least, prior to parturition). Two within-group infanticides by males suggested that some control over reproduction may be exercised postpartum Per capita survivorship of young in the den increased with the number of females who gave birth. Thus, dominant females may benefit from subordinate reproduction, providing a possible explanation for the lack of reproductive suppression among females in this species.

AB Clark's nutcrackers, Nucifraga columbiana, store thousands of pine seeds during the autumn and retrieve them throughout the winter. It has been shown that these birds are able to use visual cues to relocate hidden food in the laboratory. In this set of experiments, we trained three groups of Clark's nutcrackers to find a hidden food goal that was placed in the same spatial location relative to the testing room. During training, the location of two local cues in relation to the goal differed between the three groups. Group 1 learned the task with the cues closest to the goal, group 2 with the cues further from the goal, and group 3 with the cues furthest from the goal. To test whether the proximity of these two local cues to the goal affected how spatial information was used, we manipulated local and global information in a series of experiments. Results indicated that local cues were more important sources of spatial information for group 1, whereas global cues seemed to be used more by birds in groups 2 and 3. These findings suggest that the proximity of visual cues lead to overshadowing of other sources of spatial information surrounding the goal.

AB We studied 12 size-matched pairs of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, in an experimental stream in southwest France, to determine whether fish activity and motivation changed during the course of reproduction. The absolute weight of spawners did not affect their spawning activity. On average, females deposited their eggs within 3 days in nine nests. Male and female breeding behaviours changed throughout the reproductive period. This cyclic variation in behaviour appeared to be determined in part by the activity of the other sex, as a consequence of complex interplay between the sexes, but also largely by the stage of the spawning period. During the first three ovipositions, male-female stimulus-reaction chaining became more consistent just before spawning, which may help synchronize gamete release for successful fertilization. During the last three ovipositions, sequence chaining between the sexes was less coherent, possibly as a result of reduced mate attractiveness and/or physiological limitations.

AB To be fed, a king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, chick must identify the call of its parents, in the continuous background noise of the colony. To study this recognition process, we played back to the chicks parental calls with acoustic parameters modified in the temporal and frequency domains. The parental call is composed of syllables (complex sounds with harmonic series) separated by pronounced amplitude declines. Our experiments with modified signals indicate that the chick's;frequency analysis of the call is not tuned towards precise peak energy values, the signal being recognized even when the carrier frequency was shifted 100 Hz down or 75 Hz up. To recognize the adult, chicks used frequency rather than amplitude modulation, in particular the frequency modulation shape of the syllable. This structure is repeated through the different syllables of the call giving a distinct vocal signature. Our experiments also show that the receiver needs to perceive only a small part of the signal: the first half of the syllable (0.23 s) and the first three harmonics were sufficient to elicit recognition. The small amount of information necessary to understand the message, the high redundancy in the time and frequency domains and the almost infinite possibilities of coding provided by the frequency modulation signature permit the chick to recognize the adult, without the help of a nest site. For these reasons, the code used in the call of the king penguin can be regarded as a functional code, increasing the possibility of individual recognition in an acoustically constraining environment.

AB When, where and from whom young songbirds learn their songs have been controversial issues in the study of song development. We chose to study some of these issues in two migratory and closely related songbirds, the chipping sparrow, Spizella passerina, and field sparrow, Spizella pusilla. Nestlings of both species were collected in western Massachusetts and hand-reared in the laboratory. There, juveniles were placed in separate cages and assigned to one of three rooms; in each room were eight young chipping sparrows, eight young field sparrows and two adult tutors of each species, arranged so that most of the young males were adjacent to adult tutors of the same species. During mid-winter, adult tutors were moved from one room to another, so that the young birds heard different song types from different tutors during their hatching year and the following spring. From Spectral analysis of our extensive tape recordings, we found that most juvenile males imitated the songs of their hatching-year tutors but then gradually modified their songs to match more closely either their adult tutors pr other pupils the next spring. One chipping and one field sparrow clearly imitated a new song syllable from a spring live tutor; that is, these yearling males learned songs by 'instruction'. Other sparrows improvised extensively, and one chipping sparrow learned a field sparrow's song syllable. Our results reveal great individual variation in how songs are developed, and we expect similar flexibility among birds in nature. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated the development of within-song type variation in song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, with two experiments designed to determine how exposure to within-type variation influences the song-learning process and whether within-type variation itself is a learned trait. In the first experiment, we compared learning between two groups of males, one group tutored exclusively with song models presented with no variation, and the other group tutored exclusively with song models presented with a range of within-type variation that is normally produced by birds in the field. The two groups in this experiment did not differ significantly in any measure of how well they learned, suggesting that exposure to within-type variation has no measurable influence on the learning process overall. Nor did the groups differ in the expression of within-song type variation in their own adult songs, demonstrating that within-type variation is not a learned feature of song sparrow song. In the second experiment, we tutored a single group of birds with both invariant and variable models, allowing us to ask how within-type variability affects learning preferences. Young birds preferentially copied song type models presented with variation significantly more than invariant models. Taken together, these experiments provide insight into the evolution of within-song type variation in song sparrows, although the functional significance of this level of variation and learning preferences based on variation remain enigmatic.

   BEHAVIOR; TESTOSTERONE; INTRUDERS; RESPONSES; COSTS
AB In certain species, females are highly aggressive. For example, female mountain spiny lizards, Sceloporus jarrovi, express aggressive behaviours when defending their territories. Despite the occurrence of female aggression, relatively little is known about its underlying hormonal mediation. As a first step in understanding neuroendocrine mechanisms of female aggression, this study documented seasonal changes in territorial aggression, plasma steroid hormone levels, and reproductive condition in free-living female mountain spiny lizards. We determined how seasonal patterns of testosterone (T), oestradiol (E), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and corticosterone (B) corresponded to seasonal patterns of aggression. At times of the year when females were most aggressive, plasma levels of T and E were elevated. At times of the year when females were least aggressive, plasma B was elevated. Furthermore, when levels of T were elevated, females were more aggressive, and when levels of B were elevated, females were less aggressive. Plasma levels of DHT were not associated with aggression. These seasonal patterns are consistent with the hypotheses that T, and perhaps E, promote female aggression, while B suppresses female aggression. Despite these associations of hormones and aggression, no hormone was associated with aggression in a one-to-one fashion. This suggests that if steroid hormones contribute to the expression of female aggression, they must interact with each other or with other factors (for example, other hormones, receptor levels, environmental factors) to mediate fully the expression of aggression.

TI Novelty effects in a multimodal warning signal

ID DOMESTIC CHICKS; ODOR; PYRAZINES; COLOR; TASTE; CUES; PREY
AB The warning signals of toxic insects are often 'multimodal', Combining bright coloration with sounds or odours (or both). Pyrazine (a common insect warning odour) can elicit an intrinsic avoidance in domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, both against novel coloured food, and also against food colours that are specifically associated with aposematism, namely yellow and red. In three experiments, we investigated the role of novelty in this innate bias against yellow coloured food in the presence of pyrazine. Naive chicks were familiarized either to pyrazine odour or to coloured food before being tested for a bias against yellow (warningly coloured) food as opposed to green (nonwarningly coloured) food. In experiment 1, pyrazine novelty was shown to be vital for eliciting a bias against yellow food. However, experiment 2 suggested that colour novelty was not important: chicks familiarized with coloured crumbs still avoided yellow crumbs when pyrazine was presented. In a third experiment that gave chicks an even greater degree of pre-exposure to coloured crumbs, the bias against yellow food eventually waned, although pyrazine continued to elicit an aversion to yellow even after birds had had experience of up to 24 palatable yellow crumbs. Pyrazine novelty has been an important pressure in the evolution of multimodal warning signals, and can continue to promote the avoidance of warningly coloured food, even when it is relatively familiar. The implications for warning signals are discussed. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Hand-reared female chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, were tape-tutored just after fledging. In the subsequent spring (i.e. their first breeding season) they were successfully trained in an operant conditioning task where they could trigger song playback by perching on either of two short lever-type perches. In a given trial, one of the four songs that had been used for tutoring was paired with a song type unknown to the subject. The subjects showed no overall preference for either the familiar or unfamiliar song types. In a second experiment one breeding season later, the same females were confronted with two versions of one song with and without the species-specific terminal flourish. The majority of females preferred the version with a terminal flourish. The results of this preliminary study suggest that, at least in our small laboratory sample, female chaff inch song preferences vary individually for songs within the species-specific range and that exposure to a particular song type early in life plays a minor role, if any, in forming their preferences. Operant conditioning with song as a reinforcer can be used in the laboratory as an alternative method to measures of approach to test individual females' song preferences, with the great advantage that the control over the stimulus is left with the subject.

AB We examined functional and mechanistic aspects of sperm competition in the bearded tit by determining (1) the variation in copulation rate between birds breeding alone or with other males present, and (2) the number of sperm present in the female reproductive tract estimated from the number of sperm trapped on the perivitelline layers of eggs. Females copulated at a higher rate with their partner when other males were present, but this did not translate into more sperm on eggs, possibly because insemination rates exceeded the female's sperm storage capacity. The rate of sperm loss from the female's reproductive tract, which is an important variable of sperm competition models, was obtained for the first time for a wild bird and was relatively high compared with other birds. This suggests that bearded tits copulate frequently because a single insemination is insufficient to fertilize the whole clutch, and females thus have to copulate during the egg-laying period to avoid infertile eggs. This finding is the first empirical support for the fertility insurance hypothesis. In line with this we discuss the significance of the interspecific variation in rate of sperm loss in relation to mating strategies in general, and the evolution of multiple mating rather than improved sperm storage in bearded tits with particular regard to the pronounced extrapair copulation behaviour of females.

AB I studied the feeding behaviour of cad in late spring in a fjord in northern Norway by means of a stationary positioning system. The activity rhythm of eight cod tagged with acoustic transmitters was observed continuously for 3-8 days in terms of swimming speed and size of area occupied. I studied responses to food odour by setting a line with mackerel. baits in the experimental area. The cod had a diurnal rhythm of swimming activity with a slightly lower swimming speed during a 5-h period at night, indicating that they searched more actively for food during the day. A shift towards a larger proportion of active prey taken in the day, accompanied by a change in hunting:strategy where vision became more important, may explain this rhythmicity in feeding behaviour. The diurnal rhythm in the range of area occupied varied more than the swimming activity rhythm and there was no significant difference in range between day and night indicating that factors other than the diel light cycle also influenced periodicity in activity. A higher proportion of fish encountered by the bait odour plume located baits than that of fish that were out of range of the odour plume, indicating the importance of chemically mediated food searching in this species. The cod detected a food odour source from a distance of several hundred metres, and responded immediately to the odour plume by carrying out a rheotactic search at a moderately higher swimming speed.

AB Like many sexually dimorphic ungulates, bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, form sexually segregated groups. Nursery groups include females, lambs and subadult males, while adult males form bachelor groups. Previous hypotheses to account for sexual segregation in ungulates have suggested sexual differences in energy requirements, predation risk and social preferences. I tested the hypothesis that differing nutritional demands, due to sexual dimorphism in body size, would lead to different movement patterns and time budgets. If ruminating/foraging schedules differed according to body size, males and females could not synchronize their activities and therefore would segregate by sex. To test this hypothesis, I observed a population of marked bighorns. I recorded the time males and females spent lying, grazing or walking during 8-14 h of focal-animal observations. Initial and final location of groups and steps taken per minute foraging were also noted. Females spent more time foraging and walking and had longer foraging and walking bouts than adult males, but did not differ in numbers of steps taken while foraging. Males spent more time lying than females. Subadult males switched between nursery and bachelor groups and changed their foraging behaviour depending on the type of group they were in. The distance moved was on average almost four times greater for female than for male groups. I suggest that sexual difference in time budgets and movement patterns make it difficult for males and females to stay in the same,group and therefore lead to sexual segregation.

AB Transitions in behaviour across a continuous distribution of organisms can provide valuable information on how variation in behaviour is maintained. We used analyses developed for interspecific hybrid zones to examine geographic variation in colony founding strategy in the desert seed-harvester ant, Messor pergandei. Newly mated females initiate new colonies either alone (haplometrosis) or cooperatively with other foundresses (pleometrosis). The incidence of these founding strategies were surveyed across the species' range and found to occur in geographically distinct regions joined by a narrow transition zone. Foundresses collected from haplometrotic sites were more likely to display aggression and found solitary nests than foundresses from pleometrotic sites, suggesting that geographical variation in metrosis is due to genotypic divergence. Foundresses from transitional sites were generally not aggressive and tended to co-found nests in the laboratory, yet rarely formed associations in the field. Such an abrupt shift in behaviour indicates that variation in colony founding strategy is maintained by selection rather than the result of secondary contact of neutral characters. Level of aggression displays a wider dine than founding strategy and is likely under selection only when accompanied by active strategy preference.

AB Male bushcrickets, Requena verticalis, provide their:mates with a proteinaceous nuptial gift, which functions both as paternal investment in offspring and to ensure sperm transfer. When nutrients are limited, males have a lower potential reproductive rate than females, so the operational sex ratio becomes female biased. Males are then expected to discriminate more in their choice of mate for two reasons: (1) the relatively higher female potential reproductive rate should reduce the costs of rejecting a female; (2) multiple mating by females should increase variance in female mate quality, because of first male sperm precedence. Males are known to discriminate against old females, which are more likely to have mated previously. Our objective in this study was to partition experimentally the influences of male potential reproductive rate (manipulated by diet) and variance in female quality (estimated by age) and to assess their relative influence on the level of mate choice of male bushcrickets. The potential reproductive rate of males had a great impact on their choosiness, whereas variance in female age had no effect. These results support recent theoretical models that predict costs, rather than benefits, will primarily influence the level of mate choice; (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Sex recognition and mate choice by male western toads, <i>Bufo

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID BEHAVIOR
AB In field-based choice experiments, we examined sex recognition and mate choice in male western toads, Bufo boreas. When given a simultaneous choice between a male and a female of equal size, males did not discriminate between the sexes and attempted to amplex a male or a female with equal frequency. When a test male clasped a stimulus male, the stimulus male uttered a release call that caused the test male to release the stimulus male. Male-male amplexus never lasted more than 3 s, but male-female amplexus was tenacious and prolonged. Furthermore, males discriminated between gravid females that differed in body size, choosing larger gravid females over smaller ones, but they did not discriminate between gravid females or non-gravid females of equal size. In choice tests that excluded chemical cues, males jumped more frequently towards large females than small ones. Given that females are significantly larger than males, selecting larger individuals as potential mates increases the probability that males amplex with a female.

AB The binding of volatile semiochemicals to lipocalin proteins in many mammalian scent marks may provide a gradual release of volatile ligands, extending the life of airborne odour signals. We tested this by using menadione to displace semiochemical ligands from major urinary proteins (MUPs) in urine streaks obtained from adult male house mice, Mus domesticus, and assessed the responses of other males to these and to intact urine marks as they aged. Dominant male mice scent-mark their territories extensively with urine streaks; MUPs in these marks bind at least two semiochemically active molecules, 2-sec-butyl-4, 5-dihydrothiazole (thiazole) and 2,3-dehydro-exo-brevicomin (brevicomin), associated with the males' aggressive status. Wild-caught males (N=24), housed in individual enclosures, were presented with two glass slides, behind mesh to prevent contact, on which 10 mu l of both unfamiliar urine and 0.5 mg/ml menadione in ethanol had been streaked. On one slide the urine and menadione solution were mixed to displace ligands; on the other they were separate (intact urine). We carried out tests 0, 0.5, 1 or 24 h after deposition, and matched them to changes in the concentration of thiazole and brevicomin within the intact and displaced marks. Males were hesitant to approach intact urine up to Ih old but, when ligands were displaced, or were reduced to low levels by natural evaporation from intact urine streaks aged 24 h, their approach was similar to that to water and to menadione controls. Ligands did not appear to cause any longer term avoidance and, after the first approach, investigation increased with the freshness of urine regardless of when the ligands were displaced. This is the first direct demonstration that proteins evince a slow release of olfactory signals from mammalian scent marks. The nature of their response suggests that, from a distance, mice may be unable to tell whether airborne signals emanate from scent marks or from the donor himself and we suggest that this may provide territory owners with a major advantage in defending their territories.

AB After milk ejection, piglets spend several minutes massaging their own teats on the sow. We examined whether this behaviour could be a mammalian counterpart to begging in young birds, and hence be explained by theories of honest begging. In one experiment, the behaviour of piglets was examined in relation to their previous milk intake. In each of 16 litters, one focal piglet was exposed to three treatments for three consecutive sucklings: 'no milk', where the piglet was withheld from the teat during milk ejection; 'extra milk', where it was fed 10 mi of extra milk directly after milk ejection; and 'control', when it received its normal intake. Average massage duration in the next three sucklings was significantly longer in the 'no milk' than in the control piglets. No milk' pigs massaged more intensely (number of massage movements/min), were more persistent in attempting to maintain udder contact and spent less time away from the udder. However, there were no significant differences between 'control' and 'extra milk' treatments. In a second experiment, in which we manually massaged teats for 0, 3 or 10 min, we found no significant effect of massage duration on milk output (measured by weighing piglets before and after milk ejection), although massage tended to increase output. We conclude that post-sucking massage in piglets has a number of aspects similar to honest begging in birds. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated daily changes in body mass, fat reserves and crop contents, and diurnal organization of behaviour, in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, in relation to experimental manipulations of food availability. Diurnal mass change and the organization of foraging behaviour during the day were in general agreement with recent theoretical predictions. Foraging intensity, and hence rate of mass gain, was most rapid immediately after dawn and before dusk. The experimental birds did not alter either mean body mass or their diurnal mass trajectory after a period of 2 weeks when food was made unavailable for 2 h a day at unpredictable times. Instead, they changed their allocation of time to different activities during the day, decreasing the mean amount of time spent locomoting and increasing the mean amount of time spent inactive over the day. Thus, contrary to a number of recent studies on different species, zebra finches appear to respond to unpredictable interruptions in food supply by reducing energetically expensive activities rather than adjusting their levels of energy reserves.

   BEHAVIOR; JUVENILE DISPERSAL; MARSH TITS; BIRDS
AB A model that explains natal dispersal in resident screech-owls is presented and examined. The model is based on interactions among hormonal changes, body condition and social stimuli. It predicts that corticosterone, an adrenal glucocorticoid known to stimulate locomotor and foraging activity, increases in blood plasma prior to dispersal through a combination of endogenous and exogenous events. This mediates the locomotor activity that underlies dispersal behaviour. Juveniles in good body condition (i.e. those with sufficient fat reserves) will disperse when corticosterone increases. Birds in poor body condition will not, but they will increase their foraging activity under the influence of corticosterone. Dispersal of siblings will reduce aggression and/or competition for food, enabling the remaining juveniles to improve their body condition and disperse. Initial studies on screech-owls, Otus asio and O. kennicottii, have produced results that are generally consistent with the model. For example, captive juvenile screech-owls showed increased locomotor activity in the weeks leading up to the time when free-living juveniles are dispersing, and activity levels declined thereafter. Peaks in corticosterone corresponded with periods of high locomotor activity (i.e. at the time of dispersal) in captive owls. Finally, field studies indicate that dominant juveniles, which are presumably in better physical condition, initiated dispersal before their more subordinate siblings.

TI Evidence for dominant wild female chimpanzees investing more in sons
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID LOCAL RESOURCE COMPETITION; BIRTH SEX-RATIOS; DAUGHTERS
AB Parents are expected to invest more resources in the offspring gender that promises more grandchildren. In a variety of vertebrate species skewed sex ratio at birth and differential parental investment in sons and daughters have been documented. Wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, living in the Tai. National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, were followed for 15 years. This community followed the typical species pattern in that males showed natal philopatry and the sex ratio at birth was almost 1:1. An analysis of 33 inter-birth intervals revealed that dominant females invested about 2 years more in sons, whereas subdominant females invested about 11 months more in daughters. The first difference is significant. Sons of dominant females had higher survival than other youngsters. The benefit of such a facultative investment is discussed. The absence of such a differential investment by mothers in other chimpanzee populations is compatible with an explanation based on variations within the female-biased dispersal pattern in this species and the possible role of maternal condition.

AB Kin selection theory predicts the existence of potential conflict between queen and workers and among workers concerning the production of males in insect societies with a single, once-mated queen. We investigated the occurrence of reproductive conflict and worker reproduction in both single- and multi-queen colonies of 10 species of the ant genus Leptothorax. In contrast to previous observations in related species, workers only infrequently engaged in aggressive interactions and did not lay large numbers of eggs in colonies containing queens. Allozyme analyses of queens, workers and males suggest that the contribution of workers to the males produced in colonies with queens is indeed minimal, at least in L. unifasciatus. When the queens died or were experimentally removed from the colonies, in most species dominance interactions among workers became significantly more frequent and one or several high-ranking workers started to lay eggs. Workers with an increased number of ovarioles per ovary apparently had a reproductive advantage over workers with normal ovaries. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Shiny cowbirds, Molothrus bonariensis, parasitized a high frequency (average 48%) of nests in five colonies of chestnut-capped blackbirds, Agelaius ruficapillus, in Argentina. Two distinct egg morphs occurred, spotted and immaculate white eggs, as well as a few very lightly spotted intermediate eggs. The clear differences between morphs, combined with considerable-variation in spotting pattern between spotted morph eggs, made it possible to visually match eggs into groups that were probably laid by single females. Eggs attributed to a single female were more similar in size and shape than eggs attributed to different females. Using egg dimensions and colour patterns to infer spatial patterns of laying by individual females indicated that: (1) individual brood parasites often-laid several eggs in the same colony, (2) females also laid eggs in more than one colony, and (3) several females laid eggs in each colony, and often in the same host nests, ruling out the notion that parasites defend exclusive territories with respect to host nests. Multiple cowbird eggs per host nest invariable resulted from several females laying in the same host nest: egg morphs and visual comparisons of spotting patterns at 14 nests indicated that individual females never laid more than a single egg in the same host nest. Experimental parasitism of nests with spotted and white morph eggs, combined with observations of naturally parasitized nests, demonstrated that chestnut-capped blackbirds accept all morphs of cowbird eggs. Since other important host species reject white eggs, however, the adaptive maintenance of the white morph is difficult to explain. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We studied microhabitat choice of colour morphs, causes of sex differences in microhabitat use and colour polymorphism in Idotea baltica, a marine isopod living mainly on the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus. The colour morphs differ in frequencies between the sexes and appear to be cryptic on the visually heterogeneous Fucus. In this study, no colour-morph-dependent preference for visually matching microhabitats was found. However, in all three experiments conducted, females were found more often on the lower parts of the Fucus than males. The microhabitat choice of the sexes was directed by some character of Fucus itself, not by preferred :height within the plant. However, the sexes did not choose differently between upper and lower parts of Fucus as food. The food choice and substrate choice correlated in males but not in females, implying that microhabitat and feeding preferences are more tightly associated in males. We propose that the stronger preference for the less exposed lower parts of Fucus as microhabitat and the lack of correlation between microhabitat and substrate choice in females can be explained in terms of a greater investment in anti-predator protection in females than in males. Thus, the sexual difference in microhabitat choice would ultimately result from different strategies maximizing reproductive success in males and females. We suggest that the sexual differences in coloration and colour morph frequency in I. baltica are explained as an adaptation to sex differences in patterns of habitat use.

AB An understanding of diet selection in animals requires knowledge of not only what animals eat in relation to what is available, but also how they perceive the foods available to them. Birds use auditory, visual, olfactory and possibly vibrotactile cues to find prey, but vision is the predominant mode of prey detection. In a series of controlled experiments in an aviary, four American robins, Turdus migratorius, found buried mealworms in the absence of visual, olfactory and vibrotactile cues, suggesting that they could use auditory cues to locate the prey. They also had significantly reduced foraging success when auditory cues were obscured by white noise. These results conflict with the only other experimental study of foraging in American robins, which concluded that they foraged using visual clues alone.

AB The responses of ostariophysan fish to alarm substance (Schreckstoff) have been investigated extensively in the laboratory but there have been few tests of its role under natural conditions. Furthermore, existing studies of the efficacy of Schreckstoff as an alarm substance in the wild have typically employed indirect approaches and have failed to document specific behaviour in a quantitative manner. European minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus, were exposed to Schreckstoff in small aquaria. They responded with a suite of behavioural changes that are consistent with the explanation that they perceive danger. Fish from the same population were then exposed to Schreckstoff under conditions that more closely resembled their natural habitat. Under these near-natural conditions they showed a small decrease in feeding rate and a slight increase in group size, both effects being transitory and independent of stimulus concentration. These data reveal that the ostariophysan fright reaction is context-dependent and highlight the importance of quantifying the behaviour of fish exposed to Schreckstoff under fully natural conditions.

AB The role of experience in shaping individual female mating preferences has been relatively neglected. The goal of this study was to examine how female mating preferences are shaped through male-female interactions in the clonally reproducing female gynogenetic fish, Poecilia formosa. In visual choice tests, some P.formosa preferred P. latipinna males and others preferred males of another poeciliid species, Xiphophorus multilineatus. After interacting with the same males, but without a transparent barrier between them, females originally preferring X. multilineatus switched their preference to P. latipinna males. Females can therefore change their preferences based on experience. The degree of male sexual behaviour may contribute to this change in preferences, but the direct cause is unknown. As a control, we examined how experience influenced preferences of P. latipinna and P. formosa females that had originally preferred P, latipinna males. Female preferences of the sexual species P. latipinna were statistically indistinguishable from preferences of P. formosa with an initial preference for P. latipinna males. The preferences of these two female groups were not influenced by interactions with their preferred male (P. latipinna). The post-encounter preferences of P.formosa females that originally preferred X. multilinentus also became statistically indistinguishable from these two groups of females. Female preference changes based on experience may also be generalized to males with similar traits. Poecilia formosa initially preferring X. multilineatus did not revert back to their original preference when exposed to a new pair of males, but demonstrated a significant decrease in the amount of time spent with X. multilineatus males compared with P. latipinna males.

AB The importance of innate preferences and learned associations in choice of flower colours were investigated for the pipevine swallowtail butterfly, Battus philenor (Papilionidae). Naive butterflies showed innate colour preferences for yellow and, to a lesser extent, blue and purple. Apart from their innate preferences, they were able to learn within 10 flower visits to associate floral colour with the presence of nectar rewards in yellow or magenta Lantana camara (Verbenaceae) flowers. Continued experience resulted in greater discrimination in favour of the rewarding colour. Most individuals readily shifted their foraging behaviour when the colour of the rewarding flower was changed. A capacity for rapid and flexible associative learning presumably allows butterflies to adjust their foraging efforts in response to floral rewards that vary over space or time.

ID BEHAVIOR; DIALECTS; CALL
AB The gargle call is uttered by male black-capped chickadees, Parus atricapillus, during agonistic encounters; in fights between two birds, the gargler nearly always wins. Individuals vary in the number of different types of gargles they have in their repertoires. An experiment was conducted on captive chickadees to determine whether they had a greater aversive response to a larger gargle repertoire. The measure of aversiveness was the time spent away from the stimulus. Video images of a gargling chickadee or of no bird were paired with different gargle repertoire sizes as the test stimuli. The treatment causing the most aversive response was a video of a stimulus bird paired with a repertoire of three gargle types broadcast from a loudspeaker. Only low response was found when a vocal stimulus of three gargle types was presented without the video of the stimulus bird, or when the video was presented with no gargling. The treatment in which the video of a chickadee was paired with a repertoire of a single gargle type was of intermediate aversiveness. Black-capped chickadees find the presence of a potential rival that is giving a multiple-gargle repertoire to be more threatening than one giving a single-gargle repertoire.

AB Female Amazon mollies, Poecilia formosa, are gynogenetic and mate with males of a sexual species, P. latipinna or P. mexicana, for successful reproduction. It was found that both species of males are able to distinguish between conspecific females and Amazon mollies, and preferentially mate with the former. Male mate preference per se is not an evolved response to avoid mating with Amazon mollies; male P. latipinna that are from populations currently allopatric with Amazon mollies also prefer conspecifics. The strength of this preference, however, is stronger in P. latipinna from populations sympatric with Amazon mollies than in P. latipinna from populations that are allopatric with the gynogen, suggesting that reproductive character displacement in mating preferences has occurred. Male size did not influence mating decisions; thus, the hypothesis was rejected that the gynogens are usually mated by smaller, younger males, which have yet to learn to discriminate between females. Unlike some previous studies, it was shown that P. mexicana can discriminate between conspecific females and Amazon mollies, although the strength of preference might be weaker in P. mexicana than in P. latipinna. Male P. latipinna and P. mexicana differed in their choices between females of the two heterospecific species in the complex. Male P. latipinna were reluctant to mate at all when given a choice between the two heterospecific females, P. mexicana and P. formosa. Poecilia mexicana males, alternatively, showed high mate attraction to P. formosa when these females were paired with P. latipinna females. This result is intriguing, given that it is thought that female P. mexicana and male P. latipinna were involved in the original hybridization event that gave rise to P. formosa. Therefore, the strong attractiveness of P. formosa to P. mexicana may be related to a maternally derived genetic component. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Evidence of sexual selection on male body size and on the number and symmetry of sternopleural bristles and of sex comb teeth was sought in natural populations of two Drosophila species. Body size did not differ between mating and non-mating males in either species. Mating male D. simulans had significantly fewer sex comb teeth than did males not found copulating, and mating male D. pseudoobscura had more sternopleural bristles. No difference in fluctuating asymmetry of any bilateral trait was found between mating and non-mating males. These observations suggest that generalizations that large body size and symmetry promote mating success are unfounded. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Experiments using novel and familiar resources were conducted on colonies of the leaf-cutting ant, Atta colombica Guerin, in Costa Rica to determine the effects of prior experience on acceptability of plant resources. Two plant species, Aphelandra golfodulcensis and Caryocar costaricense, grew in the foraging territories of some but not all colonies tested. Artificial patches containing flowers of one or both species were presented to all colonies to study behaviour patterns of scouts and recruits, respectively. Scouts were significantly faster to show recruitment behaviour when encountering a patch containing familiar rather than unfamiliar resources. Workers recruited to a mixed patch by a single scout preferentially harvested resources encountered during travel on trails, regardless of the resource carried by the scout. Colonies treated the two resources differently when they were unfamiliar, accepting Caryocar but not Aphelandra after a delay of up to 24 h. This difference may be due to inherent differences in acceptability of the two resources. Colonies naturally harvesting Aphelandra continued to harvest this resource from artificial patches even after 48 h of exposure to Caryocar, suggesting that familiarity altered the relative ranking of the two resources. The results suggest that conditioning affects relative acceptability of resources to both scouts and recruits, and may be a partial explanation for the diversity of resources harvested by ant colonies.

AB Mate choice in the zebra finch, Taenopygia guttata, has been extensively studied and the results have been thought to provide support for the hypothesis that females prefer brightly coloured males even in a monogamous species. A bright, red beak colour was seen as the important feature upon which females based their preference. However, many recent studies have failed to find any effect of beak colour on female preference, and some suggest that females use display rate to choose a mate. The evidence provided by various zebra finch studies is critically examined and two possible explanations for why the results differ are suggested. First, there may be a hierarchy of choice criteria with display rate being more important than beak colour. Second, it is possible that female preference for male beak colour depends on female experience of males during maturation. Finally studies on the role of beak colour in zebra finches should consider the possibility that it is males rather than females who are responding strongly to beak colour differences between the sexes.

ID INTRASPECIFIC AGGRESSION; COLOR MORPHS; HISTOCOMPATIBILITY;

AB In the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima contact between non-clonemates often elicits inter-clonal fighting, involving the application of nematocyst-laden fighting tentacles (acrorhagi) and the locomotory retreat of losing polyps. This study confirms that isoclonal aggregations of A. elegantissima display an inducible polymorphism, such that polyps at the inter-clonal boundaries (warriors) are typically smaller and carry more fighting tentacles (acrorhagi) than more central (reproductive) polyps. Based on the outcomes of eight separate contests between each combination of like and unlike morphs for each of seven pairs of neighbouring clones (i.e. N = 224 contests), this study provides the first direct evidence that warriors are aptly named. All sets of neighbouring warriors and reproductives were mutually aggressive, and warriors, despite their overall size disadvantage, won 41 out of 81 contests with the reproductive polyps of their neighbouring clone. In addition, warrior and reproductive polyps were almost equally likely to initiate an attack and to retaliate. Thus, the success of warriors against the typically far larger reproductive polyps primarily reflects the proportionately greater allocation by warriors of resources to acrorhagi. The outcomes of the inter-clonal contests further indicate that pairs of neighbouring clones are unevenly matched in terms of their fighting ability, and that inter-clonal dominance is again largely determined by relative allocation of resources to acrorhagi. In five of seven inter-clonal combinations the warriors of the apparently dominant clone defeated the majority of opposing warriors (in three cases winning all eight contests). This result represents an apparent paradox, as earlier work showed that inter-clonal borders may persist for several years. Further work is needed to determine the extent to which agonistic behaviour determines the outcomes of inter-clonal competition for space and whether the outcomes of contests between pairs of individuals reflect the true dominance relationships of entire clones.

AB Relative food patch size and inter-patch distance are assumed to be important factors affecting the extent of within-group feeding contest competition among primates. The present study on wild female Japanese macaques revealed the occurrence of within-group feeding contest competition for their main winter food item, seeds of Zelkova serrata, and showed that the rank-related difference in feeding behaviour increased when available Zelkova patches were small relative to the area of group dispersion. Low-ranking females did not feed in small and isolated patches of Zelkova, switching instead to inferior food items in terms of energy intake rate, which led to an overall rank-related difference in feeding success. Small and isolated Zelkova patches contained more neighbours and high-ranking females, and fewer low-ranking females, than large and contiguous patches. The frequency of submissive behaviour rose when the density of neighbours increased. Food characteristics that may affect the extent of within-group contest competition are discussed.

AB In a laboratory study the effect of brood size manipulations on the sexual attractiveness of offspring was investigated. Zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were reared in small or large broods. Young were exchanged so that natural siblings from different rearing conditions could be compared. Birds of both sexes reared in small broods were larger and heavier as adults; furthermore, they developed the adult bill colour sooner than birds reared in large broods. Males reared in small broods had a redder beak as adults. Males but not females reared in small broods were more attractive to opposite sex individuals, as measured in choice tests. Males with redder beaks were more attractive to females. No relation was found in females between attractiveness and measured traits. Sexual attractiveness may thus be a potentially important mechanism by which brood size affects fitness. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Competition between pairs of stickleback was studied to investigate the effects of fish size and prey size on the feeding behaviour and competitive ability of the fish when single prey items were encountered sequentially. All the fish had a high probability of attacking the prey encountered. A fish with a high probability of being first to handle the prey had a high probability of ingesting it only when the prey was the smaller of the two prey sizes offered. With the larger prey, food gain was predicted not by the first to handle but by the jaw size of the fish. Encounter with a larger prey resulted in each fish attempting to capture it more often. This was due to the larger prey being visible for longer as it had to be manipulated before being swallowed. Even when prey were ingested and hence not visible, the unsuccessful competitor remained close by for approximately 7 s. The probability of eating any prey encountered was dependent on the phenotypic properties of the individual fish. A fast reacting fish with large jaws was able to reach its daily energy requirement regardless of the encounter rate with any prey size. Competitive ability was therefore a function of the fish, ability to reach the prey first, the capacity of the jaw apparatus to ingest the prey and prey encounter rate. When the pairs of fish encountered a high proportion of large prey, a generalist feeding strategy was the best option. The results can be applied to current foraging models, in particular to extending the sequential encounter model. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Song activity in the chiffchaff: Territorial defence or mate guarding?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUAL SELECTION; SINGING BEHAVIOR; GREAT TITS; DAWN; COMMUNICATION
AB It has been suggested that males of passerine bird species sing most actively during the fertile period of their mates partly as a paternity guard strategy and partly to maximize their own extra-pair copulation success. This investigation considers whether song is used as a paternity guard strategy in the chiffchaff, Phylloscopus collybita. The study was carried out in south-eastern England (Wytham Woods, Oxford) during 1993 and 1994. Song rate was calculated as the proportion of a 5-min period a bird spent singing, sampled either at dawn or at noon. Male chiffchaffs did not sing more during the fertile period of their females contradicting the paternity guard hypothesis. During the fertile period, song rate decreased when the female was present, suggesting that males sing to contact their mates. It is suggested that after the fertile period song is used to proclaim an established territory to the neighbours. This might also allow the male to re-mate quickly following nest predation or following female desertion or predation, while minimizing expensive territorial fights.

AB This paper describes the feeding behaviour and foraging strategy of the sibling mouse-eared bat species Myotis myotis and M. blythii under natural conditions. In the Swiss Alps, the main prey of M. myotis consisted of carabid beetles (46% by volume), whereas bush crickets contributed most to M. blythii's diet (60%). However, the diet varied seasonally in both species: although they were probably a predictable food source throughout the season, carabids were under-represented in the diet of M. myotis in May and September; and when bush crickets were unavailable in May and June, they were replaced by cockchafers in M. blythii's diet. The bats selected alternative, more abundant and/or more profitable prey at certain times of the year, mostly by switching from their traditional feeding habitats to secondary (usually temporary) foraging grounds. Direct visual observations in temporary food patches showed that mouse-eared bats gleaned most prey on the soil surface while flying, but cockchafers were usually caught in flight; foraging behaviour was highly flexible. The results suggest that mouse-eared bats are opportunistic predators that maximize their average rate of food intake by balancing habitat selection.

AB Attempts to repeat the original reports by Lorenz (1939, Zool. Ant. Suppl., 12, 69-109) and Tinbergen (1948, Wilson Bull., 60, 6-52) that goslings respond more to moving hawk silhouettes than to moving goose shapes have yielded mixed results. The combination of rearing and testing conditions was critical in obtaining a difference between reactions to the two models. In particular, group-reared birds tested in groups responded primarily by crouching, whereas individually tested birds (regardless of rearing) reacted mostly by running and calling. The response to goose models habituated faster than the reaction to hawk models. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The social behaviour of adult female mountain goats, Oreamnos americanus, was studied for 2 years in an unhunted population in west-central Alberta, Canada. Compared with other female ungulates, mountain goat females interacted aggressively much more frequently and their dominance ranks were less stable in time and less age-related. Goats were organized in a non-linear but non-random dominance hierarchy, with many reversals in rank. The best morphological predictor of dominance rank was horn length one year and body mass in the following year. Age was a weaker predictor of dominance status than what has been reported for other female ungulates. The ranks of individual goats changed between years and dominance rank one year was not a good predictor of rank the following year. These results suggest that linearity may only be possible when a contested resource can be defended. Dominant female goats did not forage more efficiently than subordinate goats, and dominant status did not affect the amount of time devoted to alert behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID APODEMUS-SYLVATICUS; WOOD MOUSE; RECOGNITION; MARKING
AB Mus spretus, an aboriginal species of house mouse, appears to show a pattern of behaviour not reported in other rodents. Faeces are picked up and carried short distances in the mouth or rolled along the ground with the tip of the snout, often repeatedly. Two experiments using wild-caught subjects held temporarily in captivity investigated the potential function of this behaviour. Provided with a choice of faeces up to 12 h old from different donors in an arena, mice showed a strong preference for manipulating their own fresh faeces deposited during the trial, especially those in corners. A second experiment, using single fresh faecal samples encountered in a tunnel, confirmed that mice manipulated their own faeces (in 56% of trials) more frequently than those from conspecifics (26% of trials). Manipulation was not affected by the presence of tapeworm eggs in faeces, although this stimulated increased investigation from the donor. In both experiments, differences in investigation suggested that mice could discriminate between the faeces of conspecifics according to the sex and familiarity of a donor, preferring samples from familiar animals of the opposite sex (caught within 25 m of the subject). They showed no bias in manipulating samples from different conspecifics. Given the frequency with which moist fresh faeces stuck to mice as they passed, the results suggest that manipulation is a hygienic response to move sticky faeces away from pathways and resting sites. However, faeces are likely to play an important role in providing social information in M. spretus populations.

AB The extent to which predation influences the grouping patterns and behavioural ecology of non-human primates is a matter of continuing debate, but there are few held studies in which predation has been observed frequently enough to test the hypothesis that predation is an important influence. Group size and anti-predator behaviour of red colobus monkeys, Colobus badius tephrosceles, were studied in relation to predation by chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Predation by Gombe chimpanzees had a major impact on red colobus group size and structure. Mean group size of red colobus living in the core hunting area of their chimpanzee predators was 46% smaller than the mean size of groups living in the periphery of the chimpanzees' hunting range. Chimpanzees fed mainly upon immature red colobus monkeys at Gombe, and predation by chimpanzees was the likely limiting factor on red colobus group size and population size. Despite high levels of predation, there were few differences between large and small groups in likely predator avoidance behaviour: foraging and resting height, or nearest-neighbour proximity, for any age/sex class when they were not in the proximity of chimpanzees. When parties of chimpanzees were present the spatial positioning of colobus changed; females and immatures increased their nearest-neighbour scores to adult males, and adult males decreased their nearest-neighbour distances as a part of their communal defence tactics. Predation by chimpanzees elicits different detection and defence strategies from red colobus than do aerial (raptors) or terrestrial (felids) ambush predators. This appears to be owing to the social nature of chimpanzee hunting and the effect of chimpanzee party size and composition on hunting success.

TI PUTTING RESOURCE DYNAMICS INTO CONTINUOUS INPUT IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION
   MODELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS; PATCHY ENVIRONMENT; PREDATORS; STRATEGY
AB Continuous input models of the ideal free distribution usually assume that resources are consumed immediately that they enter a patch. This paper presents models of constant continuous input in which this assumption is relaxed, so that predictions can be made about the standing crops of resources and the density relationship of prey mortality caused by the consumers. These models suggest that: (1) the input matching rule is not dependent on the assumption that resources are consumed immediately that they enter a patch, and holds whether or not there is interference competition but not when there is an alternative source of mortality; (2) exploitation competition is fundamental to the continuous input model. Whether or not interference competition occurs can be determined in experimental situations by measuring the standing crops of resources in patches with different resource input rates; (3) interference models are not an alternative to continuous input models but represent a 'snapshot' of time from either continuous input or depletion models; (4) in continuous input models prey mortality is density independent in the absence of interference because all patches have the same standing crop of resources. When there is interference between consumers prey mortality is density dependent, unless the interference is extremely strong.

AB Matrilineal rank orders, common in cercopithecine monkeys, are often called nepotistic because female kin occupy adjacent ranks and support each other preferentially. But alliances among non-kin also play a central role in these dominance systems, enabling females to maintain their rank above lower-ranking individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which nepotism (among siblings) might conflict with a female's need to form alliances with non-kin. The study was conducted at the University of Montreal Laboratory of Behavioural Primatology housing a group of 35 Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata. In this species females outrank their older sisters after a period of aggressive challenge. Younger siblings that were individually unable to maintain their rank above an older sister were found to be able to do so in the presence of dominant non-kin, indicating that the latter are effective allies far younger siblings. Thus, in conflicts between non-kin allies and their older sisters, younger siblings may face a conflict of interest between siding with the non-kin ally to increase their competitiveness against their sister, or help their sister. One thousand and seventy-seven aggressive interventions involving 22 sibling dyads over a 56-month period were analysed. In accordance with the experimental results, dominant non-kin supported preferentially the younger siblings. The latter appeared divided between siding with their older sister and the non-kin ally. However, in conflicts between non-kin individuals and-kin that they did not target for dominance, younger siblings acted nepotistically more often. Thus, nepotism appeared constrained by a female's need for non-kin allies. These data are best interpreted in terms of individual advantages rather than in terms of kin selection or reciprocal altruism.

LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIORAL ELEMENTS; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; DIALLEL
AB The possibility that phenotypical correlations between staccato movement (an element of fear response in novel situations) and several other behavioural elements of paradise fish have a genetic component has not been investigated previously. The difficulty in determining the genetic underpinnings of staccato movement has been due to violation of the criteria of additive-dominance genetic models of applied-classical and diallel-cross analyses. Furthermore, the limited number of available inbred strains in these cross systems could decrease the number of variable loci and thus one's ability to detect possible genetic effects including genetic covariation. To circumvent these problems, bidirectional selection using a genetically variable outbred population was carried out by recording the behaviour elements in a novel situation, and based on staccato performance, breeding two high-performer and two low-performer lines and a non-selected control population. The response to selection was immediate and strong in the first selected generation in both directions without significant change in the succeeding generations, suggesting a major gene effect in the inheritance of staccato movement. Phenotypical correlations were confirmed between staccato and several other elements. However, correlated response to selection was observed only in one behavioural element (swim), suggesting a genetic component in the swim-staccato phenotypical correlation due either to pleiotropic gene effects or to genetic linkage. The other significant phenotypical correlations between staccato and the behavioural elements, which were non-genetic in origin, also represent a stable correlation structure, which is interpreted to be the result of higher neural mechanisms.

AB A field experiment with simulated nests of azure-winged magpies was carried out to test the hypothesis that this species nests in association with Japanese lesser sparrowhawks in order to reduce nest predation while paying few costs. The predation rate on nests was lower within 50 m of a hawk's nest during the incubation to nestling period than it was further away or at other stages of the breeding cycle. In addition, there was an inverse relationship between nest predation rate and hawk defence effort. Observations of natural nests showed that magpies did not defend their nests when nesting close to a hawk, and that hawks rarely preyed on magpies. Thus, magpies benefited from nesting close to hawks, while paying few or no costs.

AB Males employing a mixed reproductive strategy may increase their fitness through extra-pair copulations (EPCs), but also risk lost paternity when they leave their own mate unguarded. How males maximize the effectiveness of forced extra-pair copulation (FEPC) attempts while minimizing the risk of cuckoldry was studied in a non-migratory population of the white-cheeked pintail, Anas bahamensis bahamensis, a tropical species with extended breeding seasons. Despite substantial asynchrony in the laying dates of females, males directed FEPC attempts primarily at females in fertile condition. The rate of pair copulations also peaked during the female's fertile period, but 23.1% of all successful copulations with laying females were FEPCs. Males guarded their paternity by vigorously defending their mates from males attempting FEPC, by escorting females to their nests, by defending a territory, and by forcing copulation on their own mates after they had been subjected to an FEPC attempt by another male. Contrary to expectation, males did not temporally partition mate guarding and FEPC activity but pursued FEPCs primarily during the period when their own mates were fertile. There was no evidence, however, of a trade-off between FEPC activity and the quality of male mate guarding. Females paired to males with the highest FEPC rates were rarely subjected to FEPCs themselves. In addition, although females that abandoned nesting efforts suffered a high frequency of FEPC attempts, their mates were much less active in FEPCs than the mates of females that nested successfully. These results suggest substantial variation in male quality: some males excelled at both guarding their mates and achieving FEPCs, while others neither pursued FEPCs nor mate-guarded effectively.

The phenotypic variability was low (coefficients of variation were 5.4 and 7.7%, respectively). Although there were indications of variability among males and families, the heritability of both parameters measured by father-son regression was not significant. Twenty isofemale lines from the same population were also examined after 30 generations of culture in the laboratory. These showed similar phenotypic variability, although a greater proportion of this was among families. A single generation of artificial selection showed that this variation included a genetic component which responded to selection. Reasons for the discrepancy between the results of the two studies are discussed. (Sic) that D. melanogaster song shows relatively low phenotypic and additive genetic variability, which is consistent with most expectations for an important mating signal. However, the character can evolve following genetic drift, probably because of non-additive sources of genetic variation in the original population.

AB The copulation activity of 12 pairs of African marsh harriers, Circus ranivorus, was quantified over 1670 h to evaluate the effects of food provisioning, body size, laying date and nest spacing on copulation frequency. Pairs copulated most often in the early morning and averaged between 0.9 and 4.3 copulations/pair/day for a total of 50-220 possible copulations before egg laying. About 27% of all attempts were unsuccessful. Presentation of prey by the male to his mate was not a prerequisite for copulations and copulation duration was not associated with prey size. However, more unsuccessful copulations occurred when food was not provisioned than when it was. Extra-pair copulations formed only 2% of all observed matings (similar to other raptors), and occurred outside the territory. The first prediction of the paternity assurance hypothesis, that copulation frequency should be higher in colonial species than solitary ones, was not supported. The second prediction, that nest clumping should be associated wtih increased copulation activity within species, was, however, verified for harriers. Copulation frequency for clumped pairs was over two-fold higher than for solitary pairs. These rates were equalled by only one (solitary) male shortly after his mate had actively sought extra-pair copulations. These results support the idea that harriers appear to copulate more frequently to increase their chances of paternity.

TI TIMING OF REST AND SLEEP IN FORAGING SHREWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Laboratory measurements of three species of shrews (Sorex) have revealed an exceptionally short activity cycle, consisting, on average, of 55 min of foraging followed by 64 min of sleep. The foraging period is frequently interrupted by short rest periods, which last for 7 min on average. The present study showed that shrews enter a short rest period when their digestive tract is relatively full, and when, presumably, rate of assimilation could not be increased by eating any more. In support of this hypothesis, the duration of the short rest period was positively correlated with the estimated amount of food in the digestive tract at the beginning of the rest period. The shrews generally stopped foraging and went to sleep when they had been exceptionally successful at obtaining food, and thus their digestive tract was full when they started to sleep. The duration of the foraging period was consequently variable, but that of the sleep period relatively constant, and independent of variation in food availability. These results suggest that the rate of food intake of shrews may be limited by a digestive constraint.

TI COSTS AND BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH OVIPOSITION SITE SELECTION IN THE
   DRAGONFLY SYMPETRUM-DANAE (ODONATA, LIBELLULIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Predation by frogs, site selection and site usage during oviposition by a small dragonfly were studied. Data were collected under natural conditions and in a large outdoor field-cage. Sympetrum danae oviposits in flight as a pair (tandem) following copulation, as a released post-tandem female or as an unattended female. Under natural conditions 14% of all females that started oviposition in tandem and 10% of all solitary females were killed by frogs, while this was so for only 3% of all males  in tandem. Ovipositing post-tandem females were less frequently attacked by frogs than females that were not seen to have mated previously. Sites with Sphagnum were preferred. Substrate selection was probably mainly visual as some dragonflies were also attracted to a structurally similar, but non-aquatic, moss. Sites were chosen in relation to thermoregulatory requirements: south-facing sites were used at low ambient temperatures late in the season and north-facing sites at high ambient  temperatures early in the season. Pairs searched longer for a suitable site at higher ambient temperatures and preferred sites with ovipositing individuals on them. They were more hesitant about choosing a site when frogs were present than when they were absent. Compared with pairs or solitary/unmated females, unattended females were more likely to oviposit at the site where the male released them. The results are discussed in terms of optimized habitat selection for larval development at  minimized oviposition costs.

TI FACTORS INFLUENCING THE CHOICE OF PREDATORY TACTICS IN A WATER BUG,
   DIPLONYCHUS-INDICUS VENK AND RAO (HETEROPTERA, BELOSTOMATIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The tropical water bug Diplonychus indicus is a highly versatile predator that alternates quickly from active foraging to ambushing. The influence of hunger level, the presence of prey and environmental complexity on swimming, diving, resting and foraging by adult males was investigated at the individual level, in a factorial experiment with three main treatments. There were simple relationships between these factors and the water bug''s behaviour, and interactions between these three factors  also affected foraging. The general distribution of foraging tactics between active search and ambushing was significantly influenced by the presence of perching sites (vegetation), but not by hunger level although hungry bugs as well as bugs in the absence of perching sites were significantly more active than well-fed subjects or bugs in the presence of perching sites. In the presence of vegetation, predatory attempts included fewer dives and more attempts from ambush including preliminary  orientations. Hunger level, however, did influence the distribution of ambush predatory tactics; the attempts by hungry subjects included more preliminary orientations. Capture efficiency was not affected by hunger level, but it was affected by the presence of perching sites. Under these experimental conditions the bugs appeared to be capable of modifying, to a certain extent, their predatory tactics in relation to the environment. Nevertheless, the choice of a predatory tactic did not appear to be taken on an all or none basis.

AB Aviary experiments on the effect of tail length of males on the sexual response of females were carried out with a promiscuous, parasitic finch, the shaft-tailed whydah, Vidua regia. Oestradiol-treated females, presented with two males of widely differing tail lengths, performed copulation-solicitation displays to males with lengthened tails in preference to normal-tailed controls, and to controls in preference to males with shortened tails. Yet although males were always visually isolated from each other, individuals displayed and vocalized significantly more when their tails were longer than that of the other male, and less when their tails were shorter. Females presented with a long-tailed decoy and a short-tailed live male solicited neither, but spent significantly more time with the live male.

TI MALE VERSUS FEMALE INFLUENCES ON MATING-SITE DETERMINATION IN A
   CORAL-REEF FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Theory in behavioural ecology suggests that female movements and activities ultimately determine mating system structure. However, it is also possible that males may take a much more active role in determining when and where to mate. In the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, large males in the terminal colour phase defend breeding sites to which females migrate daily. To estimate the relative roles of males and females in determining the location of these sites, all terminal-phase males or all females were replaced in local isolated populations and subsequent site use was monitored. When males were replaced in three different experiments, the mating system was essentially unaffected: only two of 24 sites ceased to be used, and no new sites were used. In contrast, when females were eplaced in three experiments, 11 sites were lost and 10 new sites came into use, and these continued to be used for at least a year after the manipulations. This occurred even though large males initially continued to defend and display over the original sites. This is strong evidence for the importance of female choice in the bluehead breeding system, and suggests that males simply respond to female site preferences.

TI SPERM COMPETITION IN THE ZEBRA FINCH, TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Extra-pair copulation is known to occur in zebra finches in the wild and the aim of this study was to examine several aspects of sperm competition in domesticated zebra finches breeding in captivity. Female zebra finches are fertile between day -11 AND +3 (where day 0 = the day the first egg is laid). Pair copulation, occurs about 12 times per clutch, peaking on day -1 and decreasing markedly after day 0. Copulation was most frequent in the first hour of the morning. Copulation behaviour of  zebra finches breeding in groups in an aviary differed from that of single pair in cages in that copulations were often disrupted in the aviary, and multiple pair copulations occurred in the aviary but not in cages. Extra-pair courtship was common in the aviary and extra-pair copulation was observed. All extra-pair copulations occurred within the female''s fertile period. Males guarded thier partners by close following, defended then from extra-pair copulation attempts, and sometimes followed  extra-pair copulations by forced pair copulations. The temporary removal of guarding males greatly increased the likelihood of the female being subject to extra-pair copulation attempts. Genetic plumage markers were used to determine paternity, and showed that in an aviary, naturally occurring extra-pair copulations resulted in extra-pair paternity. Sperm competition experiments showed that single-extra-pair copulations could fertilize eggs and that sperm from the last male to mate had 70-80%  precedence over previous matings.

TI OFFSPRING AGE AND NEST DEFENSE IN MOURNING DOVES - A TEST OF 2
   HYPOTHESES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Active nests of mourning doves, Zenaida macroura, were studied to test two hypotheses concering offspring age and nest defence. Both have been used to explain increases in defence as offspring mature. The age-investment hypothesis interprets the escalation in defence as an adaptive response to changing parental investment; the revisitation hypothesis interprets the escalation as an artefact of researcher disturbance. To distinguish between the hypotheses, the results of analyses involving  single and multiple visits to nests were compared. The age-investment hypothesis predicts an increase in offspring defence in both analyses, whereas the revisitation hypothesis predicts an increase only for nests visited repeatedly. A regression of flushing distance on offspring age was non-significant for both analyses. The intensity of flight displays, however, increased as offspring grew older in single- and multiple-visit analyses. This supported the age-investment hypothesis, but inconsistent changes in flight displays within adult pairs suggested that other factors such as predation might be more important determinants of adult behaviour. Analyses of multiple visits are subject to increased type I error if returns to the same nest are treated as independent samples; investigators analysing multiple visits should use conservative degrees of freedom to control the problem.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Playback studies have often identified note order as a feature in the recognition of conspecific song by passerines. Pitch change between successive notes in song could be an important source of order features. In two experiments, we varied the absolute and relative pitch in conspecific fee bee songs played to captive male black-capped chickadees. In experimental 1, song beginning appreciably higher or lower in absolute pitch than normal song elicited less social response. In experiments 2,  songs played at altered pitch intervals tended to elicit less combined agonistic and territorial response. These experiments indicate that chickadees are sensitive to both absolute and relative pitch information present in conspecific song.

TI KIN RECOGNITION AND ITS INFLUENCE ON MATING PREFERENCES OF THE FIELD
   CRICKET, GRYLLUS-BIMACULATUS (DEGEER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female field crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, responded differentially towards courting males of different degrees of relatedness. They evaded and even attacked persistently courting full siblings significantly more that half-siblings or unrelated males. The latency to mate was therefore greater for full sibling and half-sibling pairs suggesting that females may prefer unrelated males as mates. Female discrimination was also apparent in post-copulatory behaviour. Females were less passive when mated and guarded by full siblings; they attempted to escape more often from guarding full siblings and half-siblings and spent longer trying to escape than females mated with unrelated males. They were capable of discriminating between males even when they had had no prior experience of conspecifics. Data suggest that the mechanism of recognition in this species involves the learning of self recognition cues as well as those of individuals previously experienced. However, a female''s own recognition cue may take priority since experience of unrelated males strengthened a female''s recognition abilities rather than resulting in her treating familiar unrelated males as kin. Cuticular pheromones are suggested as a likely candidate for a recognition cue.

TI THE FUNCTION OF EGG-SPOTS IN AN AFRICAN MOUTH-BROODING CICHLID FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the functional significance of egg-spots of the anal fin of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia elegans. Wickler (1962, Nature, Lond., 194, 1092-1094), suggested that the egg-spots of male haplochromines function as egg-dummies, attracting females and enhancing fertilization of the eggs. This study compares fertilization rates of clutches from females spawning with intact males and with males from which the spots had been removed by freeze-branding. Based on Wickler''s  hypothesis, the males without spots should fertilize fewer eggs. No differences were found in the fertilization rates of the two types of male. There were differences, however, in the number of clutches produced. Over the same period, females with intact males had twice the number of clutches of those with males without spots. Subsequent choice experiments showed that females always chose males with egg-spots. They also preferred males with four spots to those with one spot. It is concluded  that the egg-spots serve as intraspecific sexual advertisement.

TI ODOR OF PYRAZINE POTENTIATES AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CUES
   AND UNPALATABLE TASTE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two experiments examined the abililty of rats, Rattus norvegicus. to discriminate an aversive quinine solution from unadulterated tap water when the presence of one of the liquids was accompanied by a pyrazine odour. Experiment 1 demonstrated that subjects would readily learn to avoid drinking in the presence of pyrazine when it had previously signalled quinine, but to drink normally when pyrazine had been paired with ''safe'' water. In experiment 2 quinine and water were presented in discriminably different contexts. Pyrazine odour aided, or potentiated, learning about the content-taste associations compared with a control in which pyrazine was not presented during discrimination training. These result are discussed in terms of the possible roles that pyrazines and other odours might play in prey selection.

TI THE ONTOGENY OF THE PECKING RESPONSE OF HERRING GULL CHICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ontogeny of the pecking response of herring gull chicks, Larus argentatus, was investigated in an attempt to resolve the potential contributions of maturation, habituation, conditioned inhibition, classical conditioning and imprinting. Previous studies had shown strong innate preferences for certain stimuli, but no significant preference for herring gulls over laughing gulls, Larus atricilla, either at birth or among older chicks whether wild-reared or laboratory trained. In the tests  reported here, naive herring gull chicks, both at 18 h and 5-6 days, showed no preference between a model of their species and one of a laughing gull. High response rates to several scrambled models indicated chicks have no innate configuration image available. Older naive chicks lost much of their response specificity. Unreinforced exposure to a model herring gull had no effect. Unreinforced exposure to a laughing gull model, on the other hand, specifically reduced the response to laughing gulls, showing that conditioned inhibition can be strong. Reinforcement to laughing gull models resulted in a species preference. However, chicks did not learn to prefer herring gulls or white circles when reinforced by these models, and showed no conditioned inhibition to herring gulls. Wild-reared herring gulls show a weak preference for their own species.

TI CONSEQUENCES OF SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN SAND FIDDLER CRABS, UCA-PUGILATOR -
   DIFFERENTIAL VULNERABILITY TO AVIAN PREDATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The predatory behaviour of seven captive white ibises, Eudocimus albus, on sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, was studied to assess the degree to which the enlarged claw of male crabs affects the relative vulnerabilities of male versus female crabs. When given a simultaneous choice between a female and male crab or between a male crab with its major claw removed and an intact male, all seven ibises showed a preference for the animal without the major claw. Overall, when offered crabs on an exposed surface, ibises chose female and declawed male crabs four times as often as intact male crabs. When probing into artificial burrows containing either a male or female crab, all seven ibises rejected male crabs almost twice as often as they did female crabs. During encounters both with crabs on the surface and with crabs in burrows, ibises appeared to be especially wary of the enlarged claw of male crabs. These data suggest that sexual dimorphism in sand fiddler crabs substantially affects the relative vulnerabilities of male and female crabs to avian predators.

TI SONG LEARNING IN MONTANE WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS - FROM WHOM AND WHEN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB White-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys, adults and nestlings were colour-banded and songs of mature progeny recorded to determine whether songs were learned from fathers, age peers or adults other than fathers. Four out of 17 sons and daughters sang the same song types as their fathers, indicating that transmission of song from fathers to their young (vertical transmission) is not the norm. Since juveniles do not sing full (''crystallized'') songs until they are older, transmission from  juvenile to juvenile (horizontal) is unlikely on the breeding grounds but may occur if siblings migrate together and hear each other''s song on the wintering grounds. The usual mode of transmission is via other adults (oblique). Birds learn one or two songs prior to or during migration, and upon settling on the breeding area the following year may utter only one theme, that which matches the neighbours'' songs during matched countersinging bouts. A bird''s song dialect is thus not necessarily an indicator of its birthplace. One wild and one laboratory-reared bird sang songs of a Lincoln sparrow, Melospiza lincolnii, and a strawberry finch, Amandava amandava, respectively. These data and data from field playback studies lend support to the notion that interspecific territoriality may lead to acquisition of alien song for use in matched countersinging during territoral encounters with allospecific neighbours.

TI SLEEP IN MAMMALS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Quiet sleep (QS) was correlated with a different set of constitutional variables from those associated with active sleep (AS), in a sample of 69 species of mammals. The time spent in quiet sleep was negatively correlated with body size and basal metabolic rate. The latter relationship remained even after controlling for the effects of body weight. Neither the total time spent in active sleep, nor active sleep as a percentage of total sleep time was significantly correlated with body weight or metabolic rate. Altricial species spend more time in active sleep than do precocial species. The time between the onset of successive episodes of active sleep, the AS-QS cycle length, was positively correlated with body weight. For their body sizes, species that live in temperate regions have shorter AS-QS cycles than those living in tropical or sub-tropical regions. Correlations between patterns of sleep and adult brain weight probably result from the confounding effects of body weight. These  findings were used to evaluate several explanations for interspecific differences in patterns of sleep among mammals.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF HUNGER, SHOAL SIZE AND PREDATOR PRESENCE ON FORAGING IN
   BLUNTNOSE MINNOWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study examines the compromise between predator avoidance and foraging in bluntnose minnows, Pimephales notatus, in shoals of different sizes and at three levels of hunger: 5, 24 or 72 h of deprivation. Trials were carried out in the laboratory with a predator present or absent. Foraging was affected significantly by shoal size, predator presence and hunger. Foraging latency decreased as shoal size and hunger level increased, but latency increased in the presence of a predator. Foraging  rate was less when there was a predator present. In the absence of a predator, foraging rate increased as hunger level increased. At the 5 h hunger level, foraging rate increased as shoal size increased, in the absence but not the presence of a predator. At this low level of hunger, minnows in all shoal sizes fed at a low rate when the risk of predation was greater. At higher levels of hunger, fish in all shoal sizes fed at a high rate when no predator was present, so that foraging rate did not  change across shoal size. When the predator was present at the higher hunger levels, only fish in larger, safer shoals fed at a rate greater than at the lowest hunger level.

TI TIME-COURSE OF MEMORY FORMATION DIFFERS IN HONEY BEE LINES SELECTED FOR
   GOOD AND POOR LEARNING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six lines of the honey bee Apis mellifera capensis were selected for good and poor learning, and compared with respect to the time-course of their memory after a single learning trial to an odor stimulus (geraniol). The good learners showed the well known bi-phasic time-course with a high rate of conditioned responses immediately after learning, followed by a reduction 1-3 min later and a consolidation into a long-term memory after an interval longer than 5 min. Poor learners differed significantly with respect to their consolidation period and the initial high response rate. The initial period (of less than 1 min) is controlled not only by the associative memory of the learning trial but also by a sensitizing effect of the sucrose stimulus which was used as an unconditioned stimulus. It is concluded that the lines selected for learning performance differ with respect to the establishment of a long-term memory trace. As in Drosophila learning mutants, differences between good and poor learners are also affected by non-associative processes involved in sensitization.

TI HERITABLE VARIATION FOR TERRITORIAL SUCCESS IN 2 DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER
   POPULATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male fruitflies from stocks from two localities were artificially selected for defence of a food area against intruding males. Both stocks showed a rapid replicable response to selection over a few generations, indicating considerable genetic variation for territorial success in the base populations. Crosses between lines indicate directional dominance for increased territorial success and no maternal or paternal effects. Selected males escalated relatively more frequently against territory residents than control males, and won relatively more escalated encounters. There was no correlated response in body weight. In the presence of territories, selected males had a higher mating success with inseminated females than control males but did not differ in mating speed. Indirect selection for territorial success was carried out by allowing flies to mate in the presence of different types of resources. After 21-26 generations, males from lines held in cages with discrete resources where territories could be established had greater territorial success than males from lines held in cages with one large resource. This genetic divergence in response to resource type is consistent with the heritable variation in territoral success and mating success of territorial males.

TI A COURTSHIP ADVANTAGE FOR SMALL MALES IN DROSOPHILA-SUBOBSCURA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Large male Drosophila subobscura carry bigger drops of regurgitated food during courtship and have greater courtship success with starved females than do small males. However, if males are prevented from producing a drop, the small males have greater courtship success than the large males, suggesting that they perform some other aspect of courtship better than large males. In the present study small males were better than large ones at tracking the female during the courtship dance. Although males of different sizes ran at the same top speed during the dance, the larger males lagged further behind the female presumably because they take longer to accelerate to or decelerate from any given speed. A male''s walking ability will also depend on other factors such as his ''athletic ability'' and the amount of food stored in his crop and body tissues. The possible relationships between athletic and food gathering ability and fertility in wild males are discussed.

TI REVERSIBILITY REVISITED - STIMULUS-DEPENDENT STABILITY OF FILIAL
   PREFERENCE IN THE CHICK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The reversibility of filial preferences was studied in domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, using an artificial as well as a more naturalistic imprinting stimulus. Day-old chicks were exposed for 2 h to either a rotating stuffed jungle fowl or a rotating red box. Two hours later their preferences were tested in a simultaneous choice test (test I), involving the box and the fowl. The next day, the chicks were trained and tested (test II) as before, except box-trained chicks were now exposed to the fowl and vice versa. In three different experimental groups, the relative attractiveness of the two stimuli (as measured in test I) was varied by altering the light intensity of the red box. In the chicks trained with the box and subsequently exposed to the fowl, there was a significant decrease in mean preference for the box from test I to test II. In contrast, the preferences of the chicks trained with the stuffed fowl were not affected by subsequent exposure to the red box.  This differential reversibility was also found when, in test I, the preference for the box was significantly higher than the preference for the fowl. These results support a model of the formation of filial preference as an interaction between acquired preference and a developing predisposition for a particular class of stimuli.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF FILIAL PREFERENCES IN DARK-REARED CHICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When given a simultaneous choice preference test 24 h after being allowed a period of time in running wheels, dark-reared domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, will approach a stuffed jungle fowl in preference to a red box. The present study was designed to determine which aspects of the stuffed fowl were critical for the emergence of this preference. In all experiments the preferences of dark-reared chicks were studied in a test involving the simultaneous presentation of an intact  stuffed jungle flowl and a second, test object. In experiment 1 this object was a ''complex'' red box, in experiments 2.1 and 2.2 disarticulated stuffed fowl, and in experiment 2.3 the ''scrambled'' skin of a jungle fowl. The results of these experiments suggested that particular arrangements or configurations of features, and not outline or textural complexity alone, are important for the emergence of the predisposition. Further support for this hypothesis was obtained in experiment 2.4 in which the intact fowl was compared to a test object containing such configurations of features. The result of experiment 3 suggested that the configuration of features associated with the head and neck region are particularly important, while the results of experiments 4 and 5, in which the test objects were a stuffed gadwall duck and a stuffed polecat, respectively, established that the configuration of features essential for the predisposition is not species specific.

TI PARENTAL RANK AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF NATAL RHESUS MALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In primates, the relationship between the ranks of parents and those of their sons has not been studied systematically, yet it has important implications for sociobiological theories. The influence of parents'' ranks upon the ranks and reproductive success of their sons who remain and breed within their natal group was tested in two captive groups of rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta. Paternity exclusion analyses revealed that both the rank and reproductive success of natal males were strongly associated with their mothers'', but not their fathers'', ranks. The ranks of natal males were also significantly correlated with their own reproductive success. However, this correlation was not nearly as strong as the correlation between the ranks and reproductive success of the fathers of these natal males. This difference was associated with a decline in reproductive success, but not in rank, of some founding males after natal males reached sexual maturity, and might result from an age bias in mating and/or the increase in the ratio of adult males to females. Although the reproductive advantage enjoyed by sons of high-ranking mothers prior to dispersal from their natal groups might be of evolutionary significance, it is important to determine whether or not this advantage persists after dispersal.

TI SEX-DIFFERENCES IN DEFENSE OF EGGS AND NESTLINGS BY NORTHERN
   MOCKINGBIRDS, MIMUS-POLYGLOTTOS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Northern mockingbirds, Mimus polyglottos, actively defended eggs and nestlings from humans visiting nests. there was a significant positive correlation between levels of defence by mates within pairs. Pairs in which males strongly attacked intruders displayed greater nesting success than pairs in which males did not. By several measures, males defended offspring more than females did: males approached closer when defending nestlings but not eggs, and engaged in more attacks on the intruder  during both egg and nestling stages. Males, but not females, increased their frequency of attacks from the egg to the nestling stage. More males than females struck the intruder when defending nestlings. When defending nestlings, males followed the intruder to the edge of the territory more often than did the females and vocalized more frequently during encounters with intruders. both sexes hovered over the intruder infrequently during the egg stage. During the nestling stage, males hovered  more than females, but the sexes hovered at similar distances overhead. Birds tending to hover over the intruder were mated to birds that likewise hovered. Males, but not females, approached intruders more closely as nestlings aged. A decrease in the distance of approach to the intruder with age of the eggs was related to nest revisitation. A similar decrease in distance of approach with the ageing of nestlings was not explained as a nest revisitation effect. A male-biased sex ratio of adults  in this population may favour the condition where males defend offspring more strongly than do females.

TI THE EFFECTS OF LITTER-SIZE VARIATION ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLAY-BEHAVIOR
   IN THE DOMESTIC CAT - LITTERS OF ONE AND 2
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In many litter-bearing species, litter-mates interact with each other in a variety of ways during early life. In the domestic cat, Felis catus, social play is a prominent form of interaction between litter-mates. The present study investigated how the lack of a litter-mate affected the development of kitten play and of the mother-kitten relationship. The subjects were 14 litters of domestic kittens living with their mothers in large indoor cages. Seven litters contained two male kittens, and the other seven contained single male kittens. Social interactions within the families were observed from day 22 to day 83 after birth. Single kittens played a more active part in maintaining close proximity to their mothers and directed more playful behaviour at them than did kittens with a sibling. Although single-kitten mothers avoided their offspring more than did mothers of litters of two, they also directed much higher levels of play behaviour at them. Despite the marked difference in the mother-kitten play relationship in the two litter types, single kittens experienced quantitatively less social play than did kittens with siblings. As the kittens grew older, single-kitten mothers showed higher levels of aggression towards their young than did mothers of litters of two.

TI THE AMNIOTIC-FLUID - AN IMPORTANT PRIMING ROLE IN KIN RECOGNITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability of individuals to learn prenatally about their amniotic fluid may be of particular importance in the development of kin recognition, ensuring that individuals learn about genetically related conspecifics. Rat pups, 8 h old, were tested for their preference between their mother''s amniotic fluid and that from an unrelated rat. The pups preferred their mother''s fluid. Furthermore, pups born by Caesarean section, when tested immediately after birth, preferred their mother''s fluid to  that of an unrelated rat, indicating that this preference is acquired prenatally. Thus, at birth, rats may possess a rudimentary idea of who their kin are, and prefer and orient towards them, ensuring that any further learning of kinship information is from genetically related conspecifics.

TI CHANGES IN THE FLOCKING BEHAVIOR OF WINTERING ENGLISH TITMICE WITH TIME,
   WEATHER AND SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the course of one winter, the food supply of birds living in a deciduous woodland in southern England was supplemented and unsupplemented during alternating periods. In the presence of substantial predation pressure from hawks, the sociality of blue tits, Parus caeruleus, and great tits, P. major, showed significant partial correlations with several weather and temporal factors when the woodland was unsupplemented. Such correlations between social behaviour and biotic factors diminished significantly when the birds has access to extra food. Blue tits and great tits without access to supplemental food flocked significantly more often with other species while foraging than when they were food-supplemented. Long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus, ignored the artificial food and foraged in mixed-species flocks to the same extent in both unsupplemented and food-supplemented periods. Results disprove the hypothesis that mixed-species foraging groups are caused by increased predation protection alone, and they support the hypotheses that mixed-species foraging groups are caused by increased foraging efficiency alone or by a combination of increased foraging efficiency and increased protection for predators.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF PREDATION RISK ON THE FEEDING MOTIVATION AND FORAGING
   STRATEGY OF JUVENILE ATLANTIC SALMON
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, changed their foraging strategy markedly after a brief exposure to a model trout predator, in ways that reduced their conspicuousness and hence risk of being preyed upon. After seeing the predator, the salmon were less likely to orientate to passing food particles, and having orientated, were less likely to attack them. They also reduced the extent of their movements, by only attacking these food particles that came close to them, and by delaying attacks  until the food has reached it closet point. They were slower to orientate to approaching food items, possibly because more visual attention was switched to scanning for predators and less to feeding. However, there was no change in the outcome of attacks, indicating that the reduced food intake was not caused by a reduction in appetite. The relative priority given to foraging and predator avoidance varied with time elapsed since the predator was last sighted; as a consequence, intake rates in the 20 min following the predator presentation averaged only 33% of the pre-predator level, but had increased to 57% 20 min later, and had recovered completely within 2 h.

AB Wild mating male D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura were larger than randomly sampled males. That this was due to size and not a confounding effect of age was confirmed by release experiments with D. melanogaster of standard age; larger males were at a mating advantage with virgin and inseminated females. In both species larger males delivered more courtship and in D. pseudoobscura they won more aggressive encounters. These results on Drosophila in the field confirm and extend those previously obtained in the laboratory.

TI SONG DEVELOPMENT IN THE WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW - SOCIAL-FACTORS AND
   SEX-DIFFERENCES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Results of earlier studies indicated that hand-raised white-crowned sparrows exposed to tape-recorded songs learned conspecific song between ages 10-50 days, but not before or after that age. These studies also indicated that allospecific songs were not learned. We describe song development in 41 male and 22 female hand-raised white-crowned sparrows. Thirty males and 15 females were exposed to a live adult singing male. It was found that most male students learned the song of their live tutor  even though tutoring was begun at 50 days of age, an age by which young would have dispersed from the natal to the breeding area. Male students learned allospecific song as easily as they did conspecific song, even though conspecific song was present in the laboratory. Only three females copied any part of the song of either conspecific or allospecific live tutors. Six 50-day-old males and seven females were exposed to tape-recorded song and none learned the tutor song. These results indicate  that there are sex differences in song learning, and that, if live tutors are used, the sensitive phase for male song learning extends beyond 50 days of age. We conclude that social interaction can override any auditory gating mechanism that prevents inappropriate stimuli from influencing song learning centres.

TI PARENTAL DIVISION-OF-LABOR AND DIFFERENTIATION OF ATTACHMENTS IN A
   MONOGAMOUS PRIMATE (CALLICEBUS-MOLOCH)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Callicebus is one of several species of New World primates in which males and females share in caring for infants. In Callicebus, the males generally carry the preambulatory infant, except during bouts of nursing. Thus, infant care in this species rests on a triadic relationship involving some degree of coordination among three individuals. We investigated the contributions of the mother, father and infant to the development of this relationship as reflected in the strength and  differentiation of social preferences and emotional bonds. The results indicate that the male begins to carry the infant most of the time in the first week of life if the parents are experienced, and somewhat later if they are not. By the third month of life the father is established as the infant''s primary attachment figure, although the parents did not differ in their attraction to the infant and each parent was more strongly attached to the other than to the infant. An important factor underlying the parental division of labour and differentiation of filial attachment appears to be the greater tolerance of the male for prolonged infant contact. The combination of frequent rejection by the mother and acceptance by the father presumably accounts for the father''s status as the primary object of filial attachment. As the infant''s behavioural competence increases, it acts as the principal agent in maintaining the pattern established earlier by the parents.

TI COSTS AND BENEFITS OF MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR IN THE GREEN LYNX SPIDER
   (OXYOPIDAE, PEUCETIA-VIRIDANS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB I examined the adaptiveness of maternal behaviour in the green lynx spider Peucetia viridans (Hentz), by measuring the costs and benefits to the female of egg-sac tending, P. viridans guards her egg sac for 6-8 weeks until the young have emerged and dispersed. I removed females from egg sacs in the field either immediately after oviposition or after they had guarded the egg sacs for 2 weeks, and compared the fate of these sacs with that of control sacs which had females present throughout. Survival rates of egg sacs were significantly improved by the presence of a female. The major sources of mortality were ant predation and sac dislodgement, both of which were significantly reduced by a guarding female, and mantispid brood parasitism, which was not affected by the female. To measure the spiders'' lifetime reproductive output, I allowed caged females to construct egg sacs. Half had their first egg sac removed shortly after oviposition, while half were allowed to guard. Significantly more non-guarding than guarding females produced second egg sacs. Thus for the green lynx spider, egg sac guarding decreases lifetime egg production, but increases offspring survival. Under north Florida [USA] conditions, the benefits of guarding outweigh the costs, and the females have a higher lifetime reproductive success than if they did not guard.

TI DETERMINANTS OF SOCIAL-DOMINANCE IN EASTERN GRAY SQUIRRELS
   (SCIURUS-CAROLINENSIS) - A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study, conducted from January 1979 to August 1981 at the Rachelwood Wildlife Research Preserve, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., examined the structure of the dominance hierarchy in a free-ranging population of eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), using physical attributes and behavioural patterns correlated with social status for groups observed in arena trials. Multivariate statistical analyses (principal components and linear discriminant function analyses) of over 380 agonistic interactions indicated taht the primary determinants of dominance were the animals'' sex and age, and that the frequency of display of key agonistic behaviour patterns could predict an individual''s age (i.e. dominance) status, with over 94% accuracy. Non-parametric analyses of variance (Kruskal-Wallis and Jonckheere-Terpstra procedures) showed that adults significantly out-ranked immatures of both sexes. No significant differences in status were found in comparisons between  immature animals and among adults, although average rank consistently increased with age among adults. Within sex/age groups, weight of the animals did not significantly influence status. These results support those determinants of dominance proposed in several earlier studies of gray squirrel social behaviour and behavioural ecology.

TI COVERABLE BADGES AND RESOURCE DEFENSE IN BIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB We propose a hypothesis to account for the evolution of coverable patches of conspicuous coloration in birds. According to the hypothesis: (1) resource of defenders use ''colour badges'' to thwart conspecific intrusions; (2) individuals not intent on challenging owners signal submissiveness with covered badges; and (3) because ownership status may change within seasons, individuals benefit from being able to produce both signals interchangeably. Coverable badges are believed to be reliable  indicators of status because cheaters may pay the cost of escalated fighting with opponents. In tests with red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) we found that territorial males discriminated between mounts of conspecifics with blackened epaulettes and mounts of male Brewer''s blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus) and, thus, rejected the alternative species recognition hypothesis. The coverable badge hypothesis was supported by evidence that: territory owners were most aggressive toward  redwing mounts showing the most red; males intruding into occupied territories covered their epaulettes; and floating males that took over experimentally vacated territories behaved as legitimate owners only minutes after entry. This hypothesis provides the first adequate explanation of the function of the coverable and conspicuous epaulettes of redwings.

TI INTEGRATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI IN THE MIGRATORY ORIENTATION OF THE
   SAVANNAH SPARROW (PASSERCULUS-SANDWICHENSIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two ''cue-conflict'' experiments were designed to evaluate the role of solar cues at sunset and stars, and solar cues at sunset and geomagnetic stimuli, in the migratory orientation of the savannah sparrow (P. sandwichensis). A sunset and stars experiment exposed birds in the experimental group to a mirror-reflected sunset followed by an unmanipulated view of stars. Experimental birds shifted their migratory activity in accordance with the setting sun despite exposure to a normal might sky. The sunset and geomagnetism experiment exposed birds in the experimental group to a simultaneous shift in both the position of sunset and the earth''s magnetic field. Again experimentals shifted their activity in accordance with the setting sun rather than the artificially shifted magnetic field. Savannah sparrows probably use stars as celestial landmarks to maintain a preferred direction and do not reorient their activity when exposed to an alternative cue once a direction is established. Savannah sparrows with experience of migration do not require geomagnetic information to use the solar cues available at sunset to select a migratory direction.

TI SCENT-MARKING BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO CONSPECIFIC ODORS BY THE RAT,
   RATTUS-NORVEGICUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The scent-marking behavior of male and female rats in response to conspecific odors was investigated in 2 experiments. Exposure to conspecific odors generally led to an increase in marking rates. No sex differences were found and large differences in marking responses according to the sex of the odor donor were only found for diestrus females. These results do not suggest that the primary function of scent-marking in this species is sexual. In the 2nd experiment, odor sources differed not only in the sex of the donor, but also in their relative familiarity to the animal being tested. This experiment showed that males marked more in response to odors from familiar (non-related) females. Females did not differ significantly on measures of marking, but did display greater interest in odors from unfamiliar males. The results are discussed in relation to possible functions of marking in this species.

AB Male marsh wrens (Cistothorus palustris) do not ordinarily learn songs from tutor tapes during their 1st spring, but in 2 experiments all 5 males given an opportunity to learn from a live adult tutor did so. Further doubt is therefore cast upon the ability to infer from laboratory situations the timing and significance of events in nature. There was marked individual variation in the responses of subjects to seemingly identical laboratory conditions; such differences among individuals are unexplainable but intriguing and warrant further study is more than mere experimental noise.

TI AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR AND ENDOGENOUS PLASMA HORMONES IN MALE JAPANESE QUAIL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Agonistic relationships established among male Japanese quail (C. coturnix) in short-term dyadic encounters of a round-robin tournament were stable and appeared to be maintained by a form of recognition. The aggressive or submissive behavior displayed by competitors throughout the tournament did not relate to their circulating levels of luteinizing hormone, androstenedione, 5 .alpha.-dihydrotestosterone or corticosterone. Plasma levels of testosterone were correlated with fighting success in the early phases of the tournament, before agonistic associations were declined. Once relationships stabilized, levels of plasma testosterone in winners declined to values comparable with those of the losers and the qualitatively distinct displays observed in winners or losers were no longer correlated with plasma levels of testosterone. These data suggest that androgens, primarily testosterone, influence the aggressiveness of an individual in initial encounters helping to determine dominance relationships between opponents. Thereafter, other factors such as learned response biases take precedence. The maintenance of stable social relationships appears to be independent of circulating levels of testosterone in adult male Japanese quail.

TI RANK-DEPENDENT COMPROMISES BETWEEN GROWTH AND PREDATOR PROTECTION IN
   LIZARD DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Juvenile Anolis aeneus lizards often live in dominance hierarchies, and in both the laboratory and field, rank was primarily determined by a juvenile''s size relative to the others when it entered a hierarchy. Because juveniles entered hierarchies soon after hatching and left when they reached subadult sizes, most juveniles slowly rose in status during their sojourn in dominance hierarchies. In laboratory experiments, rank and growth rate were positively related when both food and perches were uniformly distributed. However, when perches were non-uniformly distributed, juveniles competed to live on those perch configurations which offer protection from predators. Under these conditions, growth was more weakly related to rank than in the uniform-habitat trials, and high-ranking juveniles living on the preferred (safe) perches had significantly lower growth rates than those living elsewhere. In contrast, low-ranking juveniles in non-uniform habitats experienced no such compromise  between growth and safety, and those on the preferred perches tended to grow faster than those living elsewhere. Since most juveniles in the field seem to gradually rise from low to high rank, the behavioral strategies for optimizing growth and survival may change ontogenetically in this species.

TI CONSISTENCY IN THE RELATIVE ATTRACTIVENESS OF A SET OF LANDMARK
   TERRITORIAL SITES TO 2 GENERATIONS OF MALE TARANTULA HAWK WASPS
   (HYMENOPTERA, POMPILIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of the tarantula hawk wasp, H. ustulata, defend conspicuous palo verde trees on mountain ridges. A comparison of data from 2 flight seasons (1980 and 1981) reveals that the preference rankings of males for a set of perennial territories on one ridge remained highly consistent from generation to generation. This is the first thoroughly documented demonstration for insects that landmarks used as mating encounter sites retain the same relative attractiveness from year to year. The stability of male preferences is indirect evidence that access to females is related to the ability to acquire high-ranking territories. In both years, the flight season was 2.5-3 mo. long, the range of body sizes in this highly variable species remained the same and the ratio of territorial males to non-territorial patrollers was constant. A key difference was a strong reduction in the total number and density of males found in the study site in 1981. The wasps responded to the decrease in competition for perch territories by failing to occupy some low-ranking sites that were taken in 1980.

TI SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR AS A FUNCTION OF CONTEXT IN A COCKROACH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Intersexual (male-female) and intrasexual (male-male and female-female) behavior in the cockroach S. couloniana were compared and contrasted. The parameters of interest were: frequencies and sequences of acts, agonistic intensity, mean numbers of acts per encounter, presence and direction of asymmetry in encounters of varying lengths. Frequencies and sequences of acts differed depending on the sexes of the individuals involved. Intrasexual encounters were more intensely agonistic than intersexual encounters with females being more intensely agonistic than males. Intersexual encounters were longer than intrasexual encounters in the mean numbers of acts. In intrasexual encounters involving 2 or 3 acts, the responder was usually the winner, while in 4 and 5 act encounters, the initiator was usually the winner. In encounters of more than 5 acts, neither the initiator nor the responder had an advantage.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individuals of the tortoise beetle (D. guttata) from sites containing different host plants differ genetically in performance on different hosts. Because individual variation in habitat (host) preference could contribute to the maintenance of these genetic differences, a study was undertaken to find out whether D. guttata exhibits such variation, and if so, to determine the causes of that variation. No evidence for either larval conditioning or genetic variation in oviposition preference was obtained. An effect of adult experience on oviposition preference was detected, but the magnitude of the effect was so small that it probably has little influence on genetic divergence in traits affecting growth and fecundity. Behavioral variation does not contribute to maintenance of the observed genetic divergence.

TI MATING-BEHAVIOR AND REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION OF 3 SPECIES OF REPTILE TICK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mating behavior of 3 spp. of reptile tick, Aponomma hydrosauri, Amblylomma albolimbatum and A. limbatum is similar and involves a female sex pheromone which activates males to detach from their hosts and search. After contacting females, a stereotyped 6-phase courtship sequence occurs. There are qualitative differences between the species in courtship behavior at phase 3 (reversal of position by dorsally mounted males) and phase 6 (the copulation position). On-host observations of non-conspecific mating show that females of the 3 spp. have species-specific activation pheromones, which is contrary to reports in other species of tick. Such specificity should result in reproductive isolation of the 3 spp., but under certain circumstances it may not prevent non-conspecific contacts between the sexes. Off-host observations of courtship behavior show that once males of the 3 spp. contact non-conspecific females, they attempt courtship and are persistent with their courtship. Rarely did non-conspecific courtships proceed beyond phase 4 of the courtship sequence, as non-conspecific females did not lift their bodies to allow males venter contact. Differences between the species in leg orientation in the copulation position, together with body size differences, are responsible for a complete barrier to successful non-conspecific copulation. The observations illustrate the role that behavioral mechanisms play in reproductively isolating these 3 spp. of tick.

TI AN INVESTIGATION INTO EGG-ACCEPTANCE BY AZURE-WINGED MAGPIES AND

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Tests using magpies'' eggs (which are very similar to those of the great spotted cuckoo) on azure-winged magpies (Cyanopica cyanea) showed that the latter accepted strange eggs, rejecting only 25% of them. They are probably an accepter species and, as such, a substitute host species for the great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius). A theory is suggested for the transition from Accepter Species to Non-mimetic-egg Rejecter Species by hosts of specialist brood parasites. Evidence was obtained of host recognition by great spotted cuckoo chicks of typical or atypical host species characteristics. Basing the theory on the calls of parasitic chicks reared in the nests of the azure-winged magpies and magpies (Pica pica), the foregoing is probably the mating mechanism necessary for the parasitization of a new host species.

AB Songs were recorded from male yellowhammers, E. citrinella, in England [U.K.] and West Germany. Sonagraphic analysis revealed 3 major types of song structure in both populations. Most males had a repertoire of 2 distinct song types, and sharing between individuals was extremely rare. Most song is produced late in the breeding season, and playback experiments confirmed that it is correlated with an increase in territorial aggression at this time. Some speculations are advanced concerning the origins and functions of song repertoires in the yellowhammer.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Parrots of the genus Trichoglossus perform elaborate repertoires of visual threat displays during agonistic interactions. The displays of different species and subspecies differ in complexity and composition. As repertoire complexity increases, taxa tend to emphasize the more exaggerated components of display, and they also show a reduced inclination to attack a mirror-image opponent. These covarying attributes of threat displays in Trichoglossus are highly correlated with interspecific differences in bill-length. These findings are discussed in light of recent theoretical advances in the study of animal threat and fighting behavior.

AB This study describes the range and reliability of differences between individual elephant seal bulls, M. angustirostris, on several parameters of the threat call: call type, spacing of pulses within calls, addition of snorts to calls, pulse rate of calls and number of pulses in calls. Some preliminary analyses of the social function of these individual differences are made. Two hypotheses, that specific features of the call communicate dominance status and that differences in pulse rate represent dialects, are investigated.

TI OPTIMAL FORAGING IN A UNIFORM HABITAT - SEARCH MECHANISM OF THE GREEN
   LACEWING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of food deprivation and prey contact on the components of searching behavior in larval green lacewings (C. carnea Stephens) were examined to test the applicability of optimal foraging theory to predation in a uniform habitat. Variation in foraging intensity was primarily the result of changes in the meander. Modulation of the response to prey contact with increasing deprivation involved changes in the velocity and the response persistence and suggested the occurrence of adaptation to inferred differences in the spatial distribution of the prey. The ratio of giving-up times at different levels of deprivation was in accordance with the predictions of optimal foraging theory, even though the conditions precluded a discrete decision process.

TI HOME OCCUPANCY BY MALE OCTOPUS-VULGARIS IN A LARGE SEAWATER TANK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pairs of individually recognizable male O. vulgaris were observed in a large seawater tank containing 2 suitable homes (brick pots or plastic buckets). None of the animals established exclusive occupancy of 1 home and, for much of the time, both animals were associated together at the same site. Usually 1 of the 2 homes was preferred, and its occupant was most likely to be the larger animal, or the earlier resident if they were of equal size. Large animals took food forcefully from smaller octopus. An arm alignment interaction is described which may be a means by which 2 octopuses establish their relative sizes.

TI PAIRBOND IN KLIPSPRINGER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Like many small African antelopes, klipspringer (O. oreotragus) live in territorial pairs. The structure of the pairbond and the ways in which it is maintained through time are described quantitatively, using data on co-ordination of behavior, activity budgets, progression orders and visual monitoring. Although both partners play an active role, the female''s behavior tends to be more concerned with efficient foraging, while the male''s behavior seems to emphasize those activities that allow him to maintain contact with the female. Because the male needs to spend less time feeding than does the female, he detects predators more frequently, a behavior that probably allows the female to feed more efficiently. Both sexes apparently defend the territory against intruders, although the functional significance of the territory remains unclear.

TI LEARNING AND LIVING IN HOLES BY MANTIS SHRIMP
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda, Crustacea) that normally occupy holes in coral were presented with novel burrows (Erlenmeyer flasks painted black) in the laboratory. Individuals learn to recognize characteristics of the flask and enter the burrow increasingly rapidly with repeated exposure to the flask. Individuals show consistently fast or slow learning curves, suggesting individual differences in learning ability. Three to 7 days may be a critical period during which the stimulus must be re-encountered, or else the response is partially forgotten. A partial response remains after 14 days, and subsequent re-exposure to the stimul is associated with more rapid re-acquisition of the entry behavior than in naive animals. Field observations support the interpretation that individuals learn characteristics of their burrows and the environment. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship of learning ability to the ritualized behavior repertoire and to social interactions.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF VOCAL BEHAVIOR IN PEKING DUCKLINGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Vocal communication may play an important role in maintaining group cohesion in broods of Peking ducklings (A. platyrhynchos). To describe the development of the vocal repertoire of the young, the vocalizations of 6 ducklings were examined from several hours before hatching through 48 h posthatching. Vocalizations were recorded in standardized situations in the laboratory, including the presence of conspecific peers, exposure to maternal calls and social isolation. Whether the vocal repertoire of the ducklings would sort itself on objectively measured acoustic features without the necessity of experimenter preclassification (as has been relied upon in the past) was determined. This objective procedure produced 2 acoustically distinct (and conventional) types: contentment calls, which have short note durations, fast repetition rates and low pitch and are elicited by the presence of peers and/or the maternal call; and distress calls, with longer note durations, slower repetition rates and higher pitch, which are uttered in social isolation and emerge in mature form only after hatching. A simple physiological model based on respiratory activity is proposed to account for the acoustic variation between the 2 vocalization types.

TI DISTRACTIBILITY CHANGES DURING THE ESTROUS-CYCLE OF THE RAT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experiments are described which were designed to test the hypothesis that the ease with which rats will shift attention between stimuli varies with the estrous cycle. It was predicted from the results of earlier work that at estrus animals will shift attention less readily than at diestrus, provided that attention is already focussed on a specific stimulus. Data from 2-stimulus tests and runway tests confirmed this prediction. The nature of the underlying changes may be similar to those induced in young chicks by exogenous testosterone and may involve changes in hippocampal function.

AB Field observations on 117 tree shrews (T. glis) were made in Singapore. While there was little home range overlap between adult residents of the same sex, there was complete range overlap between those of the different sexes. The latter fell within 2 basic patterns: pair.sbd.1 adult male''s range almost completely overlapped with only 1 adult female''s range; and harem.sbd.1 adult male''s range almost completely overlapped with 2 or more female ranges. The number of females in the harem was proportional to the size of the adult male range. In terms of territorial chases, adult males chased males and adult females chased females. Scent marking mainly by adult males was observed both inside and outside territories.

TI EARLY WARNING FUNCTION OF FLOCKING IN BIRDS - EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY WITH
   CAPTIVE QUELEA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two tests are described, using the weaverbird quelea, of the proposed early warning function of flocking in birds (i.e., larger flocks detect a predator sooner). In experiment 1, flocks detected a goshawk [Accipiter gentilis] flying over their cage with a greater probability than single birds. In experiment 2, the probability of detection of a brief, artificial, alarm stimulus increased with flock size in the same way, but at a lower absolute level, as that predicted by a simple model of detection. Possible reasons for the discrepancy (non-independence of detection probabilities: flock size influences each individual''s probability of detection or response threshold) are evaluated. As flock size increased, the type of response elicited changed from taking wing to flight intention movements to orienting responses, a trend which can be understood functionally in terms of the reduced risk of capture in larger flocks once the flock has been detected by a predator.

TI HABITAT SATURATION AND COMMUNAL BREEDING IN THE ACORN WOODPECKER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The acorn woodpecker (M. formicivorus) typically lives in social groups that breed communally; all group members help to feed the young of a single nest. The behavior of acorn woodpeckers was compared in 2 locations (New Mexico and California [USA]) to test the hypothesis that saturation of the habitat by established groups may lead to more than a single male-female pair living in groups during reproduction. The habitat was probably less saturated in New Mexico. This difference was reflected in a lower tendency for juveniles and adults to remain in groups, higher reproductive rates and, more important, smaller group sizes. Habitat saturation may play an important role in communal breeding in this species.

AB Laughing gulls Larus atricilla, nesting in saltmarshes subject to tidal inundations, build substantial nests and continue adding material throughout the reproductive cycle. Under normal conditions, nest size increased until gulls had 5-day-old chicks. Nests were manipulated at various stages in the reproductive cycle. Until their chicks reached 14 days of age, gulls added material to artificially wetted nests, making them significantly deeper and wider than before treatment. During all reproductive stages examined, gulls repaired nests having half of the material removed. The adaptive significances of nest building and relative nest size are discussed in terms of washouts and the requirements of the eggs and chicks at different stages in the reproductive cycle.

Stronger dominance orders were inversely correlated with the frequency of aggressive interactions. Recognition of individuals, as measured by frequency and intensity of aggressive encounters between familiar crabs and introduced strangers, was not important in maintaining dominance orders. P. longicarpus recognized the aggressive state of conspecifics, as shown by frequencies of aggressive encounters after individuals of different dominance rankings were exchanged between established hierarchies.

TI GYNANDROMORPH ANALYSIS OF SOME ASPECTS OF SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR OF
   DROSOPHILIA-MELANOGASTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB D. melanogaster gynandromorphs were introduced into a mating chamber containing 2 wild-type conspecific males. From the differential courting responses of these males, the only important factor that enabled a male to distinguish between conspecific males and females and to direct persistent courtship only toward females was the tissue composition of females. This is tentatively interpreted in terms of a female-specific sex pheromone. Genetic, embryological and anatomical considerations suggested that the pheromone producing cells of adult D. melanogaster females are dispersed throughout, and are part of the female''s tergites, sternites and thoracic integument. Behavorial observations indicated that as the intensity of the excitatory stimuli invoked by a gynandromorph increased, it ended to be courted more persistently and for longer periods of time. Preliminary fate mapping indicated that behavioral differences between males and females are determined by anteriorly located organ(s) and that these organ(s) can trigger behavioral responses regardless of the composition or physical structure of the target organs.

TI INFLUENCE OF EATING AND REJECTING PREY ITEMS UPON FEEDING AND FOOD
   SEARCHING BEHAVIOR IN GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Variation in encounter outcome and in area restriction and area avoidance subsequent to eat and reject encounters, respectively, was examined in relation to immediately prior behavior and to the total previous experiential history within the daily feeding session. Neither outcome nor post-encounter behavior was totally dependent upon the current encounter. The motivational variables involved, however, could not be attributed simply to an increase in satiation with cumulative intake over the session. Short-term positive and negative motivational aftereffects may be present after eat and reject encounters, respectively. The former positively influences the probability that a subsequent prey item will be eaten and the latter negatively influences that probability. A rough approximation of the duration of these motivational after-effects was made.

TI INFLUENCE OF MALE ON MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR IN MONGOLIAN GERBIL
   (MERIONES-UNGUICULATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Multiparous pregnant gerbils (M. unguiculatus) were housed with or without male mates following parturition. Six of 7 litters in the ''male-present'' condition were found dead by the 3rd day post partum; these females showed very little maternal behavior. Six of 7 litters in the ''no-male'' condition were successfully reared through 9 days of observation; these females showed consistently high rates of maternal behavior. Cannibalism was rare in both conditions, the majority of pup-deaths resulting from neglect. It appears that the presence of the male disrupts maternal behavior, resulting in neglect of the pups and pup-mortality. The male''s presence may interfere with the effective space, or ''territory'', necessary to the female for the display of appropriate maternal behavior.

TI POST-CASTRATION RETENTION OF SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR IN MALE BDF1 MOUSE - ROLE
   OF EXPERIENCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male BDF1 mice (the F1 progeny of a cross between C57BL/6 females with DBA/2 males) show a remarkable retention of sexual behavior following castration. The postcastration copulatory performance of the BDF1 male mouse is described and the extent to which such performance is influenced by experience prior to castration was determined. Castration leads to significant increases in the number of mounts and intromissions needed to reach ejaculation and to a significant increase in ejaculation latency. Although precastrational sexual experience is not essential for the performance of the ejaculatory reflex after castration, it does influence the frequency of its occurrence. Furthermore, type of post-weaning social experience influenced the display of ejaculatory behavior by non-experienced castrates, as those with female social experience were superior to those with social experience with males or no social experience. The interactions of experience, hormones and genotype in the control of sexual behavior in the BDF1 male are discussed.

   VARIABLES UNDERLYING FLEEING AND GROOMING BEHAVIOUR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experiments were de-signed to examine 2 previously proposed variables an activity tendency which results in increased probability of fleeing and an optimal aroUSAl range in which grooming is most likely to occur. Wild-trapped Microtus agrestis and Clethrionomys britannicus were individually housed and tested in the previously employed experimental alley. The probability of fleeing behavior was greatly increased when overt locomotion was either concurrent with or ceased within 10 sec. of the experimental disturbance. The concept of a temporarily persisting activity tendency which in itself affects fleeing was supported. Amphetamine increased fleeing and Nembutal decreased fleeing to an extent that could not be accounted for solely in terms of current or recently ceased locomotion. Differences between species and cover conditions were equivocal, perhaps due to the high tendency of individually housed animals to flee. Two main techniques for studying the previously defined optimal aroUSAl model for grooming were to examine integration of home pen cover plus amphetamine and Nembutal with species differences in grooming and attempt to manipulate aroUSAl over a wide range with the 2 drugs. Cover and 0. 8 mg/kg amphetamine produced more grooming in Microtus while no cover and 15 mg/kg Nembutal produced more grooming in Cleth-rionomys, as predicted from the aroUSAl model. Further, the drug and cover inputs combined in their effect. Bach species showed an overall non-linear relationship between drug dose and grooming as expected from the model. Certain inconsistencies with the model were also noted in the present experiments, however, and the possibility that both aroUSAl and conflict models are necessary is discussed. The increase in grooming intensity was again noted, particularly under amphetamine, as was the increased probability and vigor of other simple motor patterns with this drug. Problems of integration of multiple inputs with patterned outputs are discussed further.

AB The investigation was undertaken to determine whether ovulation itself is the main factor in the causation of nesting behavior. Attempts were made to mask any sensory information which could possibly arise from the act of ovulation and to mimic the physical events associated with ovulation by artificially rupturing the follicle wall. Attempts to mask sensory information were unsuccessful. It was shown that artificial rupturing of the follicle was only followed by normal nesting behavior if it was performed within about 1 hr. of normal ovulation. However in a small number of cases it did follow artificial rupturing performed about 3 hr. before the expected normal ovulation.

AB Female D. melanogaster and P. simulans are unreceptive to males on the day of eclosion (day 0) but all are fully receptive by day 2. This change runs parallel to the growth of the corpus allatum and ovaries. Injection of mature corpora allata into pupae 18 hr. before eclosion leads to precocious receptivity on day 1. After mating, females are unreceptive for 6-8 days. This change has a short-term component due to the effects of copulation and a long-term component due to the presence of sperm.

The persistence of avoidance, strength of avoidance, latency of positive responses and strength of following all increased up to the 3rd or 4th day but thereafter declined. The initial changes are regarded as consequences of the process by which isolated chicks learn the characteristics of their immediate environment. The relation between avoidance and positive responses of 229 three day-old chicks were also analysed. There was a strong positive correlation between the persistence of avoidance and latency of positive responses. The persistence of avoidance and higher values of the strength of avoidance were negatively correlated with the strength of following. The positive correlation between + lower values of strength of avoidance and strength of following was attributed to their both being measures of locomotive ability.

AB Social interactions are a driving force behind disease outbreaks in animal societies. As groups become more complex and build permanent nests, they run the risk of introducing more routes of potential pathogen exposure. Eusocial societies have well-established 'superorganism immunity' that protects against disease. However, fewer studies have investigated social immunity in cooperative breeders, which may provide insight into the evolution of immunity as a form of collective behaviour during major evolutionary transitions in sociality. We exposed groups of social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola) to a generalist entomopathogenic fungus (Metarhizium robertsii) using three modes of exposure: directly onto a groupmate, mechanically vectored by prey and nest exposure. We compared spider mortality between exposed groups and pathogen-free controls. We measured space use and colony fragmentation to test whether pathogen exposure route and disease severity affected spiders' aggregation and polydomy behaviour. We found that route of exposure greatly affected spider mortality, with direct exposure resulting in the most rapid mortality. Individuals from groups with a directly exposed spider were also more likely to be observed outside their nest compared to all other treatments. Exposure did not result in differences in colony fragmentation. These data demonstrate that the route of pathogen introduction not only affects the severity of disease outbreaks but can also alter behaviours relevant for social immunity. This study enhances our understanding of the transitional steps in social immunity among cooperative breeders that may lead to the evolution of superorganism immunity.

AB Social structure arises from individual behaviours and can impact a wide variety of behavioural and ecological processes. Although changes in the physical and social environment shape sociality, how perturbations govern sociality at a fine spatial scale remains poorly understood in wild populations. By applying automated experimental treatments to radio frequency identification tracked wild great tits, Parus major, in a field experiment, we examined changes in individual social network metrics in response to manipulated changes in two factors: (1) the distribution of food resources; and (2) the stability of the composition of individuals that had access to the same feeders, a subtreatment that was applied during one of the resource treatment levels. Repeatability analyses revealed consistent differences among individuals in their social network metrics at feeders across the various treatments. As expected, the average flock size and social network metrics increased when the distribution of food changed from two single feeders spaced 50 m apart (dispersed) to one location with an array of five feeders 1 m apart (clustered). However, some social network metrics changed further when individuals were restricted to feeding from only one of the five clustered feeders, even though all five feeders remained active. We also show how experimentally imposed group membership stability can impact social network metrics. Most changes in social network metrics were maintained when the food distribution returned to the dispersed pattern with two feeders 50 m apart, although dyadic associations between individuals of known identity were largely maintained. Our results show that perturbations in access to resources and social group stability at a surprisingly fine spatial scale can change connections in social networks during foraging. Fine-scale effects can arise through assortative positioning within groups and can have important consequences for social processes at larger scales, yet are typically overlooked.

AB Individuals' movements are conditioned by the acquisition of information from personal interactions with the environment or from social sources. Despite the importance of social information in movement decision making, little is known about how individuals proceed when social information comes from multiple sources. Here, we specifically tackled this issue by experimentally testing (1) how social information from multiple sources is used to make relocation decisions and (2) whether a contrast in this information enables individuals to orient themselves in space. Using the common lizard as a model species, we conducted repeated experiments in which a focal neonate received information from two other neonates coming from distinct peripheral environments before being given the opportunity to relocate to either peripheral environment. Specifically, we focused on information on resource availability and intraspecific competition by considering informants' body mass (BM) at birth and their subsequent food intake. Our analyses revealed that the amount of resources in the informants' environments affected relocation decisions, depending on the focal individual's phenotype. We found the probability of relocation increased when both the informants' food intake and the focal individual's BM increased or decreased. We also found the relocation increased when both the informants' and focal individual's BM increased or decreased. Our findings suggest that focal individuals adjust their relocation response to social information according to their needs and/or physical abilities. Conversely, we found no significant effect of differences in BM between informants or spatial variability in resource availability on spatial orientation. This study highlights that multiple sources of social information that reflect the quality of the surrounding environment (competition or resource availability) can be used for movement decision making.

AB Strong, affiliative bonds often function to facilitate social competition through cooperative defence of resources, but the benefits of social bonds may be low when direct competition is less intense or less beneficial. In such cases, one possible outcome is that relationships are weak and undifferentiated. Alternatively, negotiating stable, selectively tolerant relationships may be a strategy to mitigate the costs and risks of sharing space when direct competition is undesirable. We investigated dyadic social tolerance among wild adult female eastern chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, who engage in low rates of affiliation and aggression with one another. While females associate with one another at different rates, these patterns could reflect shared patterns of behaviour (e.g. ranging) rather than social preference or variation in relationship quality. We first determined whether patterns of dyadic spatial association (5 m proximity) were differentiated and stable over time. To assess whether dyadic spatial association reflected preference and variation in social tolerance, we tested whether spatial association was actively maintained by waiting and following behaviour and associated with decreased aggression and increased co-feeding. Spatial associations were differentiated, and stronger associations were more stable. Frequent associates used following and waiting behaviour to actively maintain associations. Association positively predicted time co-feeding and negatively predicted aggression. These patterns were true among related and unrelated dyads. Among unrelated females, dyads with stronger associations maintained proximity more mutually. This study highlights social tolerance as a stable relationship attribute that can predict and explain patterns of behaviour and social network structure, distinct from, or in the absence of, affiliation.

AB Many migratory animals use daylength, or photoperiod, to signal when to migrate and transition between annual phenological states. Whether animals use photoperiod as a temporal or spatial cue while migrating, however, requires additional empirical support. We used hatch-year dunnocks, Prunella modularis (a songbird), caught during their first migration in southern Sweden to elucidate whether migratory animals incorporate photoperiod as a spatiotemporal cue into their endogenous migratory program during migration. We exposed the migratory-na & iuml;ve to light environments that simulated either the local photic conditions or a shorter daylength and larger transitions between photoperiods. All birds experienced local geomagnetic conditions. We hypothesized that migratory dunnocks used photoperiod to inform their first migration and predicted that the experimental treatment represented either a spatial displacement to the north or a temporal advancement towards winter at the capture site compared to the local control conditions. We found, though, that the short photoperiods terminated the expression of the migratory phenotype compared to controls by reducing body mass gain and ending migratory activity, indicating that the endogenous migratory program integrates photoperiod during migration. The incorporation of photoperiod into the endogenous program may complement geomagnetic cues to ensure ending migration at the correct time and location. The incorporation of photoperiod can also provide a mechanism that facilitates poleward shifts of overwintering distribution under climate change by allowing migrants to overwinter in newly suitable habitat at higher latitude (i.e. short stopping).

AB Offspring provisioning can act as a proxy of resource acquisition and vary with parental sex and age. Agerelated variation can arise from individual experience and senescence, but also from selective disappearance of poor-quality parents. Distinguishing between these processes and quantifying their effect on the resource acquisition and fate of individual chicks requires longitudinal monitoring of known-age individuals, which is still rare. In our longitudinal study, we observed offspring provisioning of common terns, Sterna hirundo, across a 6-year period and analysed provisioning behaviour from both a parental and offspring perspective. Using repeated measures of provisioning of individual parents, our analyses showed that provisioning did not increase with age, but that parents that were observed at older ages provisioned more, suggesting selective disappearance of parents that provisioned less. Parental provisioning was higher in males than females and increased with brood size in both sexes. For offspring, energetic acquisition declined with hatching order and increased with age. Acquisition from the mother increased faster with chick age than that from the father, and mothers distributed their provisioning more evenly across chicks of different hatching order. Parental age, however, did not affect the energetic acquisition of the offspring. The early energetic acquisition rate of chicks predicted their fledging success, but not fledging mass. When decomposing effects on energetic provisioning and acquisition rate into effects on feeding rate, prey energetic density and prey size, we found that all arose from variation in feeding rate. Overall, these results therefore show that both parents and offspring vary in quality, which is reflected in their feeding rate. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Camouflage is frequently used by animals for concealment and thereby improves survival. Typically, it is the animal's own colour and patterning that are expected to affect its detectability; however, the complexity of the background can also have an influence. Although there is a growing literature examining this, the underlying exact mechanism is unknown. In this study we addressed this issue by using humans as proxy 'predators' in a computer-based search task and monitoring their detection times for targets on varying backgrounds. By using artificial greyscale targets and backgrounds, we were able to isolate and manipulate the normally covarying factors that comprise 'complexity' in natural habitats. We show that reduced detection was explained not by greater information content (entropy) or higher variance in the background's features per se, but instead by reduced signal-to-noise ratio in the visual features that potentially distinguish target from background. This raises questions about when the term complexity should be used, and how observers learn the characteristics of a background. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

These vocal signals, with a likely precopulatory function, are thought to be costly; given energetic constraints, they are expected to be in a trade-off with postcopulatory traits, such as testicular volume. Although this trade-off has been generally tested through comparative studies across species, it remains understudied whether it holds within a single species. Using parallel-laser photogrammetry, we conducted a 9-month study at Palenque National Park, Mexico, to investigate whether fundamental frequency (F0) or formant dispersion (AF) of roars and barks from 14 male black howler monkeys encode cues of body size, and whether they are in a trade-off with testicular volume. We found that only roar AF was associated with body size, with larger males producing roars with lower AF, suggesting a likely use of roars in male-male competition or female mate choice in black howlers. In contrast, after accounting for the positive effect of body size on testicular volume, no association was found between these vocal features and testicular volume. Our results show the presence of acoustic allometry within roars of male black howlers and suggest the absence of a trade-off within a single species, despite its presence at the genus level.

AB When encountering an approaching predator, prey often must decide on an optimal distance for escape, measured as flight initiation distance (FID). As a fundamental behavioural indicator, FID has been widely measured in many species, and many biological or environmental factors have been found to be associated with FID. However, the effect of flock size on FID remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a phylogenetic meta-analysis using 142 effect sizes (based on 7666 measurements) from 99 avian species to explore the global trend of the effect of flock size on FID in birds, as well as the role of several biological and environmental factors in shaping the flock size effect. Generally, the overall effect size (weighted average) did not significantly differ from zero, with significant heterogeneity existing among effect sizes. Birds of larger body size, with a larger maximum flock size or living in nontropical regions tended to exhibit a more positive relationship between flock size and FID. Compared to passerines, waders exhibited a more positive relationship between flock size and FID. We detected significant between-taxon differences in ecological correlates of the flock size effect. For waders, body size, maximum flock size and hand-wing index were positively associated with the flock size effect on FID. For passerines, however, none of the explanatory factors played a significant role in shaping the relationship between flock size and FID. Our results suggest that the effect of flock size on FID is largely context dependent and may be influenced or even overridden by effects of other confounding factors. We also detected a publication bias, with studies reporting nonsignificant effects and those having smaller sample sizes less likely to be published.

AB Males can bias insemination and fertilization in their favour by guarding females. In some species, males physically constrain females, while in others, female movement is not as directly controlled. In the Pacific field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus, some males produce the same calling song used in long-distance mate attraction after spermatophore transfer, even though they cannot mate again. We tested the idea that this postcopulatory song serves as a mate-guarding tactic. Females that heard postcopulatory song were more likely to stay close to the male and retain their spermatophore, thus increasing the likelihood of the male fertilizing their clutch. To our knowledge, our results provide the first evidence of postcopulatory song in T. oceanicus and suggest that it may be an effective mate-guarding tactic.

AB Human activities and infrastructures can disturb wildlife and alter their behaviour by triggering antipredator responses such as changes in time allocation to different behaviours. For instance, disturbance sources like traffic can cause significant variation in allocation of time to vigilance and foraging behaviours, which can be used as sensitive measures of the effects of human disturbance on animals. Such changes may ultimately result in physiological and ecological costs for the species. We used a unique opportunity to obtain direct behavioural observations of European wildcats, Felis silvestris, in the Cantabrian Mountains (northwest Spain) to investigate how different sources of anthropogenic disturbance influence time allocation of wildcats to specific behaviours. We also analysed how traffic affects hunting and vigilance time budgets as well as hunting success. We found that wildcats allocated more time to being alert and less time to hunting, feeding and moving in the presence of humans than in undisturbed situations. Wildcats also allocated more time to hunting when traffic levels were high, near roads and further from villages. Similarly, they dedicated more time to vigilance behaviours while feeding in the presence of moving vehicles. Finally, hunting success in the presence of vehicles seemed to decrease more for female wildcats than for males although this effect was not significant. In conclusion, humans and traffic influence the behaviour of wildcats inhabiting pastoral anthropogenic landscapes, although it is difficult to know to what extent such changes may translate into demographic effects.

AB Birds are known to be highly social and visual animals. Yet no specific visual feature has been identified to be responsible for individual recognition in birds. Here, using a differential looking paradigm across five experiments, we demonstrated that African penguins, Spheniscus demersus, spontaneously discriminated between life-size photographs of their monogamous, lifelong partner and a nonpartner colonymate using their ventral dot patterns. Our findings challenge the assumption of limited visual involvement in penguin communication and suggest a rather complex and flexible recognition process in these birds. The combination of our current results and previous findings, which showed cross-modal (visual/auditory) recognition in these animals, suggests that African penguins use their ventral dot patterns to individually recognize their colonymates. Our results provide the first evidence of a specific visual cue responsible for spontaneous individual recognition by a bird, and highlight the importance of considering all sensory modalities in the study of animal communication.

AB Many studies demonstrate that urban noise interferes with animal communication by masking acoustic signals such as birdsong, but the functional consequences of impaired communication are still not well understood. Song is a long-distance signal that functions to attract a mate and defend a territory, so a reduction in communication distance could negatively influence a male's reproductive or competitive success. Reduced territorial success could manifest as more frequent territorial intrusions, reduced ter-ritory quality or reduced territory size. Although many bird species sing at higher amplitude in noise pollution, communication distance is still reduced in noisy urban soundscapes. Therefore, we examined the relationship between communication distance and territory size for male white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys, across an urban-rural gradient in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, U.S.A., in Spring 2021. We mapped territories and calculated territory size as the 75% utilization distribution using a kernel density estimator. We measured the song amplitude as well as territory background and ambient noise levels, which we then used to calculate the communication distance of each song. We found that the communication distance of a bird's songs significantly predicted his territory size, such that birds with shorter communication distance tended to have smaller territories. This suggests that communication distance may influence the size of songbird territories. In keeping with this trend, urban birds had significantly smaller territories than rural birds. This finding strengthens our understanding of the link between communication and its fitness-related functions, an important frontier in the study of birdsong. It also underlines the potential complexity of the impacts of the anthropogenic soundscape upon animal behaviour.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   COMMUNICATION
AB Many animals produce vocal signals during agonistic interactions that convey their ability and motiva-tion to escalate the conflict. Often, such disputes follow ritualized, sequential phases with increasing aggression, favouring the assessment of individuals' chances of winning. This allows for individuals to withdraw before getting involved in a serious fight. Birds are well known for the variety of information encoded in their vocalizations, sometimes including specific features that signal aggression. A particular case may be so-called 'tret calls' produced by chiffchaffs, Phylloscopus collybita, a song affix for which the communicative role is not well understood. Here, we describe the acoustic structure and use of tret calls during simulated conflicts using playback. Our results show that tret calls are a low-amplitude vocali-zation and that birds increased tret calling after playback stimulation, suggesting a role as an aggressive signal similar to soft song in other species. However, we did not find that the tret call rate predicted subsequent aggressive behaviour. Our analysis of song variation in response to playback suggested that birds respond to a simulated vocal competitor in two phases: a highly aggressive phase where syllable rate goes up, which is predictive of physical attack, while simultaneously tret call rate goes down, and a low-aggression phase, in which tret call rate goes up, while syllable rate returns to baseline levels. These stereotypic fluctuations in two acoustic features may be part of an advanced communication system to moderate aggression. Finally, our results show a seasonal increase in tret calling after birds arrive at their breeding grounds, which is in line with a role in territorial aggression. We also found a nonsignificant trend for more tret calls with increasing ambient noise levels, which may be due to increased stress and aggression under noisy conditions or reflect a masking avoidance strategy.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Courtship displays are dramatic examples of complex behaviours that vary within and among species. Evolutionary explanations for this diversity rely upon genetic variation, but the heritability of complex phenotypes depends critically on the context in which a phenotype is measured and is seldom investigated in the field. Here, we estimate two measures of heritable variation, repeatability and genomic heritability, in the advertisement songs of wild singing mice. The measures are largely concordant and exhibit an intuitive and striking pattern: we find high repeatability and heritability for spectral characteristics linked to vocal morphology and lower repeatability and heritability for measures of motivation, like song duration and rate. Our results illustrate how advances in genomics and quantitative genetics can be integrated in free-living species to address longstanding challenges in behaviour and evolution. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Personality is now recognized as an ecologically and evolutionarily significant phenomenon because it can affect fitness directly. However, empirical studies specifically tackling the importance of personality in the processes of adaptive divergence and speciation are scarce. Whether selection favours plasticity or canalization of personality traits in specific contexts and how ecological conditions affect the presence and the structure of personalities remain to be elucidated. We used five populations of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, chosen along a gradient of genetic and phenotypic divergence: an anadromous pop-ulation supposedly close to the ancestral population and two pairs of sympatric lake morphs. Fish were raised individually from eggs in a common garden experiment to specifically assess the genetic bases of the boldness trait in these populations. Thirty-two individuals per morph were repeatedly tested at 11 months old in an open field test with a shelter to assess boldness. The repeatability of the boldness trait (i.e. personality), within-and among-individual variation and temporal variation were assessed within each population. Then, the temporal plasticity in boldness and boldness mean score were assessed among populations. The results show differences between populations for the three variables, with the highest repeatability in the most diverged population, an increase in boldness over time and a lower mean value (especially the first time they were exposed to the novel environment) in the anadromous population. This suggests that boldness and temporal plasticity differ between the anadromous popu-lation and the more diverged lake populations under a controlled embryonic/juvenile environment. Further research is needed to verify the contribution of temporal plasticity for personality traits in the context of rapid adaptive radiation such as that seen in Arctic charr.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Within populations, there commonly exists consistent among-individual differences in behaviour. As a potential mechanism maintaining this variation, the pace-of-life-syndrome (POLS) hypothesis posits that consistent differences in the behaviour of individuals (i.e. 'personality') are intercorrelated and have coevolved with consistent individual differences in metabolism and life-history traits. Here, using adult male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, we tested under laboratory conditions (1) whether behavioural and metabolic traits vary consistently among individuals over time (<= 7 days) and (2) the POLS prediction that repeatable behavioural traits should be intercorrelated with each other and with repeatable metabolic rate at the among-individual level. Furthermore, based on indicator models of sexual selection, we ex-pected that sexually selected male colour ornamentation would predict individual personality and metabolic rate. We repeatedly assayed three behavioural traits (sociability, boldness, exploration) and three metabolic traits (resting metabolic rate, maximal metabolic rate, aerobic scope) in a set of males that varied in body size and colour ornamentation. All behavioural trait measures were repeatable, consistent with individual personality. Of the three metabolic traits, only resting metabolic rate (RMR) was repeatable. Behavioural trait measures were significantly intercorrelated and thus integrated in a behavioural syndrome. More 'proactive' males were bolder, more exploratory and more sociable than 'reactive' ones. However, contrary to the POLS hypothesis, RMR was not significantly correlated with any of the behavioural trait measures, suggesting that consistent individual differences in RMR do not drive or support differences in personality, or vice versa. Male colour ornamentation did not covary with behaviour or RMR and thus does not appear to be a reliable predictor of either behavioural or metabolic phenotypes. We therefore did not find any compelling support for the POLS hypothesis, suggesting that individual differences in metabolism do not underlie the evolution and maintenance of among -individual behavioural variation in our study population.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB With 68% of the world's population expected to live in cities by 2050, it is crucial to understand how animals respond to urbanization. Urban areas are associated with changes in microclimate, light, noise and human activity, which can affect animal physiology, behaviour and fitness. In particular, urbanization may affect how parents allocate time and energy between parental care and self-maintenance. In birds, a critical aspect of parental care is incubation, where parents must maintain egg temperatures for suc-cessful offspring development. However, incubation is energetically costly, and anthropogenic distur-bances may affect parental decisions related to this cost. Determining whether urbanization affects incubation is crucial for understanding the differences between urban and nonurban populations in their reproductive performance and fitness. We measured incubation behaviour and egg temperature in one urban and one forest population of great tits, a uniparental incubator, using temperature loggers. We found that, compared to forest females, urban females spent more time incubating, took shorter off -bouts and ended their last daily off-bouts at a later hour. Furthermore, time spent off the nest, the number and duration of off-bouts and daily start of activity were related to ambient temperature; start of activity was related to clutch size; and time spent off the nest was related to the day of incubation. Despite urban females spending more time on the nest, eggs of both forest and urban females experi-enced relatively similar average egg temperatures, and urban eggs tended to experience greater vari-ability in egg temperature. Furthermore, there were no differences between sites for any fitness-related offspring variable. Our results suggest that urbanization can influence the thermal environment of developing avian offspring by causing urban adults to be inefficient incubators through increased activity off the nest in the evening, differences in nest insulation and/or suboptimal incubation behaviour compared to forest counterparts.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In social species, individuals maximize the benefits of group living by remaining cohesive and coor-dinating their actions. Communication is key to collective action, including ensuring that group members move together; individuals often produce signals when attempting to lead a group to a new area. However, the function of these signals, and how responses to them are affected by intrinsic characteristics of the caller and extrinsic factors, has rarely been experimentally tested. We conducted a series of field-based playback experiments with habituated wild dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, a cooperatively breeding and territorial species, to investigate follower responses to movement calls. In our first experiment, we found that focal individuals were more likely to respond to playback of 'movement calls' than control 'close calls', indicating movement calls function as recruitment signals. In a second experiment, we found that focal individuals responded similarly to the movement calls of dominant and subordinate groupmates, suggesting that dominance status (an intrinsic factor) does not influence receiver responses. In a final experiment, we found that individuals responded to the simulated presence of a rival group, but that this outgroup conflict (an extrinsic factor) did not affect responses to movement calls compared to a control situation. This may be because attention is instead focused on the potential presence of an imminent threat. By using playbacks to isolate the acoustic signal from physical movement cues, our results provide experimental evidence of how movement calls help leaders to attract followers and thus adds to our understanding of recruitment signals more generally.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Song has been extensively studied in birds and is considered a classic example of a sexually selected trait. However, this interpretation is based predominantly on studies of males. There is growing evidence that female song is common and phylogenetically widespread, but there are still relatively few species for which song similarities and differences between the sexes have been described. We investigated the function of female and male song in the lovely fairy-wren, Malurus amabilis, a tropical species that maintains territories year-round. We tested whether song structure and sex-specific seasonal variation in song rates across breeding and nonbreeding stages were consistent with expectations of key hypotheses for song function. We did this with temporarily caged and free-living birds. We also experimentally examined female and male responses to simulated territorial intrusion, using playbacks simulating solo intruders of either sex singing songs that varied in complexity (i.e. the variety of elements in song). Females and males had similar song structure, complexity and natural song rates and both sang more during nonbreeding than breeding periods. Within each breeding stage, males sang more than females during incubation, a period of female-only investment in parental care. Both sexes sang more when they were more than 5 m apart than when close together in their dense tropical habitat. Females and males responded similarly to simulated intrusion and coordinated their responses. They responded more strongly to male than female song playbacks and to simple playback songs after they were exposed to complex songs, during both breeding and nonbreeding periods. Our observational and experimental data show that female and male songs are similar and suggest that convergent selective pressures may explain similar functions of song, primarily in joint territorial defence of resources and within-pair communication for coordination.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Maras, Dolichotis patagonum, combine social monogamy and plural breeding, an unusual mating system for mammals. We tested how maras adapt to the forced separation of pair-bonded partners and how the potential new mates perform over the breeding season and during the process of forming new pairs. Fourteen established pairs from a captive population were randomly assigned to a control (C-group; N = 7) or an experimental (E-group; N = 7) condition. The experiment consisted of replacing seven paired males with seven socially unfamiliar males (new potential mates). Individual behaviour and social interactions were recorded over a 6-month period (spring-summer; i.e. 14 sessions) from 0800 to 1800 hours, totalling 11 hourly sampling points per session. We measured pair behaviours and degree of general behavioural synchrony over sessions 1-7 (early) and over sessions 8-14 (late). We also measured how social disruption affected the social networking of individuals forming new pair bonds as compared to individuals with established mates. We furthermore assessed the level of activity of females exposed to mate switching and the production of offspring over the breeding season. In the E-group, maras showed a reduction in pair behaviours and synchronization of activities. There were also multiple interactions among females with several males, revealing initial mate choice activity during the early time period. The period of mate choice was characterized by instability in social networking and changes in the strength of a pair's fidelity. Although the E-group included five newly established pairs, offspring production was similar to that of the C-group. Our findings show that after presumably stressful experimental social disruption, most maras re-paired in captivity, although with some delay in offspring production, suggesting that this species has the plasticity to cope with male partner loss under semi controlled environmental conditions. However, the strength of monogamous bonds was affected by this social disruption. (C) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Food provisioning promotes close interaction with wildlife but can negatively impact the targeted species. Repeated behavioural disruptions have the potential to negatively impact vital rates and have population level consequences. In Bunbury, Western Australia, food-provisioned female bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, suffer reduced reproductive success via lower calf survival. However, the proximal causes of this long-term negative effect remain unknown. To infer processes that could lead to fitness costs, we combined network analyses, Markov Chain, regression models and kernel density estimates to evaluate the social environment, behavioural budget and home range size of provisioned dolphins relative to their nonprovisioned counterparts. We found that provisioned dolphins spent significantly less time socializing and had smaller home ranges and weaker social associations than the nonprovisioned dolphins. Overall, these findings suggest that provisioned dolphins experience a more restricted social environment among themselves, which likely results from investing time in an unnatural foraging tactic around the provisioning site, in proximity to human activities. This modified social environment associated with food provisioning and begging behaviour, reinforced by the limited time spent socializing, could affect the opportunities of calves of provisioned females to acquire fitness enhancing skills and form essential social bonds. This study highlights the need to consider the potential impact of human activities on the social environment of animals.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many songbird species, young birds learn their song from adult conspecifics. Like much animal communication, birdsong is multimodal: singing is accompanied by beak and body movements. We hypothesized that these visual cues could enhance vocal learning thus partly explaining the reduced learning from unimodal audio playbacks compared to multimodal live social tutoring observed in many birdsong studies. To test this, juvenile zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were tutored in a yoked design where replicate tutoring groups of three male-female dyads were exposed to the same live tutor simultaneously in three different ways. (1) Tutees were housed with the tutor in a central compartment; hence they could hear, see and interact with their tutor ('live'). (2) Tutees placed in one of two adjacent compartments could hear but not see the same tutor from behind a black loudspeaker cloth ('audio only'). (3) Tutees could likewise hear the tutor through loudspeaker cloth but could also see the tutor through a one-way mirror ('audiovisual'). Comparisons of subadult and adult song showed more changes in the audio-only than in the audiovisual or live tutored tutees, suggesting the audio-only group's song development was delayed. According to (blinded) human observer similarity scoring, the audio-only tutees' singing was least similar and the live tutees' singing most similar to their tutor's singing, while the audiovisual tutees showed an intermediate level of similarity, but the between-treatment differences in similarity were not significant. Conversely, the audio-only group showed the highest similarity values with their father's song, which they only heard before the experimental tutoring. Given that the quantity and quality of the tutor song input were the same across treatments within tutoring groups, the results support the hypothesis that visual in addition to auditory exposure to a tutor can affect the timing and possibly also the amount of vocal learning.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Begging behaviour can provide information on offspring hunger levels and be used by parents to adjust food provisioning efforts. In cooperative breeders, helpers also provide care by feeding the young. However, how helpers of different sex and relatedness to the offspring respond to begging behaviour has rarely been studied in cooperatively breeding species, which limits our understanding of the indirect and/or direct benefits that helpers may obtain by responding to offspring demand. Here, we used a cooperatively breeding bird, the sociable weaver, Philetairus socius, to investigate how nest intervisit intervals of breeders and different types of helpers, distinguished by sex and relatedness, varied with acoustic begging. Moreover, we tested whether these different classes of provisioners experienced distinct levels of begging. Our results show that only breeding males, but not breeding females or helpers of any sex and relatedness to the nestlings, returned faster to the nest to feed after experiencing more begging calls. When contrasted directly, we confirmed a statistically supported difference in responses to begging between male and female breeders. Surprisingly, second-order relatives experienced more begging calls than the other classes of more related helpers and breeders. These results show that we might find differences in how provisioners respond to begging levels when classifying group members according to their potential fitness gains. In sociable weavers, the benefits and costs of adjusting feeding efforts to begging seem to differ with sex and life history stage. Experimental and more detailed investigations on begging-feeding interactions are necessary to understand the origin and prevalence of these differences across cooperatively breeding systems.

AB In several mammal species, bachelor groups occur as a regular life history stage between dispersal and becoming the breeding male of a multifemale group. How such groups come into existence and how males that choose this strategy differ in life history traits from other males is rarely investigated. Males of the socially flexible African striped mouse, Rhabdomys pumilio, have been historically reported to adopt one of three alternative tactics: small group-living philopatric males, intermediate solitary roaming males or large group-living territorial males. Here, we describe for the first time, bachelors as a fourth male tactic. A long-term study on 13 generations of striped mice revealed two types of bachelor groups: (1) kin bachelor groups formed when all females disappeared, probably due to predation, and (2) nonkin bachelor groups formed by unrelated males that originated from different groups. Whereas kin bachelor groups occurred more frequently during the nonbreeding season, nonkin bachelor groups were most common in the breeding season and had a shorter tenure, since most of these males soon switched to the solitary roaming tactic or the territorial breeder tactic. Importantly, we found that nonkin bachelors were heavier and older than kin bachelors and that they did not differ from solitary roaming males in body mass and age. We therefore identified two different forms of bachelor groups, small kin bachelors whose female group members disappeared and larger nonkin bachelor groups showing traits of an alternative reproductive tactic.

AB When animals are misguided by evolved behavioural cues to preferentially make mistakes, they are caught in an evolutionary trap. Aquatic insects rely heavily on polarized light cues to locate bodies of water necessary for oviposition and mating. However, where artificial objects (e.g. asphalt, buildings) are at least as effective at polarizing light as natural water bodies, aquatic insects may instead prefer to oviposit on those surfaces where there eggs fail to hatch. These objects are known to create evolutionary traps by polarizing light in the visible range (390-700 nm), yet their potential for creating evolutionary traps via the reflection of ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths (<380 nm) remains largely unknown. We surveyed the natural and artificial environment to understand the properties of objects that can polarize natural and artificial sources of UV light and conducted a multiple-choice field experiment to test the importance of UV polarized light in guiding habitat selection behaviour in six families of aquatic insects. We found that UV polarized light was associated with natural water bodies, was a common component of the man-made environment created by sunlight reflecting off vehicles, buildings and solar panels during the day, and originating from lamplight with a UV component at night. One of the six families of aquatic insects we examined was preferentially attracted only to UV polarized light sources, indicating that UV polarized light is a cue used in habitat selection. These results highlight a quantitatively new type of ecological light pollution capable of creating evolutionary traps for polarotactic insects at night, or even during the day.

ID SOCIAL INFORMATION; PUBLIC INFORMATION; CULTURE; PHYSIOLOGY; TRADITIONS
AB Female mate choice copying is a form of social learning wherein females preferentially mate with partners similar to those they had previously observed mating with other females. The phenomenon is well established in many vertebrate species and some arthropods. Among insects, only one species, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, has been shown to perform female mate choice copying under experimental conditions using two artificial male phenotypes (males dusted with powders of different colours). Moreover, this species has been shown to be capable of maintaining mate choice traditions, at least in laboratory conditions. In the present study, however, we failed to obtain unambiguous support for the claim that virgin female Drosophila ('observers') tend to prefer males of the same artificial phenotype as that chosen by another female ('demonstrator'). The discrepancy is probably because our experiments differed in a number of seemingly minor details from the published experimental procedures. The results indicate that female mate choice copying in Drosophila is probably less robust than the present body of literature suggests, and that more research is needed to assess the prevalence of this phenomenon in different laboratory lines and natural populations of fruit flies.

AB Despite mass movements of insects being documented for decades, whether dragonflies migrate in Europe has not yet been experimentally tested. Similarly, little is known about the influence of weather on the movement decisions and intensity of dragonflies. Taking advantage of large movements of dragonflies along the Baltic Sea coast of Latvia, we investigated whether European dragonflies showed directed movements indicative of migratory behaviour and how weather influences their movements. First, we performed orientation tests with individual dragonflies of two commonly captured species, Aeshna mixta and Sympetrum vulgatum, to determine whether dragonflies showed directed flight and whether flight direction differed from wind direction. Both A. mixta and S. vulgatum displayed a uniform mean southward orientation, which differed from the prevailing overhead wind direction, indicating migratory behaviour. Second, we investigated the influence of weather conditions on the abundance of dragonflies captured. Differences in flight behaviour in relation to weather conditions were observed between A. mixta and the two smaller Sympetrum species (S. vulgatum and S. sanguineum). Generally, temperature, cloud cover and wind direction were the most important predictors for dragonfly abun-dance, with temperature positively, and cloud cover negatively, influencing abundance. Aeshna mixta appeared to select favourable tail winds (northerlies), whereas abundance of Sympetrum increased with more easterly winds. Our results provide important information on the influence of local weather conditions on the flight behaviour of dragonflies, as well as evidence of dragonfly migration along the Baltic coast.

AB We develop a game-theoretic model to explore the question of whether two animals should cooperate in the dangerous activity of obtaining a rich and essential resource. We consider variation in the risks incurred to individuals and in how the activities of the two animals interact to influence the probability of success. We also consider that the animals may be relatives and thus share evolutionary interests. The model is general and can, for instance, be applied to mammalian predators attempting to capture and subdue large and dangerous prey or to female parasitoid wasps that attack and, if successful, paralyse aggressive hosts that then provide the only feeding resource for their offspring. This minimal model of cooperation contains three dimensionless parameters: vulnerability (the ratio between the average time for a lone attacker to subdue the defending resource and the average time for the defender to fatally strike the attacker), the dilution ratio (the extent to which attack by animals acting in tandem reduces a defender's ability to kill its attackers) and the relatedness between the potential attackers. The model predicts that higher values of all three parameters favour cooperation and that for small values cooperation is not evolutionarily stable. Cooperation can arise from an ancestral state of non-cooperation if values of all parameters are sufficiently high but cannot arise among non-relatives, irrespective of other parameter values. Once cooperation has emerged in a population, it can be maintained among nonrelatives at modest values of dilution ratio and vulnerability. We discuss these general predictions in particular relation to the parasitoid genus Sclerodermus, in which multiple females may attack unusually large and aggressive hosts and in which host attack behaviour is mediated by kinship.

AB Many groups of vertebrates produce distress calls when attacked by predators as a last attempt to survive. However, few studies investigate whether recognition of distress calls involves learning or acoustic similarity to familiar calls. This study assesses the importance of these two factors as well as phylogenetic relatedness in distress call recognition by tropical rainforest birds. We measured the avian community responses to familiar and unfamiliar distress calls in a lowland tropical rainforest in Costa Rica using playbacks of a sympatric species, the orange-billed sparrow, Arremon aurantiirostris, and a closely related allopatric species, the white-eared ground-sparrow, Melozone leucotis. In addition, to test whether recognition is driven by phylogenetic relatedness to the call sender, we compared the phylogenetic distance of approaching individuals to A. aurantiirostris when using different playback stimuli. We found that individuals called back to sympatric and allopatric calls within similar amounts of time, supporting the role of acoustic similarity in distress call recognition. We also found that individuals approached faster and spent more time inside the observation zone for sympatric distress calls than for allopatric distress calls, and both responses were stronger than the response to white noise (control), which supports the roles of acoustic similarity and learning in distress call recognition. Sympatric distress calls elicited approaching reactions from species that were more closely related to the sympatric species than did white noise, which suggests that phylogenetically related species are more likely to identify and respond to the sympatric distress signaller, while white noise elicited responses from a random subset of species that were on average more distantly related to the sympatric signaller. We conclude that learning, acoustic similarity and phylogenetic relatedness play important roles in the response to distress calls.

AB Divergent selection is a powerful driver of speciation and has been widely studied in relation to the physical characters of organisms. Behavioural traits also significantly contribute to the evolutionary processes of divergence. However, studying such effects is fraught with difficulties as the development of behavioural traits is likely to be complex and is moulded by ontogenetic processes such as shifts in habitat use. Here we explored how several aspects of juvenile behavioural variation may relate to adaptive divergence in a freshwater fish. We assessed whether and how juveniles of two recently evolved, sympatric morphs of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, a small benthivorous and a planktivorous charr, show genetically based differences in personality that conform to their respective ecological niches, and whether these differences could contribute to reproductive isolation by generating maladaptive hybrid behaviours. Studying three aspects of behavioural variation (average trait value, consistent individual differences and trait correlations), we assessed the sociality and risk-taking propensity of hybrids and pure-morph offspring reared in common conditions. While no difference in average behavioural responses could be observed, the hybrids tended to show less repeatable behaviours and were not intermediate for behavioural syndromes that appear to differ between the two morphs. These results provide limited evidence of personality trait divergence among polymorphic fish, and suggest subtle, nonadditive effects of hybridization on the development of such traits.

AB Niche partitioning among different age, breeding status or sex classes allows resource use to be maximized while reducing intraspecific competition. Individual specialization marks the finest scale of niche partitioning where, within a species, individuals differ in their realized niches. Despite having important implications in ecology, evolution and conservation, studies simultaneously addressing the occurrence of both phenomena are scarce. We studied niche partitioning and individual specialization in foraging behaviour in relation to age, breeding status and sex using breeding, nonbreeding adult and immature Scopoli's shearwaters, Calonectris diomedea, in Minorca (Balearic Is.) during chick rearing in 2017 with GPS loggers and stable isotopes. Compared to adults, immature birds seemed to exploit a larger area at the population level, possibly to avoid competition. We found similar levels of individual specialization in immature and adult birds, which suggests the former have well-defined foraging strategies prior to prospecting the colony. For breeding status, we did not find niche partitioning or differences in individual specialization, suggesting nest attachment and pair bonds also lead to central-place foraging in nonbreeding adults. Male breeders showed greater individual specialization than female breeders in trip characteristics. At the same time, individual specialization in isotopic diet was higher in females than in males. These opposite patterns are possibly driven by a greater use of fishery discards by males, which would underlie their individual strategies of following vessels, resulting in a highly variable diet, since discarded prey types vary more than naturally accessible prey. Our results suggest that seabirds acquire individual strategies early in life and, once they are sexually mature, breeding constraints do not result in differences in feeding behaviour between breeders and nonbreeders. Finally, we showed that sexual differences in individual specialization can apparently emerge even in slightly dimorphic species sharing breeding duties.

AB In environments where females mate multiply, males should adjust their behaviour and physiology in response to the perceived level of sperm competition to maximize their fitness. Evidence of such plasticity has been found in several laboratory and field studies, but little is known about the cues stimulating these responses in natural populations. One way in which males appear to assess sperm competition risk is through encounter rates with conspecific males. Such encounter rates may be driven by the spatial distribution of resources required by males (i.e. food patches or potential mates), which in turn affects local density. However, explicit links between resource distribution, male encounter rates and shifts in behaviour related to sperm competition have not been demonstrated. We found that when group size of Drosophila melanogaster males was held constant, a small decrease in the distance between patches of food resources had striking effects on male behaviour. Compared to those from dispersed resources, males on clustered resources had a significantly reduced intermale distance (and hence encounter rate) and subsequently a longer noncompetitive copulation duration, previously shown to be a reliable indicator of male perception of sperm competition risk. The aggregation of resources, operating via increased encounter rate, can stimulate shifts in behaviour affecting male sperm competition performance. Given that the spatial distribution of resources is typically variable in natural populations (and often unpredictable), selection is likely to favour the evolution of plasticity in sexual behaviour where resource aggregation increases the probability of sperm competition.

AB Quantifying the direction and strength of mate preference is essential to improve our understanding of sexual selection. Experimental designs, however, often do not consider how individuals evaluate and compare the available options, which may affect the results significantly. Preferences are often assumed to be absolute, with individuals assigning a fixed, absolute value to a cue or potential partner they encounter. However, individuals may instead also compare the available options, in which case the social context plays an essential role in the preference for each potential partner. Here we investigated the importance of considering the choosers' evaluation process in mate preference tests. Using a mate preference study on wild great tit, Parus major, heterozygosity, breast stripe size and yellowness as a case study, we tested whether individuals use absolute or comparative mate preferences. We analysed how the perceived average attractiveness and the variation in attractiveness of the group of potential mates affected the measured preference functions. We found that the average attractiveness of the stimulus groups affected the total time individuals spent visiting all stimulus birds, and that the variation in attractiveness within groups affected the measured preference slopes. This indicates that the social context will affect the measured responses to stimulus groups, and that great tits may use both absolute and comparative evaluation. Considering how a study species encounters and evaluates potential mates and how the social environment may affect preferences is essential when choosing an appropriate experimental design to obtain reliable measurements of mate preferences. We therefore strongly advise future studies to consider not only the absolute stimulus trait values, but also the context in which they are presented. The ability to quantify preferences accurately will increase our understanding of mate preferences, mate choice and ultimately sexual selection.

AB Temporary associations with conspecifics provide critical opportunities for the acquisition and development of socioecological skills, especially in species where these interaction opportunities are not readily available. In fact, social interactions can have far-reaching consequences for the cultural and communicative repertoire on both the species and population level. However, to what extent interaction rates are linked to association patterns, which depend on individual and ecological factors, is often overlooked. Here, we examined the sources of variation in immatures' social behaviour, in relation to both activity and partner type, in one Sumatran (Suaq) and one Bornean population (Tuanan) of wild orang-utans (Pongo spp.) that are known to differ in sociability. Specifically, we examined to what extent the time spent in social interactions and with specific social partners was related to study population, but also individual (e.g. age), ecological (food availability) and social variables (e.g. presence of specific associates). Overall, we found that study population and the presence of specific associates (siblings, peers, adult males) had a profound effect on the occurrence of different social activities, while local variation in food availability did not appear to play a major role. Although proportions of time spent in interactions was overall higher at Suaq, we found no difference between the two sites regarding the use of interaction opportunities when partners were available. Begging was mainly directed at mothers, whereas peers and older siblings served primarily as play partners, and unflanged males were frequent targets of social gazing. Our study suggests that orang-utan infants use interaction opportunities differently depending on social partners and interaction type. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Pattern formation and collective behaviour in animal aggregations is highly complex and occurs across many scales, over a wide range of environmental conditions. The patterns found in collective behaviour may be modulated by the environmental habitat in which a group is located. Here, we consider whether habitat context influences the collective behaviour of fish schools under threat of predation in a dynamic salt marsh system. By comparing collective responses of wild forage fish prior to and during predator attack across three environmental contexts, we examine whether schooling state is influenced by the habitat that fish schools reside in. Our results indicate that habitat context had a much stronger effect on collective state relative to predation. The habitats studied (both a marsh edge habitat and a higher complexity habitat) induced changes in the behavioural state of fish schools compared to a free-field context, which demonstrates an alteration of the collective behaviours performed by the school. This suggests that other ecological factors, such as the local environment, plays a larger role than predation risk in structuring the spatial and temporal group level patterns found in collective behaviour.

AB Toxic or noxious prey often signal their unpalatability through aposematic coloration, and the evolution of aposematism has become a model system in evolutionary behaviour. Aposematic colours are not only easily recognized by predators, but, for many predators, aposematism enhances learning and memory retention. In this study, we used a visually oriented, insectivorous agamid lizard, Diploderma swinhonis, to test whether aposematic coloration enhances lizards' ability to detect and remember distasteful prey. We exposed lizards to quinine-flavoured crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, that were dyed with colours generally regarded as aposematic (red) and nonaposematic (green). After a single exposure, lizards readily learned to reject both red and green crickets, but in subsequent trials they were more hesitant to attack red than green ones. However, the lizards remembered both types of prey for up to 60 days and showed a similarly high rate of generalizing that aversion from coloured to noncoloured crickets. Our results demonstrate that visually hunting lizards exhibit nuanced patterns of learning and memory in foraging tasks and make ideal subjects for experimental work on aposematism.

AB In mammals characterized by a mating system in which a single male monopolizes reproduction, infanticide is reported to occur following a male take-over, often resulting in females returning to oestrus more rapidly than if their infant has survived. However, over the course of a 17-year study of golden snub-nosed monkeys, Rhinopithecus roxellana, a polygynous colobine species, we found no behavioural or suspected evidence of infanticide. Based on social network and genetic analyses, we found that more than half of the infants were sired as a result of extrapair matings (EPMs). Female golden snub-nosed monkeys initiated EPMs with bachelor or neighbouring resident males. These were considered 'sneaky' copulations because they did not occur in the presence of the leader male of the female's one-male unit (OMU). We suggest that through a process of paternity confusion, females decreased the likelihood of infanticide after a male take-over. In contrast, in a group of the same species in which the number of bachelor males was artificially reduced, EPMs were infrequent and four cases of infanticide were observed, three of them following a male take-over. Golden snub-nosed monkeys reside in a large multilevel society that develops by the fusion of several independent OMUs to form a breeding band, which is characterized by increased social cohesion and intrasexual tolerance among leader males. Females play an active role in mate choice, and engage in a diverse set of mating tactics, including counterstrategies such as EPMs to avoid infanticide. These results offer new insights into the diversity of behavioural strategies facilitated by complex social structures in nonhuman primates, as well as other social mammals. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Melanin is a common pigment that can indicate individual quality to potential mates and social dominance to competitors. For many avian species, plumage melanism varies within both males and females. If predictive of individual quality, sexual selection may drive contrasting expressions of melanism for each sex, reflecting their different reproductive roles. For an alpine population of horned larks, Eremophila alpestris, we investigated whether plumage ornament size and darkness predicted morphometric traits, parental care and fitness correlates, and we evaluated support for assortative pairing. Males with darker crowns and larger masks were associated with greater wing length and mass, respectively. Males with darker ornaments were paired with females that provisioned nestlings at a higher rate, began nesting earlier in the season, had larger clutch sizes and ultimately had greater nest success. For females, plumage ornaments did not predict morphometric traits (i.e. wing length, mass), provisioning rate of the male partner, clutch initiation date or reproductive success. Instead, females with darker crowns provisioned nestlings more frequently and had larger clutches. Overall darker males tended to pair with darker females, but plumage ornament size did not correlate within mated pairs. We demonstrate that: (1) the darkness of plumage ornaments is a better predictor of fitness than ornament size and (2) darker males are associated with greater individual quality and reproductive investment of the female mate, while female darkness primarily predicts reproductive investment. These results indicate the potential for sex-specific selection pressures and mate choice based on the predictive value of plumage melanism.

AB Animals often live within close proximity of multiple conspecific individuals, allowing them to eavesdrop on other animals' signalling interactions to guide their own social behaviours. For a young animal that is learning to vocalize, eavesdropping on vocal interactions between adults may provide a rich source of information: young animals might preferentially learn vocalizations that are commonly heard in interactions between adults or that are heard to be effective for attracting mates or defending resources. We used a multispeaker playback experiment with wild Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, to test the hypothesis that vocal learning is guided by eavesdropping. Over a 6-year period, we tutored young Savannah sparrows with experimental tutor songs; half of the tutor songs were broadcast in simulated vocal interactions between two tutors, and the other half were broadcast as noninteractive, stand-alone solo performances. If eavesdropping plays an important role in guiding vocal learning, we predicted that young birds would preferentially learn the vocalizations heard during interactions between tutors. In contrast to our prediction, young Savannah sparrows did not preferentially learn interactive tutor songs; birds were similarly likely to learn songs heard in an interactive context (N = 13) and in a noninteractive context (N = 17). Analysis of live adult tutors' reactions to the loudspeakers showed that they responded with similar vocal behaviour during interactive and noninteractive treatments, and therefore their vocal behaviour did not compromise the playback simulation. We conclude that eavesdropping on vocal interactions between tutors does not appear to be essential for vocal learning of wild Savannah sparrows.

AB Males in female-philopatric social groupings leave their natal groups to pursue successive reproductive opportunities in one or more other groups. In vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, adult males coexist and physical eviction is not a driver of male movement. Migratory decisions are expected to turn on an evaluation of future reproductive opportunity, as indexed principally by local operational sex ratio and relative competitive ability. Although vervet males' reproductive success is correlated with dominance, they are distinctive in that the attainment of rank is contingent on integration into female sociospatial networks and we expect decisions about continued residency to reflect this. We used 8 years' data from three groups to confirm that male dispersal between groups is seasonal in our population, with a peak that is coterminous with androgen levels and precedes peak mating and conception by 4 weeks. The average length of completed residency was 459 days, with an increase in the logged rate of departure after 1428 days, which is 150 days longer than the estimated modal age at first conception by putative daughters. There were positive correlations between a male's initial and highest rank, and between his highest rank and the length of time to reach it. We found that a male's residency was positively and independently associated with his highest achieved rank and both his grooming centrality and proximity degree. Additionally, increasing rank and proximity degree also had positive effects on residency length subsequent to the attainment of his highest rank. The probability of emigration was associated negatively with both female number and grooming centrality scores. We conclude that emigration from a group is linked to male rank attainment and mediated by a male's integration into female sociospatial networks. We found no evidence that emigration preceded the sexual maturity of putative daughters. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many species of anurans, males produce advertisement calls that function to attract reproductively active females. Rival males may use the public information in these calls to optimize their own tactics for acquiring mates. To see whether male cane toads, Rhinella marina, modify their mate-searching and amplexus behaviours in response to conspecific calls, we monitored toads in outdoor enclosures while playing recordings of advertisement calls, a biologically irrelevant stimulus with similar acoustic properties or silence. Male toads were seven times more likely to engage in amplexus and moved twice as much during a toad chorus than during the control sound or silence. Nonacoustic cues also influenced propensity to initiate amplexus, with males five to 16 times more likely to amplect a moving target than a stationary one (regardless of the sex of the animal being amplexed). Our study shows that male toads dramatically alter their behaviour in response to acoustic and visual information from conspecifics, suggesting that this public information holds substantial value to them as they seek to fine-tune their own reproductive tactics.

AB Communication is the foundation of all social systems, and learning is perhaps the most important cognitive tool. But how do these two critical faculties interact? With social insects being some of the best learners of the invertebrate world, and indisputably the most communicative, we examine the role of learning and experience in social insect communication. Learning plays a major role for both senders and receivers. A sender's experience can modulate what information is available for communication, whether communication is effective and whether individuals are motivated to communicate. Signalling about a resource is often modulated relative to the value of that resource and relative to the value of sharing information about it. The receiver's experience and knowledge can affect which parts of a signal's information content it attends to, how this information is acted on and, indeed, whether it attends to communication at all. Ultimately, while innate responses form the basis of social insect communication, learning is often a critical modulator of communication processes.

AB Navigation by terrestrial arthropods that wander away from a shelter in search of food or mates in uncluttered environments invariably relies on path integration mechanisms, which provide distance and direction information used to compute a straight-line return trajectory. Navigation in cluttered habitats is more typically visually guided, even in species that are nocturnal. Nocturnal, tropical arachnids in the order Amblypygi, however, depend neither on path integration nor on vision to navigate and are hypothesized to instead rely on highly sensitive olfactory structures. The distal articles of their antenniform legs are covered with receptors that presumably bind the odour stimuli thought to control, at least in part, their impressive ability to relocate a shelter after they wander in a rainforest understory. To test the hypothesis that olfactory inputs from the antenniform legs support their near-distance ability to localize a shelter, we conducted a laboratory experiment with the amblypygid Phrynus marginemaculatus in which an olfactory cue (with contact chemoreception precluded) identified the location of a shelter, the position of which was varied as subjects were trained. Localization of a shelter was readily learned and performance was fully retained over a 2-week period in which subjects were not trained. Localization of the odour-cued shelter declined markedly, however, when the distal articles of the antenniform legs were amputated. Moreover, the residual discrimination ability displayed by subjects when they were subsequently retrained depended on how many olfactory receptors had been removed. The results clearly demonstrate that odour cues can support near-distance goal localization and that receptors on the antenniform legs are the locus of the peripheral neural transduction necessary when odour is used to identify the position of a shelter.

AB Social information varies in its reliability and relevance, requiring individuals to use rules to avoid inappropriate responses to false information. A simple rule is to respond only when a certain number of individuals provide similar information. Although individuals within social groups can use such numerical rules to assess conspecific information and make consensus decisions, it is unknown whether individuals apply similar rules when assessing the value of heterospecific information. We consider the case of individuals eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls. Eavesdroppers may be particularly vulnerable to false alarms because of the large pool of potential callers and variability in the specific threats to which they call. Individuals might therefore value alarm calls more if they come from multiple callers or multiple species than from a single caller or a single species. We tested these predictions using field playback experiments on wild Australian magpies, Gymnorhina tibicen. Magpies responded more strongly to alarm calls coming from two callers versus one caller of the same heterospecific species. However, in contrast to our prediction, magpies responded similarly to alarm calls from two individuals of different species as they did to alarm calls from two individuals of the same species. We conclude that the number of calling individuals does affect response, probably because information from multiple callers is more reliable, but that the value or reliability of information from multiple species may depend on the types of alarm calls and combination of species involved.

   INFORMATION
AB Expertise consists of the features that allow individuals with extensive experience on a given complex task to show superior performance on that task compared to novices. While expertise has been investigated mostly in humans, it is highly relevant for other species as well because it can have strong effects on fitness. Moreover, studying expertise in nonhumans can help us understand human expertise. Several features that distinguish experts within their domain of expertise from novices include (1) greater long-term memory, (2) larger capacity of working memory, (3) better ability to focus attention on the most relevant concurrent tasks, (4) superior ability to anticipate, perceive and comprehend the relevant elements in one's surroundings, (5) quicker and better decisions, and (6) faster and more coordinated motor movements. The development of expertise follows a characteristic pattern of gradual improvement in performance over extended periods devoted to practising a given complex task. Heritable variation in a few traits can affect the rate of expertise acquisition and its peak levels. These traits include motivation to practise, perseverance, basic cognitive abilities such as attention span, working memory capacity, learning rates and memory retention, and various physiological, anatomical and morphological features. Key environmental factors influencing expertise development are parental and social settings, which may encourage investment in the extended practice necessary for achieving superior performance on complex tasks. Future work on the evolutionary biology of expertise should focus on the yet unknown neurobiological mechanisms that underlie it, heritable variation in the traits that enable expertise and their genetic basis, further quantifications of expertise acquisition in natural settings, the fitness consequences of the traits that facilitate top expert performance, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of expertise.

AB Animal movements govern most ecological interactions, from predation to reproduction and survival. How animals move through the environment depends on available sensory information. Some snakes are able to perceive infrared (IR) radiation in addition to visible light. Research on this sensory system has been almost exclusively focused on predation, and researchers have largely found that vision and IR compensate for each other when one or the other is absent. However, IR sensing likely has much broader functions, including navigation in the environment. Many features in the environment of pit vipers are both visually and thermally salient and could be used for orientation. Here, we tested how vision and IR sensing interact in sidewinder rattlesnakes, Crotalus cerastes, in a simple navigation task in the field. Unlike in a predatory context, IR sensing did not compensate for the lack of vision. Snake movement paths were more tortuous, and snakes were less likely to encounter landmarks when eyes where occluded but were unaffected when pit organs were occluded. These findings suggest that the interaction between visual and IR cues may depend on context, and have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of IR sensing.

AB Differential allocation occurs when individuals alter their reproductive investment based on their mate's traits. A previous study showed that male threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, reduced courtship towards females that had previously been exposed to predation risk compared to unexposed females. This suggests that males can detect a female's previous history with predation risk, but the mechanisms by which males assess a female's history are unknown. To determine whether males use chemical and/or visual cues to detect a female's previous history with predation risk, we compared rates of courtship behaviour in the presence of visual and/or olfactory cues of predator-exposed females versus unexposed females in a 2 x 2 factorial design. We found that males differentiate between unexposed and predator-exposed females using visual cues: regardless of the olfactory cues present, males performed fewer zigzags (a conspicuous courtship behaviour) when they were exposed to visual cues from predator-exposed females compared to unexposed females. However, males' response to olfactory cues changed over the course of the experiment: initially, males performed fewer courtship displays when they received olfactory cues of predator-exposed females compared to unexposed females, but they did not discriminate between cues from predator-exposed and unexposed females later in the experiment. A follow-up experiment found that levels of cortisol released by both predator-exposed and unexposed females decreased over the course of the experiment. If cortisol is linked to or correlated with olfactory cues of predation risk that are released by females, then this suggests that the olfactory cues became less potent over the course of the experiment. Altogether, these results suggest that males use both visual and olfactory cues to differentiate between unexposed and predator-exposed females, which may help ensure reliable communication in a noisy environment.

AB Call combinations allow animals to expand the communicative power of small repertoires with acoustically inflexible elements. In Campbell's monkeys, Cercopithecus campbelli, males possess a small repertoire of calls that can be merged to an acoustically invariable suffix and which are concatenated into various sequences, mainly in response to external disturbances. The vocal repertoire of adult females has been less well studied although it is much richer, containing both alarm and various social calls. In particular, females possess a low-pitched contact call, produced either alone or merged with a high-pitched, arched unit. Combined contact calls are identity-richer and easier to detect than simple calls. Here, we investigated the socioecological factors that determined the production of single and combined utterances and found that combined utterances were more common when identity was relevant such as in mixed-species associations and during socially important vocal exchanges. In contrast, single calls were used mainly when predation risk was high, as part of this species' generally cryptic antipredator strategy. We discuss these finding in the light of current theories regarding the evolution of combinatorial signalling. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The social environment can play an important role in shaping the foraging behaviour of animals. In this study we investigated whether archerfish, Toxotes jaculatrix, display any behavioural changes in response to the presence of an audience while using their specialized foraging tactic of shooting, spitting precisely aimed jets of water, at prey targets. As any prey items shot down are potentially available to competitors, we hypothesized that shooting fish would be sensitive to the presence of potential competitors, especially given the suggestion that, in the wild, this species shows intraspecific kleptoparasitism and faces interspecific competition. We found that in the presence of another fish, archerfish took longer to shoot, made more orientations (aiming events) per shot, and tended to be closer to the target at the time of shooting. Additionally, archerfish showed high interindividual differences in latency to shoot, and these differences were consistent across contexts, with and without an audience. Our results show that archerfish are sensitive to, and adjust their shooting behaviour in response to, the presence of an audience and highlight the importance of social context in this fish species. We also suggest that interindividual differences may play an important role in archerfish shooting behaviour. This study highlights the importance of social effects and competition on foraging behaviour and decision making. Further work in this species could explore whether differences in competitive foraging ability are linked to sensitivity to the presence of an audience.

AB High mating effort leads to choosiness because each mating event reduces future reproductive potential. Many studies have shown that males adjust their sexual behaviour relative to female fecundity and encounter rate. However, little is known about the effects of a male's past mating experiences. We used guppies, Poecilia reticulata, to investigate how males change their sexual behaviour after experiencing high or low mating success. Each male was tested with two differently sized unreceptive females before and after encountering either four indiscriminate receptive virgin females or four nonreceptive pregnant females. Males that experienced high mating success with receptive females decreased their courtship displays but increased the frequency of sneaky behaviour, whereas low mating success males previously repetitively rejected by nonreceptive females showed an increase in courtship and a decrease in sneaky copulation attempts. Mating history also influenced male choosiness, with successful males showing stronger preferences for larger females than unsuccessful males. This overall adjustment in behaviour may be attributed to a reduction of resources, such as energy and gametes, as well as prior social interaction with receptive and nonreceptive females. Males that adjust their effort and choosiness based on their recent mating history and their own condition could optimize reproductive trade-offs.

AB We present novel metrics for analysis of weighted social networks that focus explicitly on the distribution of edge weights at hierarchical scales from node to egonet to community and to the network as a whole. The formulae are adapted from existing measures, originally developed in the context of population genetics to analyse variance in gene frequencies at different levels of organization. Our metrics, including 'effective degree' (by analogy to effective number of alleles), 'concentration' (by analogy to the inbreeding coefficient), 'observed' and 'expected edge weight diversity' (by analogy to observed and expected gene diversity) and F statistics allow one to partition the variance in edge weights among hierarchical levels of organization within networks. They provide a quantitative method for addressing issues as diverse as disease transmission, social complexity, the spread of learned behaviours and the evolution of cooperation. We illustrate the utility of these new metrics by applying them to three empirical social networks: long-tailed manakins, Chiroxiphia linearis, monk parakeets, Myiopsitta monachus, and mountain goats, Oreamnos americanus.

AB When females mate multiply, male reproductive success depends on both pre- and postcopulatory processes, including female choice and sperm competition. However, these processes can favour different mating tactics in males. Here we used the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, system to understand how this conflict is resolved. We asked whether knowledge of recent female mating history leads males to adjust their mating effort with respect to the time devoted to mating activity, and the frequency and the sequence of mating tactics employed. To do this we quantified male mating behaviour in three competitive scenarios: (1) Single, when a focal male arrives near a single female and remains alone with her; (2) First, when a focal male is joined by a rival male; and (3) Second, when a focal male arrives after a rival male. We hypothesized that males adjust their behaviour based on arrival order. If female sequential mate choice is the main process shaping male mating behaviours (favouring First males in guppies), males should avoid competition and invest most when Single. Alternatively, if last-male sperm precedence is the major driver of decision making, males should invest more in mating attempts in the Second scenario. Greatest investment when First implies an intermediate strategy. We found that order of arrival influenced mating decisions with most mating activity during the First rather than the Single and Second scenarios. This result suggests that both pre- and postcopulatory processes influence mating investment, and that individual males make contingent decisions to maximize both mating and fertilization success.

AB The 'cost of reproduction' refers to a series of negative effects that reproduction has on females. One behavioural cost of reproduction in vertebrates is the loss of or decrease in motility. Diminished locomotion in gravid individuals has serious potential effects on various behaviours, including locomotion, predation, antipredator, migration and the patrolling of territories. However, there have not been comparable studies on marine invertebrates. To address the cost of reproduction in marine invertebrates, we studied the sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, as a model system. Using time-lapse technology and behavioural analysis software, we analysed the locomotor behaviour of A. japonicus from the nonbreeding to the mature stage. In addition, metabolism in muscle tissue of animals between the nonbreeding and growth stage was tested with ultraperformance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The results showed that reproduction had no negative effects on locomotion frequency or maximum velocity. However, the total distance moved and cumulative duration of moving gradually decreased. Therefore, the results suggest that loss of locomotor endurance is the behavioural cost of reproduction in female A. japonicus. Additionally, we found 10 significant metabolic changes in the muscle tissue of animals in the growth stage. These results suggest that oxidative stress and lipid metabolism are potential physiological mechanisms linking reproduction and depressed locomotory performance.

AB Across animals, a male's fitness is largely dictated by his ability to fertilize eggs; and there exists a plethora of male adaptations associated with increasing fertilization success. In the nursery web spider, Pisaurina mira, males restrain females prior to and during copulation by wrapping them with silk. Previous research demonstrates that copulatory silk wrapping reduces a male's chance of being sexually cannibalized and increases the number of sperm transfer opportunities (termed insertions) that a male can achieve within a mating. While avoiding cannibalism provides an obvious survival benefit to males, the impact of insertion number on male fitness remains unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that increased insertion number realized through copulatory silk wrapping increases (1) the quantity of sperm transferred and (2) fertilization success. To accomplish this, we directly quantified the amount of sperm in male pedipalps (i.e. the male sperm storage organ) before mating and after obtaining one or two insertions. We also, indirectly quantified fertilization success by measuring the number of hatched offspring when males were capable of achieving one versus two insertions within a mating. In support of our hypotheses, we found that males transfer roughly twice the amount of sperm when achieving two insertions compared to one. We additionally found that the amount of sperm transferred is negatively related to female size. In terms of offspring number, females obtaining two insertions had more offspring compared to females obtaining only one insertion. These results show that males achieve a fertilization benefit from increased insertion number, which is obtained through the male behaviour of copulatory silk wrapping.

AB Many animal species produce ritualized signals during dyadic encounters but the functions of such 'greeting' behaviour vary considerably, or are often unknown. One established function is to acknowledge existing dominance relationships. At the same time, call rates often increase during social tension, suggesting additional functions, such as to appease higher-ranking individuals, or to maintain spatial proximity and friendly relations. For vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, vocal behaviour has been studied extensively, but little research has been devoted to calls given during encounters between two individuals, i.e. grunts. Here, we examined how individual and relationship features affected the vocal greeting behaviour of wild vervet monkeys in different ecological and social situations. We used an information theory approach to investigate the functional hypotheses of vervet monkeys' vocal greeting signals. We found little support for the main functions proposed in the literature, that is, to signal submission, to avoid conflicts, to test social bonds or to coordinate group activity. Results supported the use of grunts to signal benign intent, and we found that grunts were mostly given to closely bonded males near rivers, suggesting that vervet monkeys use vocal greeting signals to recruit individuals in situations of danger to reduce predation risk.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) coloration varies drastically across species and likely plays fundamentally different roles in facilitating social communication depending on the ecological or social context. While it is well known that UV coloration serves important social functions in species that school and flock, far less is known about the role of UV coloration in group-territorial and colonial species, where individuals have long-lasting and potentially cooperative relationships with many neighbours. We measured spectral reflectance in Neolamprologus pulcher, a group-living, colonial Tanganyikan cichlid fish, and found prominent UV coloration on both sexes. We manipulated the visibility of this UV coloration using a clear UV-blocking filter or a UV-transparent filter during behavioural contests across a barrier. We found that trials between similarly sized same-sex opponents involved significantly lower frequencies of aggression when opponents' UV coloration was obscured compared to when opponents' UV coloration was visible. As aggression is typically high between similarly sized same-sex individuals in N. pulcher, this reduction in aggression suggests that UV coloration aids in motivating individuals to engage in conspecific intrasexual interactions. We found no difference in aggression in trials between familiar and unfamiliar opponents in female-female and male-female trials, regardless of the presence of UV coloration. In male-male trials, we found significantly higher frequencies of aggression in contests between familiar male opponents than in contests between unfamiliar male opponents, but only when UV coloration was visible. Collectively, these results suggest that UV coloration is important for intrasexual interactions and prompts further investigation as to the benefits of having visual signals of communication extend into the ultraviolet spectrum.

AB The hypothesis that prey organisms can reduce the risk of predation by overtly signalling their unprofitability, or aposematism, has a long history in behavioural and evolutionary biology. To fully understand this longstanding idea, we need to measure and manipulate traits of aposematic prey, such as their distinctiveness from other prey, from the perspective of the potential predator. Specifically, we need measurements that are not anthropomorphic and that are based on the principles of discrimination developed by psychophysicists. This paper utilizes an experimentally tractable measure of discriminability based on signal detection theory as originally studied by psychophysicists. In addition, we develop and experimentally test a model to characterize the predator avoidance advantages derived from being distinct from other prey. By experimentally varying discriminability (and thus distinctiveness) we find that increased discriminability does confer a predator avoidance advantage, but the extent of this effect depends on the unprofitability of prey and the relative frequency of unprofitable prey.

AB The adaptive specialization hypothesis states that sex differences in cognition are shaped by differences in cognitive demands to solve ecological problems. While it is widely accepted that female mate choice can lead to the evolution of exaggerated male traits, mate choice might also select for different cognitive abilities in males and females. In the tungara frog, Physalaemus (= Engystomops) pustulosus, males call from a fixed position in breeding ponds while females visit multiple males before returning to the preferred mate. Thus, we predicted that females have better place memory than males. We tested this prediction in a place-learning task in which the rewarded arm of a maze was associated with a visual cue. We found that females were able to use the visual cue to solve the task while males were not, even though both males and females could discriminate the cues in an optomotor test. In contrast, males attempted to solve the task using egocentric cues (remember body-turn direction) in spite of the fact that our training procedure interrupted their use of such cues. Finally, we found that males and females had similar motivation to solve the task but females showed a greater ability to inhibit incorrect responses, leading to improved learning. Our finding that females could use a visual cue to remember locations in space is consistent with the idea that place memory could improve sequential mate assessment in tungara frogs.

AB Animals are often faced with the challenge of signalling to multiple receivers that might differ in their detection abilities and preferences. Such conditions are expected to favour the evolution of complex signals. The superb fan-throated lizard, Sarada superba, possesses one of the most complex sexual trait of any lizard: an enlarged dewlap with blue, black and orange patches that is flapped rapidly during both courtship and aggressive displays. We examined the use of the tricoloured dewlap in social signalling to determine whether (1) movement enhances signal detection, and whether (2) males and females differ in their preference for colours. Using robotic lizard stimuli, we measured receiver responses to movement and colour individually, and found that movement attracted both sexes, but the latency to respond was faster when dewlaps had all three colours compared to none (white). Furthermore, the sexes did not differ in the ability to detect colours, as more than 80% of lizards preferred coloured to white dewlaps. Most strikingly, however, the sexes showed strong preferences for different colours. Females preferentially responded to orange colour on dewlaps, and males responded to blue and black, indicating that different colours are targeted at different receivers. These results highlight that complex signals can evolve due to simultaneous inter- and intrasexual selection. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Interactions between sexual selection and ecology can drive phenotypic divergence between populations. Geographical variation in female preferences has been linked to ecology in several studies, but much less is known about patterns of geographical variation in male competition. I asked whether male aggressive territorial behaviour varied among three breeding populations of a ring species, the greenish warbler, Phylloscopus trochiloides. I measured aggressive response to playbacks of conspecific song at multiple time points to determine how territorial behaviour varied throughout the breeding season both within and between populations. Differences in the abundance and timing of resources necessary for raising offspring can shape male competitive strategies, and competition may consequently vary as a function of resource availability. I therefore combined assays of temporal variation in aggressive behaviour with season-long measures of food abundance, population density and parental provisioning rates. I found that the populations differed in intensity of aggressive response, the seasonal pattern of territoriality and the traits used in territorial responses. Overall intensity of aggression was lowest but most prolonged in the population with the lowest food abundance and highest population density, and males responded to playback primarily by singing. By contrast, birds in the two populations that experienced high food abundance and low population density exhibited a burst of aggressive display behaviour only when females were fertile. The results suggest that territorial strategies vary geographically and respond to limited resources, switching in function from season-long food defence where food is scarce to mate guarding where mates are scarce. Interactions between sexual selection and ecology across large geographical scales may ultimately lead to population divergence. The geographical variation in territorial behaviour observed in the greenish warbler implies that male competition may be an important diversifying force in this system.

ID FECAL SAC REMOVAL; BIRDS; SANITATION; PREDATION; SIZE
AB Nest sanitation-related traits have often been explained at the intraspecific level as reducing the probability of infection or detection by predators and parasites, but its evolution within the avian phylogeny is still poorly understood. We compiled detailed information of such traits for more than 400 bird species and, by means of modern comparative methodologies, we reconstructed the evolution of adults' contribution to removing their offspring's faeces and the production of faecal sacs by nestlings. Furthermore, because the functional hypotheses used to explain nest sanitation behaviour assume potential effects of brood size, body mass, nestling period and diet, we explored the association between these traits and those related to nest sanitation in a phylogenetically controlled framework. Our results suggest that parental removal of nestling faeces has driven the evolution of faecal sacs, while the ancestral states involved birds with faecal sacs removed by parents. These results support the long-held idea that faecal sacs facilitate the removal of faeces by parents. Moreover, we found that animal diets and small body sizes have favoured the evolution of faecal sacs suggesting the existence of some chemical and physical constraints in relation to the evolution of the mucous covering. Our results highlight the importance of nest sanitation in the evolution of birds and their life history characteristics.

AB Many avian species fatten to fuel migratory flights. However, the amount of fat deposited prior to departure is variable depending on individual migration strategies. Despite their small size and high mass-specific metabolic rates, migratory hummingbirds at isolated meadows can fatten up to 44% in just 4 days prior to resuming migration, suggesting profound changes in energy acquisition. However, it remains to be seen whether hummingbirds fatten at the breeding grounds prior to initiating migration. Using feeder stations outfitted with radiofrequency identification readers and digital scales, we identified a subset of premigratory ruby-throated hummingbirds that exhibited significant mass gain in the 4 days leading up to migration (premigratory fattening) and identified others that did not (premigratory nonfattening). We further assessed foraging behaviour, monitored individual mass throughout the day and calculated rates of overnight mass loss to understand what behavioural variation allowed some premigratory birds to rapidly fatten. Premigratory fattening hummingbirds abandoned foraging restraint during the middle of the day, a behaviour thought to enhance aerial agility, and increased foraging effort during both the middle of the day and the evenings by increasing the duration but not the frequency of feeder visits. Groups did not differ in their morning foraging strategy. Premigratory fattening hummingbirds also lost mass overnight at reduced rates, implying that birds conserved energy to minimize the depletion of existing fat stores, possibly via increased nocturnal torpor use. Fattening hummingbirds used a twopronged approach of increasing energy intake during specific daily periods and reducing overnight energy expenditure to achieve substantial premigratory mass gain over just 4 days. However, not all hummingbirds adopted this premigratory fuelling strategy; those that did were adults (> 1 year old), suggesting that the use of a premigratory fuelling strategy may be age related.

AB Infectious disease transmission is a cost of sociality in humans and other animals. Nevertheless, the mechanisms linking social behaviour to infection risk are poorly known. We conducted a field experiment to examine how host intrinsic traits, behaviour and physiology affect infection of nonhuman primates with gastrointestinal parasites. We measured rate to reinfection in a social group of red-capped mangabeys, Cercocebus torquatus, following chemotherapeutic treatment for parasite infections. By measuring behaviour, infection and glucocorticoid levels, we compared the relative effects of space sharing, directional contact and physiological stress on risk of acquiring new infections. We found that, within proximity networks, individuals that were central, well connected and had a tendency to switch groups were at increased risk of infection with helminths. Protozoan infections, however, were acquired more uniformly across the population. In general, position in the social network and, in particular, space sharing appears to be more important than the immunosuppressive effects of physiological stress or host traits in determining risk of infection. Our results suggest that future studies of disease ecology within wildlife populations should focus on measures of network association in addition to individual host traits.

AB The ability to recognize kin has important impacts on fitness because it can allow for kin-biased affiliative behaviours and avoidance of mating with close kin. While the presence and effects of kin biases have been widely studied, less is known about the process by which animals recognize close kin. Here we investigate potential cues that white-faced capuchin monkeys, Cebus capucinus, may use to detect half siblings and closer kin. We focus on the first year of life in a sample of 130 infant (N = 65 infant females) wild capuchins from the Lomas Barbudal population in Costa Rica. We show that (1) infant relatedness to juvenile and adult males at the level of half sibling and higher can be predicted by male alpha status, spatial proximity and age proximity, and that (2) infant relatedness to juvenile and adult females at the level of half sibling or higher can be predicted by spatial proximity (but not age proximity). Furthermore, (1) the identities of infants' fathers can also be predicted by male alpha status and the spatial proximity between infants and adult males, and (2) age proximity (but not spatial proximity) is predictive of paternal sibship. These results suggest that infant capuchins have access to multiple cues to close relatedness and paternal kinship, although whether infants use these cues later in life remains to be explored in future research.

AB Despite rapid growth in the literature on personality in wild animals, personality has seldom been explored as a tool for wildlife management in human-altered landscapes. That context frequently involves the habituation of wildlife to people, which can alter predator-prey relationships, contribute to ecosystem damage and result in human-wildlife conflict. For many ungulate species, habituation is also associated with changes to facultative behaviours, such as migration, which may also be related to individual variation. We studied these relationships by identifying behavioural types in two wild populations of elk, Cervus canadensis, within which habituation is prevalent, and in one captive population. We defined behavioural types by the relative position of each individual along a shy-bold gradient that we derived for each population from seven behavioural metrics. Those metrics included repeated measures of reactions to three stimuli (approaching humans, novel objects and novel sounds), two state variables measured with scan samples (position within herd and vigilance) and two all-occurrence records of specific behaviours (outcome of dominance interactions and herd leading). Boldness scores were more similar within than among individuals in all three populations, consistent between years, and unrelated to age. In the wild, the shyer half of each population was three times more likely to exhibit migratory behaviour, whereas the bolder half was just as likely (3: 1) to express year-round residency. Our results suggest that personality could be an important tool for managing habituated wildlife. By identifying behavioural types and their associations with particular tendencies, managers could proactively target specific individuals for behavioural modification to foster greater coexistence of people and wildlife.

AB Tool-assisted percussion is an ancient feature of human technology. Tool-assisted percussion is not uniquely human; chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, longtailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis aurea, and capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.) use stone tools to crack open encased foods. The knowledge of how these nonhuman primates use percussion tools helps us to understand how extinct hominins might have used percussion tools. Wild bearded capuchin monkeys, Sapajus libidinosus, crack palm nuts of different species by placing them on rock outcroppings, boulders and logs (anvils) and striking them with stone hammers. In the present study, we examined whether and how these monkeys modulate the kinematic parameters of individual strikes and the organization of successive strikes to accommodate the physical properties of a nut. To this end, we observed seven monkeys as they cracked two species of nuts that differ in their structure and resistance to fracture. They cracked the less resistant tucum (Astrocaryum spp.) nut by striking it repeatedly with moderate force (that is, by not exceeding a threshold) and modulating the kinematic parameters of each strike on the basis of the condition of the nut (that is, the development of a fracture) following the preceding strike. In contrast, they cracked the more resistant piacava (Orbignya spp.) nut by striking it with the maximum force that they could generate without modulating the kinematic parameters of their strikes until that nut cracked. These results demonstrate that the task-specific temporal organization of percussive movements necessary for knapping stones is within the capability of extant nonhuman primates.

AB The ability to differentiate between one's own and foreign offspring ensures the exclusive allocation of costly parental care to only related progeny. The selective pressure to evolve offspring discrimination strategies is largely shaped by the likelihood and costs of offspring confusion. We hypothesize that males and females with different reproductive and spatial behaviours face different risks of confusing their own with others' offspring, and this should favour differential offspring discrimination strategies in the two sexes. In the brilliant-thighed poison frog, Allobates femoralis, males and females are highly polygamous, terrestrial clutches are laid in male territories and females abandon the clutch after oviposition. We investigated whether males and females differentiate between their own offspring and unrelated young, whether they use direct or indirect cues and whether the concurrent presence of their own clutch is essential to elicit parental behaviours. Males transported tadpoles regardless of location or parentage, but to a lesser extent in the absence of their own clutch. Females discriminated between clutches based on exact location and transported tadpoles only in the presence of their own clutch. This sex-specific selectivity of males and females during parental care reflects the differences in their respective costs of offspring confusion, resulting from differences in their spatial and reproductive behaviours.

AB Animal personalities are ubiquitous across the animal kingdom and have been shown both to influence individual behaviour in the social context and to be affected by it. However, little attention has been paid to possible carryover effects of social conditions on personality expression, especially when individuals are alone. Here we investigated how the recent social context affected the boldness and repeatability of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, during individual assays. We housed fish either solitarily, solitarily part of the time or socially in groups of four, and subjected them twice to a risk-taking task. The social conditions had a large effect on boldness repeatability, with fish housed solitarily before the trials showing much higher behavioural repeatability than fish housed socially, for which repeatability was not significant. Social conditions also had a temporal effect on the boldness of the fish, with only fish housed solitarily taking more risks during the first than the second trial. These results show that recent social conditions can thus affect the short-term repeatability of behaviour and obfuscate the expression of personality even in later contexts when individuals are alone. This finding highlights the need to consider social housing conditions when designing personality studies and emphasizes the important link between animal personality and the social context by showing the potential role of social carryover effects.

AB Behaviours are the result of the interaction between genetic factors, past experiences, and labile environmental and social influences. Usually, the behavioural variability of an individual is smaller than the behavioural range of its species, but stable over time and contexts. This intraindividual consistency has been termed animal personality, and is found in a wide range of taxa. Personality types have various fitness and behavioural consequences. In particular, proactive individuals seem to perform better in most, but not all, learning tasks. Furthermore, personality types may also influence behavioural reaction towards the task at hand. For instance, in the literature, reactive individuals are expected to explore new environments more slowly, but to respond better to changes in their environment than proactive individuals. Here, we report the characterization of personality profiles in mallards over a period of 8 months, as well as their reactions towards a spatial-learning task. Mallards' exploration scores were repeatable both in novel environment and in novel object tests. Even though they did not differ in their baseline cortisol levels, fast-exploring birds had lower cortisol levels 30 min after the occurrence of a stressor than slow-exploring birds. Irrespective of their personality, all our birds successfully learned to find a food location within a maze. Yet, fast-exploring individuals took longer to accomplish the task, potentially because they habituated faster to stress and could engage earlier in other activities within the maze. Our results contrast with recent views of the respective consequences of being reactive or proactive. They thus highlight the importance of considering the habituation to stress when investigating the relative advantages of the reactive - proactive continuum, as well as taking into account the personality bias when conducting cognitive experiments.

   bicolor; tree swallow
ID ANTHROPOGENIC NOISE; ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE; TRAFFIC NOISE; AFFECT GROWTH;
   IMPACTS; BIRDS
AB Many recent studies suggest that increased ambient noise can disrupt acoustic communication in animals and might ultimately decrease their reproductive success. Most of these studies have focused on long-distance signals used in mate attraction and territory defence, but close-range acoustic interactions between parents and offspring may also be disrupted by noise and are closely linked to reproductive success. To test the effect of noise on parent-offspring interactions, we experimentally applied white noise (65 dB SPL) to the nests of tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, when nestlings were 3-6 days old. At experimental nests, parents gave fewer provisioning calls, which are used to stimulate begging, but otherwise we detected no difference in provisioning behaviour between experimental and control nests. More nestlings begged for food at experimental nests, using calls that were higher in amplitude and minimum frequency, than at control nests. When we played back nestling begging calls during parental visits to stimulate higher feeding rates, parents increased their feeding rates at control nests, but not at experimental nests. Our results show that noise can alter parent-offspring interactions and interfere with parental responses to begging calls. Nestlings may be able to compensate for moderate increases in noise by enhancing the conspicuousness of their begging signal, although at higher noise levels these adjustments may prove ineffective or the extra begging effort may be physiologically costly.

AB Animal social interactions usually revolve around several sensory modalities. For birds, these are primarily visual and acoustic. However, some habitat specificities or long distances may temporarily hinder or limit visual information transmission making acoustic transmission a central channel of communication even during complex social behaviours. Here we investigated the impact of visual limitation on the vocal dynamics between zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, partners. Pairs were acoustically recorded during a separation and reunion protocol with gradually decreasing distance without visual contact. Without visual contact, pairs displayed more correlated vocal exchanges than with visual contact. We also analysed the turn-taking sequences of individuals' vocalizations during an exchange with or without visual contact. In the absence of visual contact, the identity of a vocalizing individual was well predicted by the knowledge of the identity of the previous vocalizer. This property is characteristic of a stochastic process called a Markov chain and we found that turn-taking sequences of birds deprived of visual contact were Markovian. Thus, both the temporal correlation between the calls of the two partners and Markov properties of acoustic interactions indicate that, in the absence of visual cues, the decision to call is taken on a very short-term basis and solely on acoustic information ( both temporal and identity of caller). Strikingly, when individuals were in visual contact both these features of their acoustic social interactions disappeared indicating that birds adapted their calling dynamics to cope with limited visual cues.

AB Studies over the past decade have revealed many differences in song characteristics between urban and rural populations of passerines. While some of these adjustments are immediate (i.e. flexible responses to a changing acoustic environment), there is evidence that other adjustments may occur over a longer term. We tested whether adult zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, would alter their songs after being held in different controlled acoustic environments (one quiet, one with traffic noise) for 5 months and whether these changes would (1) be associated with changes in baseline circulating corticosterone level and (2) persist 2 months after being reacclimated to their original social environment. We found that the noisy environment did not elevate baseline circulating corticosterone. In addition, although noise resulted in song changes, these changes were not consistent with the current hypotheses of acoustic masking and adaptation. Rather, we found that birds living in a noisy environment significantly lowered their minimum frequencies post-treatment, an effect that lasted at least 2 months post-experiment. Furthermore, over the course of the experiment, we found that all birds, regardless of treatment group, increased the duration of their song (by increasing the number of repeated notes within their song) and showed reduced baseline corticosterone. Our results suggest that living in different acoustic environments temporarily may have both immediate and lasting effects on song characteristics. However, because these results do not correspond with field observations of masking avoidance, we suggest that the process of song modification in different environments may be more complicated than initially hypothesized.

AB Adolescent exposure to adverse environmental conditions can cause lasting changes in behaviour, cognition and physiology. One explanation for why such changes occur is that they allow organisms to adjust aspects of their phenotype to enhance function in an unfavourable environment. This concept has been investigated for stress during gestation (e.g. thrifty phenotype hypothesis, maternal mismatch hypothesis). Here, we apply these ideas within an individual's lifetime as a possible explanation for longterm phenotypic changes in response to stress during adolescence. To test whether stress during adolescence can cause phenotypic changes that prepare an animal for future threat, we exposed laboratory rats to either chronic stress or unstressed control conditions during adolescent development. After a 5-week delay, rats were assessed in a timed-foraging task under both low-threat and high-threat conditions. Chronic stress during adolescence caused long-term changes in foraging behaviours and foraging performance. In low-threat conditions, stress-exposed rats had a longer latency to begin foraging but consumed the same number of rewards as unstressed rats. However, under high-threat conditions, rats exposed to stress during adolescence began foraging sooner, made more transitions between foraging patches and consumed more rewards than unstressed rats. These results indicate that stress exposure enabled rats to forage more effectively under later novel threat, and that phenotypic changes resulting from stressful experiences during adolescence may enhance function in future highthreat environments.

AB Determining the drivers of complex systems is a major challenge felt by virtually all of biology. For complex societies, there is considerable interest in how individuals' traits determine their social roles and how the milieu of trait variants within groups shapes emergent group-level phenotypes. In this study, we tested in spiders whether individual differences in behaviour, morphology, or both shape individuals' participation in foraging. We then tested which aspects of group composition (e. g. morphological composition, personality composition, group size) predict colony-level foraging and escape behaviour. We performed these studies both under (1) standardized laboratory conditions, where colonies' ability to build webs was constrained, and (2) under more free-living conditions in the field. Regardless of the laboratory/field distinction, we found that individual task participation was regulated by individuals' body size and group size: larger individuals and individuals in smaller groups tended to participate more in foraging tasks. At the colony level, colonies composed of bolder spiders attacked prey with a larger number of attackers regardless of the laboratory/field distinction. However, our field assessments of colony foraging revealed that the speed with which colonies responded to prey was determined by their group size, morphological composition and personality composition; none of these effects were detected under laboratory conditions. Finally, we found that colonies took longer to retreat from aversive stimuli when more spiders were outside the nest. Taken together, our results suggest that colonies' social organization and collective behaviour are determined by spiders' morphology, behavioural tendencies and colony demographics.

AB Departure decisions of how and when to leave a stopover site may be of critical importance for the migration performance of birds. We used an automated radiotelemetry system at Falsterbo peninsula, Sweden, to study stopover behaviour and route choice in free-flying passerines departing on flights across the Baltic Sea during autumn migration. In addition, we had an offshore receiver station (FINO 2) located about 50 km southeast from Falsterbo. Of 91 birds equipped with radiotransmitters, 19 passed FINO 2. The probability that a departing migrant passed near FINO 2 was primarily affected by winds and timing of departure. Probably, the migrants were subjected to drift by westerly winds, leading to southeasterly flight paths and an enhanced probability of passing FINO 2. Most birds passing the offshore station departed early in the night, which indicates that southward departures across the Baltic Sea usually take place during this time window. Wind condition was the dominant factor explaining the variation in flight duration between Falsterbo and FINO 2. After considering wind influence, we found additional effects of fat score and cloud cover. Birds with a higher fat score performed the flight faster than leaner individuals, as did birds that departed under clear skies compared to birds departing during overcast skies. These effects may reflect a difference in migratory motivation and airspeed between lean and fat birds together with difficulties in controlling orientation in overcast situations on oversea flights when celestial cues are unavailable. Thus, winds, clouds and fuel reserves were the primary factors determining departure and flight decisions in passerine migrants at Falsterbo in autumn.

AB Variation in the quantity of nutrients ingested over an individual's lifetime is likely to differentially affect distinct male secondary sexual traits and courtship signals, potentially providing females with information about a male's past and present foraging history. We hypothesize that female choice is thus influenced by a male's lifetime foraging history. To test this, we manipulated the quantity of nutrients (i.e. prey items) available to male wolf spiders, Schizocosa stridulans, using a fully crossed 2 x 2 design with low versus high prey quantity across juvenile and adult life stages, and assessed the impact of these diet treatments on male foreleg pigmentation, courtship rate and mating success. We found foreleg pigmentation to be dependent upon both juvenile and adult diet, with increased nutrition dependence of pigmented versus unpigmented leg segments. Despite this, the degree of foreleg pigmentation did not predict mating success. In contrast, courtship rate was not nutrient dependent, yet strongly predicted mating success. Finally, we found a significant interaction between juvenile diet, adult diet and courtship rate on mating success. Males that experienced a diet switch (low juvenile to high adult, LH; high juvenile to low adult, HL) exhibited no relationship between courtship rate and mating success, while those that experienced a consistent diet (LL; HH) showed increased mating success with increased courtship rates. Our results suggest that nutrition dependence of secondary sexual traits is not necessarily a predictor of their role in mating success and that female mate choice is the result of complex interactions between multiple male traits.

AB Behavioural responses to damage-released chemical cues in aquatic species are often examined with emphases on the potential survival benefits accrued by conspecific receivers in accordance with the hypothesis of taxonomic cue conservation. Nevertheless, chemical cues are publically available to any capable receivers in aquatic systems, and therefore convey information on ambient risk levels to unrelated prey species and on the availability of foraging opportunities to potential predators. Many documented alarm response patterns by heterospecific receivers closely match those of conspecifics, suggesting that the contextual value of public information on risk conveyed by alarm cues may be at least as important as their conserved value. To further explore this relationship, we compared the antipredator responses of shoals of three large or three small female Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulata, to conspecific cues or cues from larger or smaller Hart's rivulus, Rivulus hartii, donors to quantify the relative values of publicly available information. Shoals of large female guppies demonstrated functionally similar antipredator responses to damage-released cues from conspecifics and larger heterospecifics, and no response to the damage-released cues from smaller heterospecifics or the kairomones of larger heterospecifics. Shoals of small guppies demonstrated significant antipredator responses to the damage-released cues of size-matched rivulus, but not to those of larger rivulus or to the odours of either size class. Collectively, these results indicate that potential prey assign at least equal importance to conspecific and public chemical cues from unrelated members of the same prey guild indicating elevated levels of predation risk in natural systems.

AB Lateralized paw usage of mice, Mus musculus, is a learned behaviour, based on a gradual reinforcement of randomly occurring weak asymmetries in paw choice early in training. The reinforcement relies on strain-dependent, short-term and long-term memory. We characterized the skills of information accumulation by quantifying the predictability of each reach of initially naive mice from past behaviour in two training sessions of 50 reaches, separated by a 1-week interval. We studied six mouse strains, including 9XCA and BTBR with absent corpus callosum and severely reduced hippocampal commissure, and compared them to a null model with random, unbiased paw preference. We found that each paw choice was based on a limited, strain-specific number of previous choices. Also, there was a limited, strain-specific degree of predictability of each choice. Consequently, there was a strain-specific degree of randomness that was not lost with training. After 1 week for consolidation of memory of learned biases, paw choices became more predictable and made use of fewer previous choices, except in 9XCA and BTBR; nevertheless, a degree of randomness remained. We conclude that paw choices are regulated by short-term memory of a small number of previous choices and by long-term memory that affects future behaviour patterns and decreases, but does not remove, the usage of short-term memory. Both short-term and long-term memory skills are strain dependent. Importantly, a degree of randomness is not removed by training and this may be a critical element for behavioural plasticity in paw preference in changing environments, supplying constant adaptability in paw preferences.

AB The characteristics of human-human and human-animal interactions have been studied intensively. Previous studies showed that the presence of a third human party can influence motivation during a cognitive task, whereas a third animal party, not expected to make any judgement, does not have a similar impact. As a growing number of animated objects are created to interact with humans, we asked whether humans can perceive robots as potential interlocutors. The question of how these objects should be visually designed in order to be accepted by human users as interlocutors and assistants remains open, essentially owing to a lack of behavioural surveys. Therefore, the present study compared the impact of the presence of different animated objects on the behaviour and performance of primary school children during a cognitive task. Fifty-one primary school pupils (10 years 11 months +/- 6 months) were individually given mental arithmetic tasks 'supervised' by a computer alone, or by the same computer assisted by an animated object (i.e. virtual human character, animal-shaped object covered with fur, humanoid metallic robot). Children's performances and behaviour were analysed. First, we found that animated objects were accepted as interacting partners, as they modified children's attention and influenced their emotional state in a positive way. Second, we found that the object design (human-, animal- or robot-like) influenced the children's reactions and performance in different ways. 3D objects (animal and robot), with more 'live' characteristics (e.g. motion), elicited more positive behaviours as well as fewer negative behaviours than the 2D character. However, the animal-like object decreased attention towards the computer more, and consequently also cognitive performance, than the human or humanoid ones. This study opens new research perspectives concerning the importance of the realism of robotic objects and the associated capacity of judgement on the level of acceptance by humans.

AB Social insects use multiple lines of collective defences to combat pathogens. One example of a behavioural group defence is the use of antimicrobial plant compounds to disinfect the nest. Indeed, wood ants collect coniferous tree resin, and the presence of resin in their nest protects them against fungal and bacterial pathogens. Many questions remain on the mechanisms of resin use, including which factors elicit resin collection and placement within nests. Here, we investigated whether the presence of brood induces Formica paralugubris workers to collect more resin, and whether the workers preferentially place resin near the brood. We also tested whether the collection and placement of resin depends on the presence of the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana. Workers brought more resin to their nest when brood was present, and preferentially placed the resin near the brood. In contrast, workers did not increase resin collection in response to exposure to B. bassiana, nor did they place resin closer to contaminated brood or contaminated areas of the nest. This lack of response may be explained by a limited effect of resin against the germination and growth of B. bassiana in vitro. Overall, our main result is that woods ants actively position resin near the brood, which probably confers prophylactic protection against other detrimental microorganisms.

AB Innovation is a way by which animals adopt a new behaviour or apply a current behaviour to a novel situation. Although exploring a new behaviour is itself risky for the animal, a growing body of research indicates that it is fairly widespread across animal species. While there have been explorations of when innovation is most likely and which individuals are most likely to innovate, less has been explored about the psychological mechanisms underlying innovation. Here we consider some psychological limits on innovation. We focus on five factors that my limit the invention of novel behaviours (neophobia, conservatism, conformity, functional fixedness and the endowment effect). The feature common to each of these is that individuals tend to stick with existing behaviours, or the existing uses of those behaviours, rather than exploring novel options. This in turn limits animals' willingness to try less common behaviours unless they are forced through circumstances to explore alternate strategies. Despite the similar functional outcomes, it is critical to understand the underlying mechanisms present in different situations in order to make strong predictions about when innovation is, or is not, expected to emerge. We then consider how transmission biases and social learning mechanisms influence and limit the spread of inventions among individuals. Of course, these 'limits' are beneficial in other circumstances, and throughout this review we consider the trade-offs for these psychological mechanisms.

AB Territorial contests between males without weaponry are based on costly displays and can result in condition-dependent alternative reproductive tactics that maximize male fitness. Physiological and morphological traits such as fat content, body size or the expression of secondary sexual traits have been shown to contribute to male territory-holding potential. When territorial contests are based on flight displays, wing morphology is expected to contribute to the territory-holding potential of a male through its effects on flight performance. We explored whether wing shape contributed to the territory-holding potential of males of three species of Calopteryx damselflies. Males of these species show two distinct, condition-dependent behavioural tactics: territorial and nonterritorial. Previous studies have shown that territorial males have higher fitness than nonterritorial males. We used mark-recapture to determine male tactics within the populations and compared wing shape, size and wing coloured spot size (a secondary sexual trait) between tactics. Territorial males of all three species had shorter and slightly broader hindwings than nonterritorial males. In two species, forewings of territorial males were longer and broader than forewings of nonterritorial males. Wing size and wing spot size did not differ between tactics. We suggest that the wing shape of territorial males might confer better flight manoeuvrability, which would be advantageous for territorial contests. Therefore, wing shape is likely to be an important trait contributing to territory-holding potential in condition-dependent alternative reproductive tactics based on flight displays.

AB Many animals face a trade-off between choosing to forage and avoiding predation. This trade-off may be optimized if animals assess short-term changes in predation risk and match their investment in costly antipredator behaviours to the current level of risk. Although there is growing evidence that insects are sensitive to predation risk, using a range of cues in their assessments, little is known about how variation in these cues influences responses. We used simulated nonlethal predator attacks, a direct physical cue of predation risk, to investigate how the frequency and location of attacks influence the feeding behaviour of gumleaf skeletonizer caterpillars, Uraba lugens. We found that a caterpillar's immediate behavioural response depended upon where on the body it was attacked. Caterpillars attacked on the abdomen were more likely to walk away or rear their head, whereas caterpillars attacked on the head were more likely to move their head sideways or regurgitate. Changes to subsequent feeding behaviour were influenced more by the frequency of attack. Caterpillars experiencing a high frequency of attack were less likely to start feeding within 3 h behavioural trials compared with caterpillars experiencing an attack of low frequency. Of those that did feed, attacked caterpillars significantly reduced their rate of ingestion and total consumption. The changes to feeding behaviour displayed by attacked caterpillars are consistent with reducing future risk of predation and demonstrate an ability to have nuanced responses to predation risk, shaped by the type of nonlethal attack experienced. Such sensitivity is important if animals are to respond effectively to predation risk. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social eavesdropping is the gathering of information by observing interactions between other individuals. Previous studies have claimed that dogs, Canis familiaris, are able to use information obtained via social eavesdropping, that is, preferring a generous over a selfish human donor. However, in these studies the side was constant between the demonstrations and the dogs' choices, not controlling for potential location biases. In the crucial control condition of our experiments, the donors swapped places in half of the trials before the dogs chose. We found that first choice behaviour as well as the time dogs interacted with the generous donor were influenced by location (side). In a second experiment the subject's owner interacted with the two donors. Again, the result of the side control revealed that the critical factor was location (side) not person. The results of these experiments provide no evidence for social eavesdropping in dogs and show the importance of critical control conditions.

AB Understanding the relationship between kinship and female social preferences in mammalian societies is frequently complicated by philopatric behaviour and variation in pairwise home range overlap. While the influence of space use on association patterns is increasingly being considered in studies using network analysis, methods are needed for generating null models that control for pairwise home range overlap. We investigated female associations in a wild population of eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, a species with higher fission-fusion dynamics, to test the influences of home range overlap and kinship on pairwise association strengths. Genetic analysis revealed that females were highly philopatric and we found that association strengths were significantly correlated with home range overlap. To test for social preferences, we compared observed associations with random associations based on individuals' space use, simulated using Digiroo2. HWIG, a version of the half-weight association index that controls for among-individual variation in gregariousness was used for all analyses. Preferred associates had significantly higher pairwise relatedness than expected. Although some females had strong social relationships with some of their close kin, in general, space use had a much stronger correlation with association strengths than both pairwise relatedness and maternal lineage. This suggests that familiarity may play a key role in driving association patterns in female kangaroos. We recommend controlling for individuals' space use when undertaking studies on social preferences and social structure in general. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Pathogens can affect host behaviour in ways that influence disease transmission as well as survival and fitness for both host and pathogen. Hibernating bats with white-nose syndrome (WNS) show a number of unusual behaviours including increased frequency of arousal from torpor, altered roosting behaviour and premature emergence. However, mechanisms underlying these patterns are not understood, and the behaviour of bats with WNS has not been examined systematically. Three hypotheses could explain increased arousal frequency. Bats may arouse to (1) groom in response to skin infection, (2) drink to offset dehydration or (3) increase activity, possibly in an attempt to access resources, avoid a source of infection or limit the risk of infecting relatives. We tested these hypotheses with captive little brown bats, Myotis lucifugus, inoculated with Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the fungus that causes WNS. In contrast to predictions of all three hypotheses, bats inoculated with the fungus tended to be less active than controls during arousals from torpor and did not increase grooming or visits to the water source in their enclosures. However, bats showed a dramatic reduction in clustering behaviour as infection progressed. Reduced activity and clustering could represent adaptive, maladaptive or pathological responses. Reduced activity could be an energy-saving mechanism or a pathological consequence of infection while reduced clustering could have beneficial or detrimental consequences for transmission, energetics, water balance and survival. Our results highlight the need for studies of host behaviour to understand dynamics of wildlife infectious diseases. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The study of reliability, or 'honesty', in communication between individuals with conflicting interests has been a major focus of game theoretical modelling in evolutionary biology. It has been proposed that mixed populations of honest and deceptive signallers can be evolutionarily stable in a model of conventional, or 'minimal cost', signals of competitive ability, and evolutionary simulations have been presented to support this hypothesis. However, we find that these results are questionable on both theoretical and methodological grounds. Here, we examine the theoretical issues raised by this model and examine the proposed 'cheating' strategy through the use of a genetic algorithm. Our evolutionary simulations do not support the hypothesis that deception can be evolutionarily stable in this game. Intuition and common sense have it that animals communicate using ambiguous threat displays that have an underlying probabilistic mixed strategy type of mechanism, but there remains no working game theoretical model of such a communication system.

AB Predators induce behavioural defences in a large range of prey species, including molluscs. The ability of a species to respond appropriately to risk cues may determine the outcome of interspecific competition. We investigated whether two invasive mussel species, the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, and the quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, differ in their behavioural responses to risk cues released from round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, and rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus. In response to risk cues, both species increased their attachment strength, aggregated more, increased the use of a refuge habitat and decreased clearance rates. Although attachment strength, aggregation rate and refuge habitat use was greater for zebra than for quagga mussels, the strength of predator-induced responses was similar in the two mussel species for all behaviours except for filtering activity. Zebra mussels decreased clearance rates more when exposed to predator risk cues than quagga mussels. Both mussels decreased clearance rates the most with rusty crayfish risk cues present. Since these responses have a fitness cost associated with lower growth rates, the stronger response of zebra mussels may make this species competitively inferior to quagga mussels in an initial low-predation environment when few native predators are feeding on these mussels. This advantage may shift to zebra mussels over time if native predators learn or adapt to feed on the dreissenids. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Distractive marks have been suggested to prevent predator detection or recognition of a prey, by drawing the attention away from recognizable traits of the bearer. The white 'comma' on the wings of comma butterflies, Polygonia c-album, has been suggested to represent such a distractive mark. In a laboratory experiment using blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, as predators, we show that the comma increased survival, since the blue tits attacked butterflies with overpainted commas more often than sham-painted butterflies with intact commas. In a field experiment we placed hibernating, similarly manipulated, comma butterflies on tree trunks of two different species and noted their survival. Although survival was higher on birch trees than on oak trees, there was no effect of treatment, probably because the butterflies were preyed on by both diurnal and nocturnal predators and the latter are unlikely to attend to small conspicuous markings.

AB Courtship behaviours of males often resemble the food-begging behaviour of their young, at least from a human perspective. Although it is argued that this represents a sensory trap, it is still unclear whether such behaviour in males is objectively similar to nestling behaviour and can elicit female parental care (e.g. attraction to nestlings) in courtship, as predicted by the sensory trap hypothesis. In this study, we demonstrated that the enticement calls of male barn swallows structurally resemble the food-begging calls of nestlings, compared with the other three male vocalizations (i.e. songs, alarm calls and contact calls). In addition, we used experimental playback of the vocalizations to compare the response of females towards male enticement calls and nestling food-begging calls during the courtship period. We found that females were attracted to the playback of nestlings' food-begging calls during the courtship period, despite nestlings being absent at this time. The response of females to food-begging calls was similar and positively correlated with their response to male enticement calls. These observations support the sensory trap hypothesis, i.e. that male signals mimic stimuli to which females respond for parental care. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals must locate prey and mates in noisy sensory environments. Species that rely on visual cues, and which are prey of visual predators, consequently face trade-offs. Additionally, within species, sexual conflict over mating may impose pressures to avoid both predators and mates. Many studies have attempted to explain female-specific polymorphisms in damselflies, but without considering their actual conspicuousness under natural conditions. Using models of colour perception for damselflies and birds, we assessed the detectability of female coloration to conspecific males and potential predators. Alternative colour morphs reduce female apparency either through signal similarity with conspecific males (i.e. mimicry) or by matching the noise of the visual background. The colours of male-mimicking andromorphs that reduce their apparency among groups of males at breeding sites render them highly detectable to males as well as visual predators in offshore vegetation, where females occur when not reproducing. By presenting tethered female damselflies to free-flying males amidst vegetation, we demonstrated that, among flying females, males were able to detect andromorphs more easily than the more cryptic heteromorphs. Thus, when male density is low, cryptic heteromorphs may experience less harassment than andromorphs, suggesting a scenario of disruptive selection on female coloration driven by males as well as predators. Greater attention is warranted not only to the predation risks of female signals, but also to the effect of variation in the visual environments on encounters between males and unreceptive females.

AB Group-living animals frequently have to trade off the costs and benefits of leaving an established group and joining another group. Owing to their high fitness relevance, group-joining decisions are commonly nonrandom and may be based on traits of both individual members and the group such as life stage, body size, social status and group density or size, respectively. Many group-living animals are able to recognize and to associate preferentially with familiar individuals, i.e. those encountered before. Hence, after dispersing from established groups, animals commonly have to decide whether to join a new familiar or unfamiliar group. Using binary choice situations we assessed the effects of social familiarity on group-joining behaviour of the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. Group living in P. persimilis is brought about by the patchy distribution of its spider mite prey and mutual conspecific attraction. In the first experiment, gravid predator females given a choice between spider mite patches occupied by unfamiliar and familiar groups of females strongly preferred to join familiar groups and to deposit their eggs in these patches. Preference for socially familiar groups was robust across biases of spider mite prey densities between choice options. The second experiment revealed that the predatory mite females can smell social familiarity from a distance. Females subjected to odour choice situations in artificial cages were more strongly attracted to the odour of familiar than unfamiliar groups. We argue that P. persimilis females preferentially join socially familiar groups because a familiar social environment relaxes competition and optimizes foraging and reproduction.

AB The analysis of repeated journeys of the same individuals is becoming an important tool in the study of animal migration. This approach has been used to analyse the migratory consistency (in schedules, routes and stopovers) of various species, with implications for the understanding of navigation mechanisms, travel strategies and conservation. However, few studies have addressed the individual consistency in pelagic long-distance migrations, in particular in the routes followed in different years. By analysing 100 journeys from 35 individual Cory's shearwaters, Calonectris diomedea, that repeatedly migrated to the South African region we examined the fidelity to migratory paths and stopovers of a transequatorial seabird migrant. Cory's shearwaters showed an overall trend to be faithful to their routes in different years, which was particularly obvious in the first (southbound) part of the outward migration. Nevertheless, we did not detect any individual consistency in the final part of the outward migration, in the return migration or in the location of the stopovers. The fact that Cory's shearwaters can be either consistent or inconsistent in different parts of their routes is possibly related to the variability of the external factors (such as wind conditions and location of good foraging areas) found along the way.

AB Predators often show strong plasticity of optimal foraging strategies. A major difference in foraging strategies occurs between sit-and-wait and active predators. Models predict that the efficiency of these strategies is affected by environmental conditions, active predators being favoured when prey are scarce and their detection difficult. The shift between the two strategies may occur through both phenotypic plasticity and local adaptations. Larvae of the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, are typically stream-dwelling sit-and-wait predators, but some populations breed in caves. We evaluated whether local adaptations or phenotypic plasticity determine shifts in foraging strategy between stream and cave populations. The foraging behaviour of salamander larvae was evaluated under all combinations of three test conditions during trials: light versus darkness, prey presence versus absence and food deprived versus fed; larvae originated from caves and streams and were reared in epigeous photoperiod or in darkness. Observations and video tracking showed that salamander larvae modified their behaviour in response to environmental conditions. In the darkness, larvae showed higher average velocity and moved longer distances. Movements were higher in food-deprived larvae and in the presence of prey compared to fed larvae and prey absent conditions. Furthermore, larvae from cave populations showed higher behavioural plasticity than stream larvae, and better exploited the available space in test environments. Variation in foraging behaviour was strong, and involved complex interactions between plasticity and local adaptations. Larvae from cave populations showed higher behavioural plasticity, supporting the hypothesis that this trait may be important for the exploitation of novel environments, such as caves.

AB Signals of closely related species tend to be more distinct when occurring in sympatry than in allopatry. Such differences allow species-specific identification and presumably reduce interspecific mating. Among chickadees, dawn chorus behaviour affects female mate choice. Within our sympatric study population of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, and mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, directional hybridization occurs via extrapair matings between female mountain chickadees (the subordinate species) and male black-capped chickadees (the dominant species). In this study, we compared dawn singing from this sympatric population with dawn recordings from allopatric populations of each species. Mountain chickadees used more chick-a-dee calls than songs during the dawn chorus when they co-occurred with black-capped chickadees in the sympatric population, but used similar proportions of calls and songs in the allopatric populations. We also found differences in the fine structure of the song; both species typically had a descending first note in their song (glissando), but mountain chickadees in the sympatric population used an ascending first note. The internote ratio between the first two notes of the song of the sympatric mountain chickadees lacked a characteristic frequency drop found in the allopatric mountain chickadee population and in the allopatric and sympatric populations of black-capped chickadees. Geographical analysis of songs of mountain chickadees across western North America revealed consistent differences in song features among sympatric/allopatric populations in different regions, but the nature of character shifts were not always parallel among populations. These findings illustrate possible character displacement in a subordinate species (mountain chickadee) to reduce acoustic overlap with a dominant heterospecific (black-capped chickadee).

AB Boldness is a personality trait that defines how individuals respond to risky situations and has clear fitness consequences. Since the adaptive value of boldness is context dependent, the benefit of a distinct personality is less clear when the environment is unpredictable. An ability to modulate behaviour can be beneficial, although as behavioural plasticity itself may be costly this depends on the levels of environmental stability. Both boldness and its plasticity are linked with physiological stress coping mechanisms, whereby animals with reduced glucocorticoid responses to stress are bolder and less flexible in behaviour. We investigated the behavioural changes made by bold and shy rainbow trout, and the magnitude of those changes, in response to predation risk and exposure to two environmental challenges. Behavioural and physiological responses under biotic (either no, predictable or unpredictable predation risk) and abiotic (temperature increase or hypoxia) factors were measured. Boldness was determined using a standard novel object paradigm. In general, after exposure to the treatments, fish exhibited less extreme bold or shy behaviour; the greatest change was observed in fish exposed to hypoxia, or those exposed to high risk particularly in shy fish held at a lower temperature. Higher risk also resulted in increased stress, suggesting that extreme bold or shy behaviour might have been maladaptive under a potential predator threat. These results represent novel evidence that boldness is flexible depending upon particular environmental challenges, with important implications for populations facing environmental extremes caused by anthropogenic activity and climate change.

AB I outline how understanding the mechanism of behavioural plasticity is important for predicting how organisms will respond to rapidly changing and novel environments. I define two major forms of behavioural plasticity: developmental and activational. Developmental plasticity refers to the capacity of a genotype to adopt different developmental trajectories in different environments. Activational plasticity refers to differential activation of an underlying network in different environments such that an individual expresses various phenotypes throughout their lifetime. I suggest that the costs and benefits of these two forms of behavioural plasticity may differ: developmental plasticity is slow, but results in a wider range of more integrated responses. Furthermore, the neural costs associated with activational plasticity may be greater because large neural networks must be maintained past an initial sampling and learning phase. While the benefits of plasticity are realized in variable environments, I argue that fine-grained and coarse-grained variation may differentially select for activational and developmental plasticity, respectively. Because environmental variation experienced by an organism is largely determined by behaviour, developmental plasticity may still evolve in fine-grained environments if niche choice results in coarse-grained 'realized' variation. Behavioural plasticity should impact evolution in novel environments because it increases the chances of survival in these environments. Developmental behavioural plasticity may be particularly important for diversification in novel environments because it can impact not only survival, but also the development of signals and preferences important in mate choice. Future areas of research on behavioural plasticity and rapid environmental change include stress as a mechanism underlying rapid integrated responses and life history perspectives on predicting developmental versus evolutionary responses.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests that sexual conflict is all pervasive, although cooperation is evidently needed in sexually reproducing organisms. While male mating success is typically positively associated with resource-holding potential, old male mating success prevails in some organisms despite old males being in greatly reduced condition. We tested whether this counterintuitive pattern is the outcome of (1) sexual conflict or (2) female preference for older males in the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Our results support the first hypothesis as females that mated with older compared to younger males showed reduced hatching success of eggs and higher remating propensity, and tended to show shorter refractory periods. Thus, females apparently try to compensate for reduced fitness arising from mating with older (low-quality) males by being more willing to remate, especially with young and/or virgin (high-quality) males. As mating with older males negatively affects female fitness, old males may acquire a mating advantage by being more aggressive and persistent during courtship, in line with the residual reproductive value hypothesis. Thus, males increase their own reproductive success at the expense of their female partners, such that the 'cooperation-conflict balance' between the sexes seems to be shifted towards conflict in B. anynana.

AB Specialized defence traits and strategies are crucial in surviving enemy attacks and in resource acquisition. In numerous social insect lineages, soldiers function as specialized defence traits of the colony, but associated defence strategies are poorly known. The turtle ant Cephalotes rohweri is an obligate cavity-nesting ant with highly specialized soldiers. To maximize growth and reproduction, colonies must use their limited availability of soldiers to defend multiple cavities. Using laboratory experiments informed by field data, we addressed how soldier 'deployment' across cavities adjusts to changes in cavity availability and quality. From initial field-like conditions, soldier deployment to newly available cavities was rapid, stabilized quickly, and at least doubled the number of cavities defended by each colony. New cavities were defended by fewer soldiers than original cavities still in use. Nevertheless, when new cavities differed in size, an important quality metric, large cavities were used more often and defended by more soldiers than small cavities. Despite these dynamic responses, total soldier deployment to new cavities was limited to an approximately constant proportion (0.4) of overall soldier availability across colonies and resource contexts. Moreover, there was a significant positive relationship between total soldier deployment to new cavities (greater for larger colonies) and both the number of newly defended cavities and their average level of defence. These results demonstrate that colony-wide soldier deployment is dynamic, predictable and context sensitive but ultimately constrained by the availability of soldiers in the colony. Furthermore, the consistently lower number of soldiers in new cavities, which always limits the potential losses to enemies, is concordant with a 'conservative bet-hedging' life history strategy. Broadly, our findings show that a specialized soldier caste can be associated with a far more sophisticated defence strategy than previously recognized. This provides a more complete perspective on the evolution of soldier-based defences in insect societies. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Differences in food availability across life stages may have varying influences on adult male traits, potentially providing perceiving females with a wealth of information about environmental effects and a male's ability to cope with them across a variety of timescales. We use the wolf spider, Schizocosa floridana, to test the effect of variable food abundance on male reproductive success. Schizocosa floridana males perform elaborate courtship displays consisting of seismic signalling accompanied by waving and tapping of sexually dimorphic, pigmented forelegs. Previous research has shown that female mate choice is based upon some, but not all, aspects of this display and that the expression of some components is influenced by juvenile food availability, demonstrating the condition dependence of certain traits. We expand on this previous work by independently manipulating both juvenile and adult resource availability in a fully crossed 2 x 2 design and subsequently assessing male mating success and phenotype expression. We found that mating success was affected by a complex interaction between juvenile diet, adult diet and courtship rate. The significant three-way interaction indicates that females assessed males reared on a high juvenile diet and a low adult diet differently than they did males in all other treatment groups, suggesting that females incorporate information about a male's past and current foraging experience into complex mate choice decisions. As a confirmation of the effectiveness of our diet treatments, we documented a significant effect of juvenile diet on leg pigmentation and a significant effect of adult diet on body condition, yet these traits alone did not interact with courtship rate to predict male mating success.

AB Aggregation is a prerequisite for transitions from a solitary to a social life. One evolutionary route to sociality implies the maintenance of cohesion among juveniles. The study of the influence of ontogenesis on mutual tolerance appears of fundamental importance for understanding social transitions. Spiders are particularly relevant models to address these questions. All solitary spiders have a transient gregarious phase prior to their dispersal and solitary and social species are included within the same genus. We characterized the patterns of aggregation during ontogenesis in the solitary spider Agelena labyrinthica. Our results showed that the intensity of aggregation in solitary spiderlings declined from the day of emergence to the sixth week. We developed an agent-based model implementing behavioural rules measured experimentally to explore their relative contribution in the ontogenetic shift in social behaviours observed in solitary spiders. Combining experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrated that aggregation relied on a modulation of individual behaviours depending on the number of conspecifics perceived locally and that the decline in aggregation with age relied on variations in the strength of interattraction occurring during ontogenesis.

AB Floral scents learned during the waggle dance, a signal through which honeybees provide nestmates with spatial information on foraging sites, are an important component of recruitment. Forager bees can be reactivated to go to previously exploited food sources by perceiving scents they learned at the flowers within the dance context. Here, we tested whether floral scents experienced not at the foraging site, but via scented nectar inside the nest, can influence subsequent recruitment. We determined that bees that were exposed to scented food while in the hive tended to follow dances in which the recruiting bee presented the same odour experienced 8 days earlier. Moreover, a higher proportion of bees with in-hive experience were successfully recruited to the feeding sites scented with the experienced odours than to the feeding sites scented with novel odours. This bias in recruitment was independent of the time that the bees spent following dances. These findings suggest that associative memories acquired even as early as the first week of adult life were responsible for a variation in recruitment. We discuss our results in terms of the adaptive value of the long-term olfactory memories acquired inside the nest as a facilitator to decode the spatial information transmitted in the honeybee dance.

AB Studies of bear cognition are notably missing from the comparative record despite bears' large relative brain size and interesting status as generalist carnivores facing complex foraging challenges, but lacking complex social structures. We investigated the numerical abilities of three American black bears, Ursus Americanus, by presenting discrimination tasks on a touch-screen computer. One bear chose the larger of two arrays of dot stimuli, while two bears chose the smaller array of dots. On some trials, the relative number of dots was congruent with the relative total area of the two arrays. On other trials, number of dots was incongruent with area. All of the bears were above chance on trials of both types with static dots. Despite encountering greater difficulty with dots that moved within the arrays, one bear was able to discriminate numerically larger arrays of moving dots, and a subset of moving dots from within the larger array, even when area and number were incongruent. Thus, although the bears used area as a cue to guide their responses, they were also able to use number as a cue. The pattern of performance was similar to that found previously with monkeys, and suggests that bears may also show other forms of sophisticated quantitative abilities.

AB Vocal plasticity is the ability of an individual to modify its vocalizations according to its environment. Humans benefit from an extreme form of vocal plasticity, allowing us to produce a wide range of sounds. This capacity to modify sounds has been shown in three bird orders and in a few nonhuman mammal species, all characterized by complex vocal communication systems. In other mammals, there is no evidence for a social impact on vocal development. We investigated whether contact calls were affected by social environment and kinship during early ontogeny in goats, a highly vocal and social species. To test the influence of social environment on kid vocalizations, we compared half siblings raised in the same or different groups. The effect of kinship on calls was assessed by comparing full siblings with half siblings. Calls of half siblings were more similar when they had been raised in the same social group than in different groups, and converged with time. Full siblings had more similar calls than half siblings. The group-specific indicators in kid vocalizations show that goat call ontogeny is affected by their social environment. This suggests that vocal plasticity could be more widespread in mammals than previously believed, showing a possible early pathway in the evolution of vocal learning leading to human language.

AB Experiments indicate that selection against aggression in mammals can have multiple effects on their morphology, physiology, behaviour and psychology, and that these results resemble a syndrome of changes observed in domestic animals. We hypothesize that selection against aggression in some wild species can operate in a similar way. Here we consider the bonobo, Pan paniscus, as a candidate for having experienced this 'self-domestication' process. We first detail the changes typically seen in domesticated species including shifts in development. We then show that bonobos show less severe forms of aggression than chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and suggest that this difference evolved because of relaxed feeding competition. We next review evidence that phenotypic differences in morphology and behaviour between bonobos and chimpanzees are analogous to differences between domesticates and their wild ancestors. We then synthesize the first set of a priori experimental tests of the self-domestication hypothesis comparing the psychology of bonobos and chimpanzees. Again, bonobo traits echo those of domesticates, including juvenilized patterns of development. We conclude that the self-domestication hypothesis provides a plausible account of the origin of numerous differences between bonobos and chimpanzees, and note that many of these appear to have arisen as incidental by-products rather than adaptations. These results raise the possibility that self-domestication has been a widespread process in mammalian evolution, and suggest the need for research into the regulatory genes responsible for shifts in developmental trajectories in species that have undergone selection against aggression.

AB Field studies in urban environments have shown that birds sing with higher frequencies in response to noise, but so far there are no perceptual data showing benefits of high-frequency songs over low-frequency songs under typical urban noise conditions. In this study we investigated the potential effects of specific frequency use in different environments on the perceptual performance of trained great tits, Parus major, in the laboratory. Test signals consisted of song phrases shifted both up and down in frequency. The subjects had either to detect test songs or to discriminate between test songs in both urban and woodland noise conditions. In the detection experiment, auditory thresholds were on average 6 dB better for high-than low-frequency song variants in urban noise, while in woodland noise there was no difference in detectability. In the discrimination experiment, the great tits showed different patterns of discrimination in urban compared to woodland noise conditions. Discrimination between low-frequency song variants in urban noise was less efficient than discriminating between other frequency variants, which was not the case in woodland noise. Our analysis revealed that features concerning the high-frequency elements of the songs were used in urban noise, while the birds used more features of the whole songs to solve the discrimination task in woodland noise. Our results on the perceptual abilities of birds under urban noise conditions provide rare and novel insights on the receiver side complementing many studies on noise-level-dependent frequency use on the sender side.

   COOPERATION
AB Natal dispersal is a strategy employed by individuals to avoid reproducing with close relatives. In most bats, incestuous matings are prevented by the departure of one sex; thus, all-offspring philopatry has rarely been recorded in these mammals. Here we present evidence of all-offspring philopatry to natal groups in a Neotropical insectivorous bat. Our results are derived from behavioural observations of a long-term, capture-marker-capture study conducted on three populations of Spix's disc-winged bat, Thyroptera tricolor. Results indicate that dispersal patterns of this species are characterized by low emigration rates (0.40-0.73 individuals per year), long residence times (492-1238 days) and high offspring retention of both sexes within natal groups. The retention of offspring resulted in groups being primarily composed of one or two matrilines. Our study is the first to demonstrate such high amounts of male and female natal philopatry coupled with limited spatial movements in bats. These dispersal patterns may be explained by morphological and ecological constraints associated with costly flight dynamics and significant variation in the distribution and quality of habitat, in addition to social benefits accrued by remaining affiliated with close kin.

AB In group-living or social species intraspecific predation and cannibalism can lead to substantial decreases in inclusive fitness because related individuals may encounter one another. Therefore, selection on the ability and accuracy of kin recognition to avoid losses in inclusive fitness is expected. Competition and relatedness are two key factors for the evolution of siblicide and cannibalism. However, our knowledge of the temporal dynamics and the accuracy of kin-mediated siblicide and cannibalism is scarce and experiments have usually focused on either relatedness (kin recognition) or weight asymmetry (dominance and competition) as independent components. In an experiment we set up mixed-kinship groups of three nymphs of the European earwig, Forficula auricularia Linnaeus, a gregarious and (sub-) social species, to investigate the combined effects of relatedness and weight asymmetry on the temporal dynamics of siblicide and cannibalism. We found that the temporal dynamics were jointly influenced by relatedness and weight asymmetry among nymphs. Weight asymmetry effects on siblicide and cannibalism were stronger between unrelated individuals than between related individuals as shown by a significant relatedness*weight asymmetry interaction on survival patterns. The opportunity to choose between related and unrelated individuals did not enhance the accuracy of kin recognition but induced the above interaction between relatedness and weight asymmetry on cannibalistic outcomes. These results show that relatedness and weight affect siblicidal and cannibalistic behaviour, and that their combined effect depends on the social context.

AB An important decision for individuals of many species is how to balance the need to forage against encounters with potential dangers. The proximate emotional cues that animals use to make complex foraging decisions are poorly known. We therefore investigated how behavioural and physiological responses to three different environments were linked with foraging decisions in 72 laying hens, Gallus gallus. The environments were F (additional foraging materials), FR (additional foraging materials and a cue indicating risk of predation) and R (risk cue only). Hens spent 3 weeks in one environment, followed by 3 weeks in another. The two environments were then linked with a tunnel and, on seven occasions, the hens chose one of them. The entire procedure was repeated twice so that the hens' responses and choices were assessed for every possible pair of environments. Across the experiment we predicted transitive preferences of the form F > FR > R. We modelled associations between responses and decisions using a hierarchical statistical model. Overall, hens preferred environments in the pattern predicted, but with considerable interindividual variation. Hens chose environments associated with lower stress (specifically lower corticosterone levels and lower faecal water content) in this foraging context, suggesting they could use emotional state variables as a proximate method of choosing between complex environments. Positive choice was further associated with less head shaking, self-scratching, standing alert and feeding, and more foraging and sitting alert during a novel object test. Our results, alongside previous work, suggest that some of these responses are good general indicators of emotional valence. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Changes in activity in animal groups are a potential source of group fragmentation if members do not coordinate themselves. This coordination can become further complicated when individuals within a group face conflicts of interest. We experimentally induced symmetrical conflicts of interest over which direction to choose in meerkat, Suricata suricatta, groups. We trained dominant and subordinate individuals to expect food at locations in opposite directions when the group was still at its sleeping burrow (i.e. before the group started foraging). Trained individuals were more likely to initiate group departure in the direction of their rewarded location and there was no difference between dominants and subordinates in initiation rate. Initiation of group departure seemed to be the most important factor determining the final direction of the group, as the direction chosen by the first initiator was rarely challenged. We did not observe any obvious signals used to enhance recruitment during this process. Over the experimental days, initiator identity changed suggesting that individual motivation to initiate group departure varies from day to day. Meerkats voluntarily avoided immediate foraging benefits to maintain cohesion with the group, which probably prevented them from incurring costs associated with becoming isolated. We conclude that individuals refrain from initiating group splits when conflicts of interest are low and any individual can take the lead, often without the use of obvious signals other than the displacement itself.

AB Measures of individual quality, especially energetic resources, have long been linked to investment in reproduction. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying this relationship are not well understood. In this study, we examined glucocorticoids as a potential mediator linking individual quality to investment in reproduction, because glucocorticoids have been associated with measures of both energetic resources and reproduction. We manipulated energetic resources (feather-clipping handicap) and glucocorticoids (corticosterone-soaked dermal patch) in female tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, and measured reproductive investment (offspring provisioning rate). Feather clipping was performed approximately 10 days before the first behavioural trial, while corticosterone patches were applied the day before the second behavioural trial. Prior to corticosterone manipulation, handicapped females provisioned their offspring at a lower rate and had lower levels of endogenous free corticosterone than control females. Also prior to the corticosterone manipulation, there was a trend for a negative association between endogenous corticosterone and offspring provisioning rate. There was no effect of the corticosterone manipulation on offspring provisioning rates, but there is some uncertainty regarding the efficacy of the manipulation. Overall, these results do not support the hypothesis that glucocorticoids are the primary physiological mechanism linking quality and reproduction, as measured by offspring provisioning behaviour. Instead, individuals facing a sustained reduction in quality lower their circulating levels of free corticosterone perhaps to mitigate the negative effects of their handicap to themselves and their offspring.

AB Nutrient balancing is well known in herbivores and omnivores, but has only recently been demonstrated in predators. To test how a predator might regulate nutrients when the prey varies in nutrient composition, we restricted juvenile Pardosa prativaga wolf spiders to diets of one of six fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, prey types varying in lipid: protein composition during their second instar. We collected all fly remnants to estimate food and nutrient intake over each meal. The spiders adjusted their capture rate and nutrient extraction in response to prey mass and nutrient composition irrespective of energy intake. Intake was initially regulated to a constant lipid plus protein mass, but later spiders fed on prey with high proportions of protein increased consumption relative to spiders fed on other prey types. This pattern indicates that the spiders were prepared to overconsume vast amounts of protein to gain more lipids and energy. The spiders also regulated protein after ingestion, and ingested protein was incorporated less efficiently into body tissue when the prey was protein rich. Despite both pre- and postingestive nutrient regulation, the body lipid: protein compositions of the spiders were highly affected by the nutrient compositions of their prey, and growth in carapace length and lean body mass increased with increasing prey protein: lipid ratio. Our results demonstrate that prey nutrient composition affects these predators, but also that the spiders possess behavioural and physiological adaptations that lead to partial compensation for these effects.

AB The manipulating androgens hypothesis (MAH) proposes that female birds increase the level of testosterone (T) in their eggs to promote greater offspring begging, and thereby elicit increased provisioning by their mates. We examined the effect of a positive in ovo manipulation of T on provisioning by house wren, Troglodytes aedon, parents, and concomitantly examined the begging response of nestlings. We also examined the mass of nestlings throughout their growth to assess the effect of T on their development, and three measures of nest performance: hatching success, nestling survival and the proportion of nestlings that fledged. Nestlings hatching from T-injected eggs begged more than nestlings hatching from control (oil-injected) eggs early in the nestling period, but not later in the nestling period. However, treatment had no effect on the levels of parental provisioning or nestling mass gain, nor any effect on hatching success or nestling survival. There was a significant increase in parental provisioning rate, but a decline in the size of prey taken to the nest over the course of the breeding season, which was likely the result of declining environmental quality. Our results support neither the MAH, nor the expectation that nestlings should grow at different rates in relation to in ovo titres of T. (c) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Parents allocate food resources to their offspring in proportion to the intensity of begging behaviour. Begging encompasses several activities including vocalizations that should honestly signal need and jostling for the position in the nest where parents predictably deliver food items. Although siblings are known to adjust begging level to each other, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We examined this issue in experimental two-chick broods of the barn owl, Tyto alba, a species in which siblings communicate vocally with each other in the prolonged absence of parents. The function of sib-sib vocal communication, so-called sibling negotiation, is to resolve conflicts over which individual will have priority of access to the next delivered indivisible food item. We found that when a nestling produced longer negotiation calls and stood closer to the nestbox entrance in the absence of parents, its sibling vocally negotiated at a lower rate. Additionally, when an individual produced more negotiation calls in the absence of parents, its sibling begged less intensely at the parent's return, with begging being the key factor that determined which nestling obtained a food item. We conclude that position in the nest and the duration of negotiation calls produced in the absence of parents influence the rate of producing negotiation calls, which in turn influences the rate at which siblings beg for food from their parents. Adjusting begging behaviour could therefore depend on complex sib-sib interactions taking place in the prolonged absence of parents. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many animal signals given during agonistic interactions are thought to convey levels of aggressive motivation of signallers, but few studies have experimentally tested whether such signals actually predict subsequent aggressive behaviour. In songbirds, the predictive content of most putatively aggressive vocal signals remains largely unresolved. Prior studies of agonistic vocal signalling in birds have generally assessed the reliability of vocal displays using indirect response measures such as approach to a playback speaker. However, this method does not allow aggression to be assessed directly, because subjects have no opportunity to engage in actual attacks. In this study, we assessed the aggressive content of vocal signals in black-throated blue warblers, Dendroica caerulescens, using a direct measure of aggression. We presented territorial males with a brief period of conspecific song playback, recorded their vocal responses, and then revealed a taxidermic mount, giving subjects an opportunity to attack. We found that one song feature, low-amplitude 'soft' song, was an extremely reliable predictor of attack; a logistic regression model in which the occurrence of soft song was the sole predictor correctly classified 93% of males as attackers or nonattackers. By contrast, four other vocal behaviours (total number of songs, rate of song type switching and numbers of two nonsong vocalizations) failed to predict whether birds would attack the mount. These data provide evidence that soft song in black-throated blue warblers conveys extremely reliable information about impending aggression. We suggest that the reliability of soft song observed in this study and recent studies in emberizid sparrows may be stabilized by vulnerability costs because the limited distance with which it can be transmitted forces signallers to place themselves at risk of retaliatory attack.

AB Burying beetles exhibit elaborate biparental care, in which a male and a female bury a carcass upon which they rear their brood and defend it against conspecific competitors. If an intruder succeeds in taking over the carcass, it kills the entire brood and rears its own young on the remaining resource. However, the resident male and female are able to discriminate between an intruder and their breeding partner, and assist their mate in driving off intruders of either sex. Efficient brood guarding requires effective recognition and discrimination mechanisms. Theory predicts that the setting of the optimal acceptance threshold should be affected by the rates of interaction with desirable and undesirable individuals, and shift towards a less permissive threshold when the probability of encountering intruders increases. Here we provide a critical test of acceptance-threshold theory by investigating discrimination rules during reproduction in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. The beetles typically discriminate between their breeding partners and conspecific intruders based on a class-specific discrimination rule: they generally accept beetles that are also caring for larvae ( whether their own partner or not), but are aggressive towards all nonbreeding beetles. However, we demonstrate that this recognition system is flexible at the level of individual experience and changes with context. After the introduction of an intruder, rejection rate increased, which was manifested as a shift from class-specific to individual-specific discrimination: males suddenly began discriminating between their own breeding partner and novel breeding females, and were more aggressive towards the latter. We show that the plasticity in the recognition system is not caused by template updating, but instead by a flexible acceptance threshold. Our experiments suggest that breeding males learn the individual features of their own breeding partner, but set their acceptance threshold depending on the risk of encountering an intruder.

AB In studies of animal behaviour, researchers have long been concerned that their presence may change the conduct of their study subjects. To minimize observer effects, researchers often habituate their study animals. The premise of this method is that, with sufficient neutral exposure, animals will stop reacting to humans. While numerous studies demonstrate that negative responses to humans decrease over time, the fact that an animal does not flee from or behave aggressively towards observers cannot be taken as evidence that it is not altering its behaviour in other, more subtle ways. Because remotely monitoring the behaviour of wild animals is difficult, it has not been possible to answer the critical question: do habituated animals change their behaviour when researchers are present? Here, we use data from an automated radiotelemetry system that remotely monitored the movement and activity of radiocollared animals to test whether observers affected the behaviour of seven habituated white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus. We found no evidence that observers influenced the ranging behaviour or activity patterns of their study subjects. Capuchins did not move faster, stop to rest less frequently, or display higher levels of activity when they were being followed compared to when they were alone. It has been suggested that researchers may embolden habituated study subjects, artificially increasing their relative dominance, but we found no relationship between observer presence and proximity to neighbouring social groups. Although it remains possible that observer effects existed but were too subtle to be detected with the remote sensing technology we used, the results of this study nevertheless provide reassuring evidence that humans can observe habituated wild animals without overly influencing the animals' activity and movement patterns.

AB A growing body of evidence suggests that many prey attempt to prevent attack by signalling that they have detected a predator and are able to escape. Much of the evidence for pursuit deterrence is indirect in that signalling is not shown to reduce probability of attack. Indirect evidence is obtained by eliminating alternative hypotheses and demonstrating that signals are directed to predators. Other studies have shown that signalling is related to single predation risk factors. Because prey need not signal at low risk and should attempt to escape immediately when at high risk, pursuit-deterrent signals should occur most frequently at intermediate risk. Tests of escape theory have demonstrated that flight initiation distance (predator-prey distance when prey flees) increases as risk associated with various risk factors increases. I show that in the lizard Callisaurus draconoides, which signals by waving its tail, probability and timing of signalling are affected by degree of risk for several factors that strongly affect flight initiation distance, specifically distance to refuge, speed and directness of approach, and predator persistence. Flight initiation distance increased with risk for all factors, but for all but one factor, relationships to risk differed between signalling and escape, and differences were readily predicted from functional differences between these behaviours.

AB Grooming and avoidance of contaminated areas are among the behavioural defences employed by animals against parasites. Antiparasite defence behaviour is costly in terms of time, energy and/or food foregone and therefore animals are expected to modulate their defences depending on the risk of attack and/or the severity of the symptoms caused. We tested the hypothesis that an insect host invests more in defence against more virulent (more likely to cause death) than less virulent parasites. We tested avoidance and grooming of adult pine weevils, Hylobius abietis, in response to infective juveniles of two species of entomopathogenic nematodes, the more virulent Steinernema carpocapsae and less virulent Heterorhabditis downesi. Weevils avoided feeding on a substrate contaminated with S. carpocapsae but not H. downesi. Weevils also groomed more when their bodies were contaminated with S. carpocapsae than either H. downesi or water. We also made direct observations of nematodes on weevils. When equal numbers of nematodes were applied to weevils more S. carpocapsae than H. downesi moved actively on the weevil's cuticle. Thus, the differential response of weevils to the two nematode species can be explained by the weevils detecting the more aggressive behaviour of S. carpocapsae than H. downesi, which corresponds to a higher probability of death.

AB Several species of nonhuman primates respond negatively to inequitable outcomes, a trait shared with humans. Despite previous research, questions regarding the response to inequity remain. In this study, we replicated the methodology from previous studies to address four questions related to inequity. First, we explored the impact of basic social factors. Second, we addressed whether negative responses to inequity require a task, or exist when rewards are given for 'free'. Third, we addressed whether differences in the experimental procedure or the level of effort required to obtain a reward affected responses. Finally, we explored the interaction between 'individual' expectations ( based on one's own previous experience) and 'social' expectations ( based on the partner's experience). These questions were investigated in 16 socially housed adult chimpanzees using eight conditions that varied across the dimensions of reward, effort and procedure. Subjects did respond to inequity, but only in the context of a task. Differences in procedure and level of effort required did not cause individuals to change their behaviour. Males were more sensitive to social than to individual expectation, while females were more sensitive to individual expectation. Finally, subjects also increased refusals when they received a better reward than their partner, which has not been documented previously. These results indicate that chimpanzees are more sensitive to reward inequity than procedures, and that there is interaction between social and individual expectations that depends upon social factors.

AB Trade-offs between the costs and benefits of growth are thought to be mediated by behaviour, whereby rapid growth is associated with greater predation mortality because of increased foraging effort. We tested this hypothesis by collecting young Pomacentrus amboinensis using light traps and settling them onto patch reefs where their behaviour and survivorship were monitored for 24 h. One month later, individuals of the same cohort were collected from shallow reefs and released onto patch reefs where their behaviour and survivorship were monitored for 6 days. At settlement young fish suffered high (60% in 24 h) mortality that preferentially removed larger, faster-growing individuals. However, we could find no evidence that foraging behaviour contributed to this selective mortality. In contrast, 1 month later the same cohort underwent negative size-selective mortality where the smallest, slower-growing fish were preferentially removed by predators. Larger fish spent more time foraging, were more aggressive, swam greater distances and chased more fish than smaller individuals. Thus, consistent individual differences in behaviour contributed to patterns of mortality, but in a way that involved no apparent trade-off with growth. For P. amboinensis, consistent variation in growth may be maintained by spatial and temporal differences in the selective regime within the reef environment.

AB Displacement activities, which are typically locomotory, grooming and object-manipulation behaviours, have been shown to reduce stress. However, their function within the motivational system remains unclear. I tested the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during transitions between motivational states, using the honeybee model system. I observed a number of locomotory and grooming behaviours performed when foraging honeybees returned to the hive to dance. These focal behaviours occurred significantly more frequently during the period of transition from waggle dancing to exiting the hive to forage than during the periods before the waggle dance or during the waggle dance. By contrast, the control behaviour, trophallaxis, was distributed across time periods significantly differently, occurring with equal frequency in all periods. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during motivational transitions. Evidence from other species suggests that the most likely function is facilitation, rather than inhibition, of the transition. The wide range of species in which displacement activities have been identified suggests that they are a universal feature of motivational control.

AB The notion that the immune system of potential mates can influence adaptive mating decisions is more than 25 years old and has sparked many fruitful investigations of mating behaviour and the fitness consequences of mate choice. Prior empirical work has focused on (1) assortative mating based on major histocompatibility complex alleles and (2) trade-offs between reproductive effort and immunocompetence that signal mate quality. These two approaches to understanding the link between immunity and mate choice have remained separate. Given that the immune system must flexibly respond to pathogens that an individual encounters over the course of a lifetime, it is important that researchers begin to incorporate both genetic and phenotypic indexes of immunity in studies of mate choice. Here, I outline several ways that investigators can begin to use a combination of immunogenetic and immunocompetence data to answer open questions about the influence of immunity on mate choice.

AB Mechanosensory use is a seldom-mentioned function for feather ornaments, yet recent experimental evidence showed that the elaborate facial plumes of crevice-dwelling whiskered auklets, Aethia pygmaea, have just such a sensory role. Here we explored the evolutionary patterns of mechanosensory function of similar facial feather ornaments in related species. In an experimental chamber (maze) devoid of visible light, crested auklets, A. cristatella, a close relative of the whiskered auklet, showed an increase in head bumps (262%) after trial flattening of their forehead crest. The frequency of head bumps in the absence of the crest was positively correlated with the natural crest length of the crested auklet. There was no correlation between crest length and head bumps when we added an artificial crest to least auklets, A. pusilla, which do not have a natural crest. Thus, only the ornamented Aethia species that breed in deep-crevice appear to have detectable mechanosensory ability. A pairwise analysis across all nonpasserine bird families further revealed a greater frequency of elongated facial plumes in birds that live in complex habitats and are active during low light conditions. We suggest that selective pressure enforced by complex habitats may trigger facial feather exaggeration for mechanosensory use. Once the primordial sensory structures evolved, sexual and other social selection processes could act on these traits and lead towards further exaggeration.

AB The removal of previously stored rival sperm and increased ejaculate expenditure are effective male sperm competition tactics to ensure paternity. We examined both behaviours and their interaction for male cuttlefish, Sepia lycidas, as a strategic investment. Males increased the duration of sperm removal and the number of ejaculations per mating when they were not the last male who had mated with the current partner. These responses would decrease the number of rival sperm and increase the male's own sperm in the fertilization area. Recognition of the female's mating history appeared to result from close mate guarding during successive matings. Moreover, when the last mate of the current partner was different from the current mate, there was a significant negative relationship between sperm removal duration and the number of subsequent ejaculations. This interaction suggests both strategic investment allocation and constraints on each mating investment as possible results of mating interruption by other males and spermatophore depletion, respectively. In addition, larger males with high competitive ability prolonged sperm removal when the last mate of the current partner was different from the current mate, whereas smaller males with relatively larger testes ejaculated more times during a mating. Male S. lycidas might adjust the duration of sperm removal at the risk of failing to achieve ejaculation and allocate their finite ejaculate expenditures based on the results (i.e. the increasing proportion of their own sperm).

AB The social environment can act as an important selective force on both morphological and behavioural traits by conferring a reproductive advantage on individuals that successfully navigate social interactions. The ontogeny of these social traits is poorly understood. We examined whether increasing exposure to more complex social environments could hone competitive skills and ultimately increase reproductive success in adult brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. We created two types of flocks ('Dynamic' and 'Stable') that differed in social complexity. In Dynamic flocks, birds were regularly exchanged across groups, whereas in 'Stable' flocks, the composition of birds remained static throughout a year. Social networking analyses revealed that males in the Dynamic flocks had larger and more variable singing networks during the manipulations than did the males in the Stable flocks. When we put males from the two conditions together into new environments with unfamiliar females, the Dynamic-condition males had greater mating success. Our results establish a link between social competence and reproductive success and suggest that social skills are extremely flexible characteristics, even in adulthood.

AB In social insects, each behavioural group holds information that may be crucial for the colony's functioning and regulation. We investigated which behavioural group plays the key role in the regulation of recruitment and how it manages to tune the foraging effort according to the level of starvation in the colony. We focused on recruiters and recruits: Recruiters hold information concerning the characteristics of the food source whereas domestics and potential recruits may be better informed about the colony's needs because of the constant contact that they have with their recruits and/or larvae. We imposed different starvation levels on nest-workers and recruiters and observed their interactions. The level of starvation did not alter the behaviour of the recruiters. However, we observed a change in the recruits' response to the recruiter's signal if the starvation level increased. This induced more recruits and thus more workers foraging in starved colonies. In nonstarved colonies, recruits did not respond to the recruitment signal and no recruitment occurred. Our results suggest that the recruits' response is the major key to the regulation of the recruitment process. This study has deciphered how individuals assess the colony's needs and integrate all the information to build up an optimal food exploitation strategy adjusted to starvation.

AB In species where males look after the offspring, females are under strong selection to adopt choice strategies that allow them to find good fathers. I investigated female choice strategies in the scissortail sergeant, Abudefduf sexfasciatus. In a manipulation experiment where the position of clutches was altered, some females laid small clutches to test males and only went back to males if the test eggs were cared for. Test eggs allowed females to select good fathers, whereas usual predictors of parental quality, such as male body size and courtship rates, seemed ineffective. However, test eggs were used only by 7.4% of females at the very beginning of the male's mating phase, probably because of the high cost of this strategy. When possible, females preferred to mate with already guarding males. By pooling eggs in nests that already contained the clutches of other females, they diluted the cost of predation and cannibalism by the parental male, and obtained higher hatching success for their broods.

AB Female sexual receptivity is a behaviour at the crux of mechanistic and evolutionary perspectives of reproductive behaviour. To gain insight into the general processes by which a male persuades a female to mate with him, we tested whether the courtship pheromones of the red-legged salamander, Plethodon shermani, dampened female defensive or ingestive behaviours. Females did not sprint significantly shorter distances to evade startling stimuli when experimentally treated with pheromone solution compared to a control. However, females did consume 25% fewer fly larvae when treated with pheromone compared to a control. The female's maintenance of normal defences suggests a behavioural state that is unresponsive or resistant to pheromone stimulation, but the change in feeding activity indicates that suppression of female hunger is beneficial to male mating success. Together, these results indicate that male courtship pheromones may augment female receptivity by modulating the expression of other competing or inhibitory motivated behaviours.

AB In many species, predation risk at oviposition sites causes females to avoid high-risk sites. Previous studies, however, have focused on assessment of current risk at the site during oviposition. Whether memory of previous risk plays a role has not been considered. We examined whether memorized risk affects oviposition site selection in the water strider Aquarius paludum insularis. Aquarius paludum eggs are laid on vegetation on or in the water and are frequently parasitized by a parasitoid wasp. Eggs at deeper positions are less frequently parasitized than those near the surface. After one of three treatments (no, low or high wasp density), A. paludum females were allowed to oviposit in parasitoid-free aquaria. The depth of oviposition of females that had previously experienced high wasp density was greater than that of those that had not experienced wasps. However, the difference in oviposition depth between low-density and no-wasp treatments was slight although significant. This indicates that A. paludum makes the decision on oviposition depth in response to the egg parasitism risk experienced before oviposition. The effect of the memorized risk was largest just after the treatment and became weaker over time. A measurable effect persisted for 28 days.

AB Frog choruses are dynamic social environments in which males must balance the conflicting demands of attracting a female and defending their calling site. The optimal trade-off is probably one that adaptively tracks temporal and spatial changes in the local social environment. Previous studies have indicated that a male frog's propensity to interact aggressively with its nearby neighbours reflects patterns of plasticity that could allow for such tracking. We presently do not know the mechanisms underlying plasticity in aggressive signalling in frogs, nor do we understand how plasticity depends on variation in social context. In this field playback experiment with spring peepers, Pseudacris crucifer, we investigated how differences in the type of signalling interactions (a form of social context) experienced by calling males influence the plasticity of aggression directed towards nearby neighbours in the chorus. We used the habituation-discrimination experimental paradigm to present males with calls simulating a new neighbour that was initially either aggressive (producing a mixture of advertisement and aggressive vocalizations) or nonaggressive (producing only advertisement calls). We found that interacting with an initially aggressive versus nonaggressive neighbour had negligible effects on the plasticity of a male's aggressive response, but that subsequent changes in social context (e. g. a switch to aggressive calling by a previously nonaggressive neighbour) greatly influenced a male's aggressive responsiveness. We discuss our results in terms of short-term habituation as a mechanism for the plasticity and specificity of aggressive signalling behaviour in frog choruses.

AB Breeding synchrony occurs when individuals simultaneously perform portions of the reproductive cycle more often than expected by chance. We tested for the role of social stimulation in driving breeding synchrony of European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, in a spatially-structured population in New Zealand over 11 years. Natural spreads in laying in groups were consistently tighter relative to aggregations of individuals chosen at random. Rather than a decrease in synchrony with increasing density, as would be expected if competition reduces breeding condition, we found that birds in dense breeding areas showed tighter synchrony. As the number of active nests within 500 m of a breeding location (i.e. human-constructed concrete bunkers) increased, the spread in clutch initiation date decreased. There was a correlation between synchrony and. edging success; less synchronous locations had lower. edging success. These results indicate that local and larger-scale levels of social stimulation may help coordinate reproductive timing in group-living birds. While the link between fitness and. edging success may not be causal, our results suggest that factors driving synchrony may also be related to individual quality and reproductive success.

AB Sperm competition theory predicts that males should adjust the number of sperm they ejaculate adaptively, according to sociosexual cues of sperm competition at the time of mating. Specifically, it is predicted that ( 1) males will respond to an increased risk of sperm competition from rivals by increasing sperm allocation, and ( 2) the increase in allocation will be lower when rivals are related. In species that use odour for communication, scent-based cues provide information on the presence and identity of conspecifics, and could thus serve as a basis for adjusting sperm allocation. We tested these predictions in the house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, a species for which scent is critical to many aspects of social and reproductive communication. Sperm allocation was measured for subject males mating immediately following exposure to odour stimuli deriving from ( 1) themselves ( control treatment), ( 2) a brother or ( 3) an unrelated male. The behavioural responses of subjects to conspecific odours indicated that males detected the presence of these stimuli in their environment, but contrary to theoretical predictions we found no evidence that they increase the number of sperm ejaculated in response to either of the odour cues indicating an elevated risk of sperm competition. Similarly, we found no significant differences between treatment groups in other traits linked to ejaculate investment, including copulatory plug size and copulatory behaviour. These findings contrast with previously studied rodent species, suggesting that responses to cues of sperm competition risk may display considerable interspecific variability.

AB Song learning in birds makes it possible for males to faithfully imitate tutors and also to generate novel improvisations. Within local dialects of the Puget Sound white-crowned sparrow, most males share the terminal trill phrase in their songs. In contrast, the introductory note complex is more variable within local populations and appears to encode individual identity. We studied the song-learning process during initial territory establishment in a wild population of white-crowned sparrows. Although most adult males sing a single song type, many yearling males overproduce song types early in their first singing season before deleting all but one song type from their repertoire. We asked whether this attrition process favours retention of a song with a note complex that resembles that of a male's neighbour, as would be predicted by various hypotheses assuming a benefit to song sharing, or whether it favours retention of a distinctive note complex, which would produce individuality in song. We found that males that initially overproduced song types retained shared note complexes, and that these males were more likely to share their adult note complex with neighbours than were young males that did not overproduce. Only 51% of recruits overproduced, however, and we close by speculating that overproduction and close song sharing may be correlates of male quality and learning ability.

AB Many species use specific vocalizations that attract conspecifics to food sources or that recruit other group members to inspect secondary predator cues or to mob predators. However, little is known regarding the variation in the acoustic structure of such calls and the associated meaning. In the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose, Mungos mungo, we investigated calls produced in the context of group recruitment to three different stimulus types: ( 1) secondary predator cues; ( 2) snakes; and ( 3) members of rival groups. Calls produced in response to predator faeces differed from the harsher variants elicited by snakes and rival groups, but the latter two elicited similar calls. Only a few calls of intermediate acoustic structure were produced in response to the different stimulus categories. Playbacks of calls elicited by the different stimuli caused individuals to approach the speaker in the same way. However, calls elicited specifically by snakes and rival mongooses resulted in a higher proportion of receivers responding and a faster receiver response than calls elicited by faeces. This suggests a graded rather than a discrete recruitment call system. Thus, despite obvious differences in stimulus type and the purpose of recruitment, the acoustic structure of calls conveys information about the risk of the encountered stimulus and not the stimulus type itself, allowing receivers to adjust their response according to the urgency. Since calling continued for prolonged periods after all group members had gathered around the callers, these calls may also function to deter rivals and to coordinate the subsequent group response.

AB Field studies on male forest guenon alarm-calling behaviour have revealed a number of intricacies about how these primates use vocalizations to protect themselves from predation. In these species, the vocal behaviour of adult females is often different from that of the males, but little systematic work has been done. Here, we describe the alarm call system of female Campbell's monkeys, Cercopithecus campbelli, in their natural forest habitat in western Ivory Coast. We found that in response to disturbing events, females produced three basic alarm call types, 'wak-oos', 'hoks' and acoustically variable 'trill' calls, consisting of repeated and rapidly ascending (RRA) pulses, which varied systematically in the temporal and frequency domains. Using observational and experimental data we were able to demonstrate that the RRA calls consisted of four acoustic variants, which could be associated with specific contexts, allowing listeners to draw inferences about the type of disturbance experienced by the caller. We also compared the alarm call behaviour of free-ranging individuals with published results from captivity. As predicted, captive individuals failed to produce predator-specific alarm calls, but they also produced an RRA variant in response to humans that was absent in the wild. We discuss the relevance of these findings in terms of their broader potential impact on evolutionary theories of primate communication. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ability to recognize and accurately interpret facial expressions is critically important for nonhuman primates that rely on these nonverbal signals for social communication. Despite this, little is known about how nonhuman primates, particularly monkeys, discriminate between facial expressions. In the present study, seven rhesus monkeys were required to discriminate four categories of conspecific facial expressions using a matching-to-sample task. In experiment 1, the matching pair showed identical photographs of facial expressions, paired with every other expression type as the nonmatch. The identity of the nonmatching stimulus monkey differed from the one in the sample. Subjects performed above chance on session 1, with no difference in performance across the four expression types. In experiment 2, the identity of all three monkeys differed in each trial, and a neutral portrait was also included as the nonmatching stimulus. Monkeys discriminated expressions across individual identity when the nonmatch was a neutral stimulus, but they had difficulty when the nonmatch was another expression type. We analysed the degree to which specific feature redundancy could account for these error patterns using a multidimensional scaling analysis which plotted the perceived dissimilarity between expression dyads along a two-dimensional axis. One axis appeared to represent mouth shape, stretched open versus funnelled, while the other appeared to represent a combination of lip retraction and mouth opening. These features alone, however, could not account for overall performance and suggest that monkeys do not rely solely on distinctive features to discriminate among different expressions.

AB Males of the pentamorphic fish, Poecilia parae, show a striking colour polymorphism that ranges from drab coloration resembling females to brilliant black and red stripes. We tested the hypothesis that the observed polymorphism may persist because each morph uses a unique but equally successful mating strategy. We quantified the mating behaviour, testes investment and sperm morphometrics of each morph. We found that the smallest morph (immaculata), which resembles drab females, used a 'sneaker' tactic (i.e. forgoing courtship and mostly 'stealing' copulations) as a mating strategy. Immaculata males also had larger testes, and produced larger ejaculates and sperm with longer. agella, which should provide advantages during sperm competition. The largest morph ( parae) and the coloured blue, red and yellow morphs used a combination of courtship and sneaker tactics. However, they achieved greater copulation success as a result of courtships. The testes investment of parae and yellow morphs were similar but larger than those of the blue and red males. Our results suggest that male morphs of the pentamorphic Poecilia parae use unique mating strategies that exploit different aspects of pre-and postcopulatory sexual selection, which, in turn, may help maintain their relatively stable frequencies in the wild.

AB Elaborate secondary sexual traits, such as plumage ornaments, are important signals in reproductive communication and so it is important to maintain them in good condition. Time and energy spent in their maintenance reinforce the honesty of the ornamental traits. Variation in plumage visual properties as a function of maintenance has until now received little attention. Here, we used a combination of spectroradiometric measurements of plumage coloration, a physiological model of bird vision and behavioural observations to investigate how grooming behaviours affect plumage coloration in experimentally soiled male domestic canaries. Although showing a similar total amount of grooming, dirty males showed more feather ruffling and less preening than control males, suggesting that removal of dirt does not require an increase in grooming activity and that ruffling is likely to be more efficient for removing dirt. Grooming activities were not correlated with changes in plumage reflectance, probably because the same grooming behaviour is more efficient at removing feather dirt when performed by some individuals than by others. Dirty males were distinguishable in coloration up to 2.5 h after soiling. Shoulders and throat were the dirtiest of all body parts and took males more time to clean. Taken together, these results suggest that females are able to assess visually the difference between potential partners differing in their soiling level. If grooming activity is costly, females could base their choice on the coloration of plumage areas more susceptible to soiling and difficult to clean.

AB Trophically transmitted parasites have to deal with the antipredator adaptations of their intermediate hosts. Some of these parasites induce behavioural changes in their intermediate hosts that make them more vulnerable to predation by definitive hosts. However, the adaptiveness of behavioural manipulation also depends on the probability of being eaten by a nonhost predator. Parasites might therefore try to use specific antipredator responses of intermediate hosts to avoid this dead end. We tested this hypothesis using the acanthocephalan Polymorphus minutus and its intermediate amphipod host, Gammarus roeseli. In their natural habitat, uninfected G. roeseli shelter near the river bottom while infected gammarids tend to cling onto floating materials. In microcosm experiments, infected amphipods were preyed upon by sticklebacks (nonhost predators) less than uninfected individuals when refuges were provided near the water surface. Regardless of their infection status, G. roeseli reacted to olfactory cues of predation by spending more time on refuges and near the surface. However, these behaviours were increased in infected gammarids. These results suggest that, in addition to specific induced behaviours, parasites may also enhance an existing antipredator behaviour to increase their own survival.

AB Young herring gull, Larus argentatus, chicks peck at the red patch on the lower mandible of their parent's yellow beak. In a famous study on the 'instinctive behaviour' of herring gull chicks, Tinbergen examined whether the presence, colour and position of the patch affected the pecking of the chicks. While this experiment is often cited as demonstrating a preference for a red patch, the original data showed that chicks pecked more at a black-patched model (Tinbergen 1948, De Levende Natuur, 51, 49-56). Tinbergen later ascribed this unexpected outcome to a methodological error in his experiment: the red-patched model was presented more frequently than all the others, which made him adjust his data later on. We repeated Tinbergen's experiment (experiment 1), using replicas of the original models. We also did the experiment as Tinbergen described it later on (but which he never carried out), presenting all models equally often (experiment 2). Our results confirm that red is not the most preferred colour when it is presented more often than other colours. In experiment 2 the relative ranking of all models was the same as in experiment 1, with the exception of the red-patched one, which was now preferred most, as expected by Tinbergen. Our findings also confirm that the more frequent exposure to the red model in experiment 1 resulted in a disproportionate decline in interest for this model. So, although he never did the actual experiment, Tinbergen's intuition and corrected data show a reasonable match to the results of our experiment.

AB Spatial memory is important for animals to achieve successful foraging, reproduction, territorial defence and predator avoidance in structurally complex habitats. This cognitive function has been shown to be affected under stress conditions in surface-dwelling rodents. Here we used the Tala's tuco-tuco, Ctenomys talarum, a subterranean rodent that inhabits complex burrow systems, as a study model. This species has a highly developed spatial ability and individuals are regularly exposed to predatory stress while foraging on the surface. We examined the consequences of a single and brief exposure to predatory cues on the spatial working and reference memory performance. We trained wild-caught individuals (32 males, 36 females) in a six-arm radial maze (spatial working memory task) or a longitudinal maze (spatial reference memory task). Once the animals reached a memory performance criterion, they were exposed to a direct predatory cue (immobilization), an indirect predatory cue (cat urine odour) or both cues combined, and their memory performance was evaluated. Exposure to direct and combined predatory cues impaired spatial reference memory, increasing both the latency to achieve the goal and the number of errors during the test. Combined presentation of both predatory cues also negatively affected spatial working memory, but only for latency to achieve the goal.

AB Controversy exists regarding the nature of primate social relationships. While individual primates are frequently hypothesized to form enduring social bonds with conspecifics, recent studies suggest that relationships are labile, with animals interacting only over short periods to satisfy their immediate needs. Here I use data collected over 10 years on a community of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, to investigate whether male chimpanzees establish long-term social relationships and to determine the factors that affect variation in relationship quality and the stability of social bonds. Kinship and dominance rank influenced the quality of relationships. Maternal brothers and males of the same dominance rank class groomed each other more equitably than did unrelated males and males that were dissimilar in rank. In addition, males that formed strong social bonds groomed more equitably than did males that displayed weaker bonds. Social bonds were stable over time, with relationships in one year predicting those in subsequent years. Kinship and the quality of social relationships affected bond stability. Maternal half siblings and males that groomed each other equitably maintained longer-lasting bonds than did nonkin and males that groomed each other unevenly. Virtually all of the males established at least one enduring relationship with another individual. The most enduring bonds formed between a few pairs of maternal brothers and dyads that maintained balanced grooming interactions. These results indicate that male chimpanzees maintain long-lasting and equitable social bonds whose formation is affected by maternal kinship and the quality of social relationships.

AB Darwin developed the theory of sexual selection to account for the evolution of weaponry, ornamentation and other secondary sexual characters that are commonly more developed in males and which appeared unlikely to contribute to survival. He argued that these traits had evolved either through intrasexual competition between males to monopolize access to females or through consistent female preferences for mating with superior partners. Since 1871, a substantial body of research has confirmed his explanation of the evolution of secondary sexual characters in males, although sex differences in reproductive behaviour are more diverse and the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for them are more complex than was initially recognized. However, secondary sexual characters are also widespread in females but, as yet, their evolution and distribution have received relatively little attention from evolutionary biologists. Here, I suggest that the mechanisms responsible for the evolution of secondary sexual characters in females are similar to those operating in males and include intrasexual competition between females for breeding opportunities, male mating preferences and female competition to attract mates. Unlike males, females often compete more intensely for resources necessary for successful reproduction than for access to mating partners and the development of secondary sexual characters in females may be limited by costs to fecundity rather than to survival.

AB In some taxa, females choose their mates indirectly by using male combat. In the Kanzawa spider mite, Tetranychus kanzawai, adult males guard prereproductive quiescent females. In a dual choice experiment, more males first approached females already guarded by a conspecific male than approached solitary females. In further experiments, I examined which factors attracted males during precopulatory mate guarding. Males were not attracted to males not in a mate-guarding position. In contrast, the presence of a nonbreeding individual, a juvenile male or a female in a mate-guarding position did attract conspecific males. These results suggest that the presence of any conspecific individual in a mate-guarding position stimulates quiescent females to produce chemicals that attract males. Guarded quiescent females also attracted the attention of the predatory mite, Neoseiulus womersleyi, but solitary females did not. Since N. womersleyi search for prey using chemical cues, guarded females that release more chemicals than solitary females are probably in more danger. However, males were not attracted to guarded quiescent females that had been previously exposed to N. womersleyi. Thus, quiescent females appeared to control the release of their chemicals, that is, guarded quiescent females release a male-attractant signal. When more than one male attempts to guard one female, male combat often occurs. I discuss the possibility of indirect mate choice by T. kanzawai females during precopulatory mate guarding facilitated by the use of male-attractant signals.

AB While mate choice is often assumed to be based on an absolute value that may reflect underlying male quality, many mating systems facilitate the comparative evaluation of males. Females can encounter a number of potential mates, either sequentially or simultaneously, before making a mate choice decision. Consequently, the attractiveness of one male may depend on the attractiveness of other males a female has previously encountered. To examine whether female choice in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi is based on the comparative evaluation of males, I altered the social context in which a set of males were encountered. Using a robotic crab system to manipulate claw size and wave rate directly, I determined female preference for two male options in the absence and presence of an asymmetrically dominating decoy option. The decoy male option was designed to change the relative attractiveness of the initial two male options. The presence of the decoy significantly altered the absolute preference, but not the relative preference, for the two male options. While this study clearly demonstrates that female U. mjoebergi are not using strict absolute preferences when ranking each male's attractiveness, it does not conclusively support comparative evaluation mechanisms. One possibility is that sexually selected traits in a complex signalling system often vary in how reliably they reflect male quality, and females may use a combination of absolute and comparative measures when assessing male quality.

AB Warthogs, Phacochoerus africanus, are an unusual ungulate. They are facultative cooperative breeders where females within the same population display both solitary and cooperative reproductive strategies. Warthogs require burrows for sleeping and rearing their young, yet they are unable to dig their own burrows and rely on aardvark excavations. Studies of warthogs have failed to show any reproductive benefits to females participating in communal care and suggest a reproductive cost to cooperation. The ecological constraints hypothesis proposes that environmental factors limit an individual's ability to successfully disperse and reproduce. In this study we investigated whether limitations in burrow sites can explain cooperative breeding in this species. We checked over 500 burrows for signs of use systematically for 1 year to determine whether burrows were a limiting resource and to investigate burrow use preferences. Our methodology allowed us to determine whether burrows were used by adults with young or by adults without young. We found that burrow availability did not appear to pose an ecological constraint on independent living, as the percentage of burrows used remained relatively low throughout the year. Additionally, the number of burrows in a warthog clan area did not influence the percentage of females breeding cooperatively. Predator avoidance appeared to be the main factor influencing individual burrow selection by warthogs and communal nesting may best be explained as a form of antipredator behaviour.

AB Species that vary in social structure within and among populations can provide unparalleled insight into the evolution of sociality. The theridiid spider Anelosimus studiosus varies widely in its social structure at the northern edge of its range. Colony sizes range from the solitary/territorial female with her offspring to cooperative colonies of tens to hundreds of adult females. In previous work, we developed an assured fitness returns 'brood-fostering model' that predicts that in cooler environments mothers in multiple-female colonies will have a selective advantage over solitary female nests. According to the model, at cool sites the rate of juvenile maturation is slowed, increasing the probability that the mother will die before the brood reaches independence. In her absence, other females would foster her brood. We tested this hypothesis by manipulating colony size and by monitoring the reproductive success of naturally occurring solitary and multifemale colonies in cold and warm temperature environments. Our results indicate that while multiple-female colonies have higher fitness at cool sites, the solitary female nests achieve higher fitness at warmer sites. The higher reproductive success of multifemale colonies at cold sites further reflects the total failure of solitary female nests at these sites. Solitary female nests that survived generally had higher reproductive success than multifemale colonies at all temperatures. In natural colonies, fitness was highest for smaller multifemale colonies in the colder environments and decreased in the larger colonies. We use these data to re. ne the brood-fostering model and discuss the results with regard to the observed polymorphism in social structure. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Among social insects, awareness of the presence of queen(s) or reproductive individuals is crucial to the maintenance of group cohesion. Although it is fairly well established that information on the queen's presence is chemical, little is known about how this information is transmitted among colony members. In Diacamma sp., direct physical contact informs nestmate workers of the presence of the gamergate. We investigated the pattern and efficiency of transmission of gamergate information to workers in Diacamma sp. Workers could sense the absence of a gamergate and switch their behaviour within 3 h of being orphaned. However, even in colonies with gamergates present, some workers failed to encounter the gamergate within 3 h of their last contact. This transmission inefficiency increased with increasing colony size. Nevertheless, workers in colonies of a natural size range usually refrained from reproducing in the presence of gamergates. This suggests that self-restraint by workers in response to the perception of queen presence alone does not explain the absence of worker reproduction. The gamergate increased her frequency and duration of walking around in the nest as the colony size increased, possibly to improve contact efficiency and police worker reproduction. Simultaneously, dominance and policing behaviours by workers occurred more frequently with increased colony size. Our study shows that multiple complementary mechanisms, such as policing, dominance and self-restraint, regulate the reproductive division of labour in Diacamma sp. We also report the novel finding that the relative importance of these mechanisms can change over time as the colony grows. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Female mate preferences can favour the evolution of complex secondary sex traits in males. A mechanism increasingly explored to explain the origin of such male traits is sensory exploitation. Under sensory exploitation, female mating preferences are by-products of sensory biases that originate previously (often in nonreproductive contexts). Tungara frogs (Engystomops) have offered a widely known example for this mechanism. Male E. pustulosus make a complex call by adding a chuck to their typical whine call. Previous studies reported that the evolution of complex calls was driven by a female sensory bias that originated in the common ancestor of Engystomops, before the origin of complex calls. Here, I carry out mate choice experiments and new phylogenetic and comparative analyses to reevaluate the evolution of female mate choice and courtship calls in tungara frogs. My results indicate that the chuck and its corresponding female preference have coevolved in a process that is compatible with Fisherian or good genes sexual selection. Character reconstructions show that both the chuck and the female preference have originated multiple times among closely related lineages. I found no support for previously proposed scenarios of sensory exploitation in Engystomops, and the mate choice experiments indicated that increased stimulation of the sensory system by the male courtship signal does not necessarily translate into increased female preference. This finding highlights the significance of central processing in mate choice decisions. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Investment in mates and offspring typically reflects a trade-off between survival and reproductive potential. Individuals should therefore invest according to potential fitness benefit. Males typically cannot ascertain their probability of paternity directly, but this can often be approximated from mating success. In fowl, mating frequency and fitness are both predicted by the rate at which males produce alarm signals. These novel phenomena suggest insights into the evolution of apparently altruistic signals. However, as in virtually all studies examining the adaptive value of alarm calling, the relations between behaviour and its possible benefits are correlative. Demonstration of a causal relationship requires experimental evidence. There are two likely models of the relation between alarm calling and reproductive success. Calling, like other costly traits, might be attractive to females. Alternatively, calling might result from recent mating success and hence be a form of mate investment. Here, we test the latter possibility by manipulating the mating success of male fowl. Results show that males increase their alarm-calling effort as a function of their recent mating success. This provides strong support for the mate investment hypothesis and is the first demonstration of a causal link between mating frequency and alarm calling.

AB Play behaviour is widespread in mammals, but benefits to play have been difficult to demonstrate. Physical training is one of the many proposed hypotheses, suggesting that males and females should play differently, that increased maternal investment should lead to increases in play, and that increases in play should result in physical advantages. In a population of feral horses, Equus caballus, males and females did not differ in their play behaviour except that males initiated more of their play bouts than females. Maternal condition influenced play behaviour only in males, with sons of mothers in good condition playing more. However, when we controlled for maternal effects by comparing a son and a daughter of the same mother, daughters played more when their mother was in poor condition and sons played more when their mother was in good condition. Mothers of foals that played more lost more condition. Therefore, the difference in play behaviour could not be explained by offspring sex or maternal condition alone, but play behaviour mirrored variation in maternal investment. In addition, those individuals that played more survived better and had better body condition as yearlings despite weaning earlier. Since increased activity has been linked to enhanced musculoskeletal development in domestic horses, we suggest that play provides a link between increased maternal investment, increased body condition and future reproductive success in feral horses, and probably in other species.

AB Numerous territorial species are less aggressive towards neighbours than strangers. This tolerance towards neighbouring conspecifics, termed the 'dear enemy' effect, seems to be a flexible feature of the relationship between neighbours, and has been shown to disappear in some species after experimental or natural modi. cations of the context. However, the maintenance over time of this singular relationship has been poorly studied. In this study, we followed the change of dear enemy relationships during the breeding season in a territorial songbird with a complex song, the skylark. We examined in the field the response of territory owners to playbacks of neighbour and stranger songs at three periods of the breeding season, corresponding to three ecological and social situations. Results showed that neighbours were dear enemies in the middle of the season, when territories were stable, but not at the beginning of the breeding season, during settlement and pair formation, nor at the end, when bird density increased owing to the presence of young birds becoming independent. Thus, the dear enemy relationship is not a fixed pattern but a flexible one likely to evolve with social and ecological circumstances. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When a female parasitoid encounters a previously parasitized host she may reject it or accept and oviposit in/on it (superparasitism), frequently adding one or more eggs after killing some of the offspring in the initial clutch (infanticide). Herein we document these behaviours in a facultatively gregarious endoparasitoid wasp, Metaphycus flavus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), when females encounter unparasitized and parasitized brown soft scales, Coccus hesperidum (Hemiptera: Coccidae), 2 h, 2 days or 4 days after their initial parasitism. We also report the consequences of such behaviours for their offspring survival. Females discriminated unparasitized scales from parasitized scales independent of the time elapsed since the first oviposition and they often oviposited on parasitized scales after killing some of the offspring in the first clutch. Immature parasitoid mortality was a dominant feature of this host-parasitoid interaction and it depended on the occurrence of superparasitism and the time interval between ovipositions. In single clutches, encapsulation of parasitoid eggs was the major source of immature mortality. Encapsulation rates decreased when a second clutch of eggs was added; consequently, superparasitism appears advantageous. When the time interval between ovipositions was long (2-4 days), encapsulation rates decreased again, but most of the younger larvae of the second clutch were consumed by the older larvae of first clutch in superparasitized hosts. Under these circumstances a female should avoid superparasitizing these hosts, or she should kill the eggs or larvae already present in it before allocating a clutch of eggs.

AB Eusocial bee ( Apidae) foragers are able to mark food sources with olfactory attractant or repellent signals. Because these bees also have an excellent ability to learn associatively, they may be able to associate forager- deposited marks either positively or negatively with food depending on reward quality. We provide the first field experiments showing such a context- based interpretation of field information (odour marks and visual local enhancement) in stingless bees. We sequentially exposed individual foragers of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana to three situations in which one feeder was marked with either the visual presence of nestmates ( sealed inside clear containers to prevent odour release) or odour marks alone. In the first situation, we offered two equally rewarding sucrose feeders ( unscented 2.5 M sucrose solution). In this case, experienced foragers showed no preference on their subsequent visits to any of the feeders, even though the marked feeder was made more conspicuous with odour marks or the visual presence of nestmates. In the second situation, experienced foragers significantly preferred the marked feeder when it offered a sucrose reward. In the third situation, when the marked feeder offered no carbohydrate reward ( only water) and the unmarked feeder offered sucrose, the experienced foragers avoided the marked feeder and significantly preferred the unmarked one. Thus, foragers learned to associate food quality positively or negatively with chemical or visual marks at the food source. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB There has been substantial interest in whether birds use small degrees of asymmetry (fluctuating asymmetry, FA) in visual communication. However, there is a scarcity of experimental evidence for the visual role of FA. Hence, there is still much debate as to whether FA could be a visual cue. We address this issue by exploring whether European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, can perceive small asymmetries in digital representations of a visual communication trait: white plumage spots on dark throat and chest feathers. Through a series of operant learning trials, we trained starlings to discriminate symmetry from an initially large asymmetry ( 50% relative asymmetry in the position and number of dots) and then reduced the asymmetry through subsequent learning and unreinforced test trials. Six of seven birds could reliably detect a 25% asymmetry and one bird could detect a 15% asymmetry. There was no evidence for discrimination of a 10% asymmetry. Therefore, we propose that starlings express a limit for detection of asymmetry in this complex structured trait between 10 and 15% relative asymmetry. We discuss this limit in light of natural plumage asymmetries and conclude that most individuals in a wild population would probably be perceived as equally 'symmetric', rendering FA in such a trait an unlikely cue in visual communication. We also discuss the commonalities between this apparent limit to asymmetry detection and other reports of perception in European starlings and pigeons, Columba livia, and suggest that our findings could be applied cautiously to other avian systems.

AB Most animal displays make use of multiple sensory modalities (visual, acoustic and chemical signals) to convey similar information. Although multimodal displays may allow producers to use displays in a wider variety of social and physical contexts, it is difficult to explain their evolution because of the likely increased costs to senders and receivers. In this study, playback experiments in two contexts were used to study the behavioural responses to visual (headbob displays) and chemical (femoral pore secretions) signals in sagebrush lizards, Sceloporus graciosus. Lizards in the field tended to headbob in response to headbob displays and to engage in chemical exploratory behaviour when presented with chemical secretions. Territorial residents produced fewer headbob displays and head-turns in response to a combined signal produced by a robotic lizard than they did to either signal presented alone. This inhibition was confirmed in the laboratory, where presentation of a visual stimulus alone decreased chemical exploratory behaviour and presentation of a chemical stimulus alone decreased the number of headbob displays produced. The absolute cost of this interaction between sensory modalities may be low because the two behavioural responses are redundant, both allowing the receiver to acquire additional information, either by engaging a second lizard in a bout of interactive visual displays or by absorbing more of their scent. Thus, in sagebrush lizards, multiple signals may be evolutionarily maintained because behavioural responses to different sensory modalities are redundant and, hence, the cost of negative interactions between those responses is low.

AB Current socioecological models predict that clumped food resources influence aggression, yet definitions of clumped resources often include two concepts: time spent at the resource and distance between resources. To disentangle these two aspects of clumping, we conducted an experiment on 15 multimale-multifemale groups (range 50-110 individuals) of captive rhesus macaques at the California National Primate Research Center in which we varied both food size and interfood distance independently to test which factor more significantly influenced two forms of feeding competition, contest competition and punishment. At interfood distances of 1-6 m, two same-sized apple pieces of 1 g, 5 g, 15 g or 30 g were offered to the monkeys simultaneously during each of 297 trials. Aggression was recorded 5 min before the arrival of the food, when the food arrived and 5 min after. Results of the independent effects of food size revealed that larger food size was significantly associated with both contest competition and punishment. Interfood distance was not significantly associated with either contest competition or punishment. These results suggest that the size or handling time of food may be a better predictor of within-group aggression than is the spatial distribution of food.

AB Animals gain antipredation benefits from being in larger groups through increased probability of predator detection, dilution of individual risk of being attacked and confusion of predators during attack. A further benefit is that individuals in larger groups can decrease the amount of time they spend being vigilant, while maintaining a high probability of predator detection. They may then gain extra time to forage, so increasing overall intake rate. Increasing group size, however, can also increase competition so that intake rates decrease. We investigated whether there was a foraging benefit in redshanks, Tringa totanus, that show the group size decrease in individual vigilance. Intake rates did not change with group size, despite an increase in time spent foraging. Interference competition increased with group size because individuals travelled more to find prey. Redshanks used the extra time available to forage to maintain intake rates under increased competition. Although the group size effect on vigilance did not accrue direct foraging benefits, larger groups formed, conferring other antipredation benefits. Intake rates were maintained because the interference competition was compensated by the benefits of reduced individual vigilance. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Xiphophorus continens is one of two northern swordtail species that has only small, noncourting, sneaker males. In this study we discovered that female X. continens were strongly attracted to the scent of courting males of their close relative X. montezumae and that they preferred the odour of those males to the scent of conspecific males. The heterospecific attraction is asymmetric; female X. montezumae were not attracted to the scent of X. continens. These results suggest that the olfactory cue is in fact multicomponent, transmitting information about both the species identification (conspecific versus not a conspecific) and sexual status (sneaker male versus courting male) of the sender. These two 'bits' of information can interact in either a mutually reinforcing or an antagonist manner depending upon the choice being offered. Xiphophorus montezumae females choosing between X. montezumae/X. continens males are faced with mutually reinforcing cue components: 'conspecific + courting male' versus 'not a conspecific + sneaker male'. Xiphophorus continens females making the same choice, however, are faced with conflicting cue components: 'conspecific + sneaker male' versus 'not a conspecific + courting male'. We suggest that the strength of attraction to the conspecific based upon olfactory cues in these fishes represents the complex outcome of the female's attraction to the different components in the male-based cue.

AB The honeybee, Apis mellifera, dance language, used to communicate the location of pro. table food resources, is one of the most versatile forms of nonprimate communication. Karl von Frisch described this communication system in terms of two distinct dances: ( 1) the round dance, which indicates the presence of a desirable food source close to the hive but does not provide information about its direction and ( 2) the waggle dance, which indicates the presence of a desirable food source more than 100 m from the hive and its provides information about both its distance and its direction. The view that honeybees have two discrete recruitment dances has been widely accepted since its inception in the 1920s. However, there are few detailed examinations of the behavioural parameters of dances over the range of food-source distances represented by round dances and waggle dances. Here, we show that both the round dance and the waggle dance convey information about distance and direction and that there is no clear switch between the two. We conclude that it is most meaningful to view the round and waggle dances as the ends of a continuum and that honeybees have just one adjustable recruitment signal: the waggle dance.

AB Information sent by multimodal communication (i.e. signals in multiple sensory modalities) may be redundant('backup' signals) or may vary in content with each mode ('multiple messages'). Males of the brush-legged wolf spider, Schizocosa ocreata ( Hentz) ( Araneae: Lycosidae), use complex multimodal ( visual and seismic) courtship signals. The visual component has previously been shown to be a condition-dependent signal used by females in mate choice. Here, we examine female choice based on isolated seismic signals to identify which aspects females use to evaluate males, and to determine whether visual and seismic signals are redundant. Females showed receptivity when exposed to the seismic component of male courtship alone. The attributes of seismic signals best predicting female receptivity were peak amplitude, peak frequency and maximum frequency of percussive strikes and stridulation pulse duration. Moreover, two behavioural attributes associated with seismic signals, cheliceral strike rate and double-tap rate, were also good predictors of receptivity. Males eliciting female receptivity were in better condition, and attributes of seismic communication were correlated with male size and mass, suggesting the possibility of information about male quality in seismic communication. Trait correlations also revealed overlap in information contained within visual and seismic channels. Given this overlap, we conclude that seismic and visual signals are largely redundant and may serve as backup signals but might also convey information about different male attributes. The use of redundant signalling would be adaptive in S. ocreata because this species inhabits structurally complex forest leaf litter environments where signals can be attenuated rapidly.

AB The regulation of parental supply and offspring demand was modelled for altricial birds. The situation might differ for precocial species, where offspring can also feed themselves. We investigated the effect of supply and demand on mother-offspring interaction in precocials by cross-fostering pups between the domestic guinea pig and its ancestor, the cavy. The two are closely related, yet guinea pigs are heavier and produce more milk than cavies. We thus created a low-supply situation for pups raised by cavy mothers and a high-supply situation for pups raised by guinea pigs. Females nursing cavy pups confront low demand; those nursing guinea pig pups confront high demand. Pups in a high-supply situation showed more sucking attempts than pups in a low-supply situation, indicating a positive effect of supply on demand. High-demand pups showed more sucking attempts than low-demand pups. Mothers with high-demand pups nursed more frequently and spent more time nursing than mothers with low-demand pups. Milk production remained unaffected and timing of weaning was only slightly adjusted to the kind of pup fostered. Weaning was marked by decreasing of sucking attempts and maternal responsiveness and by increasing aggression. Mothers apparently received information about pup demand, but maternal state seemed to induce the weaning process largely independent of pup demands. The effect of supply on demand differed from predictions of current models. Differences in parent-offspring interaction in altricials and precocials deserve more research attention.

AB Associations between ants of the genera Crematogaster and Camponotus are found in many parts of the world. Associated species use common trails (trail sharing) or even share a common nest (parabiosis). In a tropical lowland forest in Malaysian Borneo, we studied intraspecific and interspecific aggression among the parabiotic species Crematogaster modiglianii and Camponotus rufifemur using both field and laboratory assays. Cr. modiglianii tolerated Ca. rufifemur workers from certain foreign colonies but fiercely attacked those of others. In contrast, Ca. rufifemur was tolerant even towards attacking allocolonial Cr. modiglianii workers but killed other Crematogaster species. By analogy, other Camponotus species usually attacked and killed Cr. modiglianii. Intraspecific confrontations among Ca. rufifemur colonies yielded a gradient from allocolonial tolerance to strong aggression. The aggression patterns coincide with those of Cr. modiglianii towards Ca. rufifemur workers from the same colonies. Our results suggest either that Ca. rufifemur is not able to recognize allocolonial Cr. modiglianii workers as foreign or that they are recognized but tolerated. The unilateral, species-specific but not colony-specific tolerance of Ca. rufifemur towards its partner species contrasts with highly colony-specific tolerance found among neotropical parabioses.

AB Aposematic conspicuous coloration consists of one or a few bright colours, often in combination with a black defined internal pattern. The function of conspicuousness in aposematism has been ascribed to signal efficacy, based on experimental evidence involving prey items with uniform colour that contrast with the background. Although there are several hypotheses about the existence of internal contrasts within warning coloration, little experimental evidence has been presented. Here we used domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, to investigate the relative importance of colour and pattern in avoidance learning. Birds in two groups were first trained to discriminate between a grey positive stimulus and a cyan negative stimulus with either black dots or stripes. Pieces of mealworms, untreated and palatable or made unpalatable by soaking in quinine were used as reinforcers. Secondly, to determine what birds had attended to when learning the discrimination, colour and/or pattern, we compared how they generalized their avoidance of the 'training stimulus' to either a 'colour only' or 'pattern only' stimulus. The chicks learned to avoid the unpalatable prey items but showed no difference in behaviour depending on the type of pattern presented. The generalization test showed that birds avoided the novel 'colour only' stimulus at least as much as the 'training stimulus', and did not generalize their avoidance to the 'pattern only' stimulus. We conclude that birds do not necessarily attend to complex patterns when learning a warning signal, and domestic chicks primarily learn a bright colour rather than an equally novel conspicuous black pattern.

AB Many male insects provide somatic nuptial gifts that may strongly influence reproductive fitness, ensuring effective copulation or mediating paternal resource benefits in offspring. Although the courtship feeding behaviour on tergal gland secretions has been described in numerous cockroaches, studies on the function of these so-called nuptial gifts are lacking in this group. In this study, we examined, in the Madeira cockroach, Leucophaea maderae, the functional significance of tergal secretions by manipulating their availability on the back of males. We tested whether male tergal secretions function as a form of mating effort, and/or as a form of paternal investment. In a first experiment, we gave females the choice between two males, one with and one without tergal secretions. In a second experiment, we gave females the opportunity to copulate with a male of these two male types. Our results showed that the difference in male mating success was significant only when females could choose between the two male types. Contrary to all past expectations, females preferred to copulate with males whose tergal secretions were experimentally removed. Additionally, we showed that females did not gain any fitness benefit from copulating with a male with tergal secretions, but it even seems to be the contrary in terms of longevity. Consequently, neither the mating effort hypothesis nor the paternal investment hypothesis has been confirmed in this species. Our results are discussed with regard to the chase-away sexual selection model. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the visual ecology of the coloration of the eastern Atlantic fiddler crab, Uca tangeri, with particular attention to predator (e.g. avian) and conspecific vision. Spectral reflectance measurements were made on different body parts used in possible intraspecific communication as well as background habitats including crab-made materials (e.g. mudballs). Avian-based and crab-based visual models were used to obtain different estimates of crab conspicuousness to potential predators and conspecifics. We found that male body parts (except for dorsal carapace) were significantly more conspicuous to conspecific viewers than female equivalent body parts, and showed greater within-body contrast estimates. Moreover, male major claw areas differed in reflectance properties, producing variation in conspicuousness that fit signalling predictions: areas visible during claw-waving events were most conspicuous against the background sky, whereas areas visible in nonwaving positions were more conspicuous against substrate backgrounds. For avian vision, sexually dimorphic coloration results in males being generally more conspicuous than females (in terms of brightness contrast) against all backgrounds, however, there was no sexual dimorphic conspicuousness of carapace coloration. Furthermore, one of the most conspicuous features of both male and female crabs is an area that is likely to be more visible to crabs (mouthparts) than to avian predators from above. While conspicuousness varies with background, the most conspicuous background for male signalling parts (major claw) is dark mudballs, suggesting that males may increase the conspicuousness of their signals by modifying their signalling environment.

AB Male green treefrogs, Hyla cinerea, attract both potential mates and satellite males with their advertisement calls. Males using the satellite mating tactic position themselves silently near a calling male and attempt to intercept females attracted to the caller. Although use of conditional mating strategies may result from competition among males, few studies have considered the importance of female mate-choice preferences on the adoption and expression of alternative mate-acquisition behaviours. In this study, I tested two hypotheses. First, satellite males produce relatively unattractive advertisement signals and hence are at a competitive disadvantage when using the primary tactic. Second, satellite males associate with males producing the most attractive advertisement calls and hence increase the chance that they will intercept a female. Satellite males recorded in the field produced advertisement calls higher in frequency and shorter in duration than those produced by callers. Females consistently preferred the lower-frequency call alternative presented in two-speaker choice experiments, although they showed no preference in regard to call duration. In a second set of two-speaker choice experiments, noncalling males showed phonotactic behaviour similar to that of females, and their acoustic preferences roughly paralleled those of females. This phonotactic response may enable males producing unattractive calls to use the satellite mating tactic in a manner that maximizes potential reproductive fitness.

AB Empirical evidence that females can copy each other's mating preferences comes predominantly from research on lekking species, but recent laboratory studies revealed that public information can also play a role in the evolution of mate preferences in monogamous species with biparental care. Although the question of why monogamous females copy each other's mating preferences is still debated, it has been suggested that public information could be used by females to assess and choose extrapair mates. Since there is only indirect empirical support for this hypothesis, I developed a game-theoretic model to explore the possible roles that mate choice copying may play in mediating extrapair behaviours in monogamous species. Like previous game-theoretic models on mate choice copying, the model predicts that only females that have a high probability of obtaining a better partner should copy the mating decisions of others. On the other hand, unlike previous games that applied to lekking species, the present model predicts that mate choice copying can be advantageous even when there is no variation among females in their discrimination ability and they all can assess the quality of potential partners without error. Moreover, as mate choice copying essentially benefits high-quality males, males of lower quality would be interested in developing defensive tactics to discourage females from seeking extrapair copulations, thereby contributing to intraspecific and interspecific variations in the rate of extrapair paternity.

AB The 'heterospecific attraction hypothesis' (HAH) has been proposed to describe interactions between migrant and resident birds where migrants may indirectly select habitats using the presence/absence of residents. This hypothesis might be extended to other taxa, such as amphibians, which migrate yearly to breeding sites, sharing them with other species. However, the ability of amphibians to be cue-users is not quite obvious as for birds, and must be assessed first. Therefore, in this study we investigated how smooth newts, Lissotriton vulgaris, oriented facing two known species (the common toad, Bufo bufo, and the green toad, Pseudoepidalea viridis) and whether they oriented preferentially towards the calls of species that indicate the more suitable pond for breeding (B. bufo). Newts showed positive phonotactic responses for both species but clearly oriented towards B. bufo when the playbacks of the two toads were presented simultaneously. Our results support the idea that the 'HAH' might be extended to other taxa than birds. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite much effort to ascertain the consequences of temperature variation for a wide range of animal performance traits, the effect of temperature on interactions among organisms is still poorly understood. The present work tests for a direct influence of water temperature on sexual recognition, mate preferences and female-female interactions in the pipefish, Syngnathus abaster. Three experiments were conducted by monitoring time spent in the vicinity of conspecifics at three water temperatures intended to reflect sea water temperatures before the onset of reproduction (15 degrees C) and during the early (18 degrees C) and late breeding season (24 degrees C). Four major results emerged: (1) S. abaster can visually discriminate potential mates from fish of the same sex; (2) males and females responded differently with the former diverting their attention towards the opposite sex at intermediate (18 degrees C) and high temperatures (24 degrees C), while the latter only showed a significant interest in potential mates at 24 degrees C, devoting an equal amount of interest towards both males and females at 18 degrees C; (3) at breeding season water temperatures, both sexes discriminated against smaller partners, preferring larger ones; (4) different-sized females adopted distinct temperature-modulated behavioural responses, possibly because large dominant females, which engage in competition at 18 degrees C, constrained the reproduction of smaller ones, which seem to compete only at 24 degrees C. These results highlight the importance of temperature as an effective agent in the modulation of S. abaster reproductive behaviour. Considerations on the ecological significance of the observed behavioural patterns are also discussed. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In nature, female crickets often encounter males sequentially, choosing whether to mate with each male they find rather than selecting the most attractive male from a pool of available mates. Upon encountering a male, a female may base her decision to mate on a particular internal threshold or on a relative standard that takes into account the attractiveness of her previous mates. Here, we test whether the attractiveness of a female's previous mating partner influences her behaviour with respect to a second mate in the decorated cricket Gryllodes sigillatus. We measured both pre- and postcopulatory female mate choice as well as the effect that postcopulatory mating guarding by males had on females' postcopulatory behaviour. We showed that in both their first and second matings, pre- and postcopulatory mate choice are congruent, as females prefer to mate with, and accept more sperm from, attractive males. However, the outcome of pre- and postcopulatory choice does not depend on the attractiveness of a female's previous mate, suggesting that females employ a single standard upon which their mating decisions are based.

AB Age- assortative mating has been documented among birds, but there is little evidence of direct benefits to females that pair with older males. In this study, I examined nest concealment in Darwin's small tree finch and tested the following predictions: ( 1) nest concealment increases with male age, ( 2) females prefer males that build well-concealed nests, and (3) females receive direct benefits through reduced predation at concealed nests. Darwin's small tree finch has a pattern of annual moult that makes it easy to observe age-related variation in reproductive success. In this species, males build a display nest that is sometimes used by the female for nesting. Controlling for male age, females preferred display nests for nesting that were well concealed by surrounding vegetation, whereas exposed display nests were rarely used for nesting ( although occasionally a female paired with the male that built the unused display nest). Using cross-sectional and longitudinal data, this study found evidence of a female pairing preference for older males, as well as increased nest concealment among older males. Females that paired with older males had higher. edging success ( using the longitudinal data), mostly due to reduced predation.

AB In theory, liberation from parental care in brood parasites should facilitate polygamous matings by both sexes. We used a combination of mtDNA and microsatellite analysis to reconstruct sibling groups of Hors. field's bronze- cuckoo chicks to infer the mating system of this species. By mapping the distribution of sibling groups we also inferred the breeding ranges and breeding duration of individual cuckoos. Genetic analysis revealed that individual female cuckoos laid distinctive egg types, enabling inclusion of data based on egg morphology. Pairs of Horsfield's bronze- cuckoos occupied exclusive breeding ranges encompassing clusters of host territories. There was a bimodal pattern in the timing and duration of breeding: early-arriving females laid eggs over a period of up to 5 weeks and were then replaced by late- arriving females, which continued laying periodically over at least 2 months. In other brood- parasitic birds polygamy is widespread. By contrast, Horsfield's bronze- cuckoo females were genetically monogamous, and males were either monogamous or sequentially monogamous. Polygamy may be constrained in Horsfield's bronze- cuckoos by the exclusive home ranges of females. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Research has shown that territories of animals are economical. Home ranges should be similarly efficient with respect to spatially distributed resources and this should structure their distribution on a landscape, although neither has been demonstrated empirically. To test these hypotheses, we used home range models that optimize resource use according to resource-maximizing and area-minimizing strategies to evaluate the home ranges of female black bears, Ursus americanus, living in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We tested general predictions of our models using 104 home ranges of adult female bears studied in the Pisgah Bear Sanctuary, North Carolina, U.S.A., from 1981 to 2001. We also used our models to estimate home ranges for each real home range under a variety of strategies and constraints and compared similarity of simulated to real home ranges. We found that home ranges of female bears were efficient with respect to the spatial distribution of resources and were best explained by an area-minimizing strategy with moderate resource thresholds and low levels of resource depression. Although resource depression probably influenced the spatial distribution of home ranges on the landscape, levels of resource depression were too low to quantify accurately. Home ranges of lactating females had higher resource thresholds and were more susceptible to resource depression than those of breeding females. We conclude that home ranges of animals, like territories, are economical with respect to resources, and that resource depression may be the mechanism behind ideal free or ideal preemptive distributions on complex, heterogeneous landscapes.

AB Song repertoires are thought to have evolved by sexual selection, with larger repertoires being advantageous in both female choice and territory defence. While most hypotheses of repertoire evolution treat different song types as functionally equal, an alternative hypothesis is that song repertoires evolved to allow song sharing with multiple neighbours. In support of this hypothesis, song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, share high proportions of their repertoires with territorial neighbours in at least three west coast populations in North America, and song sharing is correlated with a territorial advantage in at least two of these. We studied song sharing and territory tenure in an east coast population of song sparrows in North America in which song sharing is significantly less common. We found no evidence for a territorial advantage of whole song sharing in our population. We also found no evidence for a territorial advantage for partial song sharing, even though partial song sharing is as common in our population as whole song sharing is in the west coast populations. Population demographics (such as annual survival and territory density) do not seem sufficient to explain different levels of sharing between populations. Thus, we found no evidence in our population to support song sharing as a target of selection in the evolution of song repertoires. (c) 2007 The Association for the Stady of Animal Behavior.

AB Locomotion is one way that organisms interface with their environment, and this relationship can be affected by the structural habitat and behavioural context associated with each movement. Previous studies have examined the effects of habitat or behaviour on locomotion individually, but have not addressed the potential interaction between these factors. In addition, studies often use induced behaviours or manipulated habitats to examine the effects of habitat and behaviour on locomotion. Although valuable, these approaches provide little information on the range of natural behaviours and habitats that animals occupy. To address these issues, we examined the effects of structural habitat, behavioural context, and their interaction on undisturbed locomotor speeds in the ornate tree lizard, Urosaurus ornatus. Detailed video analysis revealed that both habitat and behaviour affect locomotion individually; locomotor speed decreases with increasing perch height when animals move on woody substrates and while displaying and capturing prey. Surprisingly, we found no relationship between speed and perch diameter or substrate incline. Additionally, we show that the interaction between perch diameter and feeding behaviour results in a negative relationship between speed and perch diameter during feeding but not during other behaviours. In light of these findings, we suggest that the relationship between habitat, behaviour and speed is affected by the level of locomotor performance (maximal versus submaximal) that animals routinely use during undisturbed activity.

AB Animals have evolved an impressive array of behavioural traits to avoid depredation. Olfactory camouflage of conspicuous odours is a strategy to avoid depredation that has been implicated only in a few species of birds. Burrowing owls, Athene cunicularia, routinely collect dried manure from mammals and scatter it in their nest chamber, in the tunnel leading to their nest and at the entrance to their nesting burrow. This unusual behaviour was thought to reduce nest depredation by concealing the scent of adults and juveniles, but a recent study suggests that manure functions to attract arthropod prey. However, burrowing owls routinely scatter other materials in the same way that they scatter manure, and this fact seems to be at odds with both of these hypotheses. Thus, we examined the function of this behaviour by testing four alternative hypotheses. We found no support for the widely cited olfactory-camouflage hypothesis (manure did not lower the probability of depredation), or for the mate-attraction hypothesis (males collected manure after, not before, pair formation). Predictions of the burrow-occupied hypothesis (manure indicates occupancy to conspecifics and thereby reduces agonistic interactions) were supported, but results were not statistically significant. Our results also supported several predictions of the prey-attraction hypothesis. Pitfall traps at sampling sites with manure collected more arthropod biomass (of taxa common in the diet of burrowing owls) than pitfall traps at sampling sites without manure. Scattering behaviour of burrowing owls appears to function to attract arthropod prey, but may also signal occupancy of a burrow to conspecifics.

AB Theoretical models predict that small birds should adjust daily patterns of body mass gain in response to environmental and internal factors. In a companion paper, we described a model on daily fattening that allows the analysis of precise changes in the shape of hourly patterns of body mass. In this study, we tested one of the main predictions of the model: the inflexion point of the body mass trajectory should be delayed in response to a decrease in food availability increasing body mass as soon as possible when food is scarce. This effect might be stronger in subordinate than in dominant birds. We tested both predictions with four pairs of coal tits, Periparus ater, kept in cages where food was delivered at high and low rates. Daytime increase in body mass was I g in both treatments. As predicted by the model, the tits increased body mass as soon as possible when food was delivered at a low rate, and the inflexion point of the body mass trajectory was 16.7% delayed compared to the high food delivery rate. However, dominance rank had no significant effect on the shape of daily body mass increase. To our knowledge, this is the first precise estimate of the change in the shape of body mass trajectories. Our findings have important implications for the analysis of daily patterns of body mass and for the design of studies of body mass in small birds.

AB Aggregating has been widely studied in a variety of animals and found to have important benefits in terms of sociality, courtship, predator avoidance and physiology. Several species of nocturnal geckos form diurnal aggregations; however, little is known about the benefits of these groupings. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the benefit of aggregation for the desert-dwelling western banded gecko, Coleonyx variegatus. We found that banded geckos benefit from aggregation by a reduction in evaporative water loss (EWL). No social or mating benefits were detected, and geckos did not group to avoid predators. Geckos did not select diurnal retreat sites based solely on the scent of conspecifics, although they aggregated readily when conspecifics were present. Thus, C. variegatus appear to achieve physiological but not social benefits from grouping. Banded geckos belong to an ancestrally tropical lineage whose descendants invaded present-day North American deserts at a time when these regions were more mesic. This may explain their relatively high rate of EWL. Aggregating seems to be a solution to this physiological handicap. Our study also suggests a path for the evolution of social behaviour: as animals aggregate for physiological benefits, the stage is set for the evolution of more complex social interactions.

AB Males of many species establish territories from which they exclude conspecifics, and experience can influence the cl fence and stability of territorial boundaries. We used a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure to determine whether engaging in a form of behaviour associated with territorial defence, aggressive behaviour, was rewarding for male green anoles and whether aggressive experience could alter the spatial/contextual preferences of these territorial lizards. When approached by a male conspecific, or when exposed to their reflection in a mirror, many male anoles show species-typical aggressive behaviours. We repeatedly exposed male anoles to a mirror or the nonreflective back of the mirror in opposing sides of a CPP apparatus that consisted of two contextually distinct chambers connected by a central tunnel. Control animals (N = 10) were exposed to the back of the mirror in both sides of the apparatus. Following conditioning, animals that showed aggressive behaviour (N = 13) when exposed to the mirror during conditioning increased the time that they spent in the side of the apparatus paired with the mirror relative to baseline. In contrast, the preferences of nonaggressive (N = 8) and control animals were unchanged. These findings suggest that engaging in aggressive behaviour (and not simply seeing a conspecific) is rewarding for male green anoles and that aggression-related reward and associative learning could influence the formation and/or maintenance of stable territories.

AB Philopatry or homing isolates breeding groups and therefore strongly affects population structure within a species. In salmonid fish, the movements of males among nesting females may control gene flow, and therefore affect fine-scale population structure, within and among breeding grounds. In this study, we recorded the daily movements of male sockeye salmon from three populations during the breeding period. We modelled daily movement using an exponential function and then added additional parameters to explore the extent to which movement varied between streams, between years within streams as salmon density varied, and between males of different ages/sizes. This approach revealed that: (1) in all three streams, male movement decreased as a function of time on the breeding grounds and was limited in most cases, (2) movement patterns, particularly initial exploratory movement, differed between streams, (3) movement patterns differed between years within a stream but were unrelated to density, and (4) there was little effect of age/size on movement; the small observed effect was due to differences in exploratory movement, not sustained differences over the entire breeding season. Overall, the restricted movements by males on the breeding grounds indicated that salmon populations can be structured on fine spatial scales as a result of limited gene flow within seasons if homing to precise natal locations also occurs.

ID EGALITARIAN SOCIETIES; GROOMING RECIPROCITY; APPROPRIATE ORDER;
   LINEARITY; RANKING; MODEL
AB In the analysis of social dominance in groups of animals, linearity has been used by many researchers as the main structural characteristic of a dominance hierarchy. In this paper we propose, alongside linearity a quantitative measure for another property of a dominance hierarchy, namely its steepness. Steepness of a hierarchy is defined here as the absolute slope of the straight line fitted to the normalized David's scores (calculated on the basis of a dyadic dominance index corrected for chance) plotted against the subjects' ranks. This correction for chance is an improvement of an earlier proposal by de Vries (appendix 2 in de Vries, Animal Behaviour, 1998, 55, 827-843). In addition, we present a randomization procedure for determining the statistical significance of a hierarchy's steepness, which can be used to test the observed steepness against the steepness expected under the null hypothesis of random win chances for all pairs of individuals. Whereas linearity depends on the number of established binary dominance relationships and the degree of transitivity in these relationships, steepness measures the degree to which individuals differ from each other in winning dominance encounters. Linearity and steepness are complementary measures to characterize a dominance hierarchy. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The acanthocephalan parasite, Acanthocephalus dirus, undergoes larval development in the aquatic isopod, Caecidotea intermedius, before completing its life cycle in the intestine of a fish (e.g. sunfish). Inside C. intermedius, the parasite develops through noninfective acanthor and acanthella stages and into the cystacanth stage, which is infective to definitive hosts. Research has shown that individual A. dirus induce phenotypic changes in C. intermedius that increase conspicuousness to definitive hosts, and that the level of modification is most pronounced when the parasite has developed into the cystacanth stage. We examined whether development into the cystacanth stage also correlated with changes in mating behaviour of the host. Using a field survey, we quantified the pattern of development of larval A. dirus to identify specific periods when either infective (cystacanth) or noninfective (acanthor, acanthella) stages dominated. Males infected with cystacanth-stage larvae had lower pairing success than males infected with larvae in the noninfective stages. To identify the behavioural mechanisms underlying this relation (i.e. male response to females, female resistance), we used a field-based experiment to examine the relation between parasite development and mating interactions between males and females. Cystacanth-infected males were less likely to initiate mating attempts with females than were acanthor/acanthella-infected males, and this effect could explain the population-level mating pattern. We discuss the results in the context of both adaptive and nonadaptive mechanisms underlying parasite-mediated changes in mating behaviour. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although generalist predators have been reported to forage less efficiently than specialists, there is little information on the extent to which learning can improve the efficiency of mixed-prey foraging. Repeated exposure of silver perch to mixed prey (pelagic Artemia and benthic Chironomus larvae) led to substantial fluctuations in reward rate over relatively long (20-day) timescales. When perch that were familiar with a single prey type were offered two prey types simultaneously, the rate at which they captured both familiar and unfamiliar prey dropped progressively over succeeding trials. This result was not predicted by simple learning paradigms, but could be explained in terms of an interaction between learning and attention. Between-trial patterns in overall intake were complex and differed between the two prey types, but were unaffected by previous prey specialization. However, patterns of prey priority (i.e. the prey type that was preferred at the start of a trial) did vary with previous prey training. All groups of fish converged on the most profitable prey type (chironomids), but this process took 15-20 trials. In contrast, fish offered a single prey type reached asymptotic intake rates within five trials and retained high capture abilities for at least 5 weeks. Learning and memory allow fish to maximize foraging efficiency on patches of a single prey type. However, when foragers are faced with mixed prey populations, cognitive constraints associated with divided attention may impair efficiency, and this impairment can be exacerbated by experience.

AB Territorial boundary patrols are a distinctive and unique aspect of wild chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, behaviour. Although patrolling has been frequently observed in nature and several proposed functional explanations for it exist, scant information is available regarding the proximate factors that affect this activity. We found that there is considerable temporal variation in the frequency of patrolling by chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We examined several ecological and social factors that potentially influence this variation. Results of logistic regression analyses revealed that male party size was the single best predictor of the tendency to patrol. Lethal intergroup aggression occurs in chimpanzees, and patrols are likely to be dangerous and costly. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that chimpanzees at Ngogo reduce these costs by patrolling together in large parties.

AB Energetic costs of fighting, such as high lactate or low glucose, have been shown in a range of species to correlate with the decisions made by each opponent, particularly the decision by one opponent, the 'loser', to end the fight by 'giving up'. Studies based on complete fights of differing duration, however, do not provide information on the changes in the physiological correlates of fighting that may take place during the course of the encounter, or how these changes may influence the capability and decisions of the contestants. We interrupted fights between hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, at specific points, and related energy status to the preceding activities. Costs rose quickly with a rapid accumulation of lactic acid in attackers and declining muscular glycogen in defenders. Changes in physiological status appeared much earlier than the changes in behaviour that they may have caused. Furthermore, some physiological changes might have been an effect, rather than the cause, of fight decisions. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vigilance in ungulates is considered to have a predominantly antipredator function, with the frequency and duration of scans, per individual decreasing with increasing group size. Social influences on vigilance scans have been overlooked in studies on ungulates, although studies in primates and birds show that conspecific scans are important determinants of vigilance behaviour. We investigated group size effects in giraffes and examined social influences on their scanning. behaviour, as well as the influence of feeding posture. We found that group size has little effect on scanning behaviour in either bulls or cows, which may be attributable to our inability to measure a group as perceived by a giraffe. Time spent scanning by lone cows did not differ from that of cows in any other group type, but time spent scanning by bulls when alone was less than that in groups. The presence of calves in a group did not influence scanning behaviour. Predation risk does not appear to be a significant modifier of vigilance behaviour, although a constant level of antipredator vigilance is probably maintained. Social factors were a significant modifier of vigilance scanning. Bulls scanned the most when they were in groups with larger bulls, and least when they were with smaller bulls. A similar pattern was seen with nearest-neighbour identity, and the identity of individuals within 10 in of a focal animal. Cows were significantly more vigilant when an adult bull was close, or was the nearest neighbour. Finally, vigilance advantages have been postulated as a determinant of sexual segregation in giraffe foraging heights but we found that the posture associated with high foraging heights imposes a vigilance cost, not an advantage. We therefore conclude that differential vigilance requirements are not a determinant of feeding height segregation between giraffe bulls and cows.

AB Many prey species use chemical cues deposited by predators to assess predation risk, and some prey are capable of discriminating among predator chemical traces based on the predator's recent diet. Here we test the influence of genetic relatedness (degree of genetic similarity between prey) and ecological relatedness (degree of refuge and trophic overlap between syntopic prey) on the evolution of predator-diet discrimination by red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus. In experiment 1, we examined whether red-backed salamanders from Binghamton University (Binghamton, New York, U.S.A.) would differentially respond to chemical traces from garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) fed conspecific P. cinereus from four populations belonging to three phylogenetic groups: Group II from Mountain Lake, Virginia, Group III from Binghamton University, New York, Group III from Hawk Mountain, Pennsylvania, and Group IV from Cherry Springs, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. The test salamanders only avoided chemical traces from garter snakes fed salamanders from the two Group III sites, although the response to the Group III-Hawk Mountain treatment was intermediate to that for the Group III-Binghamton University treatment and the Group 11 and IV treatments. In experiment 2, we examined whether red-backed salamanders collected from two subpopulations, syntopic or allotopic with two-lined salamanders, Eurycea bislineata, vary in their response to chemical cues from garter snakes foraging on two-lined salamanders. Only red-backed salamanders syntopic with E. bislineata avoided chemical traces from garter snakes fed E. bislineata. These results suggest that both genetic and ecological relatedness play a role in the evolution of predator-diet discrimination in red-backed salamanders.

AB To reinvestigate whether macaque monkeys could learn the reversed-contingency task, we trained six rhesus monkeys on the problem. On each trial, the monkeys chose between one and four pieces of the same food item. If a monkey selected four pieces of food, it received one instead; choice of one piece of food led to the receipt Of four. All of the monkeys initially tended to select the larger quantity of food, but eventually learned to choose the smaller amount. The results confirmed a previous report that macaque monkeys quickly reached a performance level of roughly 50% 'correct', defined as choosing the smaller amount of food, and some individuals continued to perform at that level for a protracted period of testing. Contrary to that report, however, the present findings show that macaque monkeys can master the reversed-contingency task. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   CONTEXT
AB Social status in lek-breeding species is highly correlated with mating success. Reproductive failure of subordinates may be caused either by direct aggression by dominant males or by induced physiological changes. We hypothesized that recent social status (winning or losing an encounter with another male) affects the production of courtship sounds in male Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, in the absence of dominant males. We staged dyadic encounters between males and subsequently allowed full access to a female to either the winner or the loser (one fish per dyad). We minimized possible effects of social experience by isolating the subject males before the experiments. All males courted the females but winners produced more courtship sounds than losers and showed significantly shorter courtship latencies and longer courtship durations. The sounds of winners had longer pulse durations and lower peak frequencies. Male size and condition factor, fighting latency and duration, and number of escalated agonistic acts were not correlated with number of sounds or any of the courtship parameters measured. Differences between winners and losers in courtship were probably related to transient physiological changes induced by the encounter outcome, such as changes in levels of circulating monoamines, cortisol and androgens, which can modulate courtship behaviour including sound production. We suggest that in nature the outcome of recent social interactions between males may affect the production of courtship sounds and courtship behaviour in general from the early stages of hierarchy formation.

AB In Pavlovian conditioning, animals acquire a response to a previously neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS), such as a light, if that stimulus predicts a biologically important event (unconditioned stimulus, US), such as delivery of food. Learning typically occurs when the CS precedes the US (forward conditioning), and not when the CS follows the US (backward conditioning). In social learning about predators, the predator stimulus is considered to be the CS to which observers acquire avoidance responses after the stimulus has been presented in contiguity with an alarmed demonstrator, the US. We tested the prediction that social learning of response to a predator would occur even if the social alarm cues (the US) appeared before the predatory stimulus (the CS). Carib grackles, Quiscalus lugubris, responded to a familiar predator presented at close range by suppressing alarm calls. Presentation of an unfamiliar avian model (black-and-yellow pigeon) also decreased calling, and this inhibition of calling was enhanced following a training session in which the model stimulus was presented in association with grackle alarm calls. Acquired inhibition of calling was independent of the order of presentation of the model and an alarm chorus. These are the first results to indicate that social acquisition of predator avoidance is not dependent upon a particular temporal relationship between predators and social alarm cues. Evolution may have modified some properties of Pavlovian conditioning to accommodate social learning about potentially dangerous stimuli.

   ANTIPREDATOR; DECISION; RULES; RESOLUTION; CARCINUS
AB The efficiency of predator avoidance strategies depends on the availability and accuracy of sensory information. Although vision can in principle provide instant information on a predator's position, direction of approach and identity, prey animals that face fast predators have to respond so early (close to the limits of detection) that visual cues are unreliable predictors of actual risk. This is a major problem for prey animals that have to balance predation risk with the cost of antipredator action. I investigated the visual cues fiddler crabs Uca vomeris use to decide when to run towards their burrow in response to an approaching (dummy) predator by running towards their burrow. The crabs did not always escape immediately when they first detected the dummy, but continued to monitor and assess its approach. The crabs relied on retinal image speed to trigger a home run. Retinal speed did not correlate well with the actual risk of predation because it confounded a predator's direction of approach with its speed and proximity. In an attempt to reconcile what is known about predator avoidance in semiterrestrial crabs, I propose a two-tier antipredator response system and discuss the crabs' multistage response strategy in the context of the associated costs and the availability of information. Multistage predator avoidance, which is common among prey animals, appears to be designed to improve the quality of information in an attempt to minimize the costs associated with predator avoidance responses.

AB Foraging site selection is likely to be influenced by vegetation structure since this can affect both the potential energy gain and predation risk that animals associate with a patch. We investigated foraging site selection by chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, between a 'safe' patch with short stubble allowing earlier detection of an approaching predator and a 'risky' patch with longer, more visually obstructive stubble. When initial seed densities in the patches were equal, individuals foraged more in the short stubble and had shorter vigilance periods than those that foraged in the long stubble. These differences in foraging and vigilance behaviour changed if the food abundance in each patch was unequal. We used these variations in measures of foraging and vigilance behaviour to predict the level of increased food abundance in the 'risky' patch necessary for it to be used more often. As the relative density of seeds in the long stubble compared to that in the short stubble increased, the proportion of time individuals spent in the short stubble declined. Patch switching occurred at a seed density ratio of approximately 1:2.5. Individuals made a higher proportion of pecks in the short stubble with less than two times as many seeds in the long stubble. With more than three times as many seeds in the long stubble, they made a higher proportion of pecks in the long stubble. The results show that compensation through vigilance for the increased predation risk manifest in a patch's physical characteristics may greatly reduce the profitability of a patch.

AB We investigated the consistency of behaviour over repeated tests in dogs, Canis familiaris. Dogs were tested three times, with an average of 30 and 35 days between tests. The behavioural test used in the study included 10 subtests that exposed dogs to various situations, such as the appearance of an unfamiliar person, play, preylike objects, metallic noise and a suddenly appearing dummy. Studies using the same test with many dogs have revealed five specific personality traits, labelled Playfulness, Chase-proneness, Curiosity/Fearlessness, Sociability and Aggressiveness, and one higher-order, broader dimension, interpreted as a shyness-boldness continuum. We used these traits in the present study. We found significant correlations over the test series in all the specific traits as well as in the Boldness dimension. The magnitude of trait scores for Playfulness, Chase-proneness and Sociability, as well as for the Boldness dimension, was stable between tests. The scores for Aggressiveness and Curiosity/Fearlessness, however, differed between the first two tests: the intensity of behaviour related to fear and aggression decreased from test 1 to test 2, but the intensity of exploratory behaviour increased. This result indicates that these two traits in dogs are sensitive to novelty although individual differences are also maintained in nonovel situations. The results suggest that playful, social, exploratory avoidant and aggressive behaviour in dog is influenced by stable dispositions; i.e. personality traits, that seem to have been important during the evolution of the domestic dog.

AB Many mobile predators use different foraging behaviours depending on whether prey are clumped or uniformly distributed in space. It is believed that predators can increase foragging efficiency on patchily distributed prey if they alternate intensive searching (slow speeds and frequent, acute turns) with extensive searching (high speeds and infrequent, shallow turns). We used Fourier transforms, fractal dimension analysis and traditional single-value measures of movement to determine which proximate cue caused these changes in behaviour: frequency of encounter or degree of satiation. Over a range of encounter rates and levels of hunger, we found that larval ladybird beetles showed intensive search behaviour for varying levels of encounter frequency, but did not alter their behaviour when hunger level was manipulated. We provide a conceptual model that explains why encounter frequency is more likely than hunger level to determine search behaviour. We discuss the relative merits of Fourier transforms in relation to fractal dimension and single-value measures. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Aninial Behaviour.

AB Male birds can often accurately gauge the fertile status of females. As is found in other species, the stitchbird manifests this ability through increased mate guarding and attempted extrapair copulations centred on the female's peak fertile period. Males are thought to use various behavioural. cues to assess female fertility, including (1) within-pair copulation, (2) mate-guarding intensity, (3) female solicitation, (4) female flight behaviour, (5) nest building, (6) egg laying and (7) paired male song intensity. Using a correlational approach, I examined which behavioural cues were closely linked with the fertile status of the female stitchbird, as well as which cues accounted for patterns of extrapair male behaviour. Female stitchbirds increased their body weight by an average of 31% (maximum 43%) in the 3 weeks before laying. Extrapair male interest rose sharply as the female's weight increased from 31 g to a peak weight of approximately 41 g, 2 days before the first egg was laid. Thus, increasing female weight appears to be the primary fertility indicator in this species, and it is likely that males evaluate this through changes in her flight behaviour. Because of potential costs associated with forced copulation, female stitchbirds may attempt to limit the availability of information regarding their fertile state by burying eggs within the lining of their nest.

TI Size and stripes:: how fish clients recognize cleaners
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID CLEANING SYMBIOSIS; REEF FISH; CALIFORNIA; ETHOLOGY; BEHAVIOR; WRASSE
AB Little is known of how individuals find each other in interspecific mutualisms involving free-living partners. We tested the importance of two factors, namely body size and the presence of a lateral body stripe, in the recognition of cleanerfish by their fish clients. Clients on an Indonesian reef flat readily approached wooden models of the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, which varied in size and stripe characteristics.. The composition of the clientele of models was not significantly different from that of natural cleaning stations, suggesting that fish visiting the models were seeking to be cleaned. Normal-sized models of cleaner wrasses attracted significantly more clients, which showed more intense interest and stayed with the models for. significantly longer, than super-sized models. For normal-sized models, the number of clients increased as the length of the cleaner's lateral stripe increased (from 0, to 44, 67 and 100% of body length). However, there was no effect of stripe length on client numbers for super-sized models. Client interest also did not vary with stripe length for models of either size. Small body size and the presence of a lateral stripe therefore appear to be long-distance signals that their bearer may be a cleaner, but after initial attraction, client interest is maintained by other cues. Alternative short-distance signals,may include colour, other visual signals such as cleanerfish dances, or physical contact between cleaner and client.

AB Recent theories on primate sexual selection have paid increasing attention to the importance of reproductive strategies of females living in multimale groups. However, the extent to which females are able effectively to conceal or advertise the time of ovulation as part of these strategies remains unclear. Few studies have investigated the ability of males to discern female reproductive status under natural conditions, and none has taken into account differences in male rank, and thus ability to gain access to females or cues. We tested male assessment of a female's fertile phase under natural conditions in longtailed macaques. We used timing of mate guarding by dominant males and the response of subordinate males towards the repeated playback of a female copulation call to measure male interest in females throughout the ovarian cycle. Relating the degree of male interest to female reproductive status, as determined noninvasively by faecal hormone analysis, we found that interest in females shown by both dominant and subordinate males was strongest during and around the fertile phase. Our results also indicate that males were better able to recognize the fertile period in conception than in nonconception cycles. Furthermore, our finding of a strong positive relation between male interest and female oestrogen levels in all cycles indicates that at least some of the cues used by males to assess female reproductive status are oestrogen related.

AB Individuals show stable differences in their aggressive responses towards unfamiliar conspecifics. We investigated the extent to which variables present during early life could be identified that were correlated with these later individual differences in aggressive behaviour. The behaviour and growth of 125 domestic pigs, Sus scrofa, from 16 litters, were studied from birth until 18 days after weaning, when they were tested on two occasions in resident-intruder tests to measure their aggressiveness. Aggressiveness was affected by litter, although not by sex. A number of early life correlates of later resident-intruder aggressiveness were found at the litter level. Pigs became more aggressive if they had been born into larger litters. Pigs in these aggressive litters were more active in the 8-h period immediately after birth, perhaps taking longer to achieve satiety at the udder. They were also in poorer condition 2 days after birth. Aggressive pigs also engaged in more pushing with littermates over the whole preweaning period. The best correlates of aggressiveness appear to be a number of correlated variables relating to low nutrition, either prenatally or in the early postnatal period. The results are consistent with the concept that early environmental conditions can programme behavioural responses for later life. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Most bird species produce different acoustic signals in different behavioural contexts. This intraspecific variation in signal types is thought to be the result of selection for optimal communication in each context. Doves in the genus Streptopelia have three distinct behavioural contexts in which they produce coo vocalizations. Some Streptopelia species have three acoustically similar coo vocalizations associated with the three contexts, but in others the coo vocalizations differ in acoustic structure. Using a well-resolved phylogeny, we examined whether acoustic differentiation between coo types was the ancestral state. Unexpectedly, the results showed that the common ancestor of Streptopelia had differentiated coos rather than a single coo type. This result implies that context-specific acoustic signals disappeared from the vocal repertoire independently at least two times. We further tested whether different context-dependent signal types follow different evolutionary pathways and whether they differ in rate of evolutionary change. We found that the long-range signal (perch-coo) evolves at a higher rate than the short-range signal (bow-coo). These results are discussed in relation to selection for species recognition and transmission requirements. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In any host-parasitoid interaction, the detection of the host in its microhabitat is a crucial step in the interaction that has a major influence on the parasitoid's fitness. We used bioassays to investigate whether the parasitoid Sympiesis sericeicornis (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) uses the vibrations of its host Phyllonorycter sp. gr. blancardella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) to detect it in the leaf mine. From the large variety of signals produced by the host, we identified a unitary signal that could be reproduced artificially. We then sent this signal into emptied mines to analyse the reaction of the parasitoid. The wasps reacted by increasing both the time spent foraging on the mine and the number of insertions of the ovipositor to detect the 'virtual' host. This study is the first to show that parasitoids detect host vibrations. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When fighting is costly, avoiding contests with superior opponents should confer fitness advantages. Black howler monkeys, Alouatta pigra, produce loud calls that reliably indicate the minimum number of male group members. Using playback recordings, I manipulated 'numeric odds' (number of defending to intruding males) to examine whether alpha males use loud calls to assess relative fighting ability, and whether they modify responses to intruders based on relationships with male companions, level of subordinate male cooperation and/or presence of vulnerable offspring in the group. Results indicated that alpha males assess relative fighting ability; howling and approach responses were weakest when subjects faced unfavourable odds. Subordinate male contest participation was inconsistent and alpha males relied less on these unpredictable companions during risky approaches; whereas intruder number affected most howling and approach responses, companion number only influenced howling and orienting duration. Post hoc analyses suggested no effect of alpha-subordinate relationships on. alpha reactions. However, preliminary evidence suggested that if subordinates participated, alpha males escalated most when they outnumbered intruders. Alpha males also had shorter howling delays as numeric odds (based on the presence of all subordinates) were increasingly in their favour. Thus, alpha males seemed to escalate in order to signal group-level fighting superiority rather than as a means to gather information on closely matched opponents. Finally, alpha males howled more quickly and for longer at potentially infanticidal intruders if small offspring were present in their group and never called when odds were against their group unless offspring were present, suggesting that contest value was influential.

AB Weakly electric fish communicate with brief electrostatic field pulses called electric organ discharges (EODs). EOD waveforms are sexually dimorphic in most genera, a condition thought to result from mate choice acting to shape the electric signal's constituent action potentials. We have no direct behavioural evidence that sexual selection by either mate choice or intrasexual competition is responsible for sex differences in the EOD waveforms of electric fish. We explored sexual selection in electric fish by conducting two-choice unforced preference tests with live, unaltered gymnotiform electric fish, Brachyhypopornus pinnicaudatus, which are sexually dimorphic. In the initial test, gravid females selected males over females only when the males were larger than average. Gravid females in later tests preferred larger males to smaller males in a significant majority of those trials in which they showed a preference. In about one-third of those trials, females spawned with their preferred male, confirming their preference. We concluded that passage through the choice apparatus was related to mate choice. The signals of chosen males had larger EOD amplitudes and longer EOD durations. These findings show that female B. pinnicaudatus do have a preference for a certain male phenotype. The system requires additional study to dissociate correlated male phenotypic characters to identify which male traits the female prefers.

AB We review data from both ethology and psychology about generalization, that is how animals respond to sets of stimuli including familiar and novel stimuli. Our main conclusion is that patterns of generalization are largely independent of systematic group (evidence is available for insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans), behavioural context (feeding, drinking, courting, etc.), sensory modality (light, sound, etc.) and of whether reaction to stimuli is learned or genetically inherited. These universalities suggest that generalization originates from general properties of nervous systems, and that evolutionary strategies to cope with novelty and variability in stimulation may be limited. Two major shapes of the generalization gradient can be identified, corresponding to two types of stimulus dimensions. When changes in stimulation involve a rearrangement of a constant amount of stimulation on the sense organs, the generalization gradient peaks close to familiar stimuli, and peak responding is not much higher than responding to familiar stimuli. Contrary to what is often claimed, such gradients are better described by Gaussian curves than by exponentials. When the stimulus dimension involves a variation in the intensity of stimulation, the gradient is often monotonic, and responding to some novel stimuli is considerably stronger than responding to familiar stimuli. Lastly, when several or many familiar stimuli are close to each other predictable biases in responding occur, along all studied dimensions. We do not find differences between biases referred to as peak shift and biases referred to as supernormal stimulation. We conclude by discussing theoretical issues.

AB Behaviours or traits associated with aggression and communication may increase an animal's conspicuousness to predators or parasitoids. Most examples of this come from instances of aggression or communication within a species. We tested whether interspecific encounters between ants enhance the host location success of a parasitoid (Diptera: Phoridae) that attacks ants in the genus Linepithema. At food resources recruited to by Linepithema, parasitoid discovery rates were lower when Linepithema was alone than when other ant species were present. In experimentally controlled encounters, parasitoid discovery rates were elevated when Linepithema confronted an ant species that elicited use of chemicals, but not when it confronted an ant species that primarily elicited physical aggression. These results indicate that phorid parasitoids of Linepithema use the ant's chemicals as host location cues. Because Linepithema is known to abandon food resources in the presence of its phorid parasitoids, its use of chemicals during interspecific encounters may diminish its competitive success when phorids are nearby.

AB Pheromones play a central role in coordinating the events leading up to copulation in snakes. We report here a novel pheromone system in the brown tree snake in which females release a pheromone that inhibits male courtship behaviour. In a previous study, we made observations of female brown tree snakes releasing cloacal secretions (CS) during courtship that appeared to cause courting males to cease courtship. All snakes have glands that release CS through ducts located along the cloacal orifice. Although CS have been studied for many years, their function in the mediation of snake behaviour has not been experimentally well determined. We examined the role of CS in the reproductive behaviour of male and female brown tree snakes. We conducted four experiments to test the effect of both male and female CS on brown tree snake behaviour under two behavioural contexts, courtship and male-male ritualized combat. Within each experiment, we compared the effects of CS to a control. Female CS caused a decrease in the time that males spent courting females and a decrease in the intensity of courtship compared with the control treatment. Male CS did not, however, affect the time that males spent displaying courtship or the intensity of that courtship. Neither male nor female CS had significant effects on male ritualized combat behaviour, including time that males spent in combat or the intensity of combat behaviours displayed. Furthermore, neither female nor male CS had an effect on female courtship versus controls. The inhibition of brown tree snake reproductive behaviours is specific to female CS inhibiting male courtship behaviour. This pheromone acts in concert with the female sex pheromone to regulate the events leading to copulation.

AB Dear enemy recognition reduces the costs of territorial defence in some species, but not others, when a neighbour is more threatening to a resident's fitness than an intruder. I asked whether dear enemy effects were fixed in a particular species, or if the reduced aggression between a resident and neighbour was disrupted by the presence of potential mating opportunities. Observing variegated pupfish, Cyprinodon variegatus, in the field and in the laboratory, I examined the effects of a female's presence in a male's territory on residents' aggressive responses to conspecific neighbours and strangers as well as heterospecific opponents. Although reduced aggression consistent with dear enemy recognition was seen between conspecific neighbours in the absence of females, the presence of a female in a male's territory instigated comparably greater aggression between the neighbours. No reduction in aggression was seen between pupfish males and heterospecific opponents. These findings suggest that dear enemy recognition may be a flexible, rather than a fixed, feature of the relationship of neighbouring conspecific males. Despite the disruption in dear enemy recognition caused by a female, residents in the laboratory faced with neighbours spent more time associating with the female than residents faced with strangers. This allowed the residents to secure as many spawns as did males who had been faced with no competitor. Residents faced with any other type of opponent had reduced reproductive success, suggesting that the dear enemy relationship between residents and neighbours is more complex than simply a reduction in aggression.

   MIGRATION; ISLAND; DISPLACEMENT
AB Sea turtles have recently been shown to have the sensory ability to use magnetic information for guidance in the open ocean, although the importance of different potential navigational cues remains unknown. Between May and August 2001, we satellite-tracked green turtles, Chelonia mydas, during their >2000-km postnesting migration from Ascension Island to Brazil, following five individuals both during their transoceanic crossing and while on the Brazilian coast. None of the turtles travelled directly to its final destination but, instead, there were extended (up to 792 km) movements along the coast after the oceanic crossings. The extent of movement along the coast was unrelated to the oceanic crossing route. For example, individuals whose final destination was in the north of Brazil did not follow a more northerly oceanic crossing than those with a more southerly final destination. These observations show that green turtles returning from Ascension Island do not swim directly to their final destination, but instead conduct migration in two distinct phases: a fairly direct open ocean crossing, following which they turn north or south along the coast to reach their final destination. This long-distance migration may therefore be conducted without turtles needing to resort to sophisticated navigational skills. These previously unidentified long coastal movements may heighten the risk of turtles being captured by fishermen. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In primates, long-range communication is often mediated by the use of 'long' (or 'loud') calls. Beyond the acoustic classification of these calls and descriptions of the behavioural context in which they are produced, few experimental studies have examined how species-typical information is encoded in the structure of these signals. We present the results of eight experimental conditions designed to isolate the mechanisms underlying the perception of long calls in cottontop tamarins, Saguinus oedipus. Our procedure involved presenting a combination of naturally produced and experimentally manipulated long calls to individuals isolated from their group, and then recording the relationship between signal design and the production of antiphonal long calls by the test subject. Tamarins did not distinguish between normal calls and time-reversed or pitch-shifted long calls, but normal response rates did require the species-typical amplitude envelope. Furthermore, there was suggestive evidence that the number of syllables and the syllable rate may also influence antiphonal calling responses. We discuss these results in terms of the mechanisms of vocal recognition in primates and other taxa. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In four large aviaries, we studied social assortment and reproductive behaviour of female brown-headed cowbirds housed with males differing in age class and in corresponding levels of intrasexual interaction. Juvenile and adult females resided with either (1) adult males, (2) juvenile males, (3) adult and juvenile males, or (4) no males. We observed social behaviour of males and females from September 1999 through to the 2000 breeding season. Throughout the year, males in the different conditions showed different levels of social interaction, with adult males being most engaged in male-male interactions and juvenile males being least engaged in male-male interactions. Females in the four conditions differed in their associations with males and with other females. In conditions with adult males, females spent more time near males, approached males more often, and associated with females less. During the breeding season, females in conditions with more adult males copulated more and produced more fertile and viable eggs. In the condition where females were housed with juvenile males, they copulated less, laid fewer eggs and destroyed more of their eggs. Results indicate that throughout the year, females are sensitive to male age and behaviour in their social group, and that this sensitivity can have reproductive consequences.

AB To determine the costs and benefits of queen association in termites we examined for the first time female-female interactions in colonies founded by two unmated females. In the termite Reticulitermes speratus, females that fail to pair with males found colonies cooperatively with partner females and reproduce by parthenogenesis. We analysed the relationship between queen dominance and initial size ranking in two-queen colonies from the viewpoint of first worker brood production and weight gain. To assign parentage to offspring of two-queen colonies we used mtDNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP); the results suggested that the two queens produced first worker brood equally throughout colony foundation. Furthermore, initially smaller females gained significantly more weight than initially larger females. This may have resulted from altruistic behaviour of the larger females towards the smaller ones. A simple mathematical model, which considered resource allocation and survivorship, could explain why the larger females behave altruistically towards the smaller females. We also examined the responses of females when more than two females were placed in a petri dish in the presence or absence of a male. If a partner male was present, only one female survived in the colony. In the absence of a partner male, two females, but never more than two, founded a colony cooperatively. These results show that females need a partner to found, and retain, a colony. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Because mating is a product of individual reproductive strategies that may vary with changing conditions, we predicted variable mating behaviour in an arid-adapted, territorial rodent, the giant kangaroo rat, Dipodomys ingens. We also predicted that familiarity would facilitate nonaggressive courtship and mating in this solitary rodent. Through direct observations in the field, we found that mating varied from exclusive to multiple partners. Where densities were low, and on nights when multiple females were in, oestrus, each animal mated with one member of the opposite sex. In conditions where the operational sex ratio was skewed towards multiple males, males footdrummed and competed for females. Males were able to mate with one or two females in adjacent territories, and they successfully competed for these same females throughout the breeding season. Females that mated exclusively with one male had more pups emerge from, the burrow compared with females that experienced male competition. Females allowed nearest neighbour males to enter their burrows, and they engaged in more nonaggressive contact with close neighbours than with other males. Paired encounters in the field showed less aggression towards neighbours than strangers. In laboratory tests, females were less aggressive towards and allowed more contact with familiar than unfamiliar males. These results show that D. ingens can alter mating strategies as conditions change. Familiarity is an important factor in nonaggressive interactions between males and females and may be important to mate preferences in females during reproduction. The less aggressive behaviour to neighbours than to strangers ('dear enemy' phenomenon) is consistent with other solitary animals that defend multipurpose territories.

AB Nestling birds use vocal and visual behaviours when soliciting food from parents. Such behaviours serve at least two discrete functions: (1) to induce parents to bring more food; and (2) to influence how food is allocated among brood members. Playback experiments have shown that vocalizations serve function 1. Do they also function to influence intrabrood allocation, as contemporary begging theory suggests, or is that governed chiefly by the nonvocal components of begging (neck stretching, gaping, jockeying for position within the nest)? We tested this hypothesis using a novel nonsurgical muting technique to decouple the vocal and visual components of begging in nestling red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus. Single chicks that were muted temporarily (1 h) continued to be fed at roughly the same rate as either the same individual prior to muting or sham-muted nestlings in the same brood. Parents reduced provisioning rates by increasing nest attentiveness in response to changes in the begging behaviour of the brood following treatment. These changes included less time spent begging (visual and vocal) accompanied by a reduction in the collective vocalizations of the brood. Our results suggest that vocalizations function primarily to regulate parental foraging rates, and visual begging displays function primarily to access food (competition).

Male survival decreased significantly, and male-male behavioural interactions increased significantly, with increasing male density (males were kept at 1, 2, 6 and 10 flies per 285 cm(2) in pots of 5.5 cm in diameter and 12 cm. high). No such effects were observed in females over the same density range. This suggests that male survival decreased in response to the deleterious effects of male-male behavioural interactions. At the highest density, courtship wing fanning directed towards other males decreased significantly over time. In addition, as either density or male-biased sex ratio increased, males were increasingly likely to be engaged in courtship wing fanning that was not directed towards females. These results suggest that high adult density may significantly reduce male reproductive success, by decreasing survival and mating success. The results highlight the potentially high survival costs of male-male interactions and indicate differences in the nature of reproductive costs in the two sexes.

AB Much work on social learning has involved behaviour transmission between pairs of individuals, but recently the need to examine the social context in which learning occurs has been recognized. Previous studies using small numbers of animals have shown social influence on the behavioural development of juvenile male brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. Here we looked at the larger social context that forms the framework for such influence in more natural settings. We allowed a captive group of over 70 cowbirds, comprising adult and juvenile males and females, to associate freely in a large complex of connected aviaries. Highly organized social assortment emerged in the group, with individuals associating with others based on similarity in age and sex. juvenile males that associated more with adult males had higher courtship success. juvenile males that associated more with females sang less over the year. These results indicate that the social context of social learning for juvenile males is not just random association with all other birds in the social group, but is a selective and structured pattern of interaction. Differences in navigating this social structure correlated with courtship success and vocalization, behaviour known to be affected by social learning. Studies such as this, using large groups with free assortment of individuals, are the first step towards understanding the effects of the larger social context surrounding social learning.

AB To understand the functioning and organizational complexity of insect societies, a combination of different approaches is needed. One such approach, which we adopt in this study, is to consider tasks in insect societies not based upon their function, as is traditional, but upon their structure. Four types of task in insect societies have been proposed: individual, group, team and partitioned tasks. We examine the relationships among these four task types and consider 'task complexity' to mean the degree of cooperation and coordination required to complete a particular task successfully. In this respect, individual tasks are considered the simplest (low complexity), group tasks are more complex (medium), and team and partitioned tasks the most complex (high). We decompose tasks into their component subtasks to understand how the demands of a task influence how workers must work together to complete it successfully. We describe a simple method to measure the complexity of tasks using task deconstruction. Points are assigned to each subtask within the task and summed to give a total score. This measure, the task's score, allows objective comparison of tasks (different tasks may be ranked in order of their complexity) within and between species, or even higher taxa, and we hope it will be of practical use to researchers. We propose that both team and partitioned tasks may contain individual, group, team and partitioned subtasks. We examine each of the possible task-subtask relationships and provide examples from known social insect behaviour. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Most female birds have only a left ovary and associated oviduct with entry to the oviduct on the left side of the urodeum of the cloaca. We hypothesized that male cloacal contacts during copulation would occur from the left side of females because this would put sperm closer to the entrance of the oviduct. We observed that cloacal contacts from the left outnumbered those from the right by a margin of 3:1 during tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor, copulations at nestboxes in western Michigan in 1999. The directional bias of cloacal contacts may have an adaptive function. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We describe a stochastic model of an animal exploring and foraging within an uncertain environment. Behaviour is determined not by an optimizing algorithm but by fuzzy systems using linguistic rules derived from the information primacy hypothesis which stresses the importance of continual information gathering under conditions of uncertainty. In the model, the animal's hunger increases steadily over time and is reduced by visiting locations that may contain varying amounts of food. Uncertainty arises from three sources: (1) location novelty or ambiguity, that is, the animal is uncertain whether it has visited the same location before; (2) variation in the amounts of food in a given location; and (3) the recency of information concerning these two aspects of a given location. In complex and changing environments fresh information is likely to be more accurate than old information and consequently our model gives most weight to recently gathered information. All sources of uncertainty are reduced by visiting locations and gathering fresh information. The model is successful in simulating results from experiments investigating such phenomena as: spontaneous alternation; patrolling; the effects of hunger on the variability of learnt responses; latent learning; contrafreeloading; and behaviour following changes in food availability.

AB Breeding density is predicted to influence the use of alternative reproductive strategies and may account for some of the variation in extrapair paternity rates found within and between avian species. By exploiting the extreme range of breeding densities occurring in a single, semicolonial population of Bullock's oriole, Icterus galbula bullockii, this study showed that, as predicted, both the number of nests containing extrapair nestlings and the mean proportion of extrapair nestlings in a brood increased with breeding density (high versus low breeding density: broods with extrapair nestlings: 62 versus 27%; mean: 48 versus 16%). As found in some other studies, extrapair paternity (both exclusion and assignment) significantly increased the variance in reproductive success among males. No difference was found in the mean reproductive success of males at different breeding densities. However, as predicted, the variance in reproductive success among males increased with breeding density. This study indicates that the distribution of individuals within a single population can lead to significant differences in the opportunity for sexual selection, and that density may be an important factor affecting variance in male reproductive success among populations.

AB We measured the 24-h flight activity patterns of 84 species of Nearctic Lepidoptera representing 12 ultrasound-earless and seven ultrasound-eared families to examine the evolution of the diel flight periodicities (DFPs) and auditory defences of these insects. Most species tested showed mixed DFPs (flight during day and night hours) with few being exclusively nocturnal. With the exception of one geometrid moth and one arctiid moth, only the butterflies (Papilionoidea+Hesperioidea) were exclusively diurnal, supporting the hypothesis that this trait has resulted from their lack of ultrasound-sensitive ears, structures that in most other Macrolepidoptera provide auditory defence against aerially foraging, insectivorous bats. Eared species showed the highest tendency to fly during both day and night, a trait we suggest results from their possession of both visual and auditory defences. Earless moths were almost exclusively nocturnal and may be constrained to the night because of their size and tendency for ground-hugging flight, which may provide protection against bats, but would be liabilities against diurnal, visually hunting predators. Ultrasound sensitivity not only appears to protect eared moths from aerial predators (bats) but also protects them from terrestrial predators by allowing the moths to remain in the air during the night, and, we suggest, is responsible for the success of this group of Macrolepidoptera., (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Like most mammals, grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, are thought to be polygynous. However, genetic analysis reveals that as few as 1% of males gain reproductive success that is significantly above average. At the same time there appear to be more full siblings than can be accounted for by chance, implying some level of partner fidelity. We used an enlarged data set to show that, on average, maternal half-siblings who have different fathers are significantly more diverse than expected from random mating. This unexpected pattern is too strong to be accounted for by influxes of males from other breeding colonies and hence implies female choice for partner diversity. We argue that behavioural mate choice is an unlikely explanation and speculate that naturally occurring antisperm antibodies could modulate sperm competition through weak immunointolerance of sperm from previous partners. Whatever the mechanism, choice for diverse partners will tend to increase the local effective population size. We used a simple model to show that such a strategy could be favoured at the level of the individual in small closed or semiclosed populations of long-lived species where polygyny would lead to a rapid increase in the level of inbreeding.

AB I manipulated food availability in juvenile and adult fishing spiders (Dolomedes triton) to test two hypotheses for sexual cannibalism. The adaptive foraging hypothesis posits that sexual cannibalism is an economic, adaptive foraging strategy on the part of the adult female. In contrast, the aggressive-spillover hypothesis suggests that precopulatory sexual cannibalism is misplaced aggression favoured in previous life-history phases. Several results indicated support for the adaptive foraging hypothesis. First, increased adult food availability produced marginally nonsignificant fecundity benefits in female's first egg sacs and highly significant fecundity benefits in female's second egg sacs. Second, while consumption of a male did not result in more offspring in either egg sac, it did significantly increase the probability a female would successfully hatch an egg sac. Finally, mating trials revealed mixed support for the adaptive foraging hypothesis as, for the most part, female mating behaviour (attack or mate) was not determined by the adaptive value a male represented (food item or sperm donor). Specifically, the likelihood of it precopulatory attack was not determined by male size, date (an indirect estimate of male availability)or female nutrient load. However, mated females did tend to attack courting males more often than virgin females. The aggressive-spillover hypothesis was supported by several findings. For juveniles, food availability had a significant positive effect on fixed female size (cephalothorax area at final moult) which, in turn, had a significant positive effect on fecundity. Thus, the spillover hypothesis' assertion that strong fecundity selection acts on juvenile feeding and fixed adult size was supported. The possibility that the spillover and adaptive foraging hypotheses are not mutually exclusive is discussed, especially in light of the presence of high levels of sexual cannibalism both before and after mating.

AB Sociality can promote both cooperation and competition. although we assume social organisms possess adaptations that allow them to form groups and deal with within-group conflicts, these are often subtle and difficult to detect. Using a simple form of sociality displayed by young ant foundresses of the desert-seed-harvester ant, Messor pergandei, as a model system, I exploited intraspecific geographic variation in social behaviour to investigate how the social, context has altered individual behavioural strategies. I created social groups composed of two normally nonsocial foundresses, normally social foundresses and mixed groups, and compared foundresses' aggression and willingness to invest resources towards colony productivity. Nonsocial foundresses, presumably not adapted to social life, invested significantly more resources into colony growth than normally social foundresses, and experienced reduced survivorship in mixed groups. In contrast, social foundresses displayed two novel competitive behavioural strategies when confronted with nonsocial partners: retaliatory aggression and egg consumption. These results document that the evolution of social behaviour, rather than promoting cooperation, is driven by the evolution of competitive;e strategies designed to exploit group members and reduce the risk of being exploited by others.

AB In species with biparental care of offspring and high levels of extrapair parentage, paired males may suffer reduced fitness by investing in offspring that are not their own. In such instances, males are predicted to evolve some form of discrimination between kin and nonkin and vary investment accordingly. One simple form of discrimination is to follow behavioural cues to paternity. We investigated paternal contribution to chick rearing in a socially monogamous population of stitchbirds, Notiomystis cincta, with high levels of extrapair copulation (EPC) and extrapair paternity. The relative contribution of the male to chick provisioning was negatively correlated with attempted EPC frequency. Because the majority of EPC attempts are forced and conspicuous in stitchbirds they are an obvious cue for males to use. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We used time-lapse underwater video systems in the subtidal zone of the Mingan Islands, eastern Canada, to examine behavioural interactions of four kleptoparasites with the sea star Leptasterias polaris when it was feeding on infaunal (buried) clams. Departures of L. polaris from its prey coincided with interactions with kleptoparasites in 10 out of 10 filmed feeding bouts on the large clam Spisula polynyma, compared with only four out of 10 of filmed bouts on the smaller clam Mya truncata. The sea star's abandoning of the prey was most often caused by interactions with another sea star, Asterias vulgaris, a potential predator. The whelk (a carnivorous snail), Buccinum undatum, and the crabs Hyas araneus and Cancer irroratus, also kleptoparasitized L. polaris, especially when A. vulgaris was present. Comparisons of feeding bouts in the presence and absence of kleptoparasites showed that at least 10.4% of the prey mass captured by L. polaris was lost to kleptoparasites. Simultaneous current meter data showed that the movement of A. vulgaris and B. undatum to sites where L. polaris was feeding on S. polynyma was upstream, suggesting chemodetection of food odours. Crabs in the vicinity may also use visual cues. Leptasterias polaris is the only carnivore that can efficiently extract large clams from the sediments and therefore its foraging may supply a substantial part of the diet of kleptoparasites.

AB Maternal rank 'inheritance', the process by which juveniles attain positions in the dominance hierarchy adjacent to those of their mothers, occurs in both cercopithecine primates and spotted hyaenas. Maternal rank is acquired in primates through defensive maternal interventions, coalitionary support and unprovoked aggression ('harassment') directed by adult females towards offspring of lower-ranking individuals. Genetic heritability of rank-related traits plays a negligible role in primate rank acquisition. Because the social lives of Crocuta and cercopithecine primates share many common features, we examined whether the same mechanisms might operate in both taxa to promote maternal rank 'inheritance'. We observed a large dan of free-living spotted hyaenas in Kenya to test predictions of four mechanistic hypotheses. Hyaena rank acquisition did not appear to be directly affected by genetic heritability. Unprovoked aggression from adult female hyaenas was nor directed preferentially towards low-ranking cubs. However, high-ranking mothers intervened on behalf of their cubs more frequently and more effectively than low-ranking mothers. Maternal interventions and supportive coalitions appeared to reinforce aggression directed at 'appropriate' conspecific targets, whereas coalitionary aggression directed at cubs apparently functioned to extinguish their aggressive behaviour towards 'inappropriate' targets. Young hyaenas and primates thus appear to 'inherit' their mothers' ranks by strikingly similar mechanisms. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Modern intensive farming conditions lack the diversity of substrates present in more natural environments and offer young animals fewer opportunities for interaction. Evidence exists that this may affect the organization of interactive patterns of behaviour, but shifts in behavioural diversity have not been measured directly. We investigated the effect of the substrate in the home pen on the diversity of behaviour in young growing pigs, Sos scrofa. Over 5 months, 26 pigs were housed singly in either substrate-impoverished (SI) or substrate-enriched (SE) conditions. Once every month we recorded the behaviour of these pigs in detail both in the home pens and in two novel object tests. In addition, we calculated the diversity of behaviour shown by SI and SE pigs in the home pen and in the novel object tests, using a relative behavioural diversity index. In the two novel object tests, SI pigs were less mobile than SE pigs and focused their behaviour on particular substrates. In addition, SI pigs showed less diverse behaviour than SE pigs. Our results show that the less diverse behaviour of SI pigs previously recorded in their home pens persists under novel conditions, supporting the hypothesis that substrate-impoverished housing conditions structurally affect the organization of behaviour in young growing pigs.

AB Escalated contests between animals are potentially costly because of increased energy expenditure and risk of predation or injury. Hence we would expect selection to favour any mechanism that avoids unnecessary prolonged fighting. One such means of avoiding escalated fights could be the use of information gained through individual recognition. Precious work has shown that a darkening of the body colour is closely associated with submission in contests between juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and it has been hypothesized that this may act as a visual signal to the opponent. We tested the hypothesis that body darkening is used to reduce the cost of contests between familiar fish such that losers darken more quickly when faced with familiar than unfamiliar opponents. In contests between unfamiliar fish, submissive darkening occurred after more escalated contests in which the loser incurred more aggression, whereas the opposite occurred when familiar fish were in conflict. In addition familiar fish either submitted quickly or engaged in protracted conflicts in which neither fish signalled submission, whereas in unfamiliar fish contests were of intermediate duration regardless of whether either fish darkened. We suggest that body darkening is used by familiar fish to signal submission to familiar dominants in order to avert a costly escalated fight, but familiarity can lead to escalation without submission if perceived competitive asymmetries are finely balanced.

AB To investigate female responses to territorial intrusion I presented female song sparrows with either a simulated female song sparrow intrusion or a simulated spotted towhee, Pipilo maculatus, intrusion as a control during either the prebreeding, breeding or postmoult seasons. Aggressive and nonaggressive behaviours and vocalizations were compared between intrusion types and across seasons. Principle components analysis suggested that female responses fell into three categories: (1) responses directed towards the intruder, mostly aggressive; (2) responses directed towards the mate; and (3) lack of response to the intruder. In every season, females responded more aggressively to simulated female song sparrow intrusion than simulated towhee intrusion. Responses directed towards female song sparrow intruders dropped across the three seasons and were significantly higher in the prebreeding season than in the breeding or postmoult seasons.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID PIED FLYCATCHERS; DEFENSE; BIRDS
AB An increased mortality rate is a cost of parental care, and can be high during the provisioning phase of altricial nestlings. When a parent stops feeding the nestlings temporarily after seeing a predator, it can reduce its own predation risk, but the suspension of parental care may also reduce its offspring's chances of surviving. We modelled this situation by exposing a stuffed sparrowhawk near collared flycatcher nests and removing it when both parents had seen it. We measured the time (return time) between the removal and when each parent entered the nestbox. The parents' risk taking and the return time are assumed to be inversely related. We studied which brood variables the parents take into account when deciding how much risk they are willing to take during the provisioning period. Males took more risk for older and better-quality nestlings and earlier broods. The females' behaviour was opposite to that of the males: they took significantly less risk for older and better-quality offspring and visited the nestbox later for earlier broods. The males' behaviour supported the reproductive value hypothesis, that risk taking is related to brood value and survival chances, whereas the females' behaviour supported the harm to offspring hypothesis, that risk taking is related to the broods' vulnerability.

AB Many species of ants occupy multiple nests, a condition known as polydomy. Because of their decentralized structure, polydomous colonies may be removed from some of the constraints associated with classic central-place foraging. We used laboratory and field experiments to assess the mechanisms involved in dispersed central-place foraging in polydomous colonies of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile, a widespread invasive species. Both in the laboratory and in the field, Argentine ants established new nests at sites located near food. Laboratory colonies of L. humile redistributed workers, brood and resources among nests in response to the spatial heterogeneity of food resources. In addition, laboratory colonies formed recruitment trails between nests in the,context of foraging, providing a mechanism for the transport of material between nests. This highly flexible System of allocating nests, workers and brood throughout a colony's foraging area potentially increases foraging efficiency and competitive ability. The importance of polydomy as a determinant of competitive;ability is underscored by its prevalence among ecologically dominant ants, including most, if not all, highly invasive species.

AB The social and spatial organization of urban fox groups prior to and during an outbreak of sarcoptic mange was compared with predictions derived from the resource dispersion hypothesis (RDH). We investigated the availability of three key resources. Neither daytime rest sites nor breeding sites appeared to be limited in availability. The availability of food deliberately supplied by local householders was examined by questionnaire surveys. The daily and weekly amount of food supplied was greatly in excess of the minimum requirements of a pair of foxes, but was consistent between territories. The availability of this food source increased markedly as a result of more people feeding the foxes. In agreement with the RDH, group size prior to the outbreak of mange increased from 2.25 animals (N=4) to 6.57 animals (N=7). Before the outbreak of mange, two territories were divided. Increased scavenge availability on smaller territories may have promoted these changes. Excluding these spatial changes, territories were very stable between years. After the outbreak of mange, group size declined as a direct result of mange-induced mortality. Surviving animals increased their ranges only after neighbouring groups had died out. Ranges did not increase in size in response to a decline in food availability. Nor were the increases in range size associated with the relinquishment of parts of the existing territory. These postmange changes are contrary to the RDH. Three factors may have promoted these changes: the elimination of interstitial space, the forced dispersal of young or future division of the territory.

AB Males of many bird species use a variety of behaviour patterns that reduce their chances of being cuckolded. The 'fertility announcement' hypothesis (Moller 1991, American Naturalist; 138,; 994-1014) proposes that song might be one such paternity guard. According to this hypothesis, paired males would announce their female's fertile status by singing. This has been interpreted as an honest signalling, evolutionarily stable strategy. Contrary to the predictions of this hypothesis, male willow warblers, Phylloscopus trochilus, sang very little when females were fertile. intrusions by other males in the fertile period were not less common when males sang at higher rates. Mate guarding and singing are best interpreted as two conflicting behaviours during this period; the former: being directed to the fertile female and the latter to attracting a second female, or an extrapair female. A survey of recent studies suggests that, in most,passerine species studied, males do not sing during the fertile period of their females. The different conclusions of Moller (1991) are probably due to his use of population-wide estimates of the timing of singing behaviour and egg laying. Breeding asynchronies within populations would be responsible for the apparent matching between the peaks of singing activity and fertility.

AB We refined established methods for examining the temporal organization of behavioural events and applied them to the study of bats emerging from roost sites. Previous studies have shown that as roosting numbers of bats increase, temporal patterning (clustering) in their emergence behaviour, as measured by chi(2) or G statistics, also increases. Expressing the extent of temporal clustering using chi(2) or G, however, confounds two effects. The statistic may increase because clustering increases. However, an increase will occur, even if the amount of clustering stays constant, if the sample size of observations increases. A positive relation between emergence size and chi(2) or G may not necessarily reflect increased clustering. We developed a method to separate these effects using computer-modelled event streams. Using this method, we examined intra- and inter-roost variation in the temporal patterning of emergences of the pipistrelle bat, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, from four roosts in northeast Scotland. The 'corrected' expression of clustering decreased as roost size increased, which was opposite to the effect found with the uncorrected expression and also opposite that predicted a priori from the bottleneck hypothesis. This novel result suggests bottlenecks may disrupt clustering rather than promote it. This latter interpretation was supported by observations that clustering was significantly reduced in the middle of large emergences. Variation in clustering between roosts was significant, suggesting exit topology may have an important influence on clustering behaviour. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Aggression among spotted hyaena, Crocuta crocuta, siblings is often intense, and sometimes lethal. Frank et al. (1991, Science, 252, 702-704) proposed that siblicide routinely occurs in half of all spotted hyaena litters, namely those composed of same-sex twins. We propose an alternative to this 'obligate' model. In our 'facultative' model we suggest that siblicide is far less, common than previously supposed, and that it occurs only when resources are insufficient to sustain two cubs. According to this facultative model, intense neonatal aggression functions to establish intralitter dominance rather than to kill siblings. Furthermore, differences in litter size and composition between captive and field settings previously used to support the obligate model are assumed in the facultative model to be due to prenatal factors rather than to postnatal siblicide. Here we tested the predictions of these two hypotheses with 10 years of field data from hyaenas inhabiting the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. We found that, although sex compositions of hyaena litters averaged over the entire 10-year period did not differ from those predicted by chance, they did vary with environmental conditions. Litter sizes, by contrast, remained constant. These data are inconsistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that spotted hyaenas in same-sex litters routinely engage in siblicide.

AB As mitochondria are inherited in a matrilinear way, an animal hybrid contains the mitochondrial DNA of its 'mother species'. Of 80 studies that analysed the mitochondrial DNA of at least five hybrid individuals, 50 showed that all hybrids contained the mitochondrial DNA of only one of the two parental species, indicating either mating of females of species A with males of species B but not vice versa (unidirectional hybridization) or the disappearance of one of the two parental mtDNA types after reciprocal hybridization. I review and discuss factors promoting unidirectional or reciprocal hybridization and present a sexual selection hypothesis for unidirectional hybridization. The inequality of the sexes in parental investment leads to the sex that invests more being the more discriminating one. In the presence of conspecific males, females reject allospecific males and, consequently, a male in an environment of both allospecific sexes is unlikely to mate, while in the absence of conspecific males, females sometimes accept fertilizations by males of other species. Thus, hybrid matings are usually between the females of a rare species and the males of a common species, but not vice versa. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID SEXUAL SEGREGATION; FOOD; RUMINANTS; RAMS; AGE
AB In many sexually dimorphic mammals, adults tend to form single-sex groups ('social segregation'). It has been assumed that social segregation is simply a by-product of sex differences in habitat use ('habitat segregation'). I tested this assumption on red deer, Cervus elaphus, and feral soay sheep, Ovis aries, using data on group Composition, habitat use and space use collected on the Scottish islands of Rum (1974-1993) and Hirta (1985-1994), respectively. If social segregation had been a by-product of habitat segregation, then (1) social segregation should have been influenced by the same environmental parameters that influence habitat segregation and (2) degree of social segregation should have equalled (and in no case been larger than) degree of habitat segregation. However, I found that weather parameters that influence habitat segregation did not influence social segregation in red deer and that degree of social segregation was significantly larger than degree of habitat segregation in both species. I conclude that social segregation is not a by-product of habitat segregation in either species, and discuss the implications of this finding.

AB The evolved functions, if any, of infant handling (IH) by female primates remain unclear for many species. I tested a new hypothesis, that II-I tests social bonds between adult females, using data on a group of wild white-faced capuchins. I also tested the nonadaptive, learning-to-mother, reciprocity; harassment and alliance-formation hypotheses. Focal subjects were the mothers of 10 infants that ranged in age from 0 to 90 days. The behaviours comprising IH (inspecting, nuzzling, sniffing, and a distinctive vocalization) differed. from typical maternal behaviour. Nulliparous females engaged in no more IH than did parous females. The median frequency of rough handling was zero, kidnapping was not observed, and maternal restraint of infants was extremely rare. Infant handling rate was unrelated to the relative dominance ranks of the mother and the handler. Females tended to handle the infants of females with which they groomed and formed aggressive coalitions more frequently; Dyadic IH rates were not correlated with rates of allonursing when the infants were older than 90 days of age. There was no evidence for reciprocal exchanges of IH between females. Mother-terminated IH bouts were longer when the mother had groomed the handler more frequently before the infant's birth. Based on these findings, the learning-to-mother,reciprocity and harassment hypotheses are unsupported for this species. Some support exists for the nonadaptive hypothesis. Contrasting predictions of the bond-testing and alliance-formation hypothesis are presented for future testing. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID ORIENTATION DISCRIMINATION; COLORED STIMULI; BEES; MEMORY; INSECT;
   PERCEPTION
AB In recognizing a pattern, honeybees, Apis mellifera, may focus either on its ventral frontal part, or on the whole frontal image. We asked whether the conditioning procedure used to train the bees to a pattern determines the recognition strategy employed. Bees were trained with the same patterns presented vertically on the back walls of a Y maze. Conditioning was either absolute, that is, bees should learn to choose a rewarded pattern when there is no alternative, or differential, that is, bees should learn to choose a rewarded pattern that is paired with a different, nonrewarded one. Bees used different pattern recognition strategies depending on the conditioning procedure: absolute conditioning restricted recognition to the lower half whilst differential conditioning extended it to the whole pattern. Bees trained with absolute conditioning saw and learned the features of the upper part of the trained patterns, but assigned more weight to the lower part. Bees trained with differential conditioning learned not only the features of the reinforced stimulus in an excitatory way, but also those of the nonreinforced one in an inhibitory way. Thus, conditioning tasks that involve not only excitatory acquisition of the conditioned stimulus per se, but also discrimination of nonreinforced stimuli, result in an increase in the visual field assigned to the recognition task. Conditioning tasks that involve only excitatory acquisition of the rewarded stimulus result in a higher weighting of the lower pattern half and thus in a more reduced field assigned to the recognition task. This difference may reflect;that existing between a conditioned and an incidental behavioural modification. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although the variability and complexity of chimpanzee behaviour frustrates generalization, it is widely believed that social evolution in this species occurs in the context of the recognizable social group or community. We used a combination of field observations and noninvasive genotyping to study the genetic structure of a habituated community of 55 wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes vents, in the Tai Forest, Cote d'Ivoire. Pedigree relationships in that community show that female mate choice strategies are more variable than previously supposed and that the observed social groups are not the exclusive reproductive units. Genetic evidence based on nuclear microsatellite markers and behavioural observations reveal that females in the Tai forest actively seek mating partners outside their social unit; noncommunity males accounted for half the paternities over 5 years. This female mating strategy increases male gene flow between communities despite male philopatry, and negates the predicted higher relatedness among community males. Kin selection seems unlikely to explain the frequent cooperation and sharing observed among group males in this population. Similarly, inbreeding avoidance is probably not the sole cause of permanent adolescent female dispersal as a combination of extragroup mating and avoidance of incest with home group males would allow females to avoid inbreeding without the hazards associated with immigration into a new community. Extragroup mating as part of chimpanzee females' reproductive strategy may allow them to choose from a wider variety and number of males, without losing the resources and support provided by their male social group partners.

AB Sand martin parentage was studied at a large breeding colony in central Scotland. Multilocus DNA fingerprinting was used during the 3-year study to exclude some social parents as true parents, and thereby determine the frequency of monogamy, quasiparasitism (QP), intraspecific brood parasitism (ISBP) and extrapair fertilization (EPF) amongst 45 broods and 167 nestlings. Monogamous parentage characterized the majority of broods (60%), so most chicks were the offspring of their social parents (81%). QP (involving a male's extrapair mate laying in his nest) was found in 9% of broods and 2.4% of chicks and ISBP (or 'egg dumping') in 4% of broods and 1.8% of chicks. A substantial proportion of offspring arose from EPFs, affecting 36% of broods and 14% of chicks. On present evidence, the relatively high frequency of QP found in sand martins is unusual. We propose that its observed frequency is unlikely to be due to chance events and may represent a female-driven strategy. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Population differences in a communicative display can lead to reproductive isolation and speciation, and are an indicator of the potential for rapid change in the display. Herein, we describe differences in-the push-up displays produced by three populations of sagebrush lizards, Sceloporus graciosus, in the field. Lizards from these three populations differ in the use of display body postures, the number of legs extended to produce the up-and-down motion of the display, and the number of headbobs produced in each of three segments of the display. In addition, there is at least one behaviour that is unique to one of the three populations (the 'nodding run'). These differences among populations suggest that both the structure and the function of the push-up display are undergoing far more rapid change than was previously thought.

AB Selecting an 'optimal' nest site is believed to be an important component of fitness for birds, but paradoxically there is often considerable intraspecific variation in nest sites. Few Studies have tested whether nest-site selection by birds changes after experience with nest predators. Using data collected over 9 years, we examined within- and between-year variation in 331 nests of white-tailed ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus. We found the first direct evidence for a fitness trade-off with amount of cover at the nest; concealed sites were less often detected by predators but were more risky for incubating hens. Small ptarmigan and those in good body condition used sites with less cover, while large ptarmigan nested at higher elevations. Nesting success was not related to age or spring body condition. Responses to experience with predators were less clear. Successful females tended to use less cover the following year, whereas unsuccessful females tended to change cover types, but not the amount of cover, in subsequent years. Overall, characteristics of nest sites showed strong seasonal patterns, suggesting that microclimate may be a more important selective pressure than predation.

AB Hypotheses proposed to explain the formation of mixed-species foraging groups have focused on both foraging and antipredation benefits. Mixed-species flocks of bark-foraging birds form during the winter in the eastern deciduous forests of North America. These flocks are composed of two parid nuclear species, tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor, and either Carolina or black-capped chickadees, Poecile carolinensis or P. atricapillus, and several satellite species including downy woodpeckers, Picoides pubescens, and white-breasted nuthatches, Sitta carolinensis. The parid nuclear species Seem to act as flock leaders and are closely followed by the satellite species. To elucidate what advantages downy woodpeckers and white-breasted nuthatches gain by flocking with parids, we removed parids from eight Ohio woodlots isolated by surrounding agricultural fields and compared the woodpeckers and nuthatches in these woodlots to those in eight controls. We tested four predictions generated by group-foraging hypotheses: compared with controls, satellite birds in treatment woodlots should (1) forage more in microclimates that reduce metabolic costs, (2) increase their vigilance, (3) exhibit reduced nutritional condition and (4) exhibit higher mortality rates. As predicted, female downy woodpeckers in treatment woodlots tended to forage in locations that were more sheltered from wind, presumably thereby reducing metabolic costs. Treatment males and females of both species significantly increased their vigilance. Finally, in the absence of parids, male nuthatches showed significantly reduced nutritional condition according to ptilochronology analysis of feathers grown during the experimental manipulation, and tended to exhibit increased mortality.

AB We assessed scent marking by golden hamsters in response to flank gland odours from kin and nonkin to investigate mechanisms of kin recognition by odour cues. Hamsters engage in two types of scent-marking behaviour, flank marking, which is associated with competition and aggression, and vaginal marking, which females use for sexual solicitation. In experiment I, flank marking by males and flank and vaginal marking by females was significantly less in response to flank odours from siblings than nonsiblings. These results indicate a lower level of agonistic motivation (flank marking),and sexual interest (vaginal marking) towards kin than nonkin. In experiment-2, the marking responses of males and females to flank odours from siblings, unfamiliar half-siblings and unfamiliar nonsiblings were graded based on the degree of relatedness. In experiment 3, males from cross-fostered lifters marked significantly less in response to flank odours from brothers than nonbrothers, regardless of whether they were reared with the odour donors. These results demonstrate a phenotype matching mechanism for kin recognition based on differences between odours from kin and nonkin. Because the-presence of foster-siblings or a foster-mother in the nest did not change hamsters' responses to flank odours from kin:versus: nonkin, one possible explanation for our results is that hamsters use their own odour-asa referent in this process ('self-referent phenotype matching').

AB Conspecifics may play a positive, neutral or negative role in the habitat choices of prospective settlers. I investigated the effect of conspecifics on habitat choice in a territorial grasshopper, Ligurotettix coquilletti, in three field experiments using both broadcast calls and live males as stimuli.:In a two-bush choice experiment, males chose bushes from which conspecific calls-were broadcast over either silent bushes or bushes broadcasting:calls of another grasshopper species. When presented with a choice between broadcast calls and a live conspecific male, however, males preferred bushes that contained a live male. In the third experiment, males were more strongly attracted to bushes occupied by a single territorial male than to unoccupied bushes, but had a lower probability of remaining on occupied bushes over an extended period. Despite the lower overall probability of remaining on a-bush, males remained clustered on the occupied bushes at the end of this experiment because Of their high initial attraction to occupied bushes.

AB An important function of the courtship displays of male animals is to stimulate, or 'persuade', females to mate. While many studies of courtship success' have shown that females choose stimulating males as partners fewer have demonstrated that the most persuasive males in a population also enjoy the highest mating success (i.e. mate with the greatest numbers of partners). Such a relationship provides a stronger test of the hypothesis that male displays evolve by sexual selection via female choice. We tested this hypothesis in the laboratory using the North American plethodontid salamander, Desmognathus ocoee, in which females only elicit spermatophore deposition if rendered sexually responsive by male courtship. First, we determined variance among individual males hi the numbers of females with which the mated across 35 encounters, in the absence of differences in partner encounter rates and direct intermale interactions. Second, we demonstrated that males with high 'historical' scores of mating success performed significantly higher frequencies of persuasive courtship displays,which provide tactile, chemical and visual stimulation to females. We conclude that sexual selectionvia female choice favours persuasive displays because they confer high mating success on the males that perform them at the highest frequencies.

AB Humans exhibit left-hemisphere dominance for processing spoken language, a species-specific acoustic signal characterized by a suite of spectre-temporal parameters. Some nonhuman primates (genus Macaca) also exhibit left-hemisphere dominance for processing their species-specific vocalizations, as evidenced by right-ear biases in orienting and reaction-time studies, and more damaging effects from left- than right-hemisphere lesions. Little, however, is known about the acoustic features underlying such biases, We conducted field playback experiments on adult rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta, to determine whether asymmetries in perception (measured as an orienting bias) are sensitive to changes in the temporal characteristics of their calls. If the observed right-ear bias for perceiving conspecific calls (Hauser & Andersson 1994, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 91, 3946-3948) depends upon particular acoustic parameters, then experimental manipulations beyond the species-typical range of signal variation will cause a change in perceptual asymmetry, either reversing the pattern (i.e. right to left ear) or wiping it out (i.e. no asymmetry). We presented manipulated and unmanipulated exemplars of three pulsatile call types within the rhesus repertoire: an affiliative signal 'grunt', an alarm signal 'shrill bark', and a mating signal 'copulation scream'. Signal manipulations involved either (1) a reduction of the interpulse interval to zero or the population minimum or (2) an expansion of the interpulse interval to the population maximum, or two times the maximum. For the grunt and shrill bark, manipulations of interpulse interval outside the range of natural variation either eliminated the orienting bias or caused a shift from right- to left-ear bias. For the copulation scream, however, a right-ear bias was observed in response to all stimuli, manipulated and unmanipulated. Results show that for some call types within the repertoire, temporal properties such as interpulse interval provide significant information to listeners about whether the signal is from a conspecific or not. We interpret the orienting bias as evidence that hemispheric asymmetries underly this perceptual effect. (C) 1998 the Association for lire Study of Animal Behaviour.

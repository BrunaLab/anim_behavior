AB The diet consumed by animals can influence their physical condition and potential for reproductive success. Do differences in diet quality affect the attractiveness of secondary sexual characteristics to the opposite sex? This study addressed this question by examining the attractiveness of odours produced by meadow voles, Microtus pensylvanicus, that were fed diets that differed in protein content. Meadow voles that served as scent donors were maintained on one of three diets, consisting of 9, 15 or 25% protein, all of which are sufficient to maintain voles in reproductive condition. These diets influenced the attractiveness of all three odours tested (anogenital area, urine and faeces). Both male and female subjects preferred odours from donors on high-protein diets: subjects preferred odours of opposite-sex conspecifics fed a 15 or 25% protein diet over odours from donors fed a 9% protein diet. Females preferred two odours of males on a 25% protein diet over the same odours of males on a 15% protein diet. These results suggest a mechanism for mate choice via odour preferences based on the protein content of the food consumed by potential partners. Because animals compete for access to higher-quality diets in nature, the choice of a mate with a high-quality diet may also be a means of choosing a higher-'quality' individual.

ID BILL MORPHOLOGY; PARUS-MAJOR; ECTOPARASITE; BIRDS
AB Many bird parasites reduce their hosts' fitness and, as a consequence, anti-parasite behaviour such as preening and nest sanitation has evolved. These activities are time consuming and, during the day, compete directly with time devoted to foraging and food provisioning to nestlings. Moreover, infested hosts may have to allocate extra time to foraging in order to compensate for the energy loss that ectoparasites impose on the nestlings and parents. Alternatively, brooding females could, at the expense of sleeping, allocate more time to preening and nest sanitation at night. If sleeping has a short-term restoring function, one may then expect a reduction in feeding efficiency of sleep-deprived females. In this study, the effect of a haematophagous ectoparasite, the hen flea, on the activity budgets of breeding female great tits during the day and at night was investigated experimentally. Time allocated to nest sanitation increased only slightly from 0.6 % of daytime in ectoparasite-free nests to 2.8% of daytime in infested nests, thus demonstrating the higher priority given to food provisioning than parasite control. Females in infested nests reduced their sleeping time significantly (73.5% of night-time in parasite-free nests versus 48.1% in infested nests). The time freed from the reduction of sleeping time was mainly used for nest sanitation (8.3% of night-time in parasite-free nests versus 27.1% in infested nests). Despite this strong decrease in sleeping time, there was no effect of ectoparasites on the females' rate of food provisioning to nestlings. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB To test the hypothesis that female choice has been subject to direct selection by predators, it was investigated whether female guppies would switch their choice of mate from more to less conspicuous males after observing a potential predator. Social and sexual preferences of virgin females for each of two males differing in amount of carotenoid pigmentation (an ornamental trait) were measured both before and after visual exposure to a novel predatory cichlid. Females initially showed strong social and sexual preferences for the brighter of the two males. Preferred males also showed lower levels of fluctuating asymmetry in the area of carotenoid pigmentation and displayed at higher rates. After exposure to the cichlid, almost half of the females became sexually unreceptive, and the remainder showed a nearly unanimous sexual preference for the duller male. Control females that did not see the cichlid continued to prefer the brighter male. These results imply that predators have selected against females that mate with conspicuous males. They also suggest that predators can influence sexual selection on male ornaments proximately through their effects on female choice as well as by imposing mortality on conspicuous males. Both conclusions suggest that indirect selection on female preferences may not play a dominant role in this system. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Field data and experiments on the presence of parasites and mate choice in Gammarus insensibilis are presented in an attempt to identify the processes responsible for assortative pairing by parasitic prevalence. Males and females captured in precopula in the field were matched for parasitic prevalence, confirming previous observations. Experiments in the laboratory indicated that assortative pairing by prevalence was largely due to the vertical segregation of infected and uninfected individuals in the water column, resulting from the behavioural alterations induced by the parasite Microphallus papillorobustus (Trematoda, Microphallidae) on its gammarid host. Assortative pairing by parasitic prevalence was not observed when water depth was experimentally reduced to a few centimetres. However, assortative pairing by size, a common pattern of pairing in gammarids, was observed whatever the water depth. Choice experiments, in the absence of vertical segregation, showed that males were choosing females on the basis of time left to moult, but were also capable of discriminating between infected and uninfected females. In addition, infected males had a longer latency to precopula during choice tests. The results are discussed in relation to current ideas on how parasites can affect mate choice.

   MAXIMIZERS; ECOLOGY; COSTS; FOOD
AB Although average nectar sugar concentrations in hummingbird-pollinated plants are low (20-25% sucrose-equivalent sugars; mass/total mass), in choice tests birds have preferred concentrations higher than 45%. This discrepancy might be explained by the use of large nectar volumes in all published choice tests to date. Biophysical models predict that low concentrations maximize energy intake rates, and thus may be preferred, at small nectar volumes characteristic of the flowers that birds visit. Rufous hummingbirds', Selasphorus rufus, concentration preferences were tested and their energy intake rates measured at low volume with a computer-controlled food-delivery and activity-monitoring system. Contrary to the predictions of models, birds generally preferred 65% sucrose over more dilute solutions. This preference generated near-maximal energy intake rates over the time scale of foraging bouts, even though rates over flower visits and shorter time scales suggested that lower concentrations would be more profitable. Neither hummingbirds' preferences nor the energetics of nectar extraction in this low-volume presentation account for the low nectar sugar concentrations characteristic of the flowers they pollinate.

ID HONEY-BEES; SCENT-MARK; BEHAVIOR
AB Newly emerged bees learn to forage more efficiently as they gain experience. To test the hypothesis that foraging efficiency would increase as bees gain experience during the day, but would decrease after a night, owing to loss of memory, naive Bombus terrestris bumblebees were allowed to forage on two clusters of artificial flowers of unequal profitabilities during 3 consecutive days. Nectar intake rate, percentage of visits to the more profitable cluster, probing time and time intervals between visits were computed as measures of the bees' foraging efficiency. Nectar intake rates increased significantly during the day, and decreased partially but significantly after a night. They varied greatly between bees. The bees did not show a preference for one of the clusters at the onset of the experiment, and none consistently increased their visits to the more profitable cluster during single observation days. Most individuals did not visit the higher-reward cluster exclusively by the end of the third day. However, visits to the higher-reward cluster did increase significantly when the first day of observation was compared with the third day. Preference for the higher-reward duster increased after the first night but decreased significantly after the second night. Probing time and inter-visit intervals decreased significantly during observation days, and increased significantly after a night. The results indicate that bees learn to approach and probe flowers faster, as they gain experience, during a foraging day, but that these skins are partially forgotten overnight. Patch preference is formed more slowly. Once formed, it is also weakened overnight. Such partial forgetting may aid the bee in reacting quickly to overnight changes in resource profitability by modifying flower choices and handling techniques.

As part oi. an effort to determine whether this pattern could be accounted for by reinforcement,female phonotaxis was studied in both species. Females of both species were attracted to male songs, but were relatively insensitive to interspecific differences in songs. Thus, female preference does not appear likely to account for calling song divergence between A. fasciatus and A. socius. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Predation risk is expected to affect the foraging behaviour of individual prey according to their size, sex and reproductive condition. Parasites may also affect the foraging behaviour of their hosts, due to increased energetic demands imposed by the parasite, or due to a parasite strategy to increase the likelihood of its transmission to the next host. Field studies were conducted to determine the effects of size, reproductive condition and trematode infection on foraging behaviour in a freshwater snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Among uninfected snails, small individuals (<3.8 mm in length) foraged more than large individuals during daylight hours when the risk of predation is greatest; non-brooding adult females foraged more during the day than females that were brooding embryos. These results suggest that juveniles and non-brooding females trade off the risk of predation with the energy required for growth and reproduction, respectively. Infection by a digenetic trematode (Microphallus sp.) also caused significant changes in snail behaviour. This trematode has a two-host life cycle. Snails are the intermediate host, and ducks are the final host. Encysted parasite larvae are transmitted to ducks when they ingest snails infected with mature larval cysts. Results showed that snails infected by encysted, transmissible larvae foraged in the early morning hours, and retreated under rocks during the late morning. In contrast, snails infected by unencysted non-transmissible larvae retreated to positions under rocks in the early morning, and mirrored the risk-averse strategy of brooding females. These results suggest that, when the parasite larvae encyst and become transmissible to the final host, they induce the snails to forage later into the morning. Because foraging by waterfowl is greatest in the early morning, encysted larvae may manipulate snail behaviour to increase the likelihood of their transmission to the final host.

AB Food-hoarding animals are assumed to maximize total storage while meeting their own energetic requirements. To maintain energetic balance, a hoarder must also devote some time to feeding. The predicted choice of hoarding strategy depends on the net rate at which a hoarder is able to feed itself. Rate-maximizing hoarding is favoured when the net self-feeding rate is high, as it was during our experiment. (At lower net self-feeding rates, the hoarder should behave more efficiently.) To evaluate the expectation of rate maximization, we examined load-size decisions (number of raisins collected for storage) made by hoarding grey jays, Perisoreus canadensis. During each visit to an experimental food source, the subject was forced to wait for access to the food. Following this delay, the jay collected a load, transported it for storage, and returned to the source. The predicted size of rate- and efficiency-maximizing loads diverged with increases in the delay. As predicted by both currencies, the jays collected larger loads following longer delays. The magnitude of the observed adjustments indicates that the jays closely approached the maximal rate of hoarding. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Despite well-documented experimental evidence of echolocation in toothed whales, virtually nothing is known about the use and functional significance of cetacean sonar in the wild. Here, the patterns of echolocation sounds produced by killer whales, Orcinus orca, off British Columbia and Alaska are described. Two sympatric populations with divergent food habits differed markedly in sonar sound production. Individuals belonging to the fish-eating 'resident' population produced trains of characteristic sonar clicks, on average, 4% of the time, 27 times more often than marine mammal-eating 'transient' killer whales. The click trains of residents averaged 7 s, more than twice as long as the trains of transients. Click repetition rates within resident's trains were constant or changed gradually; within transient's trains they often fluctuated abruptly. Transients produced isolated single or paired clicks at an average rate of 12/h, four times as often as residents. In general, the isolated clicks and infrequent, short and irregular trains of transients were less conspicuous against background noise than the sonar of residents. This difference in acoustic crypticity may reflect a flexible response to the probability of alerting prey, because marine mammals have more acute hearing than fish in the frequency range of sonar clicks. In both populations, echolocation use per individual decreased with increasing group size, suggesting the sharing of information between group members. No relationships were found between echolocation activity and water clarity for whales of either population. Transient whales often travelled or foraged without discernibly echolocating, suggesting that passive listening provides cues for prey detection and orientation.

AB This study investigated whether the escape behaviour of lizard species could be predicted by knowledge of their functional capabilities. In the laboratory, the effect of perch support diameter on sprinting and jumping ability was measured in five species of Anolis lizards. In all species, sprint speed declined with decreasing perch diameter, but decreased perch diameter had little effect on jumping ability. The escape behaviour of a lizard on a particular-sized support in nature was then evaluated as a function of the lizard's sprinting and jumping capabilities. As diameter decreased, lizards in all but one species tended to escape by jumping more frequently because jumping ability is less affected by diameter than is sprinting ability. It was also predicted that species in which running ability declines greatly as diameter decreases should switch to escape by jumping more often than species that experience less of a decline in running ability. This prediction was not confirmed. Consequently, functional capabilities play a role in determining escape behaviour in Anolis lizards, but other factors may be important as well.

AB Male smallmouth bass defend nest sites and progeny after spawning. Females may consequently discriminate between potential mates with respect to characters that indicate paternal quality. Survivorship of offspring was previously found to be positively related to the site tenacity of a male following a disturbance at the nest. In this study, a comparison of the behaviour of 462 males over four spawning seasons indicated that both body size and the developmental stage of offspring in nests influenced male guarding behaviour. Large males were more site-tenacious than small males following a human disturbance at the nest, but the strength of the association differed between spawning seasons. Males that were guarding eggs at the time of intrusion were more tenacious than males that were guarding larvae, suggesting that higher ventilation requirements of eggs may motivate males to assume higher risks of injury. Male tenacity depended neither on the date of the spawning season on which male behaviour was evaluated, male age, nor the number of offspring defended after accounting for male body size and the developmental stage of offspring. Male body size could thus provide female M. dolomieui with an a priori indicator of the paternal quality of potential mates. Comparisons of male mortality indicated that the cost of reproduction did not depend on body size and that large parental males suffered a higher reproduction-independent mortality than small parental males. Size-dependent mortality could consequently favour a relatively higher investment into current progeny by large males. Large males should also be capable of a higher absolute investment into current offspring than small males because of size-dependent metabolism and reduced feeding during the period of parental care. Higher absolute investment by large males may explain the apparent female mate preference for large male M. dolomieui and the tendency for females to prefer large males as mates in other fishes with paternal care.

AB In support of the Trivers & Willard model of adaptive variation in birth sex ratio, recent research showed that high-ranking female domestic pigs, Sus scrofa, gave birth to a greater proportion of sons than low-ranking females. Differences in maternal nutritional status caused by differential access to food of high- and low-ranking females, or differences in adrenal activity as the result of stress experienced during agonistic encounters are two possible mechanisms underlying these findings. This study examined the role that these mechanisms may play, and further investigated the relationship between social status and birth sex ratio in the pig, not only within, but also across pregnancies. The reproductive performance of a group of 37 female pigs was recorded across four pregnancies. Social status and adrenal activity of individuals were assessed during the first and fourth pregnancies. Within each pregnancy, there was no relationship between social status and birth sex ratio. Despite cross-pregnancy consistency in social status, there was no consistency in the sex ratios of the females' consecutive litters. However, high-ranking females produced significantly fewer males across all four pregnancies. There was no linear relationship between a female's social status and adrenal activity, and no evidence that adrenal activity was related to subsequent birth sex ratio. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy (an indicator of nutritional status) was unrelated to birth sex ratio. Data from a study of maternal nutrition in pigs also failed to show a clear relationship between nutritional status and birth sex ratio. Differences between the findings of the present and previous studies are discussed from functional and causal perspectives. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Crested penguins (genus Eudyptes) have a remarkable brood reduction system in which the first of two eggs laid is much smaller than the second and frequently disappears from the nest. The causes of this mortality are uncertain. In royal penguins, E. schlegeli, 70 of 84 pairs lost their first egg during the it-day interval before the second was laid, and in 15 of 22 observed losses, mothers actively ejected their own eggs from the nest. Most first-egg losses (57%) occurred within a day prior to the appearance of the second egg. Parental ejection in royal penguins was not associated with high rates of extra-pair parentage: DNA fingerprinting of 13 two-chick families detected only one individual that was unrelated to its putative father. a manipulation experiment, intended to assess the viability and insurance value of first eggs, yielded equivocal results. The hatching success of first eggs, which were temporarily removed and then substituted for second eggs, was only half that of second eggs that were not removed (48% versus 93%, N=89), but apparent viability differences due to egg type may have been confounded by delayed incubation and additional handling. None the less, the apparent reproductive value of first eggs was low; only one of 137 unmanipulated first eggs hatched. Some testable hypotheses are suggested for the evolution of ejection behaviour in Eudyptes. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The agonistic behaviour of two species of colonial spiders, Metepeira sp. a (atascadero), and M. incrassata, from desert and tropical habitats, respectively, in Mexico, were compared by observing induced interactions between immature and/or female spiders at natural web sites. Individuals of the desert species showed a greater tendency to escalate to potentially damaging behaviour, whereas the tropical species exhibited primarily low-intensity aggressive behaviour. In both species, greater body mass determined which spider gained possession of the web in unequally matched contests, whereas in equally matched contests, web residents won more often than did intruders. Desert spider conflicts were of significantly longer duration than tropical spider conflicts. The significance of these results for understanding the evolution of social behaviour in spiders is discussed. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

   EVOLUTION; BIRDS; SPARROWHAWKS; TRAIT; SIZE
AB Male pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, are highly variable in breeding plumage coloration, ranging from bright (black-and-white) to dull (brown and female-like). Male disappearance was studied during the breeding season in a woodland area in Norway. The disappearance peaked during the nestling period, probably because of predation by the European sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus. Significantly more bright (11%) than dull (0%) males disappeared during breeding. Variation in male body size (wing length, body mass), age, previous breeding experience, and aspects of behaviour (effort and success in mate attraction and in feeding of the young) did not seem to explain the differences in male disappearance. Hence, the data suggest a cost associated with conspicuous coloration. Brightly coloured males may be more readily detected than dull males by a predator and detected earlier, resulting in a greater chance of a successful attack. Female disappearance (10%) was similar to that of brightly coloured males but significantly higher than that of dull males. Females may be initially less easily detected but once detected less able to escape a predator. The results support the view that predation may help explain sexual dimorphism in bird coloration, delayed plumage maturation, and why males in species with less male parental care are more colourful than males in species with more male parental care.

AB The water mites Unionicola formosa and U. foili are obligate symbionts of the freshwater unionid mussels Pyganodon cataracta and Utterbackia imbecillis, respectively. Although behavioural specificity of adult U. formosa and U. foili is well documented, behaviour of the larvae of these species is poorly understood. The present study revealed that host-influenced behaviour of larval U. formosa and U. foili is highly host-specific, but changes during larval ontogeny. Larvae that had completed their parasitic phase with chironomid dipterans (=post-chironomid larvae) preferentially responded to a chemical signal from their respective host mussel, and exhibited the host-induced negative phototaxis that characterizes adult mites. Specificity of the host recognition behaviour of post-chironomid larvae was modified when larvae were exposed to water modified by a non-host mussel species early in development. The chemically mediated behaviour patterns exhibited by post-chironomid larvae were absent among mite larvae prior to parasitizing chironomids (=pre-chironomid larvae). These data suggest that parasitism of a chironomid is adaptive for the ontogeny of behaviour of these mussel-mites at specific stages in the mite's life cycle. Differences in the behaviour of pre-chironomid and post-chironomid larvae may reflect the different demands of contacting an insect host prior to establishing the symbiotic association with the final molluscan host. The behavioural preferences of larval U. formosa and U. foili complement those of adult mites and suggest that host specificity is an important mechanism in maintaining reproductive isolation between these two species.

AB A population of Edith's checkerspot butterfly, Euphydryas editha, laid eggs on two morphologically distinct host-plant species, one of which it had recently colonized. Search behaviour of two groups of females was compared in the held. 'Naive' females were experimentally deprived of both flight experience and host encounter, while 'experienced' females were observed without intervention. Three analyses failed to show evidence for adaptive learning that might have allowed the butterflies to increase their efficiency of host finding with experience: (1) proportions of alights on hosts were not different between the naive and experienced groups, (2) rates of alighting on hosts did not differ between the naive and experienced groups, and (3) probabilities of alighting on hosts did not increase during searching bouts. Both groups searched efficiently for their traditional host species, Pedicularis semibarbata (dwarf lousewort), and inefficiently for the novel host, Collinsia torreyi (blue-eyed Mary). There was also no evidence for behavioural differences among individuals of either group. The distribution among individuals of alight frequencies on C. torreyi appeared Poisson, with a single mode near the frequency expected from random alighting. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that no females recognized C. torreyi as a host in flight, and that differences between butterflies in observed alight frequencies stemmed simply from random variation in the composition of the vegetation over which they flew. Thus, the absence of adaptive learning impeded the evolutionary incorporation of the novel host into the diet. These results complement previous findings that E. editha from the same population failed to learn to accept particular hosts after alighting and are in contrast to other studies of insect foraging, all of which have shown that learning is an important component of foraging behaviour, causing search efficiency to improve with experience. It is suggested that E. editha could be a model 'non-learning' insect in comparative studies that empirically test the role of learning in resource choice.

AB In desert seed harvester ants, Messor pergandei, young queens (foundresses) initiate colonies alone or in groups. Previous laboratory studies revealed that multiple foundress associations produced larger initial broods of workers and were therefore more successful at stealing the brood of single foundress colonies. The idea that joint nesting is an evolutionary response to inter-colony interference competition was tested by establishing single and double foundress associations in the same field habitat. Double foundress colonies did not outlive single foundress colonies; indeed, the advantage was in the opposite direction although not significantly so. Additionally, brood raiding was not observed between new colonies. Moreover, new colonies were clumped, despite there being no evidence that nesting sites were limited. These results strongly imply that interference competition among new colonies does not differentially favour joint over single nesting. Instead, multiple foundress associations may arise from selection on females to join any nest, whether occupied or not, to lessen their risk of being preyed upon or of desiccating aboveground. Nest owners appear to tolerate such joiners, presumably because fighting is costly and most intruders die naturally. Finally; foundresses preferentially nest near mature colonies, perhaps because older colonies signal the site's profitability. In fact, the nearer a new colony was to a mature colony, the more Likely it was to produce workers. Although these new colonies were usually destroyed by the neighbouring mature colonies, nesting in such locations may be favoured if the mature colony were to die before initiating raids. Queens from raided new colonies may even join neighbouring mature colonies.

AB Flocks of male red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, were observed as they foraged on 9 x 12-m tilled plots within a 0.2-ha flight pen. One of the plots contained rice seed treated with the bird repellent methiocarb; a second plot received untreated rice. When each flock displayed a consistent avoidance of the treated plot, the number of experienced birds in the 12-bird flock was sequentially reduced to six, three, one and zero. Latency to use of the untreated plot and time spent foraging in the treated plot by naive birds were greatly reduced when at least one experienced bird was present. Throughout the 4-day trials, use of the treated seed plot by naive birds was greater than that of experienced birds. The naive flock members benefited by following experienced birds to the untreated seed plot, thereby discovering and using it more quickly than when no experienced birds were present. The naive birds did not avoid the treated seed plot, however, and many ate the treated seed and became sick. Thus, the benefit of associating with experienced birds was in learning where to forage, not where to avoid.

ID COMMUNICATION; INSECTS
AB Dancing honey bee, Apis mellifera, foragers indicate distance and direction of profitable food sources to their nestmates. It has recently been proposed that this indication of distance and direction is based on a cognitive map of the surroundings of the bees' nest, which is used to memorize the location of the food source, rather than on a path integration mechanism, which integrates distances and directions flown on the actual way to and from the food source. This hypothesis was tested using a paradigm, in which forager bees were temporarily made to fly stationarily in a wind tunnel on their way to and from the feeding site, so that information about the way to the feeding site, but not the information about the location of the food source, was experimentally influenced. The results show that dancing honey bees use information about distances and directions acquired en route; they do not support the cognitive map concept.

AB Males of the fiddler crab Uca beebei defend, court from and attract females to burrows in intertidal mud flats. Females sequentially enter and leave several male burrows before they stay in one, mate and breed. This reproductive pattern is common among fiddler crabs and suggests that males may compete for females by competing for high-quality breeding sites and females may choose mates based on burrow quality. These ideas were tested for U. beebei by comparing structural features of (1) male and female burrows and (2) the male burrows females entered and left and those in which they mated. Male burrows had narrower openings and shafts than female burrows, but neither these nor 10 other burrow features differed between the male burrows females left and those in which they mated. Thus, there was no evidence of resource-defence mating in U. beebei. This pattern of mating behaviour may be rare in the genus because burrows suitable for breeding generally may be abundant and available to both sexes. Male fiddler crabs may compete for burrows due to their value for post-copulatory mate guarding and females may choose mates on the basis of courtship displays, not the quality of burrows for breeding.

AB This study examined attendance by male barking treefrogs in breeding choruses. During four study seasons lasting 49-96 nights, median chorus tenure (the number of nights that a male participated in a breeding chorus) was only 2-3 nights. Males with chorus tenures of 2 nights or more were present for a median of 40-77% of the nights between their first and last night in the chorus. Both mating success (number of mates) and mating efficiency (nightly probability of obtaining a mate) were positively correlated with chorus tenure, but body size was not. Males whose condition declined less rapidly had both longer chorus tenures and higher mating efficiencies than males whose condition declined more rapidly. Males that spent intermediate amounts of time in the chorus each night had longer chorus tenures than did males that were present for either shorter or longer periods each night. Chorus tenure and mating efficiency made similar contributions to variance in male mating success based on a partitioning of the opportunity for selection on seasonal mating success.

AB Many studies have demonstrated that female passerine birds have reduced reproductive success when breeding as secondary females of polygynous males, usually because they receive less male parental care than monogamous or primary females. In the corn bunting, Miliaria calandra, by contrast, nests of primary and secondary females of polygynous males had similar success and nests of monogamous females tended to have lower success than both groups. Males provided almost no parental care (including nest building, incubation, nuptial feeds and provisioning of nestlings) until the chicks were about 4 days old, after which time they provided an average of up to 22% of feeds. Males did not provision nestlings of monogamous, primary or secondary nests differently as regards either feed rate or amount of food per visit. Male parental care was not associated with fledging success. A female's frequency of feeding visits was not associated with her status nor with the fledging success of her brood, but the proportion of large food loads delivered to the nestlings was positively correlated with fledging success.

ID TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA
AB Zebra finch subspecies, Taeniopygia guttata and T. g. castanotis, were cross-fostered to members of the other subspecies and their subsequent mating preferences measured. In multiple mate-choice tests, an individual could show a preference for perching near a particular bird but physical contact was not possible: in one-way mate-choice tests, stimulus birds were prevented from the individual being tested by one-way mirrors; in two-way mate-choice tests, wire-mesh screens allowed visual interaction between the test individual and the stimulus bird. In subsequent pair-formation tests, the same birds could form pairs freely in an aviary. When both sexes were cross-fostered, the birds preferred members of the foster subspecies in mate-choice tests and formed mixed pairs in the aviary. However, when only one sex was cross-fostered and the other was raised normally by members of their own subspecies all the cross-fostered males, and the majority of cross-fostered females, paired with members of their own subspecies in the aviary, irrespective of their preferences in one-way mate-choice tests. Birds spent more time with the individual they later mated within the aviary in two-way than in one-way mate-choice tests in all studies. In mate-choice tests, when both sexes were cross-fostered significantly more females than males chose their furture mate. However, when only one sex was cross-fostered more normallly raised than cross-fostered birds chose their future mate, irrespective of sex; this suggests that rearing experience has an important influence on which member of the pair ultimately chooses the mate.

AB Polygyny among European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, a monoterritorial, colonially breeding passerine, was studied for 4 years. In nestbox colonies around Antwerp, Belgium, primary females did not breed less successfully than monogamous females. No aggressive physical interactions between primary females and prospecting secondary females were recorded. Some primary females ''interfered'' (i.e. flew into the tree where the secondary nestbox was situated) when their mate was demonstrating a secondary nestbox to a prospecting female, but were chased off by their mate almost every time they interfered. Primary females ''interfered'' more frequently before completing their clutch than afterwards. Secondary females generally fledged significantly fewer young than monogamous females. Secondary females could be classified into two categories. Category I females did not have the opportunity to select bachelor males at the time of mating, and these secondary matingd may therefore be explained by the female-biased sex ratio at the time. Category II females, which could choose between mated and unmated males, fledged only 68% as many young as did simultaneously laying monogamous or primary females and their young weighed less. The results conflict with the predictions of the polygyny threshold model and the sexy son hypothesis, that secondary females should gain evolutionary advantage in either the short or long term. On the present evidence, it is not clear why category II females mated with already-mated males. Circumstantial evidence that they might have been unaware of the male''s maital status at mating is presented.

TI VIDEO IMAGE RECOGNITION BY THE JUMPING SPIDER, MAEVIA-INCLEMENS (ARANEA,
   SALTICIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Jumping spiders of the family Salticidae have well developed eyes, which mediate their highly stereotyped predatory and communicative behaviour. Experimental studies presented here provide behavioural evidence that salticids are capable of perceiving televised (video) images. Juvenile and sexually mature individuals of the dimorphic jumping spider, Maevia inclemens (Walckenaer), were tested in V-maze choice tests and behavioural chambers where they were allowed to view images of videotaped prey and spiders presented on Sony Watchman micro-television units. Results from this study suggest that jumping spiders interpret video images as renal, because: (1) spiders did not discriminate between live prey and its simultaneously presented video image; and (2) they behave appropriately when presented with televised images of prey insects (e.g. stalk and attack televised prey), conspecifics (e.g. courtship and sexual receptivity behaviour directed toward televised conspecifics) and heterospecific jumping spider species (e.g. retreat from predator stimulus). These observations support a previous estimate of low critical flicker fusion frequency values in this group, and enable the development of a powerful new method for the study of animal behaviour.

TI THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING 1ST - A PRIMACY EFFECT IN FILIAL IMPRINTING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The stability of filial preferences of domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, was investigated. In a series of experiments, preferences were measured in simultaneous choice tests at the end of 3-day periods of exposure to conspicuous artificial objects. In experiments 1 and 2, day-old chicks were exposed to one of two coloured cylinders, followed by exposure to the alternative stimulus. The original preference was significantly reversed. After a third phase of the experiment, during which the chicks were isolated (experiment 1) or exposed to the two stimuli simultaneously (experiment 2), the preference changed significantly towards the first object. A significant preference for the first object was reacquired in only one combination of stimuli in experiment 2a. The results were similar for experiments 2b-2d, in which the period of exposure to the first (2b) and the second (2d) object was increased or when there was a period of isolation after exposure to the first object  (2c). In all these experiments, the stimuli differed only in the single dimension of colour. In experiment 3, the two stimuli used differed in colour, shape and pattern. Three days of exposure to one object, followed by 3 days exposure to the other object and 3 days to both objects simultaneously, led to a significant ''resurfacing'' of a preference for the first stimulus, irrespective of which stimulus was presented first. These results confirm that the reversal of filial preferences need not be  permanent and are consistent with a ''competitive exclusion'' model of imprinting.

TI EFFECT OF PRIOR RESIDENCE ON DOMINANCE STATUS OF DARK-EYED JUNCOS,
   JUNCO-HYEMALIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Both prior residence and age have been reported to influence rank in avian dominance hierarchies. The aim of this study was to determine the relative effects of these two factors on dominance status of dark-eyed juncos. Twenty-one mixed-age flocks of recently captured juncos (192 individuals ) were observed in two similar aviary experiments, one conducted during autumn migration and the other after autumn migration had ended. In the experimental treatment, a group of adult juncos was held in a  cage for 1 week and then introduced to an observation cage in which a group of young juncos had already been housed for 1 week, thereby giving the young birds a prior-residence advantage. In the control treatment, groups of each age were held in separate cages for 1 week and were then introduced simultaneously to a neutral observation cage. Dominance ranks of all individuals were determined through observation of aggressive interactions. When given prior residence, young birds clearly dominated  adults. Because adults tended to dominate young in control flocks, these results demonstrate that prior residence can reverse agerelate dominance among flocks of juncos under semi-natural conditions. If these results apply to wild populations, they indicate that young juncos might gain in dominance status during winter if they timed their autumn migration so as to arrive on the wintering grounds before adults.

AB Between 1980 and 1990, 176 adult Merriam''s kangaroo rats were subcutaneously implanted with radio transmitters and tracked for a total fo 6316 animal-days at a California site, prior to and during reproductive seasons. Thirty-six animals are known to have been killed by predators, and 14 who disappeared abruptly are also presumed victims. These 50 cases permit various analyses of differential predation risk. Males incurred a predation rate (4.22 deaths per animal-year) more than twice that of females (2.01); this sex difference in mortality was apparently absent or reversed after the breeding season. Both male and female victims travelled significantly greater distances between successive radio-location shortly before their deaths than surviving same-sex animals tracked contemporaneously. Rather than being selective for the feeble, predation on kangaroo rats is selective for the mobile.

TI THE INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF MINNOW ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus, populations that occur sympatrically with pike, Esox lucius, a piscivorous predator, form more cohesive schools and have better integrated evasion tactics than fish from pike-free waters. The present study, which used two laboratory-reared populations of minnows, showed that anti-predator behaviour is inherited, but that it is modified on the basis of early experience (of a simulated predator attack). The greatest adjustment in anti-predator behaviour occurred in the minnows naturally sympatric with pike, suggesting a genetic predisposition to respond to early experience that varies between populations.

TI LEARNING OF HOST MICROHABITAT COLOR BY EXERISTES-ROBORATOR (F)
   (HYMENOPTERA, ICHNEUMONIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Females of the polyphagous, ichneumonid ectoparasitoid, Exeristes roborator (F.), learned the colour (wavelength), but not the brightness (intensity), of light reflected by artificial host microhabitats in the laboratory. Females given hosts in a microhabitat of only one colour subsequently preferred to contact and perform host-seeking behaviour on it when offered a choice between it and a microhabitat of another colour. Control insects did not exhibit this preference. Colour learning  influenced females'' responses whether or not hosts were present in the microhabitats. However, it did not altogether prevent females from finding hosts in microhabitats of colours that they had not learned. In nature, learning of host microhabitat colour may allow E. roborator to identify plant material that experience has taught it is a profitable resource.

TI FACTORS DETERMINING PARENTAL PREFERENCE OF CONVICT CICHLID FRY,
   CICHLASOMA-NIGROFASCIATUM (PISCES, CICHLIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Twenty-two pairs of convict cichlids and their fry were tested with a design that offered fry a simultaneous choice between their parents. The parents were presented to the fry in two states: alive and dead. The behaviour of the live parents as well as the parental preference shown by their fry were recorded. Parental preference was determined by recording the time 29 or more of 31 fry remained near the parent fish. When the parents were presented alive, the fry spent more time near the female; however, the male was preferred when the same parents were presented dead. The behaviour of the parents accounted for this difference; females performed significantly more parental behaviour than males. Males are larger than females, and may have been chosen for that reason in the experiment with dead parents. These results suggest fry prefer to approach and stay near an adult exhibiting certain behaviour patterns; morphological differences between the sexes are of secondary importance.

TI MALE TAIL LENGTH AND FEMALE MATE CHOICE IN THE MONOGAMOUS SWALLOW
   HIRUNDO-RUSTICA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male and female swallows benefit from an early start to breeding because it allows the raising of many young and a high proportion of two broods within a single season. Long-tailed males arrived early in spring while female arrival date was independent of their tail length. Male tail length was significantly positively related to success in mate acquisition and negatively to the duration of the pre-mating period and the start of breeding. Arrival date also influenced success in mate acquisition  and mating date. Females chose mates using tail length as a cue. Female mate choice was apparently not affected by territory quality. Female swallows could not predict the intensity of mate guarding or the extent of paternal care (feeding intensity of offsping) from male arrival date or male tail length.

TI A UNIQUE NEURAL TIMING SYSTEM PREVENTS MALE-MICE FROM HARMING THEIR OWN
   OFFSPRING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Infanticide is a behavioural strategy that occurs in many mammals. In male house mice, Mus domesticus, the specific stimulus of ejaculation during copulation inhibits male mice from killing pups. An unusual aspect of this phenomenon, however, is the extraordinary latency that occurs between the stimulus (ejaculation) and its adaptive response (male mice cease killing pups an behave ''parenterally'' toward them). Specifically , the inhibition of infanticidal behaviour is usually delayed for many days after a male ejaculates, but virtually always occurs before or around the time his own sired offspring would be born 18-20 days after mating. CF-1 male mice were maintined at artificially ''fast'' or ''slow'' daylengths (22 h versus 27 h light/dark cycles) to test one possible hypothesis of how a biological timing system could gauge such a long stimulus-response interval. The results suggest that photoperiodic cues synchronized the shift in behaviour, since a sudden transition from violent to benevolent behaviour toward pups occurred as a function of the number of light/dark cycles experienced after ejaculation rather than the amount of absolute time (24 h days) experienced.

TI CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VISUALLY GUIDED ESCAPE RESPONSE OF THE MEXICAN
   FREE-TAILED BAT, TADARIDA-BRASILIENSIS-MEXICANA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The visually guided escape response of wild Mexican free-tailed bats was studied in relation to acoustic and visual cues, time of day, light intensity and age. Adults exhibited a positive response towards light; however, when presented in combination, acoustic cues were preferred over visual cues. Bats displayed a reduced positive light response at times corresponding to their morning return to the cave roost from foraging. Individuals decreased their preference for light as light intensity  increased and shifted to a positive dark response when the intensity was raised to levels approximating daytime illumination at the front of the cave. This change in orientation to light may explain why bats disturbed during the day fly toward the cave mouth but then circle back rather than leave the cave. In contrast to adults, very young and non-volant pups oriented toward the dark. This behaviour may serve to facilitate growth by keeping the pups closer to a thermoneutral environment. The  transition in response from dark-orienting pups to light-orienting adults occurred at about 7 weeks, the age at which pups become volant.

TI BEHAVIORAL THERMOREGULATION IN 3 SPECIES OF ROBBER FLIES (DIPTERA,
   ASILIDAE, EFFERIA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Robber flies of three species of the genus Efferia (Diptera: Asilidae) were active in a grassland habitat across a wide range of diurnal environmental temperatures. Perch height, posture and orientation of the body axes varied with environmental temperature. Early in the day, the flies warmed up by perching with their ventral surfaces close to the ground and basking with their longitudinal and dorsoventral body axes perpendicular to the direction of the sun. As the day progressed, they perched  with their bodies raised off the surface and eventually moved onto surfaces above the ground, so that the air temperatures experienced remained within the relatively narrow range of approximately 27-35.degree. C. Changes in perch height and orientation of the body axes resulted in significant changes in operative body temperatures. At the highest environmental temperatures, E. bicaudata and E. frewingi perched with their longitudinal axes towards the sun, while E. staminea showed no tendency to  orient in any particular direction. The significance of behavioural thermoregulation and differences among the species in perch height and in orientation at high environmental temperatures are discussed.

TI WOLF SPIDERS LACK MIRROR-IMAGE RESPONSIVENESS SEEN IN JUMPING SPIDERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many jumping spiders (Salticidae), having good acuity and feature recognition mechanisms, display toward their mirror image. Since there was evidence for visually based communication in some wolf spiders (Lycosidae), mirror-image responsiveness was tested in four species of wolf spiders. Schizocosa ocreata and Lycosa rabida were expected to be more responsive than S. saltatrix and L. punctulata, the former two species having ornamented appendages used during display. However, none of  these lycosids showed salticid-like orientation or display toward the mirror image. Yet, a moving male in a nearby acoustically isolated cage elicited orientation and, in many cases, approach or display in males of all four species. Apparently, wolf spiders must be motionless to respond visually to conspecifics, which relates to their sit- and wait mode of prey capture and their reciprocal signalling during courtship. Unlike jumping spiders, wolf spiders seem unable to analyse retinal input  consisting of a moving image against a background image that is moving due to the spider''s locomotion.

TI ANNUAL OSCILLATION OF PREFERRED TEMPERATURE IN THE FRESH-WATER SNAIL
   LYMNAEA-AURICULARIA - EFFECT OF LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The thermal preference of the freshwater snail Lymnaea auricularia (Gastropods: Pulmonata), measured 49 times over 3 years, oscillated around a mean of 19.3.degree.C, with an amplitude of 13.4.degree.C. This oscillation was significantly phase-linked to both the natural photoperiod and natural ambient temperature. Lymnaea hatched and maintained in constant conditions of temperature (21.degree.C) and photoperiod (12 h) over 2 years showed a constant thermal preference of 19.8 + 1.4.degree.C. The preference was maintained between 19.5 and 20.4.degree.C when the snails were kept at 5, 15, 20 and 27.degree.C and in the photoperiods of 8 and 16 h. In a changing artificial photoperiod which followed an annual cycle, the preference fluctuated about a mean of 19.3.degree.C with an amplitude of 3.9.degree.C. When the photoperiod was constant but the temperature oscillated the preference remained constant. Thus the circannual cycle seems to be an exogenous oscillation entrained by the photoperiod.

   TIME-DELAY BETWEEN MALES, AND THE TIME OF MATING RELATIVE TO OVULATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effectiveness of male inseminations in a two-male mating situation was shown to depend on an interaction between mating order, the time delay for introduction of competing spermatozoa, and the time of mating relative to ovulation. A second male mating advantage was observed in matings begun at the onset of oestrus and was not diminished by delays of up to 3 h before the introduction of competing spermatozoa. In contrast, a first male mating advantage was observed in matings later during  oestrus which was enhanced by increasing delays before matings by a rival male. These findings are consistent with observations of mating behaviour of golden hamsters under semi-natural conditions and suggest that males attempt to time matings to have their spermatozoa capacitated at the time the female is most likely to ovulate.

TI SUNSET, SKYLIGHT POLARIZATION AND THE MIGRATORY ORIENTATION OF
   YELLOW-RUMPED WARBLERS, DENDROICA-CORONATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Celestial light cues visible at sunset appear to play an important role in the nocturnal orientation of several species of night-migrating birds. The pattern of skylight polarization, an especially prominent geographical reference at sunrise and sunet, influences the orientation behaviour of migratory birds. Yellow-rumped warblers were capable of seasonally appropriate cage orientation at dusk and were sensitive to manipulation of the axis of skylight polarization (E-vector). A series of  experimental treatments was designed to examine the relationship between sunset position and skylight polarization. The window panels of hexagonal enclosures were fitted with a depolarizer and a polaroid filter to rotate the E-vector, and mirrors to reflect the position of sunset. The results indicate that this migrant minimizes sunset position as an orientation relative to skylight polarization and may depend upon the latter to orient at dusk. The possibility that yellow-rumped warblers  calibrate their sun compass in relation to polarized light remains a question for future research.

TI LEKKING VERSUS SOLITARY DISPLAY - TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN DISPERSION IN
   THE BUFF-BREASTED SANDPIPER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB On its breeding grounds in arctic Alaska [USA], the buff-breasted sandpiper, Tryngites subruficollis, exhibied variation in social organization from lekking to solitary display as the nesting season progressed. At each of six sites observed between 1978 and 1980, males settled and displayed on small, contiguous, spatially clumped territories which were distant from the area in which females nested. At one site, 19 of 23 (82.6%) matings were seen during the first 2 days of lek occupancy.  Once females began incubation, most males abandoned the lek and left the area, but the males that remained expanded their territories and displayed solitarily, in some cases near nest sites. Some solitary males did mate. Predation on nests and nest failure were high (72.2%). It is likely that display by males on dispersed territories is a successful option because of the probability that females will re-nest after losing their first clutch of eggs and mate with nearby males. The change in dispersion of males coincided with temporal changes in females'' movements. On arrival, females travelled in groups over wide areas but, once nesting began, they travelled singly. The dynamics of social organization in this species are most consistent with a hotspot model for lek evolution.

TI COPULATORY-BEHAVIOR OF THE LIZARD ANOLIS-SAGREI - ALTERNATION OF

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The pattern of use of the hemipenes, the two independently functioning intromittent organs of squamate reptiles, was investigated in the male brown anole, Anolis sagrei. Males demonstrated a significant tendency to use the left and right hemipenes alternately when mated daily for 7 days with different females. The duration of copulation differed significantly among males and was independent of the hemipenis used. Hemipenis use was also examined in two successive copulations separated by different time intervals. After an intercopulatory interval of up to 3 h, males showed a significant tendency to alternate in the use of their hemipenes. This trend was still present following an intercopulatory interval of 24-26 h, but was not detectable following an interval of 72-74 h. Thus, alternation of hemipenis use in male brown anoles declines as the interval between copulations increases, suggesting that males adjust their copulatory posture in relation to the length of the intercopulatory interval.

TI RESOLUTION OF AGGRESSIVE CONFLICTS BY IMMATURE LONG-TAILED MACAQUES
   MACACA-FASCICULARIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior following aggressive interactions differed from the behavior following friendly or neutral control interactions among unrelated immature male Macaca fascicularis. Former opponents interacted again sooner and more often after aggression than after a friendly or neutral encounter. The higher rate did not reflect a general increase in social activity. The behavior characterizing encounters between former opponents also differed in the two situations, with more affiliative interactions post-conflict. In both situations, however, most interactions between former opponents were initiated by the higher-ranking aggressor. This pattern of interactions between former opponents is interpreted as a repair mechanism for relationships strained by aggression (i.e. reconciliation). A similar pattern of interactions was found for related animals, though it occurred more rarely than among non-kin.

TI ACOUSTIC CUES MEDIATE INTER-MALE SPACING IN A NEOTROPICAL FROG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of the neotropical anuran species Eleutherodactylus diastema produce a high-frequency, tonal, advertisement call when aggregated into breeding choruses. Within the chorus, males occupy elevated call sites scattered through large forest patches. The hypothesis that males use the amplitude of their neighbors'' calls as a proximate cue for positioning themselves was tested. Call characteristics were analyzed, inter-male distances and neighbor call amplitudes were measured, and perch availability was not assessed. Males were non-randomly distributed within the aggregation and perch availability did not determine inter-male spacing. Neighbor call amplitudes were kept within a narrow range, and relative variability in neighbor call amplitude was much less than variability in inter-male distances. These results support the hypothesis that males in this species use the amplitude of neighbors'' calls as the proximate cue for maintaining inter-male distance, and hence the spatial organization of the chorus.

TI AGE-RELATED AND SEX-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN DOMINANCE AND FORAGING
   BEHAVIOR OF NUTHATCHES SITTA-EUROPAEA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Nuthatches collecting sunflower seeds from feeders were observed. In summer, but not in autumn, adults collected more seeds per visit than juveniles. From summer to autumn, juveniles increased both the number of seeds collected per unit time and the total number taken per visit. This was probably due to an increase in both experience and ability to handle seeds, possibly associated with beak growth. Males were dominant over females, and adults over juveniles of the same sex. Dominance relations were important in determining the length of visits; males made longer visits. Males also took more seeds per visit. However, females obtained more seeds per unit time, probably to avoid being supplanted by males.

DT Article
AB Long calls of red-chested moustached tamarins, Saguinus l. labiatus, typically last 1-2 s and are made up of individual syllables. Their acoustic structure varies between populations. In this study, captive adult male and female tamarins of each of three different populations in Bolivia were played unfamiliar long calls from their natal and alien populations to determine whether they responded differentially to them. The results suggested that female tamarins respond selectively to male long calls from their natal populations.

TI IDEA INTERFERENCE DISTRIBUTIONS - POPULATION-DENSITY AND PATCH USE BY
   ZEBRAFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ''ideal free distribution'' predicts the proportion of a population in each of several adjacent habitats with different resource levels. Previous tests of this model have ignored the effect of population size, although both theoretical and empirical studies of interference suggest that population size may have important effects on individuals'' rates of resource gain. The ability of the ideal free distribution to predict how groups of 30, 60, 120 and 240 zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio, would  distribute themselves among renewing resource patches in the laboratory was tested. Fish foraging in a pool 1.8 m in diameter received brine shrimp, Artemia, in three distinct patches with a 1:2:4 profitability ratio, keeping the arrival rate of food per fish constant for all group sizes. Deviations from the ideal free distribution were found with groups of 120 and 240 fish. These deviations were similar to the ''ideal despotic distribution'', but occurred in the groups that had the lowest rate of chasing and the lowest proporton of fish outside food patches. It is hypothesized that at high densities ''ideal interference distributions'' were formed, due not to aggression but to other density-related reductions in foraging efficiency.

TI ORIENTATION IN LEAF-CUTTING ANTS (FORMICIDAE, ATTINI)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The cues used for orientation on chemical trails by laboratory colonies of Atta cephalotes, Atta laevigata and Acromyrmex octospinosus were studied. The ants used cues other than the odour trail itself when homing. When cues gave contradictory information, Atta workers used them in a certain hierarchy:presence of an odour trail, visual cues or spatial layout of the trail, ''odour cues'' on the trail and gravitational cues. Acromyrmex octospinosus seemed to have a different hierarchy,  giving more importance to odour cues on the trail. The possible nature of the ''odour cues'' on the trail is discussed.

TI SEASONAL CHANGE IN THE VOCAL BEHAVIOR OF FEMALE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS,
   AGELAIUS-PHOENICEUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Seasonal change in the vocal behaviour of female red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, was observed in order to test hypotheses for the function of their vocalizations. The ''Chit'' vocalization was given at relatively consistent rates throughout the nesting cycle, but females rarely gave Chits once their young left their nests, and females who did not receive male assistance in feeding nestlings gave Chits at higher rates than did assisted females. The rate at which the intrasexually  aggressive ''Teer" was given declined through the nesting season and primary (first-to-nest) female redwings gave Teers at lower rates than did later-nesting females. It is tentatively concluded that the Chit functions in intersexual communication and the Teer functions to delay nest initiation by late-arriving females.

TI DISPERSAL AND INBREEDING AVOIDANCE IN MUSKRATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The dispersal and mating patterns of muskrats, Ondatra zibethicus, were examined, and these data were used to test theories predicting patterns of dispersal across taxa. Natal dispersal was male biased and natal philopatry was female biased. Between 88% and 95% of associations between adult males and females suggested monogamy, while the remaining associations suggested polygyny (one male with two females). Although the majority of individuals settled close to the centre of their natal home range, no close inbreeding appears to have occurred. General patterns of dispersal were consistent with predictions of the inbreeding-avoidance hypothesis, but this hypothesis did not predict the observed male-biased dispersal.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Mechanisms of initial orientation in females of the social paper wasp Polistes gallicus (L.) were studied by releasing them 50 m away from their nest inside an arena and at a distance of 1000 m in the open, after displacing the wasps by four different methods. Results indicate that (1) the accuracy of initial orientation depends on visual information acquired during displacement, (2) this information consists of perceiving the direction of visual flow during passive displacement, and does not  depend on the recognition of familiar landmarks, (3) the direction of visual flow is measured relative to a sky compass. The supplementary angle with a celestial reference point at the moment of release would give the wasp the reverse direction for the return flight home.

AB In double-blind choice tests, lactating females of the bat Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana showed discrimination between odour obtained from the pup they nursed and odour from a randomly selected pup. Lactating females also correctly chose odour obtained from glands on their own muzzles versus odour taken from the muzzles of randomly selected lactating females. Observations of nursing behaviour in captive and natural roosts suggest that females may mark pups with odour from these glands.  Experiments with pups provide no evidence that pups discriminate between odours from their presumptive mothers and odours from other lactating females. The results of odour choice experiments using non-lactating females and adult males of these bats are also reported.

TI THE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF MULTIPLE NEST BUILDING BY MALE MARSH WRENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two hypotheses regarding the adaptive significance of multiple nest building by male marsh wrens, Cistothorus palustris were tested: (1) female marsh wrens use the nests as a cue in selecting a mate, and (2) the nests serve as decoys to reduce predation on breeding nests. Data from both observational and experimental studies suggest that females do not use the number or density of nests or the proportion of time males spend building nests as a cue. Furthermore, no correlation exists between  the total number of density of nests built and male pairing success. However, breeding nests found near large numbers of male-built nests were more successful than breeding nests near smaller groups of these nests. Our results are most consistent with the anti-predator hypothesis.

TI INTERSPECIFIC AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR IN SALAMANDERS - SPECIES-SPECIFIC
   INTERFERENCE OR MISIDENTIFICATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This research analyses variation in the interspecific aggressive behaviour of two salamander species, Plethodon jordani and P. glutinosus, from three localities which differ in extent of sympatry, the intensity of interspecific competition and frequency of hybridization. If interspecific aggression evolved by misidentification of species, it should either (1) vary concordantly with the frequency of hybridization, or (2) be similar in all of the localities. If selection for interspecific interference has occurred, interspecific aggression should vary concordantly with interspecific competition. Misidentification can account for variation in the interspecific aggressive behaviour of P. glutinosus, P. glutinosus from all localities did not distinguish behaviourally between heterospecifics and conspecifics. In contrast, for P. jordani, results suggest that alpha-selection has occurred under conditions of strong interspecific competition. P. jordani from the locality where interspecific competition is weak were less aggressive to heterospecifics than to conspecifics, while P. jordani from two localities where interspecific competition is strong were equally aggressive to heterospecifics and conspecifics.

TI HONEY-BEE KIN RECOGNITION - LEARNING SELF AND NESTMATE PHENOTYPES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It is known that there is a genetic basis to the labelling of individuals for kin recognition in the honey bee, Apis mellifera. This study shows that individual workers reared in total isolation are able to discriminate between their full sisters and maternal half sisters. When individuals were reared with a half sister, recognition of their own patritype persisted, together with a comparable awareness of the patritype of their half sisters. Workers, when reared in mixed patritype groups of 10, showed no tendency to discriminate between full and half sisters, i.e. they appeared to learn both nestmate patritypes equally well. However, the labelling phenotypes of individuals reared together became more uniform, possibly through the transfer of substances during trophallaxis and mutual grooming. Workers exposed to 10 patritypes from their full sister patrilline were more likely to accept an unfamililar full sister than workers exposed to only five. Finally, workers reared in the hive appeared to retain an ability to discriminate their own patritype; i.e., even though the hive consisted of two worker patritypes, they discriminated between unfamiliar full and half sisters that had been reared under the same controlled conditions in an incubator.

AB Using a preparation which allows in vivo observation, the spontaneous behaviour of rat fetuses was recorded on successive days during the last third of gestation (days 16-21) in each of three microenvironments: In Uterus (viewed through the uterine wall), In Amnion (delivered outside the uterus and viewed through the intact amniotic membranes), and In Bath (removed from both uterus and amnion into a benign fluid medium with placental connection intact). These observations provide evidence that the rat fetus exhibits ontogenetic changes in behavioural repertoire, diversity and organization and is responsive to variations within its enivironment as development proceeds.

TI PLUMAGE VARIABILITY AND TERRITORIALITY IN BREEDING TURNSTONE
   ARENARIA-INTERPRES - STATUS SIGNALING OR INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The turnstone Arenaria interpres has marked plumage variability in comparison with many other waders (shorebirds). Two hypotheses were tested in an attempt to explain plumage variability in breeding turnstones. The first, the status signalling hypothesis (SSH), suggests that plumage type signals status, and the second, the individual recognition hypothesis (IRH), suggests that plumage differences enable territorial birds to be recognized by their neighbours. The SSH was rejected by two tests: (a) there was no correlation between plumage phenotype of males and the quality of the territories they occupied; and (b) there was no correlation between the plumage phenotype of males and females paired to each other (assuming assortative mating according to rank). The IRH was supported by a test which showed that males could discriminate between neigbours and strangers on plumage differences alone: fibre-glass models mimicking neighbours were effectively ignored whilst models mimicking  strangers elicited an aggressive response. It is stressed that this result does not demonstrate that plumage variability in breeding turnstones evolved to facilitate recognition by neighbours, and the potential of the IRH as an explanation of breeding plumage variability in waders is discussed.

TI NOCTURNAL DEFENSIVE RESPONSES OF AFRICANIZED AND EUROPEAN HONEY-BEES TO
   THE GREATER WAX MOTH (GALLERIA-MELLONELLA L)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Colonies of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in Brazil, the United States and venezuela were presented with adult greater wax moths (Galleria mellonella L.)at their hive entrances. Africanized colonies were quicker, more persistent, and more intense in their attacks than were European colonies. Both races attacked female moths in preference to males. Although colony size did not appear to be related to defensiveness, attack data were correlated with the numbers of bees guarding the entrance.  Africanized colonies had significantly more guard bees. During successive trials, both rates attacked the moths in significantly shorter times. These findings may help explain the unexpectedly low population levels of G. mellonella in some areas of South America.

DT Article
AB Observations of infanticide in a troop of undisturbed, forest hanuman langurs by members of an invading all-male band are reported. The data, whilst consistent with the sexual selection hypothesis, did not support the social pathology hypothesis. Data from different langur populations supported the prediction, derived from the sexual selection hypothesis, that troop take-overs should occur between the birth and mating seasons. The occurrence of take-overs in different langur populations was  associated with a predominantly one-male troop structure and not with high density.

TI INFORMATION CUES USED IN MALE COMPETITION BY TETTIGONIA-CANTANS
   (ORTHOPTERA, TETTIGONIIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of the bush cricket Tettigonia cantans often occur in dense populations in which agonistic, competitive behaviour between singing males is frequently seen. Some of the informational cues that might be used to resolve these competitive interactions have been examined here, the results being drawn from studies of field behaviour and laboratory observations. The cues examined were song frequency (carrier frequency), song intensity, body weight, prior occupation of ''territory'' and onset of singing activity. Of these the most reliable cue was song frequency; dominant males have songs pitched almost 1 kHz (on average) lower than subordinate males. Song frequency was not related to body size. No consistent relationship was found between song intensity (of the carrier frequency) and body weight, or intensity and dominance, though 63% of dominant males had a louder high-frequency component in their songs. Body size was not related to status though the heaviest males in the population had a higher probability of becoming dominant. Generally dominant males initiated acoustic interactions. The independence of the carrier frequency and body weight, and the relatively low song frequency of T. cantans (compared to other tettigoniid species of similar size) suggest that sexual selection has acted to depress song frequency in this species.

TI VOCAL COMMUNICATION IN THE DOMESTIC CHICKEN .2. IS A SENDER SENSITIVE TO
   THE PRESENCE AND NATURE OF A RECEIVER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB As a test of the automaticity of the food calling behavior of cockerels, their sensitivity to the presence and nature of an audience was explored. Males were presented with either a highly preferred food or a non-food item in the presence of a familiar female, a strange female, a male, or with no audience at all. With food as a referent, there was significantly less food calling with no audience than in the presence of females, and even less with a male as a potential receiver. There was a significant amount of calling for the non-food item, especially in the presence of a strange female. Food calling to non-foods in certain social contexts is discussed as a case of deception. The modulation of signal production according to the nature of the receiver is considered in relation to the issue of intentionality in animal communication.

TI THE SEQUENTIAL-ANALYSIS OF AGGRESSIVE ACTS DURING HIERARCHY FORMATION -
   AN APPLICATION OF THE JIGSAW PUZZLE APPROACH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The "jigsaw puzzle" approach is a general method for investigating how interactions among individuals cumulate to form the overall patterns of dominance behavior in groups. Here, the model is used to discover how aggressive interactions between pairs of individuals modify subsequent interactions with bystanders or third parties. The model indicates that 4 sequences of successive, aggressive acts are possible in component triads of larger groups: 2 ensure transitive attack relationships and 2 can lead to either transitive or intransitive relationships. An application of the model to 14 groups of 4 hens demonstrates that the 2 sequences guaranteeing transitivity make up 77% of all sequences. More specifically, hens attacking 1 group member usually go on to attack a 2nd member, and hens receiving 1 attack frequently receive a 2nd attack from a bystander. In contrast, an attacked hen rarely "redirects" an attack to a bystander, and a bystander rarely attacks a group member who has just attacked another individual. The application of the jigsaw puzzle approach to aggressive sequences in other species is discussed. Data available for several primate species corroborate the findings in hens and provide support for the method as a general tool for investigating the proximate mechanisms of hierarchy formation.

TI THE ROLE OF VISION IN THE PREDATORY BEHAVIOR OF NATRICINE SNAKES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Early workers concluded that ingestively naive garter snakes (Thamnophis) recognize chemical cues from their normal prey, and that such cues are sufficient to elicit prey attack, whereas visual prey cues are not sufficient. In the light of recent observations on how garter and water snakes (Nerodia) forage, new tests were made of the role of visual stimuli in the aquatic predation of several natricine species. Both experienced and ingestively naive snakes oriented to and attacked a fish model in plain water, although they made more orientations and attacks when diffuse fish odor was present in the water. Fish odor in water also elicited increased aquatic searching behavior. Early views on the role of vision in the predation of newborn natricine snakes require modification, and there is a need for investigation of the properties of effective visual stimuli and the ontogeny of responsiveness to them.

TI ALTERNATIVE MATE-FINDING TACTICS IN A NON-TERRITORIAL DAMSELFLY
   (ODONATA, COENAGRIONIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of the non-territorial damselfly Enallagma hageni have two alternative tactics for finding mates: (1) they search the banks of the pond for unmated females (searching tactic), or (2) wait at oviposition sites for females that resurface prematurely from underwater oviposition (waiting tactic). Although the searching tactic yielded more fertilizations than the waiting tactic, for time invested, the waiting tactic became increasingly successful later in the reproductive season due to  changes in female oviposition behavior. The two tactics can be maintained in the population because males can mate by the waiting tactic during the afternoon when few females are available to searchers. Among males visiting the breeding site an equal number of times, males mating by a mixture of tactics were as successful as males mating only by the main tactic. Because marked males were found to use both tactics, these behaviors are interpreted as evidence of behavioral plasticity within individuals, representing one conditional evolutionary strategy.

TI DIEL PROFILE OF BEHAVIOR IN THE SMOOTH NEWT, TRITURUS-VULGARIS (L) - AN
   ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CUES AND ENDOGENOUS TIMING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Diel activity in a population of smooth newts during the aquatic period was compared with rhythmic activity in newts under controlled light-dark and temperature cycles in the laboratory. The light-dark cycle was the primary synchronizer of activity and entrained a bimodal activity rhythm. This rhythm was endogenous and persisted for several cycles under constant conditions. Under natural conditions this rhythm was modified by illumination and temperature to produce a crepuscular activity  pattern with a dominant second peak in activity. Diel activity under natural conditions was partitioned into sexual behavior and feeding. Whereas sexual behavior was entirely crepuscular, feeding behavior was nocturnal. Feeding was probably unrelated to the underlying circadian rhythm and was engendered by the diel migration of zooplankton in the ponds. Ascents to the pond surface for air were most frequent during periods of sexual behavior.

   INTRUDERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB After inhabiting their home sites for a few days, both males and females of the salamander Desmognathus monticola directed agonistic behavior toward intruding salamanders. Resident D. monticola were significantly more aggressive toward D. fuscus intruders than toward conspecific ones, although both conspecific and congeneric intruders were frequently attacked. Responses of D. monticola residents were independent of sex, and no difference was found in the behavior of residents toward  conspecific male and female intruders. Small D. fuscus intruders were attacked and injured more frequently than similar-sized D. monticola intruders and, in general, smaller-sized salamanders were the victims of aggressive attacks more frequently than larger ones. The proportions of bites on the head and tail of intruders were similar, although injuries were much more frequent to the tail than to the head. This species-related and size-related agonistic behavior may be functional in maintaining the spatial distribution of species in communities of Desmognathus salamanders.

TI THE APPROACH AND PREFERENCE BEHAVIOR OF CHICKS IN RELATION TO THE

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The approach tendency of young precocial birds has typically been found to be related to stimulus magnitude in an inverted U-shaped fashion. The coding and processing of stimulus information is discussed in 2 cases, namely when the quantitative stimulus variable is the size of a moving object and flicker rate. The optimal size of a moving object for eliciting approach can be derived from motion parameters that describe the growth in angular size of the projected retinal image as the object approaches the chick. A second analysis is performed which provides support for the hypothesis that the chick''s attraction to intermittent light in the vicinity of 4 flashes/s can be related to the alpha-rhythm of the chick''s brain-waves. The conclusions are based on reanalyses of the results from 2 previously reported studies (Schulman et al. 1970; Kovach 1980).

TI OLFACTORY EVALUATION OF ANDRENA HOST NEST SUITABILITY BY KLEPTOPARASITIC
   NOMADA BEES (HYMENOPTERA, APOIDEA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Kleptoparasitic Nomada bees (cuckoo bees) are guided by olfactory cues in their local topographic orientation to Andrena host nests. Decisions regarding the availability and suitability of a partly provisioned nest cell, the threat of maternal host presence and prior visitation by another kleptoparasite, are all assessed olfactorily by the Nomada female while she is safely poised at the entrance to the host''s ground nest. The influences of visual, tactile, acoustical and other sensory clues were controlled experimentally by presenting stimuli in artificial host nests. The nest approach behaviors of the kleptoparasites are comparable to non-parasitic bees. Although the host and parasite encounter the same odor cues for individual nest orientation, striking differences in their subsequent approach behaviors apparently result from the degree to which each generalizes the olfactory information available.

AB Three cichlid species, Cyrtocara orthognathus, C. liemi and an undescribed species were observed feeding on eggs, embryos and larval stages of mouthbrooding cichlids in Lake Malawi. Each species engages in a unique head ramming behavior, forcing females to jettison some young involuntarily. The 3 paedophagous species had either eggs, embryos and/or larval fish in their stomachs. C. orthognathus mimicked females by turning on and off its stripe depending on whether or not it was stalking the silver C. eucinostomus or the striped C. pleurotaenia. Two previous hypotheses concerning how paedophages capture their prey are discussed and ramming of females as the manner by which most paedophages obtain their food in nature is concluded.

TI PATERNAL BEHAVIOR AND KILLING OF YOUNG IN ARCTIC GROUND-SQUIRRELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Killing of infants and young juveniles (infanticide) and paternal behavior in a population of Arctic ground squirrels, Spermophilus parryii, near Haines Junction, Yukon Territory [Canada] was investigated. Males defended territories primarily during the period when young ground squirrels were most susceptible to being killed. Killing was most likely after removal of males that had been resident during the mating period. Immigrant males, which were unlikely to have sired the young in their new area of residence, tended to kill young, and it appeared that infanticide was a consequence of a male''s establishing residence in a new area. An analysis of the time budget of males and females suggested that males acted as lookouts during lactation, when females were spending the most time feeding. Males behave paternally through defending territories because they increase the likelihood of survival of young that they may have sired. Various tactics that both males and females might be expected to adopt given the existence of infanticide in the population are discussed.

TI FEMALE RHESUS-MONKEY AGGRESSION DURING THE MENSTRUAL-CYCLE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female aggressive behavior was studied in a heterosexual group of compound-housed rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) to determine whether the frequency of agonistic encounters fluctuated across the menstrual cycle and if changes in aggression correlated with fluctuations in serum estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) levels or with increased social activity associated with mating behavior. Aggression involving females increased during the mating phase of the menstrual cycle; this was largely due to a significant increase in the initiation of non-contact aggression. Contact aggression was infrequent and remained stable throughout all cycle phases. Males received less aggression than females independent of female cycle phase, despite the low social rank of some males in the group. Female aggression was directed equally to other mating and non-mating females. Daily fluctuations in aggressive behavior did not correlate with changes in serum levels of either E2 or T, but were related to changes in social behaviors, particularly those related to seeking a sexual partner. An analysis of covariance indicated that by holding the measures of directed female activity (following males and initiating proximity) constant, the mid-cycle increases in aggression were nullified. The significant fluctuations in aggressive behavior observed throughout the menstrual cycle are not directly related to changes in serum levels in serum levels of ovarian hormones, but are rather a consequence of a female''s attempts to copulate with a male.

TI POST-COPULATORY MATE GUARDING BY MALES OF THE DAMSELFLY
   HETAERINA-VULNERATA-SELYS (ODONATA, CALOPTERYGIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of the calopterygid damselfly H. vulnerata remain with their mates after copulating with them. The species exhibits 2 unusual features of post-copulatory mate guarding: a male often leaves his territory to accompany a female in tandem on a search for oviposition sites elsewhere, and a male perches near his ovipositing female even though she completely submerges when egg-laying and cannot be captured and mated by another male while she is underwater. These activities carry 2 risks: a male may miss other receptive females while guarding 1 mate and he may lose his territory to an interloper while he is absent. These risks were small, since territorial males secured only 1 mating per 3.6 days on average, and 23 times out of 26, territorial males reclaimed their plots quickly after being away for 30-60 min. The gain from post-copulatory guarding came from being present to recapture a female should she fly up from the water after rejecting an oviposition site. There was a 40% chance that a female would leave 1 site to search for another during an oviposition bout. If the male were not present, his mate would be captured and mated by another individual (no female ever selected an oviposition site without being carried to it by a male). Her new partner would fertilize the remaining eggs in the female''s clutch (if sperm precedence occurs in this species). The total number of eggs fertilized by a male will be affected by how well he prevents any 1 mate from copulating again before she lays her entire clutch and the total number of receptive females he captures. The variation in the degree of mate guarding by male odonates seems to be the evolutionary outcome of differences in fitness gains derived from these 2 competing activities in different ecological settings.

TI THE CHEMOSENSORY RESPONSES OF YOUNG CICHLID FISH TO PARENTS AND
   PREDATORS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The chemosensory responses of the fry of the Midas cichlid, Cichlasoma citrinellum (Pisces: Cichlidae), were tested in a Y-maze during their first 11 days of free-swimming. Fry preferred all conspecific females to blank water but did not distinguish between their own mother, another mother or a non-parental, adult female. Fry preferred females to males. Similar results were obtained for males. Fry preferred their siblings and (unrelated) juveniles to blank water. They failed to show a preference between siblings and their mothers, but preferred their mother to juveniles. Fry were able to distinguish the closely related red devil cichlid (C. labiatum) from blank water, but failed to do this for any of 3 heterospecifics (C. managuense, C. nigrofasciatum and the allopatric Sarotherodon mossambicus). The chemosensory responses demonstrated in the Y-maze are hypothesized to aid the fry in staying near the center of the guarded territory and away from predators, particularly under murky or nocturnal conditions.

TI ACCELERATION AND DELAY OF 1ST VAGINAL ESTRUS IN FEMALE MICE BY URINARY
   CHEMOSIGNALS - DOSE LEVELS AND MIXING URINE TREATMENT SOURCES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of varying dose levels and mixing of urine from various types of donor mice on the age of sexual maturation in female mice were tested. Over the range from 0.001 ml/day to 0.01 ml/day, there was no difference in the effectiveness of male urine in producing acceleration of puberty, nor was there any difference over the same dose range for urine from grouped females bringing about a delay of puberty. Urine from pregnant and lactating females brought about earlier puberty when applied in the higher dose amounts but was not effective in altering the age of 1st estrus relative to untreated controls at lower doses. These findings concerning dose levels are important for a full understanding of the behavioral consequences of urinary chemosignals. When urine from different sources was mixed, all treatments which involved urine from grouped females produced delays in 1st estrus. This has important consequences for a feedback model for population regulation in house mice involving urinary chemosignals: they accelerate or delay sexual maturation and thus shorten or lengthen generation time by affecting reproductive behavior.

TI LONG-TERM STORAGE OF LEARNED BIRDSONGS PRIOR TO PRODUCTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sixteen male swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, were reared by hand in the laboratory and exposed in infancy to tape-recorded songs. Training ended around 2 mo. of age. Samples of singing were tape-recorded sporadically from the age of 50-90 days and on a weekly basis from about 95-400 days. Analysis revealed that explicit rehearsal of learned songs did not begin, on the average, until 240 days after the least exposure to training songs. Swamp sparrows can commit song syllables to memory and produce imitations of them 8 mo. later with no rehearsal in the interim.

The bird was selective about which, of 6 holes, it chose for insertion of the tool, choosing the appopriate one with respect to the water source. Days on which attempted or successful tool-use occurred were drier than other days, and days of successful tool-use were also warmer. Availability of fresh water to the birds did not influence the occurrence of tool-use.

TI CALF DEVELOPMENT AND MOTHER-CALF SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN SOUTHERN RIGHT
   WHALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Changes in spatial relationships between mother and calf right whales (E. australis) from birth to the separation of yearling calves from their mothers were observed. During the 1st few weeks of a calf''s life, mother and calf were within close proximity over 90% of the time, and mothers were responsible for maintenance of contact with their infants. Later calves strayed farther and initiated many more leaves and approaches than their quiescent mothers. The mothers still maintained contact with their infants. Just before migration away from the area, pair members resumed close proximity and leaves and approaches by both diminished. Yearling calves, returning to the area with their mothers after 6 mo., stayed close to their mothers and few leaves and approaches by either pair member were recorded. The yearling calves were responsible for maintaining contact as the mothers left them more than approached them. This behavior on the part of mothers probably contributed to weaning of yearlings and separation after a few weeks in the area.

TI SEPARATION FROM THE MOTHER AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLAY IN CATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In 7 litters of domestic cats, half of each litter of 4 were gradually separated from the rest of the family 31-39 days after birth. The separated kittens showed significantly higher frequencies of play on some measures. In part this was because they were more active, but when the play data were corrected for general activity differences, the separated kittens still had played more. The influence of separation from the mother on play may be a facultative response by the kittens to early weaning which, in natural conditions, would probably be associated with reduced opportunities for play at later stages in development.

AB Big brown bats (E. fuscus) detect and orient toward relatively low-frequency sounds produced by chorusing frogs or groups of stridulating insects. This response occurs at distances of at least 600 m. The bats are also attracted to a broadcasted recording of the sounds. If recently fed, they do not orient to these sounds. Bats that fly toward the most intense sound field locate insects at a significantly greater rate than those that choose another direction. The use of these long-distance acoustic cues may be important for locating concentrations of flying insects.

AB Experiments were designed to determine whether assortative mating occurs in wild and game-farm mallard strains (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallard males of either strain raised with females of their own strain courted females of their own strain more than females of the opposite strain, and these males were only successful in pairing with females of their own strain. Males raised with females of the opposite strain courted wild and game-farm females with equal intensity. They were successful in pairing with females of either strain. While this study does not settle the question of possible gene flow between these 2 mallard populations, it does indicate that there is a potential barrier to panmixia.

TI PREDATORY BEHAVIOR OF YOUNG GREAT KISKADEES (PITANGUS-SULPHURATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six hand-reared great kiskadees (P. sulphuratus) were given still and moving models of prey. Series A bore various combinations of eyes, tail, neck and motion. Eyes and tail were the most strongly directing. Series B bore various colors and patterns, both as covering the whole model, and as covering only 1/3 (middle or end). The birds were not inhibited by any plain color tested by strongly avoided patterns resembling coral snakes. Given sufficient contrast, kiskadees were attracted to the painted section of the partly painted models, regardless of location (middle or end). This attraction to the contrasting section, plus the directed responses to eyes, tail and motion, should allow kiskadees to take small vertebrates like lizards quickly and efficiently.

TI SENSORY REINFORCEMENT AND ILLUMINATION PREFERENCE IN DOMESTICATED PIG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sensory reinforcement, using light onset, light offset and tone onset was studied in pigs. Light onset was reinforcing but the pigs only had the light on for up to 0.5% of the time. Tone onset and light offset were not reinforcing. Anosmic (bulbectomized) pigs did not differ from normals in their responses to light. When IR heat was used as reinforcement the pigs turned it on for 24% of the time but this fell to 4% when the radiant heaters were raised so that mainly light and little heat reached the pigs. In the light-dark preference tests the pigs kept themselves in light for 72% of the time. Pigs prefer light, but will not perform operant responses to obtain prolonged illumination.

TI CHANGES IN RESPONSES OF MALE AND FEMALE GERBILS (MERIONES-UNGUICULATUS)
   TOWARDS TEST PUPS DURING PREGNANCY OF FEMALE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mongolian gerbils, maintained in monogamous pairs, were each offered a single test pup in order to assess changes in the paternal and the maternal responses during the female''s pregnancy. Naive males, housed with non-pregnant females, treat the pup as food, but they respond in a paternal manner when their mate becomes pregnant. Females eat pups except during very late pregnancy, when they show maternal responses. Experienced males never eat pups regardless of the reproductive state of the female. Experienced females respond in the same manner as do naive females. Both parents are brought into a maternal state prior to the birth of their offspring.

TI SATIATION CURVES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Ingestive behavior may be described by plotting the cumulative intake against time (the satiation curve). For a laboratory rat feeding in a Skinner box the most satisfactory description of this curve is a negative exponential with 3 parameters. The time constant is relatively consistent for a single individual on different occasions. There are no differences between subjects. More detailed analysis shows that the satiation curve is made up of short bouts interspersed with gaps. The overall shape results from a reduction in bout size and duration as the meal progresses, but intra-bout response rate is not the same throughout the meal. The exponential form is predicted both by causal theories of satiation involving negative feedback, and by a functional explanation using optimality theory. None of the available explanations account for the detailed structure of the curve.

TI PARENTAL FOOD-CALLING AND ROLE OF YOUNG IN BURMESE RED JUNGLEFOWL
   (GALLUS-GALLUS-SPADICEUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Adult female Burmese red junglefowl (G. g. spadiceus) attracted the young to food by means of a characteristic pecking motion and a food call vocalization. The duration of this display was dependent on stimuli originating with the young. The visual properties of the young exerted an inhibitory influence on feeding by the parent, which led to sustained food-calling. The vocalizations of the young did not have such inhibitory effects, although loss of both visual and vocal contact with the young also produced prolonged food-calling. Feeding of the young, in many species, may occur as a consequence of the inhibitory effects on parental feeding of stimuli originating with the young.

TI HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION AND POSTURAL FACILITATION - RULES FOR GROOMING
   IN FLIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rules governing grooming sequences in blowflies [Calliphora erythrocephala] are discussed. Time was divided exhaustively into 8 grooming and 2 non-grooming states. Using a keyboard connected to a computer, the times of all transitions between states during 1 h were recorded for each of 6 flies. There is a strong tendency for certain acts to alternate with others. A model of alternating choice slots and determined slots is presented. Grooming acts fall into discrete bouts, each involving either the prothoracic legs or the metathoracic legs. A great majority of bouts contain an odd number of acts. The beginning and ending of a bout constitute a characteristic structure regardless of the length of the intervening middle period. Unconvincing evidence for hierarchical organization of grooming decisions is presented. Convincing evidence is presented that postural facilitation is involved in the control of grooming.

TI EFFECT OF POST-WEANING ENVIRONMENT ON CLIMBING BEHAVIOR OF WILD AND
   DOMESTIC NORWAY RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The climbing behavior of wild and domestic Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) was compared after early rearing in 3 post-weaning environments offering different climbing experiences. Wild rats climbed in the test apparatus even when denied early climbing experience; male domestic rats did not. Early climbing experience increased the climbing scores of both stocks but influenced the climbing proficiency of wild rats only. Treatment differences in climbing behavior may be related to specific motor experiences gained during development and the effect of early experience on the response to a novel environment (test apparatus). Stock differences in climbing behavior may reflect a general reduction in motor activity among domestic rats and their reduced sensitivity to stimulus change or novelty.

TI INFLUENCE OF LIGHT-INTENSITY ON ROOSTING TIMES OF ROOK
   (CORVUS-FRUGILEGUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Little work has been done on the roosting behavior of Corvidae, particularly the influence of light-intensity on its timing. The effects of light-intensity of the roosting times of rooks (C. frugilegus) from a large roost during winter are described. Light intensity was measured and its influence on the departure of birds from the feeding grounds, arrival at the roost, entry into the roost and morning departure was significant. Departure from feeding areas (and arrival at the roost) was earlier at lower light-intensities and later at higher light-intensities. Control of responsiveness to light-intensity by circadian rhythm for rooks from different feeding grounds is discussed.

TI INFLUENCES OF SEX HORMONES ON LOUD AND SOFT WARBLES OF MALE BUDGERIGARS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Each male''s vocal behavior was recorded while he was deprived of social vocal stimuli both before and during hormonal treatments. During treatments, the vocal behavior of each male also was recorded while he could hear a taped 2-hr. concert of loud warble performed by other males. Intact males were injected with either pregnant mare''s serum (PMS), testosterone or placebo solutions. Estradiol cypionate or PMS was administered to castrated males. The data show that a male''s threshold for performing loud warble with or without social vocal stimulation and his threshold for performing soft warble without social vocal stimulation are significantly lowered by androgens but are not solely influenced by gonadotropins. Hearing the loud warble of other males seems to stimulate a male''s performance of loud warble, but it does not seem to influence his performance of soft warble. Two factors, androgens and the loud warble of other individuals, increase a male''s tendency to perform loud warble; and these factors may complement each other in their action(s). In the absence of social vocal stimulation, injections of estradiol stimulate the performance of loud warble. However, estradiol does not seem to provoke any definite pattern of loud warble in response to the loud warble of other males. The status of loud and soft warbles as male sexual behaviors is briefly discussed.

AB This paper shows that many color discriminations can be made by deficient (dichromatic) color vision systems, and a conclusion of trichromasy is not necessarily justified even when an experiment has been designed to minimize brightness cues. This criticism is specifically directed against a paper on "Color discrimination in the goldfish," by Muntz and Cronyl-Dillon.

TI PRIOR TREATMENT EFFECTS ON OPEN FIELD BEHAVIOUR OF MICE - A GENETIC
   ANALYSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB 1440 mice Mus musculus from 4 inbred strains and their crosses were either undisturbed, received moderate stimulation or shock at 8 wk. of age. A genetic analysis of subsequent open field behavior indicated sufficient genetic x treatment interactions to question the adequacy of generalizations concerning either prior treatment effects or inheritance of behavior without sampling both parameters simultaneously. Ss receiving moderate stimulation had higher heritability estimates and significant maternal effects on both ambulation and defecation measures. Increasing stimulation reduced environmental covariance and to a greater degree reduced genetic covariance between the 2 measures. An argument is presented for abandoning the present procedures of choosing experimental Ss and for representing the species to be studied by F1 hybrids formed by the complete intercrossing of several inbred lines.

TI HERITABILITY AND THRESHOLD DETERMINATIONS OF OPTOMOTOR RESPONSE IN
   DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The optomotor turning response to an illuminated moving striped plate was determined for a large number of wild type Drosophila melanogaster. Each fly was given 10 opportunites to respond to the stimulus and optomotor scores ranging from 0 (no response) to 10, were assigned. Selective breeding procedures based on low, middle, and high scores were imposed on the tested population and 3 strains of flies differing with respect to optomotor behavior were successfully bred and maintained for 30 generations. The extent to which controlling individual differences with regard to a single stimulus value would affect optomotor threshold functions was also studied. Minimum light intensities required to elicit the response for different stripe widths were determined for the 3 strains. The resulting threshold curves were identical in shape but displaced along the abscissa indicating that though the relation between light intensity and optomotor threshold was invariant for all 3 strains, quantifiable systematic differences were produced.

TI ROLE OF RESPONSES TO LIGHT IN SELECTION AND MAINTENANCE OF MICROHABITAT

AB Tricorythus discolor (Burm.), found in nature exclusively on the under surface of stones in shaded reaches of streams exhibited a strong orthokinetic response in which there was virtually no locomotory activity under low light intensities a weak negative phototaxis and a strong skototaxis. Baetis harrisoni Barnard found in nature predominantly above stones in sunlit reaches exhibited an orthokinetic response similar to that of Tricorythus but which under certain current conditions is superceded resulting in maintenance of the nymphs in areas of high light intensity a strong positive phototaxis. These responses are of adaptive significance and enable selection and maintenance of the respective microhabitats.

TI GENETIC SELECTION FOR SOCIAL DOMINANCE ABILITY IN CHICKENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Five generations of bidirectional selection of mature male chickens {or social dominance scores in initial pair contests produced large strain differences within each of 2 breeds. Apparently symmetrical responses, continued individual intra-strain variability and absence of clear trends in yearly herttabllity estimates all suggest a polygenic mode of inheritance, intermediate gene frequencies in the foundation stocks and a large reservoir of additive genetic variation for agonistic behavior. Selected strains became differentiated for frequency of contests with aggressive behavior, ability to win decisions and physical severity of interactions. Responses were neither age nor sex specific. Peck-order status of selected strain females in intermingled flocks differed significantly, but differences appeared to be of reduced magnitude as compared with those based on initial pair contests. Comparisons of frequency and severity of social interaction of selected strain females in intra-strain flocks failed to indicate strain differences although these were clearly present in intra-strain initial pair encounters between males. It is hypothesized that genotypes responsible for differences in agonistic behavior under conditions of selection may not be equally effective in a different environment.Authors.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Normal, one eye-covered and one eye-removed crayfish were presented a target with food on it 5 trials a day for 7 days (phase A). They were then presented the target alone 5 trials a day for 3 days (phase B) to determine whether any association between target area and food had occurred in any of the groups as a result of the previous pairing of the 2 in phase A. In phase A all 3 groups performed significantly better than a control group in which target and food were presented separately. In phase B an association between the target area and food was found to occur whether visual input could occur through one (eye-covered) or both (normal) eyes, as long as both sets of optic ganglia were intact, but did not occur under these conditions if one eye and its associated ganglia were removed (eye-removed).

TI CONTROL OF NESTING BEHAVIOUR OF DOMESTIC HEN .3. EFFECT OF COCAINE IN
   POST-OVULATORY FOLLICLE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of the post-ovulatory follicle on nesting may be due to the release of a hormone or by affert impulses from neural receptors in the follicle. The object was to determine whether afferent impulses are important. 0.5-0.6 ml of a 5% aqueous cocaine solution was injected into the post-ovulatory stalk. Ten out of 24 of the experimental birds had abnormal nestings, whereas only 2 out of 24 controls injected similarly with saline were affected. This difference is statistically significant. The results indicate that a neural component is involved in some way, but this does not exclude the possibility of endocrine mechanisms operating as well.

AB The neurological development of the dog was studied in 45 puppies from 11 litters of 4 different breeds. These observations were correlated with earlier work concerning the emergence of adult EEG [electroencephalographic] patterns, stable conditioning, morphological development of the cerebral cortex, and behaviorally determined periods of development. Changes occurred in a spectrum of reflexes employed in the investigation as indicators of neurological development. During certain phases of development it was found possible to group these reflexological changes into 4 arbitrary periods which precede the behaviorally determined periods of development.

TI CHANGES IN RESPONSIVENESS TO YOUNG IN ADULAT MOUSE .I. PROBLEMATICAL
   EFFECT OF HORMONES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Fifteen female mice were observed daily during the first and second lactation periods in the presence of 3 of their own young placed out of the nest. Responses of retrieving, licking, nest-building and lactation position made during the 5 minutes following the subjects'' contact with the scattered young were recorded. Occurrences of these responses observed during the first lactation period were compared with occurrences observed in a group of 15 virgin females presented with an experimental litter. The tendency of the mother to show all 4 responses decreased from the beginning to the end of each lactation period and responsiveness to young was higher during the first than during the second period. The virgin females gave practically the same results as prlmlparous mothers with regard to retrieving and nestbuilding, but showed more frequent licking and lactation position. The following conclusions concerning the determinants of the diminution in maternal behaviour from birth to weaning of the litter can be made: The change cannot be explained by a single constant determinant for two reasons. The first is that the diminution is not the same for each of the 4 responses. That is to say the responses do not appear to reflect the same determinants. The second is that responsiveness was lower during the second than during the first lactation period. As a consequence determinants must vary to produce this change with successive litters. A simple invariant hormonal process or stimulus explanation is thus excluded. No positive evidence for hormonal influences on occurrence and changes in maternal behaviour was found. The virgin females were at least as responsive as the mothers. The postparturitional hormonal condition may, however, counterbalance negative effects resulting from increasing experience. The primary determinant would appear to be stimulus factors (e.g. cries by the young). This conclusion follows from the striking responsiveness of the virgin females who, unlike the mothers, had neither the postparturitional hormonal state nor continual experience with the young.

DT Article
AB The amount of food eaten by paired and isolated chicks, estimated by weighing the chicks periodically through a 12 hr. period, was recorded for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th days after hatching. On all 3 days the paired chicks ate more than the isolates. On the 5th day these chicks were tested under 4 degrees of social contact isolation, visual only, restricted physical contact, and complete physical contact. The only condition displaying facilitation was complete contact. An analysis of variance showed no effect of, or interaction with, prior social experience. Further experiments showed that these results were not affected by differential weight losses in the isolated and social conditions or by compartment size or number of food cups available. Observations suggesting that social facilitation might be related to bill pecking are also reported.

AB Obligate avian brood parasites typically impose great costs on their hosts by replacing the host's offspring with their own. Multiple theories have been put forward regarding which factors influence the probability that a host nest will be parasitized. One of these, the perch proximity hypothesis, predicts that nests that are close to trees are more likely to be parasitized, as trees provide a vantage point for the parasite to observe nest building by the host. Substantial support for this hypothesis has been found in several species of brood parasites that occur in a range of open habitats, such as reed beds, marshlands and grasslands, where vantage points are likely to be scarce. However, it is unclear whether this prediction applies to species that occupy woodland habitats. Although brood parasites may be more likely to exploit nests with suitable vantage points nearby, it is possible that a high density of vegetation might obscure the nest, thereby reducing the likelihood of parasitism. Here we used a long-term data set of superb fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus, nests to test this hypothesis in the brood-parasitic Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo, Chalcites basalis. Contrary to the prediction of the perch proximity hypothesis, parasitism risk did not increase with closer proximity of a perch to the nest; instead, we show that the risk of parasitism may decrease as tree density increases. These results suggest that exploration of the host activity hypothesis and nest exposure hypothesis may be fruitful for future work in this system. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB When confronted with ambiguous information, some individuals respond expecting positive outcomes and others expect negative outcomes. Based on such decisions under ambiguous situations, a behavioural paradigm has been developed in animal welfare science that allows researchers to characterize animals as more 'optimistic' or 'pessimistic'. Using this judgement bias test, recent studies have detected consistent individual differences in 'optimism levels'. However, the potential ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences of these differences are not yet clear. We aimed to explore the ecological relevance of being more optimistic or pessimistic. Specifically, we investigated the correlation between optimism levels and foraging choices under predation risk in laboratory mice, Mus musculus f. domestica. To address this, we first characterized female mice (C57BL/6J) as more optimistic or pessimistic by using an established judgement bias test. Then, we assessed individual differences in the tendency to choose high-risk/high-reward or low-risk/low-reward conditions by using a newly developed test based on predator cues (rat odour). We showed that this novel test is a suitable tool to investigate individual differences in foraging under predation risk. First, the test imposed a risk - foraging trade-off for mice because the risky condition clearly induced more avoidance and risk assessment. Second, individuals showed highly repeatable differences in their choice of the risky or safe option. Considering our main aim, we did not find evidence that optimistic and pessimistic mice make different foraging decisions under predation risk. A potential explanation could be that the consequences of individual differences in optimism levels are context specific and might not be relevant in the face of predation risk.

AB Learning stimulus-response associations helps animals to adjust to changing environments. Sequentially learned associations may interact with each other, either reinforcing memory, a process referred to as 'transfer', or hindering memory, a process referred to as 'interference'. According to Osgood's (1949, Psychological Review, 56(3), 132-143) model, close similarity between new and previously learned stimuli can enhance the transfer of memory through a process of stimulus generalization. In contrast, the model proposes that if responses are different from those previously learned, generalizing stimuli may lead to confusion, resulting in the interference of memory. This model has primarily been applied in the context of human verbal learning. However, the interaction between stimulus similarity and response similarity is poorly documented in nonhuman animals, despite a growing body of literature suggesting that both vertebrate and invertebrate species share complex cognitive abilities similar to those found in humans. Here, we tested Osgood's model using bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) foraging for sucrose on artificial flowers with varied colours (= stimuli) that required either legitimate visits or nectar robbing (= responses). Bees were first allowed to forage on one type of flower, then switched to another type of flower and finally returned to the initial flower type. We measured learning performance via flowerhandling time and the number of failed visits. Consistent with Osgood's model, bees made more failed visits when they switched between similarly coloured flowers requiring different foraging techniques but made fewer failed visits when switching between similarly coloured flowers with the same technique. Regardless of similarities in stimuli or responses, however, experienced bees were faster in handling flowers than were na & iuml;ve bees.

AB Developing and implementing effective approaches to improve the welfare of animals participating in research requires reliable monitoring of their wellbeing. Since wellbeing is a multidimensional state that relates to an individual's physiological, behavioural and psychological/mental health, assessing it requires the use of measures that are both ecologically relevant and species-specific. Grey mouse lemurs are small, nocturnal, arboreal and omnivorous primates and a powerful model for fundamental and translational research. As such, it is important to study the factors that may help predict their wellbeing in captivity. Therefore, we monitored 12 adult mouse lemurs (six females and six males) housed with a same-sex weight-matched cage mate for 5 weeks under standard (Control) levels of environmental enrichment and 12 adults (six females and six males) under relatively High enrichment. We hypothesized that higher structural enrichment would stimulate metabolic energy expenditure, influencing how individuals would respond to a battery of behavioural and physiological measures, especially since their feeding rations remained unchanged throughout the study. We characterized circadian activity, judgement bias, predatory motivation, thermal reactivity to stress and changes in body composition. Generally, mouse lemurs under High enrichment showed more activity and increased predatory motivation and optimism than those in the Control group during daylight. Lemurs under High enrichment also showed increased responses during a stress reactivity test and higher losses in body and fat mass. Principal component analysis identified seven (out of nine) components that explained 96% of the variability in the data. Using a Na & iuml;ve Bayes classifier algorithm trained with these new principal components, we classified the animals as either from High or Control enrichment levels with 100% accuracy. In summary, by measuring several relevant behavioural and physiological responses to environmental enrichment, we identified a multidimensional effect related to differences in welfare.

AB Animals have evolved a wide variety of signals that punctuate social interactions, thus optimizing communication systems. In the study of communicative strategies, real and play fighting are good models, as they are associated with risks and injuries. Therefore, within these two domains, clear 'statement' signals should be recruited to disambiguate messages. We gathered video data (135 h) from 38 wolves from three mixed-age captive groups (Canis lupus arctos, C. l. lupus, C. l. occidentalis) and analysed all the facial expressions in aggressive and playful domains. The analyses revealed the presence of three different threatening faces (Light-, Medium- and High-TF), mainly performed during aggressive encounters, which differed in the degree of mouth opening and lip stretching. We also identified two different relaxed open mouth facial expressions (Full- and Half-ROM) exclusively performed during play and possibly signalling different levels of playful arousal. Interestingly, facial expressions did not differ between groups thus suggesting a hard-wired facial communication system at least in these two domains. The next step will be to test hypotheses on the efficacy of such facial displays in eliciting an appropriate response in the receivers, potentially translating into a fine modulation of behavioural patterns in both play and real fighting.

AB Song in oscine birds is learned across generations, and aspects of the song-learning process parallel genetic transmission: variation can be introduced into both cultural and genetic traits via copy error, and both types of traits are subject to drift and selective pressure. Similarly to allele frequencies in population genetics, observing frequencies of birdsong features can improve our understanding of cultural transmission and evolution. Uniquely, community science databases of birdsong provide rich spatiotemporal data with untapped potential to evaluate cultural evolution in songbirds. Here we use both community science and field study recordings of chipping sparrows, Spizella passerina, to examine trends across nearly seven decades of song. We found that some syllable types tended to persist in the population for much longer than others. Persistent songs tended to contain more syllables of shorter duration than songs that were observed across fewer years. To draw inferences about the effects of learning biases on chipping sparrow syllables, we constructed a spatially explicit agent-based model of song learning. By comparing our empirical analysis to simulated song distributions using three different song-learning strategies (neutral transmission, conformity bias and directional selection), we suggest that chipping sparrows are unlikely to select tutors neutrally or with a conformity bias and that they learn their songs with a remarkably low copy error rate.

AB Climate change and anthropogenic noise are two of the most widespread human-induced stressors affecting wildlife populations globally. However, the effects of these stressors are rarely investigated together, despite the fact that they often co-occur, particularly in urbanized areas and can have a multitude of adverse effects on species. Here, we compared the effects of heat stress and anthropogenic noise, both when presented alone and together, on the behaviour of wild Western Australian magpies, Gymnorhina tibicen dorsalis. Birds were presented with a playback of background noise and a playback of anthropogenic (plane) noise under both heat stress and nonheat stress conditions. Consistent with previous studies, we found both heat stress and anthropogenic noise reduced foraging and increased vigilance behaviours of magpies. Importantly, exposure to these two stressors simultaneously led to a greater change in behaviour, revealing that the simultaneous occurrence of two anthropogenic stressors had a more marked effect on behaviour compared to either stressor alone. This study provides some of the first evidence of the additive impact of heat stress and anthropogenic noise on the behaviour of a wild urban-dwelling bird species. Such findings highlight the importance of considering multiple stressors when looking at the effects of human-induced rapid environmental change on animals, since anthropogenic stressors rarely occur in isolation.

AB Social species often share with conspecifics the responsibilities of finding food, defending against predators or caring for young. Within a social group, individuals' roles can be influenced by age, sex and personality. Black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, are nonmigratory passerine birds that spend their winters living in social flocks. Due to the intense metabolic stress placed on chickadees by low winter temperatures, the role of flocking in resource localization and allocation among flockmates is an important aspect of individual fitness, especially during winter. Understanding changes in flock structure in response to the environment may provide insight into the consequences of social behaviour variability on overwinter survival. Here, we used social network analysis to quantify the effects of ambient temperature on social foraging behaviour in winter flocks of black-capped chickadees over two winters in Massachusetts, U.S.A. Contrary to our expectations, we found that two measures of social connection were higher on warm days than on cold days. We found no evidence that sex or dominance rank influenced birds' behavioural responses to temperature. Furthermore, contrary to previous research, we found male-biased sex ratios in most of our flocks. Our findings that birds had more and stronger social connections on warm days and that an individual's response to temperature was not related to their status in a flock beg further investigation as to the specific costs and benefits of flocking in chickadees and other birds.

AB Multimodal rhythmic signalling abounds across animal taxa. Studying its mechanisms and functions can highlight adaptive components in highly complex rhythmic behaviours, like dance and music. Pinnipeds, such as the harbour seal, Phoca vitulina, are excellent comparative models to assess rhythmic capacities. Harbour seals engage in rhythmic percussive behaviours which, until now, have not been described in detail. In our study, eight zoo-housed harbour seals (two pups, two juveniles and four adults) were passively monitored by audio and video during their pupping/breeding season. All juvenile and adult animals performed percussive signalling with their fore flippers in agonistic conditions, both on land and in water. Flipper slap sequences produced on the ground or on the seals' bodies were often highly regular in their interval duration, that is, were quasi-isochronous, at a 200-600 beats/min pace. Three animals also showed significant lateralization in slapping. In contrast to slapping on land, display slapping in water, performed only by adult males, showed slower tempo by one order of magnitude, and a rather motivic temporal structure. Our work highlights that percussive communication is a significant part of harbour seals' behavioural repertoire. We hypothesize that its forms of rhythm production may reflect adaptive functions such as regulating internal states and advertising individual traits.

AB Selection acts differently on females and males due to differences in potential reproductive rates, driving the evolution of sex differences in traits, including growth and behaviour. Additionally, selection pressures vary during an individual's ontogeny, with growth being crucial in early developmental stages and reproduction during adulthood, leading to age- and sex-specific behavioural strategies. In this study, we investigated a sexually size dimorphic spider, the raft spider, Dolomedes fimbriatus, in which females are substantially larger than males. We repeatedly observed spiders from juvenile to adult stages, examining boldness, voracity towards prey and probability of attacking. Our findings revealed that females exhibited greater boldness, voracity and probability of attacking the simulated attacker than males. Notably, the observed behaviours changed during ontogeny, with sex differences in the magnitudes and directions of change, indicating distinct life history strategies between the sexes. Moreover, we detected positive associations between body mass or age and behavioural traits, supporting a proposed positive feedback loop between assets and behaviour. While mass and age were not significant confounding predictors in the analyses of sex differences in behaviour, some collinearity was present between sex, mass and age, so that their effects on behavioural differences between the sexes cannot be conclusively disentangled. Repeatability of behaviours was low but significant for boldness and probability of attacking, with similar estimates between the sexes. These results underscore the importance of considering sex-specific life history strategies in behavioural trait studies.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB In many cricket species, individuals fill sex-specific mating roles. For mate attraction in the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, males remain stationary and produce a species-specific calling song (senders) while females detect this signal and move towards it in a behaviour known as phonotaxis (receivers). Male G. bimaculatus have been observed responding to the calling song of conspecifics, and phonotaxis has anecdotally been reported for males in related species. Here, we aimed to quantify the tuning and intensity of male phonotaxis behaviour in G. bimaculatus by using a trackball system and established acoustic paradigms, and by comparing responses to typical female phonotaxis. The tuning to a syllable repetition interval (SRI) paradigm was similar between the sexes and both preferred sound patterns that correspond to the male calling song. Also, the responses to different chirp patterns were not different between the sexes; however, the male's absolute steering responses to attractive chirps were significantly weaker than in female phonotaxis. Our results highlight the presence of phonotactic behaviour in male G. bimaculatus, which may be relevant for keeping populations together or indicative of alternative mating strategies.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID FLEXIBILITY; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; LIFE
AB Animals living in complex social environments are often able to flexibly adjust their behaviour to different social contexts. Yet, flexible responses require time and energy and can be constrained by a variety of mechanisms. Here we asked whether the socio ecological environment experienced by the facultative cleaning goby Elacatinus prochilos influenced their interest in cleaning interactions. Elacatinus prochilos can be found in two socio ecological contexts: inhabiting cleaning stations, where they live in pairs and feed by removing ectoparasites from larger marine organisms (cleaners), or barrel sponges, where they live in dominance hierarchies and rarely engage in cleaning interactions (sponge-dwellers). We tested individuals used in a previous experiment with controlled social structures (small groups with dominance hierarchies) and feeding conditions (better access to food to dominants) to better understand which factors influence cleaning activity in facultative species. We found that dominance significantly decreased cleaning activity in male (and potentially female) sponge-dwellers. We hypothesize that longterm hormone-mediated or time allocation constraints may explain reduced cleaning activity in dominant male sponge-dwellers. While previous studies showed that E. prochilos can be socially flexible, here we showed that feeding flexibility might be restricted for dominant sponge-dwellers. This highlights the importance of testing the flexibility of individuals in different social contexts to better understand the evolutionary importance of adaptive behavioural flexibility.

AB The strength of precopulatory sexual selection may vary within a breeding season depending on fluc-tuations in the social environment faced by active individuals. Here, we investigated within-season variations in precopulatory sexual selection in the river lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis. We determined individual lifetime mating success in a group of 20 females and 15 males through constant video recording in an experimental aquarium. Among each sex, we calculated the potential strength of sexual selection and selection on identified traits (body size and temporal spawning patterns) at two different timescales: a fine-grained scale in which we considered mating events at daily time steps and a global scale in which we pooled all mating events that occurred during the breeding season. We found a predictable change in the operational sex ratio that corresponded with a change in the opportunity for sexual selection in males. Selection on both male and female body size was stronger when active competitors were larger. In addition, the timing (onset and span) of both the male's and the female's reproductive activity affected the number of matings performed over the season with a strength dependent on individual body size. Overall, our study documented that river lampreys experience within-season changes in precopulatory sexual selection. Such temporal dynamics are important to consider, and we advocate for longitudinal observation of mating behaviour to complement traditional time-integrated estimation of mating success based on genetic parentage analysis or cross-sectional analysis. & COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The recent development of animal-borne sensors coupled with location data can provide insights into how individuals modify their behaviour with respect to specific habitat features. Animals can express a diverse array of behaviours as they navigate heterogenous landscapes, yet few studies have specifically evaluated the interaction of behaviours with habitat characteristics. We used a novel broadcast acoustic transmitter to investigate the interaction between vocal behaviours of an endemic Hawaiian thrush, the oma'o, Myadestes obscurus, and habitat features across a naturally fragmented forest landscape. Through the development of behavioural landscape models that link specific vocalizations with space use, we found that the use of different vocalization types (calls, songs, whisper songs) were highly variable across the landscape but were associated with distinct habitat features. The likelihood of calls increased in an open lava matrix between forest patches, while whisper songs were more strongly associated with the dense interior areas of forest fragments. In contrast, the rate of oma'o vocalizations overall decreased in the open lava matrix, suggesting that oma'o may shift behaviours from territory defence to foraging as they transition through different habitats. Our study revealed context-specific changes in behaviour across oma'o home ranges, including courtship, aggression and social interactions between individuals. Combining the use of a novel acoustic tool with automated radiotelemetry allowed us to overcome challenges associated with detection and analysis of variation in behaviour and resource selection across a highly heterogeneous landscape that would have been otherwise difficult to impossible.

AB In species with biparental care, the amount of care devoted to offspring is affected by the negotiation rules that the parents adopt. Theoretical models predict that biparental care can be evolutionarily stable if a decrease in parental investment by one parent is only partially compensated by its partner. However, empirical studies have found substantial variability in compensatory behaviour and have mainly used nesting provisioning as a single measure of parental effort. In this study, we investigated parental compensatory behaviour for two parental tasks, offspring provisioning and nest defence. These two tasks are likely characterized by different levels of risk as well as different cost and benefit functions for the parents, which may affect the expected level of compensatory responses. We experimentally widowed (by temporarily removing one parent) male or female Spanish sparrows, Passer hispaniolensis, and measured their compensatory responses to offspring provisioning and nest defence (after predator presentation of green whip snake, Hierophis viridiflavus, models). Parents differed in their compensatory responses in relation to parental task and sex: both sexes partially compensated for offspring provi-sioning, but females compensated by a larger degree than males. For predator defence, males instead decreased defence behaviour by increasing latency and reducing the number of attacks, while females did not change their behaviour when caring alone. This within-individual comparison indicates that parents adjust their compensatory behaviour according to parental task. We discuss how these differ-ences could arise due to different costs and benefits of extra investments. (c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The integration of environmental cues can be critical to the successful timing of life cycle events. Yet, our understanding of cue integration remains limited, particularly regarding migratory timing and the integration of nonphotic cues. Here, we applied a recently proposed conceptual framework that con-siders both cue dependency and interactions among cues to experimentally investigate the integration of social or temperature cues with changing food availability in the context of facultative migratory timing. Furthermore, we examined circulating corticosterone as a potential endocrine mechanism for cue integration. We provided pine siskins, Spinus pinus, with either ad libitum food or a restricted diet and tested whether a short-term cold exposure or socially acquired information about food availability affected behaviour indicative of a migratory response, energetic reserves or circulating corticosterone levels. Temperature and food availability cues elicited distinct behavioural responses, as cold exposure increased nocturnal activity, while food restriction increased diurnal activity. Pine siskins integrated social and food cues in an additive manner, as diurnal activity levels were highest in food-restricted birds with neighbours that also had a restricted diet. However, pine siskins showed no physiological prepa-rations for future migratory response following exposure to any cue combination. Furthermore, we found no evidence that changes in circulating corticosterone were a mechanism underpinning cue integration. These findings highlight the diverse modes in which proximate environmental cues are integrated to time life cycle events, which may ultimately impact organismal fitness.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Coppery titi monkeys maintain pair bonds through affiliative behaviours (e.g. tail twining, maintaining social proximity). Findings from previous studies suggest that the amount of time pairs spend in affiliative contact is not stable over time within pairs and differs across pairs. The present study investigates several predictors (temperament, age at pairing, pregnancy status and presence of infant) that may help explain observed changes in affiliation over time and between pairs. We hypothesized that affiliation varies for individual dyads and that time-varying and dyad level predictors explain variability in affiliation. We analysed pair affiliation using scan samples collected five times per day for 1 year for 29 pairs. We used Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects effects modelling to test the effects of predictors. Pregnancy predicted higher affiliation levels (Y-02 = 0.40, 95% highest posterior density interval (HPDI): [0.21, 0.58]). The presence of an infant and aggression did not predict variability in affiliation. Models would not converge when we included age at pairing, so we cannot draw conclusions about the role of age in affiliation. Findings from this study suggest that time-varying predictors like pregnancy status help explain the large degree of variability observed in affiliative interactions between partners in this species. It is possible that hormonal changes associated with pregnancy are driving changes in affiliative behaviours in pairs. An alternative explanation is that pairs that are more affiliative to begin with are more likely to get pregnant. Future studies will assess whether these patterns persist in subsequent pairings.

AB Bumble bees (Bombus: Apidae) are a long-standing model system for understanding animal behaviour, ecology and evolution. However, how workers in this system are organized to perform fundamental tasks related to brood feeding and food collection remains unclear. Bumble bees undergo dramatically different life stages, across which the social environment, and therefore task organization, changes over time. Queens initiate nests solitarily, and when the first cohort of workers emerge, they help the queen carry out brood-feeding and food collection tasks, whereas the queen transitions to primarily egg laying. Although task organization has been studied in mature colonies, few studies to date have explored how these tasks are organized in young, incipient nests. Here, we explored how food-related tasks, including brood feeding and food collection, are organized by workers in incipient colonies. We found that foodrelated tasks were nested, in that the majority of workers fed brood, a subset also collected nectar and a smaller subset also collected pollen. These patterns suggest that brood feeding is a task shared by most workers, and that the distinction between pollen collecting versus nonpollen collecting might be the most important axis of division of labour in bumble bee nests, at least at the early nesting stage.

AB Biologists have long been fascinated by the elaborate courtship displays performed by diverse organisms throughout the animal kingdom. The evolution of courtship behaviour often requires specializations of neural, sensory and motor systems. In addition, physically impressive displays may also require optimized metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular systems to sustain the neuromuscular demands. Hormonal signalling can reach all of these tissues simultaneously to prepare them for use in courtship. Studies of male golden-collared manakins, Manacus vitellinus, a small bird of the Neotropics with a physically intense and noisy courtship display, have uncovered numerous androgen-dependent neuromuscular and metabolic specializations that enable not only the performance of elaborate courtship routines, but also their evolutionary exaggeration. However, physiological specializations for one function can create limits on their use for other purposes. Such trade-offs may influence the way courtship develops but may also provide information used by females for mate choice. We review this body of work with an eye towards expanding our appreciation of the evolution of widespread tissue hormone sensitivity and hormone action as the system through which elaborate courtship behaviours evolve.

AB With the use of animal models in research comes the responsibility of treating them ethically. While general anaesthetics are used to reduce pain, they have the potential to interfere with research results. This is a concern in behavioural ecology, particularly in aquatic systems where organisms use chemicals as a form of communication. One well-studied source of chemical information are alarm cues - compounds released from injured skin of conspecifics that mediate antipredator responses in nearby individuals and facilitate learned predator recognition when paired with novel predator cues. To determine whether chemical euthanasia interferes with the ecological functioning of alarm cues, we first exposed woodfrog tadpoles, Lithobates sylvaticus, to alarm cues prepared using different euthanasia, preparation and use methods (physical versus chemical euthanasia; mortar and pestle homogenization versus tissue homogenizer; cues used fresh versus frozen versus aged) and compared the intensity of their antipredator responses. Second, we exposed tadpoles to a novel predator odour paired with alarm cues obtained using either physical or chemical euthanasia techniques to elicit learning, and subsequently compared their learned responses. We found that tadpoles exposed to alarm cues prepared with a chemical euthanizing agent (MS222) displayed a weakened antipredator response that was not significantly different from our water (negative) control. Similarly, tadpoles were unable to learn novel predator odours as a threat when alarm cues were prepared with MS222. In contrast, alarm cues obtained using a physical euthanasia method yielded the highest responses regardless of preparation and use methods, with the exception of cues aged 24 h, which became nonfunctional. Our results confirmed the potential for chemical euthanasia methods to interfere with the functioning of ecologically relevant chemicals. Therefore, a single euthanasia method cannot be applied to all experimental situations options are needed so researchers can select a method that provides adequate animal welfare without interfering with results.

AB Leaving the nest is a key transition in the life of altricial birds, whereby fledging decisions should depend on multiple factors, including the risk of predation. High postfledging predation risk may favour fledging at a more advanced stage of development, if more developed fledglings are better at escaping predation, or together with others. While comparative studies have highlighted the role of predation risk for between-species variation in the timing of fledging, drivers of within-species variation in fledging behaviour remain largely unknown. We presented owl models near blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, nests during the first half of the day throughout the fledging period to simulate an increased risk of post fledging predation. Using an automated monitoring system, we then recorded the precise fledging times of 595 nestlings from 105 nests (52 predator-treated, 53 control nests). Contrary to our predictions, the predator presentations did not affect the age at which nestlings fledged, the time of day of fledging or other aspects of fledging behaviour. The tendency to fledge together with siblings was affected, but the effect was in the opposite direction to that expected, with nestlings exposed to the predator treatment being more likely to fledge alone. Parents visited predator-treated nests less often, but this effect diminished over the course of the morning. We suggest several explanations for why the behavioural responses to the predation risk manipulation were generally limited. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB Playback can help identify keystone species in communities that interact behaviourally. Specifically, playback has been used to identify leader species in mixed-species flocks (MSFs) of birds, although it is not clear whether responding heterospecifics are attracted to the leader species or the whole MSF. Playback can also simulate a mobbing response; both flocking and mobbing are regarded as adaptations to predation, but the species participating in these phenomena are not often compared. We performed a complex experiment, comparing heterospecific responses to playback of (1) MSFs (multiple species calling simultaneously), (2) a primary leader species, (3, 4) two secondary leader species that occasionally lead MSFs, (5, 6) two follower species, (7) one nonflocking species and (8) one predator (a small owlet). In 240 trials over 2 years, 72 species made 980 heterospecific approaches to the speaker. We found the predator treatment attracted the most species, and the weakest response was to the nonflocking species. Other patterns were unexpected, however: the response to the MSF, and to the primary leader, was not higher than to other treatments that included MSF members, and the response to one follower species (the particularly vigilant grey-headed canary-flycatcher, Culicicapa ceylonensis) was higher than that to one secondary leader. Although flocking propensity did not influence the response, species that followed MSFs responded more than those that led them. There was a strong correlation between which bird species responded to the owlet and which responded to any MSF member. Our results reveal (1) a response by flock followers to all MSF participants, as if they used these species' vocalizations to search for the whole MSF, (2) some weak evidence that vigilant species are particularly attractive, and (3) a general correspondence between the species that are attracted to an MSF and those that mob.

AB Predator avoidance often comes at the cost of reduced foraging and mating opportunities, and therefore, prey animals are often highly attuned to variation in risk. Indeed, individuals capable of detecting threats early in life are at an advantage because they may be better able to escape risks than their naive peers. Some prey organisms, including embryonic prey, can learn to recognize new predators and may even incorporate information on the degree of threat involved. Prey organisms that evaluate the intensity of a threat and modify their behaviours accordingly should have a distinct advantage by being able to seize opportunities in low-risk situations. Graded behavioural responses that vary depending on threat levels are referred to as threat sensitive. Here we show that embryonic minnows are not only capable of learning to recognize novel predators, but do so in a threat-sensitive manner, such that fish responded with an intensity correlated to the degree of the threat to which they were exposed in the egg. Subsequent to embryonic exposure to one of three different concentrations of alarm cue paired with a novel predator odour, juvenile fish from all three groups responded to predator odour by reducing their movement. However, only those exposed to the pairing with the highest concentration of alarm cue later increased their shelter use. These responses were maintained over the course of 10 months.

AB Across animal taxa, individuals eavesdrop upon courting conspecific males, often in an attempt to steal mating opportunities. While multimodal signals can increase the likelihood that choosers respond to courters, such multimodal signals might also attract the unwanted attention of conspecific eavesdroppers. Previous studies of the brush-legged wolf spider, Schizocosa ocreata, demonstrate that fieldexperienced males court in response to visual displays of conspecific male courtship more than do laboratory-raised males. Furthermore, other studies demonstrate that males can learn to associate visual signals with the presence of a nearby female. Male S. ocreata, however, use a combination of vibratory and visual signals in their multimodal courtship display. Whether such associative learning varies based on which signal modality is experienced or whether multimodal signals result in enhanced learning remains unknown. Consequently, we examined eavesdropping on courtship behaviours of S. ocreata, with added emphasis on learning to respond to unimodal versus multimodal playback. We used vibratory and video playback techniques to test whether associative learning results in varied courtship levels when males associate unimodal or multimodal courtship signals with the presence of a nearby female. Results show that male S. ocreata associated courtship playback with the presence of a nearby female (i.e. courted at higher levels), regardless of whether courtship playback was unimodal or multimodal, demonstrating that male S. ocreata are capable of learning in multiple modalities. Multimodal playback, however, did not appear to enhance males' ability to associate conspecific courtship signals with female cues. Courtship behaviours were greater in response to vibratory playback, though, suggesting that male S. ocreata weight modalities differently than females do. We further discuss the implications of this result regarding the communication network of S. ocreata. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social dynamics can play a major role in shaping the population ecology and evolutionary trajectory of a species. This is, for instance, the case in species known to experience infanticide when a dominant male is replaced by another. Infanticide by males has been observed in many taxa, mostly in species that breed year-round and in which a few males monopolize reproduction. In such species, infanticide often occurs after take-overs of breeding groups, and the frequency of take-overs often increases with increasing female group size, therefore raising the risk of infanticide in larger groups. Among ungulates, male infanticide has been reported mostly in harem-forming equids in captive populations, usually following harem-male turnover. In this study, we empirically tested in the wild whether the rate of stallion (i.e. harem-male) turnover increases with the number of reproductive females in harems, and whether these events reduce foal survival. We used a long-term study of wild plains zebra, Equus quagga, in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, where, for more than 15 years, stallion turnovers have been recorded and accurate data on pregnancy obtained by hormone assays. We show that stallion turnovers were frequent and, as expected, particularly in harems with many reproductive females. We found that foal survival did not differ significantly between situations when a stallion turnover occurred shortly before or after their birth and when it did not. This result was consistent with the fact that no attacks by stallions on foals of their group or forced matings were observed during the study. Our study offers rare data showing that if male infanticide occurs in wild plains zebra, this should be rare, and has no important consequences for foal survival at the population level.

AB Dogs, similarly to infants, have been shown to be sensitive to human speech especially when it is directed to them. However, what essential acoustic, paralinguistic and lexical features of dog-directed speech are responsible for this preference in dogs is largely unknown. In the present study, generalized dog (DDS)-, infant (IDS)-and adult (ADS)-directed speech stimuli were created by using prerecorded sentences of multiple female speakers and these composite (averaged) stimuli were then manipulated to control for linguistic content as well as to equalize their mean fundamental frequency (F0) value. All three possible pairwise combinations of these acoustic stimuli were then presented to adult dogs in a two-way choice task where two identical target objects were used to indicate the sound sources. We found a significant preference towards the target object associated with DDS in the DDS versus ADS condition and suggest that, for dogs, mean F0 difference is not essential for DDS-ADS discrimination. However, we did not find evidence of selection bias when IDS was simultaneously presented either with DDS or ADS. Interestingly, our results also showed that dogs were more willing to approach the 'more prosodic' location (i.e. DDS or IDS versus ADS) when the prosodically more prominent sound stimulus was presented on their left side which suggests right-hemispheric specialization for neural processing of prosodic sounds in this domestic species. We also found that dogs made their choice faster when the 'more prosodic' stimulus was given first which suggests that they can perceive the difference not only between DDS and ADS, but also between IDS and ADS and between IDS and DDS. In conclusion, the composite DDS, IDS and ADS stimuli in the present study proved to be an effective technique in exploring the acoustic determinants of dog-directed speech preference in dogs.

AB Vocal learning is a biologically rare adaptation that underpins both human language and the songs of songbirds. The adaptive value of vocal learning in birds is still poorly understood, but a growing body of literature suggests that vocal learning allows songbirds to gain a fitness advantage by adopting songs that are structurally similar to the songs of individuals in neighbouring breeding territories. In this study, we investigate patterns of song development, acoustic similarity, and territorial aggression in Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis. Four years of field data reveal that Savannah sparrows routinely overproduce songs during development; more than half of young males sang more than one song type early in their first breeding season, before their repertoire underwent attrition to a single song that males maintained throughout the remainder of their lives. We also found that the attrition of song types is a selective process, with males retaining songs that are similar to the songs of their territorial neighbours. Males that sang songs that were more similar to their neighbours may have faced lower levels of territorial aggression, as indicated by lower numbers of aggressive calls. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that vocal learning in songbirds allows animals to produce songs that match territorial neighbours, possibly providing a benefit in terms of decreased aggression during territorial defence.

AB When animals engage in contests, 'fights' are usually noninjurious, involving either signals or trials of strength. Such fights end once an individual assesses that it is the weaker opponent, or it has reached the threshold level of costs it is prepared to pay. We investigated the agonistic behaviours performed and the relative costs paid by winners and losers during aggressive interactions in two species of Madagascan hissing cockroaches (the wide-horned cockroach, Gromphadorhina oblongonota, and the flat-horned cockroach, Aeluropoda insignis). By combining contest observations with measures of energetic expenditure and using X-ray computed tomography to compare the internal structure of the respiratory systems of the competitors, we revealed the differential physiological investment associated with resource-holding potential in these two species. Winners in G. oblongonota had larger respiratory volumes than predicted for their size compared to losers. Gromphadorhina oblongonota fought more aggressively and had larger respiratory systems overall than A. insignis, which engaged in less physical fighting. This indicates differential investment in fight tactics, and associated anatomy that may promote contest success. Invertebrate species at the upper limits of body size need to maintain efficient respiratory systems to support their size while also remaining subject to the influence of sexual selection.

AB Stress experienced by mothers can affect offspring phenotype, with some of these modifications potentially preparing offspring for the environment they will likely encounter. Many maternal stressors, including encounters with predators, can influence how offspring respond to risk and cues of danger later on. Using the live-bearing, highly invasive western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, we examined how repeated brief (<30 s) maternal exposures to a largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, model during pregnancy shapes offspring activity in response to cues of predation risk, as well as offspring movement through an artificial stream. Maternal predator exposure tended to increase the activity of daughters, but not sons, in a novel tank with cues of risk. In addition, maternal predator exposure increased the movement of small daughters, but not large daughters, through an artificial stream. Our results suggest that encountering predators during pregnancy can have sex-specific effects on offspring movement and exploration, particularly for sizes that are the most vulnerable to predation. In invasive species, such as mosquitofish, the transgenerational consequences of predation risk for activity, exploration and movement could help us predict potential dispersal patterns and the types of individuals at the invasion front.

AB The sexes may have different optima in cognitive traits due to differences in life history strategies and the expense of investing in metabolically costly brain tissue. However, given genetic correlations, each sex could be constrained from reaching its cognitive optimum due to intralocus sexual conflict. We compared learning performance of two male alternative reproductive tactics and females from known genotypes (both sire and dam) in the livebearing fish Xiphophorus multilineatus. We predicted that females' learning performance would align with the learning performance of their sire's genotype due to genetic correlation of cognitive traits. Using a classical conditioning assessment (associating a flashing light with a food reward), we detected mating tactic dimorphism in learning performance, with the behaviourally plastic sneaker males outperforming the behaviourally fixed courter males. Unexpectedly, females sired by the faster-learning sneaker males performed significantly worse than sneaker males. We also detected an influence of brain size on female learning performance. Previous studies have found that females invest more in offspring sired by courter males, and we therefore hypothesize that maternal effects could potentially mitigate the influence of sexual conflict on a cognitive trait.

AB Many species use early life sensory experiences to guide phenotypic plasticity and facilitate decision making during later adult settlement in new habitats or location of suitable resources. However, only some of the available sensory information in the environment is relevant for future decision making and, in addition, it may only be informative during certain times during development. This means that sampling of environmental information that should be retained to adulthood could be limited to certain sensitive periods. In the polyphagous moth Spodoptera littoralis, recent studies have demonstrated that adult females exhibit an innate preference hierarchy for certain plants that can be modulated by olfactory experience during the larval stage. This olfactory-driven phenotypic plasticity requires that information about plant quality is transferred over the full metamorphosis. However, the timing of information acquisition that affects adult behaviour and whether there is a sensitive period for the sensory experience inducing host plant preferences are not known. In this study, we tested whether experience used by adult females during host plant choice was acquired during early or later larval stages and whether adult females can retain larval experience from only one or from sequential feeding events on different plants. We found that only plant feeding experience during the later larval stages induced a host plant preference shift in adult females. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrated that when given an artificial diet in the later larval stage, adult females relied on their innate plant preference hierarchy even if they had feeding experience from a host plant in the early stages. The existence of a sensitive period during late larval stages may be constrained not only by neural development or limitations, but also by ecological factors affecting when the larval experience is most reliable for adult decisions.

AB Conspicuous colours in animals are usually explained by mate attraction, predator avoidance and prey attraction. Predators may lure prey by mimicking food or other resources. Alternatively, some animals avoid predation by visually signalling unpalatability to predators. The evolution of a signal is affected by receiver processing mechanisms. Therefore, variation in sensory systems may explain the evolution of colour polymorphism of conspicuous species. We aimed to investigate the role of receivers in the evolution and maintenance of colour conspicuousness and polymorphism in Gasteracantha cancriformis (Araneidae). We tested two hypotheses: (1) conspicuous coloration is a prey lure strategy; (2) conspicuous coloration is a warning signal to predators. Furthermore, we identified the taxonomic order of prey captured and the type of predator (avian versus arthropod). To assess the role of prey, we conducted a field experiment in which webs were assigned to one of four treatments: yellow, red or black spider models, or no model. For each treatment, we counted the number of prey trapped on the webs and calculated the damaged area of the webs. To assess the role of predators, we conducted a second field experiment in which we attached yellow, red and black models to trees using nylon thread and observed the number of attack markings on each model. Our results did not corroborate the prey attraction hypothesis. In the predation experiment, black models had more attack markings, indicating that yellow and red models were less preferred. This suggests that spider coloration may play a role in predator avoidance. Colour polymorphism in this species is possibly a multifunctional attribute, where some morphs benefit from aposematism, whereas others may have alternative fitness advantages. Nonadaptive explanations should also be considered in future experiments of the evolution and maintenance of colour polymorphisms. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Anthropogenic noise is globally increasing in aquatic ecosystems and causes adverse repercussions in many fish species, yet its effect on freshwater fish is not well understood. Here, we test the impact of boat noise on foraging and swimming behaviour on a number of wild freshwater fish species as well as captive black bullhead, Ameiurus melas, a common species in the Laurentian Great Lakes with known hearing specializations. In a laboratory setting, black bullhead were exposed to white noise, boat noise and a quiet control and monitored for changes in foraging behaviours and swimming patterns when presented with food. Black bullhead exposed to both boat noise and white noise foraged less and startled more in comparison to trials without noise. In a field setting, wild fishes with differing hearing capabilities were exposed to boat noise and a quiet control, then analysed for changes in both presence and foraging behaviour when presented with food. Field experiments were consistent with results from our laboratory study, resulting in decreased presence of wild fish and fewer foraging attempts made during boat noise exposure. However, the effects of noise in the field were highly variable by family, with fish in the Cyprinidae (or Leuciscidae) family, all of which have Weberian ossicle hearing specializations, exhibiting significantly larger decreases in feeding events and presence compared to other families (Gobiidae, Percidae and Centrarchidae) with more basic hearing abilities. Freshwater fishes alter their foraging behaviour during noise exposure, however, variation in hearing abilities may determine the extent to which their behaviour changes and the resulting degree of negative consequences.

AB Animals can transfer food between each other through both competition (theft) and cooperation (sharing). Analysing patterns of food transfers can thus yield valuable insights into animals' social dynamics, e.g. intragroup competition and cooperation. Previous studies on food transfers in our closest living relatives, the great apes, have mainly focused on ultimate explanations for food sharing and analysed food transfers as independent events with a focus on frequencies and types of transfers. In this study, we focus on the influence of contextual variables and the directly preceding interaction on food transfer attempts. We provided one monopolizable food bag per session (10 sessions each in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016) to orang-utans housed in the same enclosure (N = 12) and coded the subsequent transfers and transfer attempts of food items from the bag (N = 3207). We divided transfer attempts into four different categories (taking, co-feeding, requests, offers) and found comparable frequencies as in previous studies on food sharing in great apes. We present four models that investigate to what extent food transfer attempts influence the subsequent transfer attempt within a dyad with regards to probability of a successful transfer, choice of transfer strategy, time between two transfer attempts and probability of resistance by the food possessor. Our analyses show that characteristics of the previous interactions (e.g. success, resistance by the food possessor) and the current interaction (e.g. being in view of the food possessor, food location) affected both the behaviour of the initiator of a transfer attempt and of the food possessor. These results highlight how the behaviour of orang-utans is influenced by the preceding interaction within a dyad and by several other context-specific cues. This shows that orangutans keep track of their most recent interaction with the same partner and take that into account towards calibrating their next interactional moves.

AB Dominance hierarchies structure the adult social networks of many mammals. To identify the conditions that support the establishment of stable hierarchical relationships within groups of familiar rivals, we explored the ontogeny of spatial, social and communicative behaviour among male northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris. We demonstrate that as male seals reach sexual maturity, they increase residency time ashore and restrict fine-scale movement patterns within the breeding colony. This spatiotemporal overlap creates a predictable social environment in which repeated interactions promote greater social connectivity between older individuals. Moreover, as males become physically and behaviourally mature, their ritualized vocal displays transition from highly variable calls to stable and unique individual acoustic signatures, supporting recognition between familiar competitors. The developmental onset of reliable signature calls - along with concurrent changes in space occupancy - coincide with the formation of stable, structured dominance relationships among top-level competitors. These findings advance our understanding of the ontogeny of social behaviour under conditions of extreme competition. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The human-assisted movement of species beyond their native range facilitates novel interactions between invaders and native species that can determine whether an introduced species becomes invasive and the nature of any consequences for native communities. Avoiding costly interactions through recognition and avoidance can be compromised by the naivety of native species to novel invaders and vice versa. We tested this hypothesis using the common wall lizard, Podarcis muralis, and the native lizard species with which it may now interact in Britain (common lizard, Zootoca vivipara, sand lizard, Lacerta agilis) and on Vancouver Island (northern alligator lizard, Elgaria coerulea) by exploring species' responses (tongue flicks, avoidance behaviour) to heterospecific scent cues in controlled experiments. The tongue flick response of P. muralis depended on the different species' scent, with significantly more tongue flicks directed to E. coerulea scent than the other species and the control. This recognition did not result in any other behavioural response in P. muralis (i.e. attraction, aggression, avoidance). Lacerta agilis showed a strong recognition response to P. muralis scent, with more tongue flicks occurring close to the treatment stimuli than the control and aggressive behaviour directed towards the scent source. Conversely, Z. vivipara spent less time near P. muralis scent cues than the control but its tongue flick rate was higher towards this scent in this reduced time, consistent with an avoidance response. There was no evidence of E. coerulea recognition of P. muralis scent in terms of tongue flicks or time spent near the stimuli, although the native species did show a preference for P. muralis-scented refuges. Our results suggest a variable response of native species to the scent of P. muralis, from an avoidance response by Z. vivipara that mirrors patterns of exclusion observed in the field to direct aggression observed in L agilis and an ambiguous reaction from E. coerulea which may reflect a diminished response to a cue with a low associated cost. These results have significant implications for the invasive success and potential impacts of introduced P. muralis populations on native lizards. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB In many animal species, mothers eat some of their own eggs. While this filial egg cannibalism can have profound impacts on both parental and offspring fitness, it remains unclear whether this behaviour is a simple by-product of a generally low maternal investment in egg care and whether it is determined before or after egg production. Here, we addressed these questions in the European earwig, Forficula auricularia, an insect in which females vary in their level of investment in egg care and in their expression of egg cannibalism. Using a cross-fostering experiment, we investigated the benefits of egg cannibalism for mothers, the potential association between egg cannibalism and egg care, and whether egg cannibalism is a maternal strategy that is determined before or after egg laying. Our results first revealed that egg cannibalism provided direct benefits to mothers, as the females that consumed some of their eggs increased their investment in future reproduction. We then showed that egg cannibalism was independent of the level of maternal investment in two important forms of egg care (egg defence and the time taken to return after a simulated predator attack). Overall, this suggests that access to egg cannibalism may select for mothers to remain with their eggs, independent of the potential benefits of care for the eggs. Finally, we demonstrated that the number of eggs received, but not the number of eggs produced by foster mothers, determined the level of egg cannibalism. This highlights that egg cannibalism is determined after egg laying and is not the outcome of anticipatory maternal effects. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into our understanding of the early evolution of parental care, as they suggest that the direct benefits of filial egg cannibalism for mothers could have promoted egg attendance from an ancestral egg abandonment state.

AB Experience can modify how animals respond to relevant stimuli from their environment, for example, through associative learning. In particular, odour stimuli play a central role in foraging by influencing decision making. Numerous studies have shown that odours can acquire relevance for an animal by becoming associated with food after appetitive experience. Therefore, studying to what extent learning can modulate the behavioural response to olfactory stimuli is essential to improve our understanding about the role of experience in food exploitation in nature. Here, we evaluated whether foraging experience can modulate the response of Vespula germanica, a food generalist and opportunistic eusocial wasp, towards an aversive odour. Through field experiments, we evaluated the response of naive and experienced wasps towards an aversive odour under different scenarios, to also examine how these changes affect foraging decisions. Both naive wasps and wasps that had foraging experience in the absence of the aversive odour were not attracted to the odour alone and avoided meat sources paired with this cue. However, wasps that had foraging experience with the aversive odour showed an opposite behavioural pattern; they preferred meat sources with the aversive odour and were equally attracted to this odour and the meat source. The behavioural repertoire (i.e. approaches, landings and search behaviour) elicited by the aversive odour after experience with it indicates that change in the response was due to associative learning, leading the odour which was initially repellent, to become attractive. Interestingly, the change in the aversive odour's valence occurred after one collecting experience and three to five visits promoted long-term memory of the odour. In conclusion, our results show that spontaneous responses to odours can be modulated by experience and provide new insights about learning and memory abilities of social wasps in relation to olfactory cues.

AB The study of vocal communication in nonhuman primates, especially apes, offers critical insight into the origins of human language. Although human language represents a highly derived and complex form of communication, researchers have found that the organization of language follows a series of common statistical patterns, known as 'linguistic laws'. Zipf's law of brevity and Menzerath's law are pervasive across human languages, and these laws have been identified in the communication of a small number of primate species. What remains less clear is whether these two laws also affect long-distance vocal communication in primates. Here, we provide evidence that the long-distance morning calls of male gibbons (cao vit gibbon, Nomascus nasutus, and western black-crested gibbon, Nomascus concolor) follow both Zipf's law of brevity and Menzerath's law. We found that notes of male gibbon calls conform to Zipf's law of brevity, with the most common notes being shortest in duration. Similarly, longer sequences are made up of shorter calls on average, consistent with Menzerath's law; we also found a shortening of specific note type duration and an increase in proportion of shorter call types in longer sequences, which may underpin the emergence of this law. Our findings support the generality of these two linguistic laws beyond human language and provide evidence for compression at two levels of organizations (how frequently different note types are used, and how vocal sequences are constructed) in a long-range communication system.

AB Individuals exhibit consistent differences in behaviour and related cognitive performance. 'Cognitive styles'-based hypotheses suggest the trade-off between speed and accuracy is an important factor where an individual's behavioural traits and linked decision speeds may account for its cognitive performance. The expected relationship between accuracy and decision speed, however, is not always clear and some studies have suggested that faster individuals do not suffer the expected cost to accuracy. Contradictory findings may be attributed to taxon-specific differences but may also be due to the difficulty in separating intraindividual from interindividual variation or the use of insufficiently challenging tasks in tests. We trained archerfish, Toxotes chatareus, to shoot at artificial targets for food, and then conducted a visual discrimination study to test the cognitive styles hypothesis. To reduce potential confounding effects, we used a longitudinal design, and increased the challenge of the test by using differentially rewarded targets. We also tested fish in one of two conditions with either two or three targets in each test. As expected, archerfish showed repeatable differences in latency to shoot and consistently fast individuals were quicker to achieve initial learning criteria than slower individuals. Repeated tests revealed an inverse relationship between discrimination accuracy and speed, with slower individuals having greater accuracy in initial trials on each day, supporting the cognitive styles hypothesis. However, this relationship was statistically significant only in the three-target condition, underscoring how task design can strongly affect the ability of researchers to detect robust individual variation in cognition. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that speed-accuracy trade-offs can underlie some observed interindividual differences in cognition.

AB Eusociality is exhibited by colonial-living organisms where only a few individuals within a colony reproduce; the remaining members are nonbreeders and support reproduction of the breeders. Damaraland mole-rats, Fukomys damarensis, are one of two mammal species considered eusocial. Colonies include a breeding pair and their offspring. Unusual aspects of reproductive behaviour include the observation that both sexes display all components of mating even after long-term absence of gonadal hormones. Mating does not occur between siblings or offspring and parents, but nonbreeders from one colony will mate with individuals from other colonies. However, following 5 weeks of separation from each other, siblings will exhibit mutual sexual behaviour. Thus, familiarity through frequent proximity, rather than genetic identity, mediates inbreeding avoidance. One caveat is that breeding pairs maintain a mating relationship for years, although they obviously become familiar with each other. Among Damaraland mole-rats that are familiar with each other, two types of relationships can form, a mating relationship or a 'sibling-like' relationship marked by inbreeding avoidance. The factors determining the relationship between pairs of Damaraland mole-rats remain undefined. This experiment tested the hypothesis that the behaviour during the initial meeting of a pair of Damaraland mole-rats determines which relationship forms, i.e. mating versus 'sibling-like'. The initial pairing occurred either with unrestrained physical contact (allowing for mating behaviours) or with the two animals separated from each other by a mesh barrier (no mating could occur). This initial pairing was followed by daily 20 min pairings with the barrier in place for 2 weeks and then a final pairing without any restraint. Results indicate that the nature of the interaction within the first 20 min of meeting determines the long-term sexual relationship between pairs of Damaraland mole-rats. The results suggest a mechanistic basis for establishment and maintenance of the reproductive hierarchy in this eusocial species. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Transmitting information about the location of a predator in social animal species can be seen as an investment in a public good, where information is the resource and group members benefit from reduced fatalities of kin and cooperation partners in their community. As few empirical tests of this idea exist in natural settings, we conducted a field experiment using snake models in wild sooty mangabeys, Cercocebus atys atys. We tested sooty mangabey alarm-calling patterns when exposed to viper models, investigating whether individuals called to signal fitness, to warn specific group members, or when information about the threat is not public, as would be predicted by public goods games. Strong inter-individual differences in the likelihood of alarm calling existed. We found that overlap between callers was rare. Individuals were more likely to call if fewer individuals were present at the encounter site and if they had not heard other alarm calls before arriving at the site, indicating that alarm calls extended the information about the threat to following group members. This group size effect is in line with predictions of the volunteer's dilemma, a public goods game. We found no indications that individuals called specifically to warn ignorant individuals, kin or cooperation partners. Calling when information about the threat was not public allowed individuals to warn following group members while avoiding redundancy. Public goods games have not been employed widely in studies of the evolution of primate cooperation and animal communication in general but may provide useful models for understanding group level cooperation.

AB Animal contests are costly and predicted to be won by the individual with the higher resource-holding potential (RHP). Weight is often used a proxy for RHP; however, victory does not always go to the heaviest competitor, indicating that other traits may also contribute to RHP. Here we investigated the effect of preweaning play-fighting experience on postweaning contest behaviour in the domestic pig, Sus scrofa. We predicted that individuals that played more would win contests later in life. Play-fighting experience was also predicted to influence contest escalation behaviour, on both an individual and a dyadic level. Lastly, a pre-established framework and eight contest cost measures were used to establish whether competing individuals gather/use information regarding play-fighting experience as part of an assessment strategy. Play-fighting experience was recorded for socialized and control litters before weaning and contests were staged between unfamiliar pigs of the same treatment after weaning. Controlling for competitor weight difference revealed that increased play-fighting experience was linked to contest success in females, while the opposite pattern was found in males. Play-fighting experience did not influence which individual within the dyad escalated contest behaviour, but dyads containing more experienced losers were more likely to perform a stage of nondamaging aggression. When we used skin lesions in losers as a measure of contest cost, we found evidence for the role of play-fighting experience in a novel mutual assessment strategy in socialized dyads, whereas control dyads performed opponent-only assessment. We suggest that while assessments of RHP can be made using a physical correlate of play-fighting experience (such as skillfulness), early life socialization is required for individuals to gain an understanding of their own RHP.

AB Social network analysis provides valuable opportunities to quantify the nature of social relationships in animal societies including aspects of group structure, dynamics and behaviour transmission. Remote monitoring approaches such as camera trapping offer rich data sets from groups and species that are difficult to observe, yet the robustness of these data for constructing social networks remains unexplored. Here we compared networks of party association based on camera traps with those based on direct observations over the same 9-month sampling period in a group of habituated western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus. Networks based on camera traps and direct observations were both stable with sufficient sampling, and had very similar structures, patterns of sex assortment and individual network positions. However, camera trap data led to lower estimates of group density and dyadic association strengths, and slightly higher modularity, illustrating the limitations raised by differences in data collection methods for network comparisons. We then constructed a social network using camera trap data from unhabituated eastern chimpanzees, Rt. schweinfurthii, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach in the absence of extensive prior knowledge of the study subjects. Further, differences between the eastern and western chimpanzee social networks followed expected patterns based on recognized social differences, illustrating the promise of this approach for detecting within-species social variation. Although long-term behavioural observations will continue to provide rich data for many species, camera traps offer a powerful alternative to gain information on social group dynamics in elusive or unhabituated animals, as well as to conduct systematic multisite comparative studies.

AB Prey and ambush predators that rely on concealment face a major constraint: motion breaks their camouflage. However, dappled light is a common feature of sunny, vegetated habitats and can, when conditions are windy, become a source of dynamic visual noise. We tested the idea that this could mask movement, reducing the risk of detection. Newly hatched domestic fowl chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, a proxy for wild forest-floor birds, were trained to peck moving, on-screen prey presented among two sources of dynamic dappled light: computer-simulated and that created with a mirror ball. Dynamic dapple, however produced, increased the chick's latency to both fixate and peck the prey. Furthermore, we show that dynamic visual noise masks motion in a way that static visual noise does not. This reduction in foraging efficiency should, we predict, have significant consequences for an organism's choice of habitat (as prey), foraging area (as predator) and its pattern of movement within a habitat.

AB Animal species differ considerably in their ability to detour around a see-through obstacle to reach a goal positioned behind it. This variation is commonly assumed to derive from interspecific differences in the cognitive functions involved in the execution of the task, such as spatial abilities and inhibitory motor control. A teleost fish, the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, has recently been found to outperform many mammals and birds in this type of task. To determine whether this is a typical condition in teleost fish or whether detour abilities vary among fish species as observed in mammals and birds, we compared four distantly related teleosts in a transparent barrier task using a group of conspecifics as the goal. The scores of three species (Poecilia reticulata, Xenotoca eiseni, Oryzias sarasinorum) were similar to those previously reported for fish. The remaining species, the zebrafish, Danio rerio, showed a much higher performance, close to that of warm-blooded animals with the highest scores (e.g. corvids and monkeys). In comparative cognition studies, contextual variables rather than differences in cognitive ability may be responsible for observed differences between species. In a second experiment, we found that the four species were similarly gregarious, excluding a different motivation to reach the target as an explanation for the different performance. In another experiment, however, we found evidence that the zebrafish's higher detour performance might be due to a sensory advantage. Zebrafish used olfactory cues (towards which the barrier was opaque) to navigate to the social stimuli, whereas the guppy, which we used as a control species, preferentially relied on visual information. This study highlights the importance of sensory differences as a source of potential experimental confound in comparative cognition research.

AB Animal personalities and their degree of plasticity have been demonstrated to be adaptive and associated with ecologically important traits. While the concept is well established in a broad range of species, studies with free-ranging pinnipeds remain rare. Here we use a long-studied but declining population of Galapagos sea lions to demonstrate the existence of behavioural axes related to boldness in pups with respect to intrinsic and maternal traits. These sea lions reside in a habitat characterized by unpredictable environmental perturbations, which may select for differences in personality between individuals. We tested individual pups during two reproductive seasons (2017 and 2018) and elicited diverse yet repeatable responses to a novel object, which were associated with sex and age but not body mass differences. Responses to novel object and human approach tests were positively associated: pups that approached a novel object were also more likely to stay near humans. Maternal age and body size also affected variation in pups' responses, suggesting that fitness-relevant characteristics of mothers may influence pup personality. To determine how traits changed across time and contexts, we repeated the novel object test 1 year later in pups born in 2017 and with their mother present during both years. These traits remained repeatable and stable within the first year of life; however, shy pups showed plasticity by increasing their tendency to approach when with mothers, potentially due to maternal social support. We propose that personality in this species is likely to be relevant for coping strategies during later life history events within a changing environment.

AB Male alternative reproductive tactics typically consist of territorial and sneaking tactics. In substrate-brooding fishes, sneakers try to steal fertilizations by suddenly rushing towards females from outside the spawning sites, but they are usually caught through territorial vigilance before rushing. Nevertheless, attention is seldom paid to how sneakers overcome territorial vigilance, which limits the ecological and evolutionary understanding of alternative reproductive tactics. I addressed this issue in the triplefin blenny, Enneapterygius etheostoma, by analysing sneaker behaviour recorded in the wild. Prior to rushing, sneakers gradually got closer to the spawning sites while repeatedly pausing and moving forwards but spent most of their time pausing. They moved slowly for short distances. Territorial males detected about three-quarters of the sneaking attempts. A sneaker was detected usually immediately after starting to move, indicating that movement was a major cause of sneaking failure. Longer and faster movements were detected more frequently, particularly further from spawning sites. Movements were also detected more when territorial males faced towards, rather than away from, the sneakers. This suggests that both sneaker performance and the attentive state of territorial males affect sneaking success. Sneakers more frequently started moving from behind territorial males than from in front of them, and were then less frequently detected. In sum, sneakers seemed to conceal their movements through pause-travel locomotion, adjusting their movements and choosing favourable situations. Nevertheless, they were still detected by motion-sensitive territorial males. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The killing of conspecifics returns indirect benefits when killers eliminate competitors for resources, and direct benefits when cannibals obtain nutrients directly after killing. Cannibals risk pathogen infection and both killers and cannibals risk reducing their inclusive fitness when killing kin. When competing with kin over food during a prolonged period of starvation, we surmise that this cost-benefit ratio will stay almost constant for killers, as their benefits are indirect so that they direct killing away from kin (unless in extremis), but that this ratio will reduce over time for cannibals, as their benefits are direct, such that they will start consuming kin when food stressed. We tested this hypothesis using the maledimorphic bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini in which males are armed 'fighters' that can kill and cannibalize or unarmed 'scramblers'. In four-fighter groups that were either starved or fed for 2 weeks, and that comprised either kin (brothers) or nonkin (at most cousins), we assessed the number of dead and cannibalized fighters. The cumulative number of dead and cannibalized fighters was higher under starved than under fed conditions, and increased over time, rejecting our hypothesis. Instead, we found that fewer kin than nonkin were cannibalized, but fighters discriminated to a much lesser extent between kin and nonkin when killing. Hypothetically, cannibalism of kin incurs a greater risk of infection by pathogens to which cannibals are genetically susceptible. Our results highlight the importance of distinguishing killing from cannibalism, as they can have contrasting effects on the demography of populations.

AB Gathering information about the environment, such as the location and quality of food, is crucial for an animal's survival, particularly in a changing environment. An animal can collect 'personal information' by interacting with the environment itself, or it can collect 'social information' by observing the behaviour of others. The use of these two types of information varies across different situations and between individuals. Personality is a concept that captures consistent interindividual differences in behaviour and could be one of the factors driving interindividual variation in information use. We tested this by conducting behavioural experiments based on a colour association task in captive great tits, Parus major, originating from lines bidirectionally selected for high and low exploratory behaviour. We quantified personal information use by measuring to what extent a bird relied on previously rewarded options instead of novel options. Social information use was measured by recording how birds chose according to social information provided by video playbacks of a conspecific. Here, we demonstrate that variation in the use of both personal and social information is indeed personality related. In their decision making, slow explorers relied more on prior knowledge, from both personal and social origins, whereas fast explorers tended to ignore the available information and chose more randomly. The differences between the personality types imply different costs or constraints in acquiring and/or applying the two types of information, possibly due to variation in, for example, cognitive styles. In conclusion, we demonstrate that personality types have different strategies to cope with environmental uncertainty. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Larval-derived nutritional reserves are essential in shaping insects' adult fitness. Early larval instars of many Lepidopteran species are often sessile, and the conditions experienced by these larvae are often highly dependent on the mother's oviposition choice. Later larval stages are more mobile and therefore can choose their food whenever alternatives are available. We tested how feeding on a drought-exposed host plant impacts life history in an insect herbivore, and whether the observed responses depended on developmental stage. We used drought to alter host plant quality of the ribwort plantain, Plantago Ianceolata, and assessed whether host plant preference of postdiapause larvae and adult females increased their own or their offspring's performance, respectively, in the Glanville fritillary butterfly, Melitaea cinxia. Larval response to drought-exposed host plants varied with developmental stage: early larval stages (prediapause) had decreased survival and body mass on drought-exposed plants, while later larval stages (postdiapause) developed faster, weighed more and had a higher growth rate on the drought-exposed plants. Postdiapause larvae also showed a preference for drought-exposed host plants, i.e. those that increased their performance, but only when fed on well-watered host plants. Adult females, on the other hand, showed an oviposition preference for well-watered plants, hence matching the performance of their prediapause but not their postdiapause offspring. Our results highlight how variation in environmental conditions generates stage-specific responses in insects. Individuals fine-tune their own or their offspring's diet by behavioural adjustments when variation in host plant quality is available. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Behavioural assays in which animals recognize, localize or discriminate among signals are broadly useful for answering an array of biological questions, but results can be sensitive to the characteristics of individuals, including age and mating status. Researchers may prefer to use young, unmated individuals in experiments both to control for the effects of mating and because younger and unmated individuals may respond more often or more quickly. In natural contexts, virgin females are likely to behave differently than mated females, especially in animals that store sperm for future use, because the costs and benefits of mating are different for these two groups. In species in which multiple mating is common, individuals are much more likely to have mated at least once at the time of any given mating event than they are to be virgins, suggesting the use of virgin subjects in experiments is not reflective of most natural mating decisions. We conducted a literature review to sample the methods employed in empirical studies that use crickets in phonotaxis assays. Many studies draw conclusions based only on virgins, and methods vary widely with respect to the age of individual subjects. We then conducted an empirical study of the effect of mating status and age on female phonotaxis behaviour in Teleogryllus oceanicus, the Pacific field cricket. Our results show that both age and mating status affect some commonly used measures of female responsiveness in phonotaxis assays: older females begin moving more quickly in phonotaxis tests, while virgins have shorter response latencies. These findings are consistent with the idea that the cost of remaining unmated increases with age, and that virgin females benefit from an initial mating more than mated females benefit from additional matings.

AB In comparative visual cognition research, the influence of information acquired by nonvisual senses has received little attention. Systematic studies focusing on how the integration of information from sight and touch can affect animal perception are sparse. Here, we investigated whether tactile input improves visual discrimination ability of a bird, the kea, and capuchin monkeys, two species with acute vision, and known for their tendency to handle objects. To this end, we assessed whether, at the attainment of a criterion, accuracy and/or learning speed in the visual modality were enhanced by haptic (i.e. active tactile) exploration of an object. Subjects were trained to select the positive stimulus between two cylinders of the same shape and size, but with different surface structures. In the Sight condition, one pair of cylinders was inserted into transparent Plexiglas tubes. This prevented animals from haptically perceiving the objects' surfaces. In the Sight and Touch condition, one pair of cylinders was not inserted into transparent Plexiglas tubes. This allowed the subjects to perceive the objects' surfaces both visually and haptically. We found that both kea and capuchins ( 1) showed comparable levels of accuracy at the attainment of the learning criterion in both conditions, but ( 2) required fewer trials to achieve the criterion in the Sight and Touch condition. Moreover, this study showed that both kea and capuchins can integrate information acquired by the visual and tactile modalities. To our knowledge, this represents the first evidence of visuotactile integration in a bird species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the acquisition of tactile information while manipulating objects facilitates visual discrimination of objects in two phylogenetically distant species.

AB Group living is widespread in the animal kingdom and recent studies into the mechanisms underlying group cohesion and behavioural synchrony have highlighted the importance of between-individual behavioural differences ('animal personality'). In group-living animals, social conformity occurs when animals compromise their own behaviour to the level of a certain behaviour displayed by another individual or a group, and the degree to which individuals conform can depend upon interindividual differences in behavioural types. Social conformity can increase group cohesion and ultimately predator avoidance and/or resource acquisition for group-living individuals. However, it remains unclear whether similar conformity effects exist in solitary species, many of which form temporary aggregations and, if so, whether changes in behaviour in the presence of conspecifics are dependent on individuals' personalities in solitary contexts. We studied the effects of social context (i.e. the presence of a conspecific) on behaviour in solitary shore crabs, using automated video tracking. Individuals differed consistently in their activity levels within and across contexts and were significantly more active in solitary than dyadic contexts. No differences in activity between same- and opposite-sex dyads were found. Crabs' activity levels were more similar when tested together than when tested alone, indicating a social conformity effect. Furthermore, more active behavioural types decreased their activity to a greater extent when paired with a conspecific. The sex composition of the dyad had no effect on changes in activity. Overall, our findings suggest that social conformity is moderated by individual behavioural differences in a solitary organism. It is often presumed that, over evolutionary time, the social structure of animal populations has important consequences for the evolution of personalities and vice versa. We suggest that studying solitary or facultatively social organisms may allow researchers to tease out causality between personality differences and socioecological dynamics.

AB Leaders in democratic societies emerge by dint of followers, but the traits that determine who those leaders are, and the underlying mechanisms maintaining leadership, remain largely unknown. Models suggest a link between leadership and knowledge is important for group decisions, with more informed individuals guiding the uninformed majority. In larval aggregations of the Australian steel blue sawfly, Perga affinis, some individuals consistently lead the group on foraging trips more frequently than expected by chance. We manipulated both social group composition and the environment to determine in what circumstances leaders were retained within the aggregation. Leaders only resumed guiding group movement when they were familiar with (i.e. had knowledge of) the environment, a role they undertook even among unknown conspecifics. However, knowledgeable followers did not lead naive aggregations. These results emphasize the importance of knowledge and prior experience in maintaining the leadership role within larval aggregations. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male mate choice is an often neglected aspect of sexual selection studies. While theory predicts that females should exhibit mate choice due to their comparatively greater investment in gametes, males may also exhibit mate choice for a variety of reasons, including seeking mates with greater fecundity. Furthermore, males may exhibit discriminant or indiscriminate mate choice as a function of their own intrinsic characteristics, such as body size or condition. Here we experimentally evaluated male Jamaican field cricket, Gryllus assimilis, mating preferences using randomly selected females and determined how both male and female morphology (body size and residual mass) and male signalling behaviour influence male mate preference. Results show that male crickets exhibit mating preferences, with larger males tending to exhibit more consistent mate preferences than smaller males. Contrary to predictions, males did not prefer larger or relatively heavier females, suggesting that males may not be basing their choosiness on these proxy measures of female fecundity. Our findings highlight the need for continued research on male mate choice and identifying the intrinsic characteristics of both sexes that drive them.

AB Owing to trade-offs between investment in current and future reproduction, factors that diminish a parent's survival prospects, such as predation threat, are expected to increase investment in existing young. Nevertheless, effects of predation risk on parental investment have only rarely been examined, and not at all within the context of filial cannibalism ( parental consumption of their own offspring). We examined filial cannibalism and nest characteristics in a small fish with paternal egg care, the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, both when exposed to a common piscivore, the perch, Perca fluviatilis, and in the absence of predators. We found that when males consumed only some of their eggs ( partial filial cannibalism), the number of eaten eggs did not depend on predation threat, possibly indicating that partial clutch consumption is largely motivated by benefits to existing young. Total filial cannibalism ( whole clutch consumption) was marginally less common under predator exposure, while its strongest predictor was small clutch size. This suggests that the return on parental investment has a greater influence on total filial cannibalism than the likelihood of future breeding. Regarding nest architecture, males that consumed their entire brood after exposure to a predator built larger nest entrances, possibly to facilitate predator evasion. Males that cared for at least part of their brood, however, maintained small nest entrances regardless of predation threat. Furthermore, more elaborate nests were not associated with greater egg consumption, suggesting that filial cannibalism is not employed to sustain nest building.

   BIRDS
AB Birds often need to distinguish their own eggs from those of others or from other objects that could be confused with their eggs. Egg recognition occurs in a variety of birds that retrieve eggs displaced from the nest. Egg recognition and rejection is also a particularly widespread defence against brood parasites. We studied egg retrieval and rejection in the American coot, Fulica americana, a species with high levels of conspecific brood parasitism. Previous work revealed that hosts recognize and reject many parasitic eggs. We conducted experiments to determine whether coots also show egg retrieval behaviour and, if they do, whether the same cues trigger retrieval and rejection. If these two responses share the same general cognitive mechanism, a given egg phenotype should elicit the same retrieval and rejection response (with the realization that failure to retrieve is analogous to rejecting eggs). Coots retrieved many eggs and objects placed on their nest rims. All coot eggs were retrieved, including eggs of other conspecific females, and most chicken eggs were also retrieved. The retrieval of a moderate proportion of non-egg-shaped objects like cubes and cylinders shows that an egg shape is not essential for retrieval. Two observations suggest that egg retrieval and rejection are triggered by different cues. The non-retrieval rates of parasitic eggs differed significantly from the corresponding egg rejection rates obtained in an earlier study. Moreover, a moderate fraction of retrieved eggs and objects were subsequently rejected soon after being retrieved. The rejection of the same eggs that were previously retrieved into the nest underscores the remarkable sensitivity of retrieval and rejection decisions to slight changes in an egg's location; a difference of a few centimetres triggers a very different response mechanism. Overall, our findings suggest that selection from brood parasitism has not shaped the evolution of egg retrieval in coots. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Most animals possess multiple sensory systems, which can be used during navigation. Different senses obtain environmental information on different spatial scales and thus provide a different basis for efficient navigation. Here we used the weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii to investigate how different sensory inputs influence the navigational strategy and whether landmark information can be transferred flexibly between two sensory systems. Fish were trained to swim through a maze using a certain route indicated by either visual landmarks, electrical landmarks or without any landmarks. In subsequent tests, egocentric (internal cues, such as motion patterns) and allocentric cues (external cues like landmarks) were put in conflict by relocating the local landmarks. We found that all fish, independent of the available sensory input, chose the egocentric over the allocentric route. However, visual landmarks significantly improved the training duration compared to the other groups, suggesting an involvement of allocentric visual cues during route acquisition. In a second experimental series, fish were trained to use either visual or electrical landmarks for navigation and were subsequently tested in sensory transfer tests. Fish trained with visual landmarks were able to learn this allocentric navigation task and were capable of cross-modal landmark recognition, although navigation based on electrical landmarks was less efficient. The fish trained with electrical landmarks did not learn the task at all, suggesting that the short perceptual range of the electric sense prevented learning of allocentric navigation. Together our results show that the type of sensory input influences the efficiency of allocentric navigation in G. petersii and that these fish can use egocentric and allocentric strategies flexibly to navigate successfully under varying environmental conditions.

AB All organisms have specific habitat requirements that allow them to properly function in their environment. For many organisms, individuals shift habitat choice as they age because optimal habitats vary across life stages. Despite age-specific habitat use in a variety of taxa, identification of the causal factors driving such variation is limited by a lack of experimental studies. Field observations of the brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei, show that juveniles use low, narrow perches whereas adults use relatively higher and thicker perches. We hypothesized that this variation is driven by interactions between age classes, rather than age-specific preference for microhabitat. We manipulated adult and juvenile densities in field enclosures with artificial trees to examine how inter-age class competition influences microhabitat choice. We predicted that juveniles would move to less desired microhabitats as adult density increased (i.e. individual behavioural response) and/or adults would negatively affect juvenile survival (via competition or cannibalism) in ways that would contribute to age-specific habitat use (i.e. natural selection). We found that adult males, but not females, reduced juvenile survival. However, neither adult male nor female density influenced juvenile microhabitat choice (i.e. perch height, width or substrate) via individual behavioural response or natural selection. We also tested whether juveniles influence adult microhabitat choice. As predicted, adults did not vary in microhabitat choice in response to juvenile presence. Our study provides a rare and robust assessment of the role of age-and sex-specific density in generating variation in behaviour and survival under natural conditions.

AB Many fish species are social, and individuals spend most of their lives in shoals, but sociability can vary greatly between species, populations and individuals. Sociability has been largely studied by measuring the time spent by a focal fish in proximity to one or more conspecifics. To control for the behaviour of the stimulus fish, the conspecifics have often been substituted by a mirror, on the assumption that the subject perceives its mirror image as a conspecific. The validity of the mirror test has recently been questioned, at both the behavioural and the molecular level, because of the discrepancy in fish responses when exposed to a mirror image and to a live conspecific. In this study, we compared the sociability scores of a social fish, the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, obtained using live fish or a mirror as a stimulus, to assess the validity of the mirror test. We found that the sociability score assessed using the standard mirror test was not significantly correlated with the sociability assessed using live stimuli. Nevertheless, we observed a positive correlation between the scores of the two tests when the mirror test was performed in a more naturalistic context, controlling for the minimum distance between the stimulus fish and the mirror. Our findings provide evidence of the reliability of the mirror test as a measure of sociability compared to the test using live conspecifics when certain requirements are satisfied.

AB Animal personalities have been studied extensively in the last decade. It is still not entirely understood, however, how different personalities evolve and persist. The social niche specialization hypothesis suggests that in group-living animals the combination of social conflicts and alternative options on how to deal with them are of key importance for the development and evolution of animal personality. Here we predicted that, following the social niche specialization hypothesis, a more social species should have more pronounced personality differences. We tested this prediction using four species of shrews that differ in ecology and sociability. Three species (Neomys fodiens, Sorex araneus and Sorex minutus) are strictly solitary outside the breeding season; the fourth species (Neomys anomalus) is intraspecifically more tolerant and able to live in groups. These four species offer a good model to assess our questions as N. anomalus can, in many other respects (e.g. body size, habitat, foraging mode), be considered as an 'inbetween' species. We tested individuals of all species for their solitary activity and their activity and agonistic behaviour in within- and between-species dyadic encounters. We found that individuals of N. anomalus, but not the other species tested, showed consistent behavioural variation in agonistic behaviour. Consistent individual differences in activity were, however, also present in other species and activity was further correlated between the different contexts in all tested species. Finding more pronounced personality differences in N. anomalus than in the other, less sociable species supports the hypothesis that social niche specialization can influence the evolution of animal personalities.

AB Parental care strategies occupy a continuum from fixed investments that are consistent across contexts to flexible behaviour that largely depends on external social and environmental cues. Determining the flexibility of care behaviour is important, as it influences the outcome of investment games between multiple individuals caring for the same brood. We investigated the repeatability of provisioning behaviour and the potential for turn taking among breeders and helpers in a cooperatively breeding bird, the rifleman, Acanthisitta chloris. First, we examined whether nest visit rate is an accurate measure of investment by assessing whether carers consistently bring the same size of food, and whether food size is related to nest visit rate. Our results support the use of visit rate as a valid indicator of parental investment. Next, we calculated the repeatability of visit rate and food size to determine whether these behaviours are fixed individual traits or flexible responses to particular contexts. We found that riflemen were flexible in visit rate, supporting responsive models of care over ` sealed bids'. Finally, we used runs tests to assess whether individual riflemen alternated visits with other carers, indicative of turn taking. We found little evidence of any such coordination of parental provisioning. We conclude that individual flexibility in parental care appears to arise through factors such as breeding status and brood demand, rather than as a real-time response to social partners.

AB For most avian species, social behaviour is critically important for survival and reproductive success. Many social behaviours in birds are culturally transmitted, and as bird populations decline across the globe, important elements of these behaviours may be lost. The Hawaiian crow or 'alala, Corvus hawaiiensis, is a socially complex avian species that is currently extinct in the wild. As in other oscine passerines, vocalizations in the 'alala may be culturally transmitted. We compared the vocal repertoire of three of the last four wild 'alala pairs from the early 1990s to three current captive pairs on the Island of Hawai'i to determine how acoustic behaviour has been affected by changes in their social and physical environment. Over 18 h of recordings from wild breeding pairs were analysed and compared with 44 h from captive breeding pairs. Calls were placed into five putative behavioural categories: (1) alarm, (2) territorial broadcast, (3) aggression, (4) submission and (5) courtship. There was little difference in the overall number and diversity of call types among wild versus captive birds. However, the repertoire was significantly different. Territorial broadcast calls, common components of the wild repertoire, were absent from the captive repertoire. In addition, wild birds had twice the number of alarm calls and had a higher call rate than captive birds. Our results show how socially learned behaviours may change over relatively short periods for an entire species. Understanding how the vocal repertoire and the functional context of vocalizations change may provide useful information for ongoing efforts to reintroduce the 'alala into the wild.

AB Immigrant viability is a major determinant of the realized rate of gene flow across populations. For social organisms, the social context in which immigrants disperse across contrasting environments may have important implications for their viability post dispersal. Here, we use social spiders whose individual personalities as well as group personality compositions vary across sites to test whether the strength of selection against immigrants (i.e. mortality rates) differs depending on whether spiders are transplanted (1) as individuals and remain alone, (2) join pre-existing colonies at their new non-native environment, or (3) move with their native group. We also tested for an effect of individual personality on survival. We found that social context, and not individual personality, affects individual survival in foreign environments with contrasting resource levels. Individuals that were transplanted with their native groups suffered higher mortality rates compared to individuals transplanted as singletons, regardless of whether or not they were assimilated into native colonies. Moving as individuals could thus provide an avenue for ongoing gene flow among populations from different resource environments. We found no depressed performance of control colonies that were transplanted across sites with resource levels similar to each colony's site of origin. These results are at odds with the intuition that dispersing as a group should generally enhance the viability of immigrants, at least in social species. We propose that these results could be explained by a mismatch in the ideal group compositions (personality compositions) favoured in different environments, despite a lack of selection on individual personality traits. These results provide a first glimpse into the relative roles of individual personality and social context in mediating gene flow among populations from divergent environments.

AB Habitat loss, climate change, hunting perturbation, disease, invasive species, guild structure disruption and conflict are seven widespread threats to wildlife conservation, with the Carnivora standing at the apex of risk. Fundamental to all of these is the ability of organisms and ecosystems to adapt, else succumb, and it is the extent to which their behaviour is flexible and adaptable that may stand between viability and extinction. Knowledge gained through undertaking original research on aspects of fundamental biology and behaviour assists practitioners and policy makers in the management of conservation problems. Selecting examples of these seven threats from our projects at the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU), I identify the conservation issue concerned, and then explore the behavioural component and its relevance to mitigating that conservation issue. Social systems, demography, life histories, habitat selection, foraging and patch choice, the Allee effect, conspecific attraction, movement, ranging and dispersal are pervasive behavioural elements common across various conservation issues that determine why some populations decline and what can be done to remedy the situation. However, the overarching principle remains the same: effective action requires an understanding of the behaviour of the species concerned. Conservation is most exciting and most difficult at two ends of a continuum: the earthiness of animal lives, human livelihoods and practical action, and the erudition of big ideas, from individual behaviours to the consequences for populations and, ultimately, geopolitical decisions about how humans are to live alongside nature with the wellbeing of both as goals.

AB Experiments have shown that captive great apes are capable of observational learning, and patterns of cultural variation between populations suggest that they use this capacity in the wild. So far, the contexts and extent of observational forms of social learning in the wild remain unclear. Social learning is expected to be most pronounced during the skill acquisition of immature individuals. We therefore examined peering (attentive close range watching) by immatures in two populations of wild orangutans, Pongo spp. We found, first, that peering was most frequent in contexts in which learning is expected, namely feeding and nest building. Second, peering in the feeding context was significantly positively correlated with complexity of food processing and negatively with an item's frequency in the mother's diet. Food peering was also followed by significantly increased rates of exploratory behaviours targeting the same food items, indicating that it leads to selective practice. Food peering also decreased with age and increasing feeding competence of the immatures. Third, the age of peak peering in the nesting context coincided with the onset of nest practice behaviour, and peering events were followed by significantly increased rates of this behaviour. Fourth, the proportion of peering directed at other individuals rather than the mother increased with age. These findings are consistent with the prediction that immature orang-utans learn by observing others in a variety of contexts and that peering is followed by selective practice of the observed behaviour. We conclude that observational social learning in combination with socially induced practice over a period of several years is a critical component of the acquisition of learned subsistence skills in orang-utans.

AB Knowledge of which cues attract birds back to natal areas is important for conservation because the cues could be manipulated to attract breeders to source habitat or discourage breeders from settling in sink habitat. We examined the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic variables on natal philopatry using two metrics, short-distance natal dispersal and the probability of philopatry to the natal field, in two obligate-grassland bird species breeding in an agricultural landscape: the bobolink, Dolichonyx oryzivorus, and the Savannah sparrow, Passerculus sandwichensis. During 2002-2014, we detected 90 locally hatched Savannah sparrows and 129 locally hatched bobolinks breeding as adults near their places of origin (mean +/- SD dispersal distances: Savannah sparrows: 917 +/- 851 m; bobolinks: 1251 +/- 839 m). For both species, the location of the field on which they bred relative to fields where annual productivity was greater than replacement best explained variation in natal dispersal distance. The probability a Savannah sparrow was philopatric to its natal field increased if it fledged later in the season, while this probability decreased if there was an opposite-sex parent or sibling present on the natal field, or the field was under a late-hay management scheme. None of the variables considered explained variation in bobolink natal philopatry. Natal philopatry and short-distance natal dispersal in these species appear to be influenced by factors that are difficult to manage; however, land managers should attempt to keep management consistent across time to reduce misinformation in dispersal cues.

AB In many vertebrate mating systems, mate choice evolves when signalling via visual, chemical or auditory traits is an energetically costly process. Selection may favour individuals that can discriminate among potential mates and invest in signalling to mates with particular characteristics. Most commonly, females with costly gametes are thought to be the more selective sex; however, runaway sexual selection can produce elaborate male ornaments and behaviours that are similarly costly to produce, which can lead to male mate choice. In this study, we used behavioural trials to experimentally test male mate choice in a terrestrial salamander, Plethodon shermani. We investigated whether males altered the proportion of time they spent performing a potentially costly courtship display, 'foot dancing', in the presence of females. Specifically, we explored male mate choice in two experiments: (1) measuring how males modified the time they invested in courtship based solely on female reproductive value, and (2) determining whether males varied the amount of time they invested in courting females of varying sizes but similar reproductive value. In the first experiment, we quantified the duration of male courtship displays when males were paired with females of differing levels of fecundity (nongravid, weakly gravid and strongly gravid). Males displayed longest for females of high reproductive value (strongly gravid females) and less for weakly gravid and nongravid females. In the second experiment, we showed that males paired sequentially with different-sized females of similar reproductive values displayed significantly more often to larger females (i.e. male effort positively correlated with female size). In conclusion, male P. shermani are one of the few vertebrates known to modify their display behaviour based on female mate quality, and visual signs, such as size, may provide honest indicators of fitness.

AB In multimale multifemale primate groups, the strength and stability of affiliative relationships have been shown to affect an individual's long-term fitness such as offspring survival and longevity. Studies investigating the fitness benefits of close social relationships and the underlying mechanisms have mainly focused on the philopatric sex. The strong relationships of philopatric chimpanzee males and baboon females share important characteristics with human friendships in that increased strength of affiliative relationships is associated with increased equitability in service exchanges and relationship stability. So far, it has remained unclear whether the strong relationships of dispersing males share these characteristics as well and can thus be labelled as social bonds. Here we provide results on the variation in affiliative relationship strength and its relation to equitability and relationship stability from two wild groups of male Assamese macaques, Macaca assamensis, at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand collected over 2 and 7 years, respectively. Our analyses of almost 9000 h of focal animal data show that males formed differentiated affiliative relationships and that the strength of a relationship affected how likely males returned a grooming service within a single bout and how equally males were responsible for the maintenance of close proximity. Partner stability among the three strongest relationships was higher than among weaker relationships which suggests that top partners were not retained simply because of a lack of alternatives. Together, these results suggest that dispersing male Assamese macaques form differentiated affiliative relationships that increase in equitability and stability with increasing relationship strength. This is the first study showing long-term partner stability in males as the dispersing sex. Our results thus add to the growing body of literature indicating that nonhuman animals form close social relationships similar to human friendships. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Whether begging behaviour mediates food provisioning has been extensively studied in birds. However, begging behaviour occurs without direct offspring competition in some species and thus may be driven exclusively by intrabrood dynamics. We studied begging behaviour of individually housed offspring of the biparental mimic poison frog Ranitomeya imitator. We tested whether (1) begging is an honest signal of need or hunger, (2) begging is costly and (3) parents allocate food according to offspring need. Under manipulation of long-term diet, food-limited tadpoles increased begging effort over the course of development. Tadpoles that were induced to beg suffered a cost of taking longer to reach developmental stages and showed a marginal cost on growth rate. Finally, parents were more likely to feed the tadpole that was exposed to a nonsupplemented diet over its food-supplemented sibling. In R. imitator, begging behaviour appears to signal offspring need honestly and thus may predict differential food provisioning among offspring.

AB Plastic behavioural responses by individuals to different conditions and consistent individual differences in mean behaviour across situations both contribute to variation in a population. The relationship between behavioural plasticity and consistent individual differences is not clearly understood but may help predict personality variation in animals. High variation in mean behaviour and low variation in individual plastic responses will tend to maintain the rank order of individuals across situations and so permit consistent individual differences. Conversely, low variation in mean behaviour and high variation in plastic responses, by changing the rank orders of individuals, will erode consistent individual differences. Thus, selection that reduces variation in individual plastic responses should increase the opportunity for consistent individual differences in a population. We tested for relationships between heterogeneous predation regimes, the mean and variance of behavioural plasticity and consistent individual differences among three species groups of larval damselflies. Larvae of Enallagma signatum probably face consistent predation from fish over successive generations, whereas Enallagma ebrium/hageni and Enallagma annexum/boreale face a changing predation regime over generations either from fish or larval dragonflies. The behavioural reaction norms of larvae in repeated exposure trials to cues from a predatory fish, dragonfly larvae or no predator differed between species groups. Enallagma ebrium/hageni expressed the most consistent plastic response to predator cues, less variability in plasticity and greater consistent individual differences across cues compared to more variable plastic responses and low consistent individual differences in E. signatum. Selection on behavioural plasticity may enhance consistent individual differences in E. ebrium/hageni whereas relaxing selection on plasticity may reduce consistent individual differences in E. signatum. More generally, selection on plastic behaviour may enhance behavioural types while selection on mean behaviour may reduce behavioural types in animal populations.

AB The songs of many songbird species vary geographically, yet, the songs of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, show remarkable consistency across most of the species' North American range. Previous research has described subtle variations in the song of this species by comparing songs produced by males at distant parts of the species' range (British Columbia and Ontario). In the current study, we used an operant discrimination task to examine whether birds classify the songs produced by males in these two previously studied locations as belonging to distinct open-ended categories. In both experiments, when birds were presented with new songs, they continued to respond to songs from the same geographical location as the songs that were reinforced during initial discrimination training, suggesting that birds were using open-ended categorization. We also presented birds with songs in which we manipulated acoustic features in order to examine the acoustic mechanisms used during discrimination; results provide support that birds use the duration of the song when discriminating, but the results also suggest that birds used additional acoustic features. Taken together, these experiments show that black-capped chickadees classify songs into open-ended, geography-based categories, and provide compelling evidence that perceptible acoustic differences exist in a vocalization that is seemingly consistent across the species' range.

AB Noise pollution is a world-wide phenomenon and its effects on animal behaviour have been investigated by numerous studies focusing mostly on vertebrate taxa. However, studying how insects are impacted by human-made noise is indispensable, because of their ecological importance and in order to gain a more comprehensive knowledge of how animals can cope with this new challenge. The few studies that have examined the effects of noise pollution on the acoustic signalling of insects have characterized noise over long timescales. In this study we examined whether males of the tree cricket Oecanthus pellucens modify their calling song in response to the fluctuation in traffic noise over a short timescale. To examine this question we carried out (1) noise level measurements over a short time window (200 ms) paired with song parameter measurements on sound recordings of males singing in their noise-polluted habitats and (2) laboratory playback experiments in which each singing male was recorded during a silent control period and during noise playback. Our results show that males shortened their calls (echemes) and paused singing with a higher probability with increasing noise level. However, males did not modify the fundamental frequency of their song and did not adjust the duration of the interecheme interval in response to noise. These results suggest that crickets decrease signalling effort during high levels of noise and, at least for the song parameters we examined, do not modify their signals, as do birds and frogs, to reduce masking by anthropogenic noise.

AB Contact cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are one of the major cues that allow many insects to identify interspecific and intraspecific variation between individuals, and often have mutually nonexclusive functions that can provide multiple types of signals. A previous study showed that two sympatric, closely related Altica beetles achieve behavioural isolation via species-specific CHC profiles. Here, we explored whether these CHCs also play a role in recognition of intraspecific variation. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that differences in CHCs are a critical mating cue that allows males to discriminate the sex and age (sexual maturity) of females. We used CHC profile analysis and behavioural assays to examine mating cues in three closely related flea beetles, Altica cirsicola, Altica fragariae and Altica viridicyanea (Insecta: Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). The results showed that (1) CHC profiles are sex and age specific, (2) male beetles can distinguish males from females and can also distinguish sexually mature females from immature ones and (3) CHCs are only one component of mate discrimination as additional cues also appear to be involved.

AB The pace-of-life hypothesis predicts that among-individual differences in behaviour should integrate with a wide variety of morphological, metabolic and life-history traits along a slow to fast pace-of-life continuum. Support for the pace-of-life hypothesis has been mixed, in part because most empirical tests have been conducted strictly at the phenotypic level and have thus conflated genetic and environmental sources of covariance among traits. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that, according to the predictions of the pace-of-life hypothesis, body mass, routine metabolic rate, activity and exploratory propensity are positively integrated in the house cricket Acheta domesticus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Using modified open field behavioural tests and flow-through respirometry, we determined whether among-individual differences are correlated across morphology, behaviour and metabolism in 50 male house crickets. All traits were repeatable, but we found poor evidence for overall integration across traits. Instead we found evidence for modularity, with behavioural traits covarying independently from mass and routine metabolic rate. Modularity, like that found here between activity and exploratory propensity, has been suggested to facilitate adaptive evolutionary change by coupling functionally related traits into suites on which selection can act more rapidly.

AB Group coordination and the synchronization of activities are essential to maintain group cohesion during collective movements. Collective decisions arising from this synchronization are influenced by both ecological and sociodemographic factors. The spatial heterogeneity and temporal predictability of resources not only affect fission-fusion dynamics and patterns of movement, but also influence leadership processes. However, herd movements may also be affected by the propensity of certain individuals to initiate movements through individual characteristics such as sex and dominance. In this study, we examined how members of a European bison herd living in fission-fusion dynamics decide to move, and how they synchronize their nonforaging movements. Adult females appeared to initiate the majority of movements, while juveniles rarely did so. The number of followers for a collective movement was directly influenced by the sex and age of the initiator. Other factors also influenced the number of followers, such as the orientation and dispersion state of the herd. The initiator was more likely to be followed if it went in the direction indicated by the majority of individuals, suggesting a voting process. Subgroups of individuals joined movements using a mimetic process, confirming the fission-fusion dynamics of this species. The results of this study put a new slant on our understanding of the ecology and sociality of the European bison. In view of recent conservation studies suggesting that human-wildlife conflict could be avoided by controlling animal groups and particularly their leaders, our study could be an effective tool in the management of this species after reintroduction.

AB In the short-term, reproductive expenditure has repercussions for survival and future reproductive output. In long-lived seabirds, parents are expected to adjust their reproductive investment based on their physiological and immune status and then respond to the needs of their offspring without incurring additional costs. However, the impacts of parental expenditures on physiological and immune status have not been well explored. We compared the foraging effort (number and duration of foraging trips), time at nest and physiological status (plasma metabolites, heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, creatine kinase (CK) activity) and body condition index (BCI) of blue-footed boobies subjected to experimentally increased or decreased breeding demands. When parental reproductive demands were increased, adults made more foraging trips and decreased their time at the nest. The increases in adult physical activity were reflected in higher levels of creatine kinase/total protein (CK/TP, U/g) and higher H/L ratios, indicating that adjustments in foraging effort were reflected in their physiological status. When parental reproductive demands were reduced, parents adjusted their level of effort according to the lower needs of their offspring; as a result, their overall physiological status was greater than that of the controls, showing lower CK/TP levels and H/L ratios. Our findings indicate that parents modified their foraging effort in response to variation in the food demands of the brood to maintain reproductive value, but this adjustment had consequences for physiological status in both costs and benefits. Blue-footed boobies inhabit upwelling systems where they experience high environmental variability throughout their life span. Thus, the ability to adjust breeding effort may buffer breeding success under different scenarios, with short-term physiological expenditures possibly related to long-term survival.

AB Quantifying how animal vocalizations vary is central to understanding their function and evolution. One commonly documented feature of mammalian calls is the systematic variation in amplitude across call types. Despite a large body of existing data, there has been little attempt to assess how common calls of varying amplitude are in mammals, how broadly they are distributed at the taxonomic level, and whether similarities in context and structure across species can inform our understanding of the selective pressures promoting the evolution of amplitude variation. Here, we perform a comparative survey of amplitude variation in adult vocal repertoires from 47 species belonging to nine mammalian orders. Our data set demonstrates that low-, medium- and high- amplitude calls are not restricted to certain mammalian groups but occur widely across taxa. Furthermore, contextual analyses indicate that there are consistent differences in the contexts that accompany low-, medium- and high-amplitude calls. Specifically, we found that high-amplitude calls are reported to occur more often in agonistic and alarm-related contexts and less often in affiliative social contexts compared to low- and medium-amplitude calls. In addition, acoustic comparisons indicate that calls of varying amplitude are divergent in terms of underlying call structure. Our findings suggest that low-amplitude calls are shorter in duration and lower in frequency than medium- and high-amplitude calls. We compare and contrast our findings with similar recent approaches investigating amplitude variation in birds and discuss the implications our findings have for unpacking the adaptive significance of amplitude variation in animals more generally.

AB Age-specific differences in individual performance are reported in a number of taxa and are particularly well documented in humans. However, such data are generally lacking for birds, the taxon showing exceptionally long life in relation to body size. Here, we studied differences in vertical flight performance among three distinctive age classes (0.5-, 2- and 4.5-year-old birds) in laboratory-kept zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. We found that take-off flight speed differed significantly between the age classes with the oldest birds being ca. 10% slower than the youngest birds. Age classes also differed significantly in flight motivation, with old birds tending to be less motivated to fly than young ones. Thus, the age-specific decline in flight performance is clearly visible in zebra finches. In a broader perspective, poorer flight performance may impair foraging efficiency, social interactions and, most importantly, takeoff speed when escaping predators. This may help elucidate age-specific decline in reproductive and survival rates commonly observed in natural populations. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Acoustic signalling is a taxonomically widespread form of animal communication consisting of longrange, high-amplitude signals and short-range, low-amplitude signals. Research on acoustic communication has emphasized high-amplitude signals and often overlooked low-amplitude signals, even though they are produced in behavioural contexts that directly influence fitness. Low-amplitude signals are referred to by a variety of names such as soft songs, courtship songs, whispers, close calls, contact calls, grunts and moans, but all of these signals share a reduced amplitude and an active space that is limited to close-proximity receivers. In this review, we establish a general definition for low-amplitude signals and investigate the similarities and differences between low-and high-amplitude signals with respect to their acoustic structure and function. Then, we critically evaluate some proximate and ultimate evolutionary mechanisms that may explain why these signals are produced at low amplitude using examples from a variety of taxa. We conclude by suggesting priorities for future research on low-amplitude signals and highlighting how studying these signals will lead to a more complete understanding of how and why animals communicate acoustically.

AB Animal personality, i.e. stable individual differences in behaviour, is considered to be subject to evolutionary processes, as it has been shown to be heritable and to entail fitness consequences. Different hypotheses have been developed to explain why personality variation is maintained within populations, most likely via processes of balancing selection. One mechanism discussed is that combinations of similar personalities within breeding pairs could increase fitness. We investigated this purported mechanism by studying the association between personality combinations within nulliparous pairs and their onset of reproduction in a monogamous rodent, the mound-building mouse, Mus spicilegus. In seasonal iteroparous breeders, reproductive timing is relevant to fitness, as a delayed onset of breeding potentially limits the number of breeding occasions and lowers the chance that offspring will start reproducing during the same season. Repeated standardized tests carried out prior to pairing revealed consistent individual differences in subjects' behavioural responses with respect to anxiety and exploratory activity, indicating the existence of personality types. Within-pair similarity in anxiety levels affected the chance of reproduction: pairs with similar anxiety scores had a higher probability of breeding, and were quicker to start, during the observation period, independently of the scores of both partners of the pair. We propose that this association between 'personality matching' and the onset of reproduction could have important life history consequences in this species and might be one of the mechanisms leading to the maintenance of personality variation within populations.

AB Animals frequently compete over limited resources such as food, territories or mating opportunities. Contest behaviour varies based on factors such as the value of the contested resources and the agonistic ability of rivals. Much work on animal contests has examined aggression, but vigilance, or a state of heightened alertness directed towards specific stimuli, may also be an important component of competition in many species. In this study, we measure the relationships among social vigilance, aggression, agonistic ability and resource value during staged contests over nest ownership in Polistes dominula nest-founding wasps. Our results show that both social vigilance and aggression are involved in mediating social risk during contests. Nest owner vigilance towards a rival increased with the time of season, a measure of nest value. Owner vigilance was also positively associated with aggression such that more aggressive owners were more vigilant. During contests, aggression of owners and rivals was influenced by different factors. Owner aggression was positively associated with nest size, another measure of nest value, while rival aggression was unrelated to nest size. Instead, rival aggression was associated with facial patterns that function as signals of agonistic ability; rivals were less aggressive to owners that signalled high agonistic ability than they were to owners that signalled low agonistic ability. The distinct predictors of contest behaviour between owners and rivals indicate that competitive role has a surprisingly strong influence on cues used to inform contest behaviour. Differences may occur because owners and rivals have different information and/or motivation. These results also suggest that social vigilance and aggression may be complementary behaviours that animals use to mitigate social threat. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Prenatal breeding conditions have broad influences on maternal allocation to reproduction which can strongly affect future begging behaviours of offspring. The social environment is part of the prenatal environment; however, its influence on maternal allocation has been poorly investigated and experimental tests linking prenatal conditions to begging behaviour have seldom been conducted. In cooperative breeders the presence of additional carers, the helpers, generally predicts an increase in provisioning during the nestling stage. Since begging is costly, in these species producing offspring that beg less in the presence of helpers may be a way of saving energy not only for the offspring but also for the future survival and reproduction of females. To date, whether mothers may manipulate begging behaviour in relation to helper presence is unstudied. We conducted a cross-fostering experiment in a cooperatively breeding bird, the sociable weaver, Philetairus socius, to disentangle the possible effects of prenatal and postnatal environments on begging behaviour. Pre- and postnatal environments correspond here to the number of carers in the nest of origin and the foster nest, respectively. As predicted, begging was influenced by the prenatal environment, with nestlings originally from larger groups begging less. In addition, chicks fed by more foster birds also begged at a lower rate. We conclude that the prenatal environment influences begging behaviour. This result has important implications for understanding cooperative breeding strategies since producing offspring that beg less with more helpers may allow energy savings for females and related offspring and helpers.

AB Social dynamics are of fundamental importance in animal societies. Studies on nonhuman animal social systems often aggregate social interaction event data into a single network within a particular time frame. Analysis of the resulting network can provide a useful insight into the overall extent of interaction. However, through aggregation, information is lost about the order in which interactions occurred, and hence the sequences of actions over time. Many research hypotheses relate directly to the sequence of actions, such as the recency or rate of action, rather than to their overall volume or presence. Here, we demonstrate how the temporal structure of social interaction sequences can be quantified from disaggregated event data using the relational event model (REM). We first outline the REM, explaining why it is different from other models for longitudinal data, and how it can be used to model sequences of events unfolding in a network. We then discuss a case study on the European jackdaw, Corvus monedula, in which temporal patterns of persistence and reciprocity of action are of interest, and present and discuss the results of a REM analysis of these data. One of the strengths of a REM analysis is its ability to take into account different ways in which data are collected. Having explained how to take into account the way in which the data were collected for the jackdaw study, we briefly discuss the application of the model to other studies. We provide details of how the models may be fitted in the R statistical software environment and outline some recent extensions to the REM framework.

AB Social animals rely heavily on social cues to make foraging decisions. In social insects such as ants, perceived use of paths by nestmates is an important cue which allows ants to adjust foraging behaviours. Ants that encounter other ants on a trail reduce trail pheromone deposition. This has been predicted to allow ants to preferentially select underused paths, and thus avoid overcrowding. Here we tested this hypothesis by providing ants with two identical paths to a feeder. On the treatment path we placed 10 'dummy ants', i.e. glass beads coated in nestmate cuticular hydrocarbons, and on the control path 10 untreated beads. Contrary to expectations, ant colonies preferentially chose the treatment path. This preference was unrelated to pheromone deposition, as it arose before any pheromone was deposited. Ants performed more U-turns on the control path, and thus were more likely to switch paths if they entered the control path. Path preference disappeared when three of the untreated beads on the control path were replaced by dummy ants, demonstrating that it is the perceived absence of nestmates on a path, not the relative path use, that drives colony-level preference. By preferentially using paths containing nestmates, ants may benefit from increased information transfer and recruitment potential. The presence of nestmates on a path coupled with a lack of alarm pheromones may be a 'reassurance' that the path is safe and productive. Although ants have various mechanisms for coping with trail crowding, they in fact prefer paths that are already in use. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Vigilance in prey species can serve many purposes, including predator detection and monitoring other group members, and is generally thought to impose a cost due to reduced food intake. However, previous studies have shown that herbivores are able to reduce the foraging cost of vigilance by chewing their food during vigilance bouts ('vigilance with chewing', as compared to 'vigilance without chewing'). How predation risk, food availability and competition affect both the functions and the foraging costs of vigilance remains an open question. We studied female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, during winter and summer, when available food supplies were poor and rich, respectively, to investigate how group size, distance to cover, proximity between foragers and food patch quality affected decisions of foraging female kangaroos to exhibit antipredator or social vigilance, distinguishing vigilance with and without chewing. The use of antipredator vigilance was mainly driven by the perception of predation risk, and antipredator vigilance without chewing decreased with increased group size whereas antipredator vigilance with chewing increased nonlinearly with group size in winter. Distance to cover affected both forms of antipredator vigilance in summer only but there was no effect of nearest-neighbour distance. Social vigilance was affected positively by group size, and distance between foragers affected social vigilance without chewing positively, particularly in winter, and social vigilance with chewing negatively. Finally, patch quality increased the use of social vigilance with chewing in both seasons and decreased the use of antipredator vigilance with chewing in winter. This study provides new information on how animals make decisions about the functions and foraging costs of vigilance and allows a better understanding of how social foragers respond to an ever-changing environment.

AB Mate guarding is one of the most common tactics in sperm competition. Males are expected to guard their mates when costs of guarding (accrued from physical confrontations with rivals and/or reduced foraging) are low relative to the benefits of ensuring mating opportunities and paternity. We investigated mate guarding in the jumping spider Phidippus clarus, a species where males defend immature subadult females against rival males and attempt to mate with the females soon after they mature. We assessed a possible social cost of mate-guarding behaviour (male intersexual signalling) using laser vibrometry and respirometry. We found that males produced a unique set of signals when guarding subadult females and that these signals were energetically costly (guarding courtship). Mating success did not differ between males that successfully defended a subadult female and males that located an unmated, mature virgin female. This suggests that guarding courtship does not directly influence mate choice and that males may use different tactics depending on female availability to ensure fitness. To explore further the effect of mate guarding and guarding courtship, we experimentally sealed male's copulatory organs (males could guard normally but were unable to transfer sperm) and compared mating rates of sealed versus intact males. We found that guarding behaviour, and not sperm transfer, significantly influenced female remating behaviour. Placed in the context of P. clarus life history, our results highlight the ongoing sexual conflict between males and females and the hidden costs and benefits of mate-guarding behaviour.

AB The addressing of individuals with learned signals is inherent to human social interactions. It allows individuals to solicit the attention of a particular social companion or to direct information towards an intended recipient. The ability to address individual conspecifics with learned signals is not limited to humans, however. In songbirds, the selective addressing of individuals is facilitated by song type matching but is very much a signal of aggressive intent. The matching of learned signals is also observed in bottlenose dolphins, which will match one another's highly individualized signature whistle. Copying in dolphins occurs between close associates, which suggests that it is an affiliative signal. It could, however, also serve to manage aggression. We investigated the valence of signature whistle matching by performing interactive playback experiments. We waited until an animal produced its signature whistle and then either played back a synthetic version of its own whistle (match) or a different signature whistle (control). A total of 110 playback experiments were conducted with seven different animals from two managed groups of dolphins. The responses to the playback treatments were significantly different. Animals produced a consistent vocal response to being vocally matched, by returning the match, with no associated signal of aggression and did not respond to control playbacks in the same way. There was also an optimum time interval (<1 s) in which a match was most successful in eliciting a vocal response. Our results show that signature whistle matching is an affiliative signal that allows bottlenose dolphins to address social companions. Furthermore, these matching exchanges are driven by temporal associations, which appear to be essential in allowing animals to direct signals to particular individuals in large communication networks.

AB Collective behaviours are influenced by the behavioural composition of the group. For example, a collective behaviour may emerge from the average behaviour of the group's constituents, or be driven by a few key individuals that catalyse the behaviour of others in the group. When ant colonies collectively relocate to a new nest site, there is an inherent trade-off between the speed and accuracy of their decision of where to move due to the time it takes to gather information. Thus, variation among workers in exploratory behaviour, which allows gathering information about potential new nest sites, may impact the ability of a colony to move quickly into a suitable new nest. The invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, expands its range locally through the dispersal and establishment of propagules: groups of ants and queens. We examine whether the success of these groups in rapidly finding a suitable nest site is affected by their behavioural composition. We compared nest choice speed and accuracy among groups of all-exploratory, all-nonexploratory and half-exploratoryehalf-nonexploratory individuals. We show that exploratory individuals improve both the speed and accuracy of collective nest choice, and that exploratory individuals have additive, not synergistic, effects on nest site selection. By integrating an examination of behaviour into the study of invasive species we shed light on the mechanisms that impact the progression of invasion.

AB Kin recognition is important in allowing cooperative breeders to invest preferentially in helping kin, especially when helping is not restricted to the natal territory. Where spatial cues are not reliable indicators of kinship, animals can use family signatures, which may be learned or genetic. Alternatively, they can use unique signatures that are learned via prior experience in a context that identifies specific individuals as kin. Here we investigate sharing of song types between related and unrelated male western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, a cooperatively breeding songbird that lives in neighbourhoods composed of a mix of kin and nonkin. Helpers only assist in raising close kin, including parents as well as brothers and grandfathers living on non-natal territories. In a previous study, we demonstrated that western bluebird males are able to recognize related males through their songs. Here we ask whether this kin recognition is based on song sharing within a family or whether western bluebird song sharing is primarily with neighbouring birds regardless of relatedness. The results indicate that western bluebirds often share with related and unrelated neighbours alike, and they rarely share any notes with non-neighbouring birds, whether they are related or unrelated. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of kin signatures that were not measurable using tools currently available for detecting vocal similarity, our findings suggest that kin recognition through song does not rely on note sharing with relatives and that western bluebirds use a more broadly applicable mechanism of vocal kin recognition compared to other cooperative breeders.

DT Article
DE alternative mating tactics; conditional strategy; fighter; male-male
   competition; mating; sneaker; Tetranychus urticae
ID STRATEGIES; EVOLUTION; TACTICS; SUCCESS
AB Alternative male mating tactics occur in many taxa, and usually include sneaking behaviour. Typically, sneaking behaviour is expressed by less competitive males to avoid fighting over females guarded by stronger males and to increase their mating chances, but in theory it can be expressed by any male as long as it improves his future reproduction. Recently, we characterized fighting and sneaking behaviour in males of the two-spotted spider mite that guard females during their preadult moulting stage. Sneaking behaviour involves not responding to rival males to avoid eliciting attack, whereas fighting behaviour involves challenging all rivals. To understand these alternative precopulatory behaviours from a life history perspective, we investigated (1) their heritability, and how they are affected by (2) male density, (3) male age and (4) competition between males differing in age. We established genetic lines for fighting or sneaking by crossing a male that displayed fighting or sneaking behaviour with one of his daughters. In fourth-generation males from these lines, however, the proportions of fighting and sneaking behaviour were not significantly different. The frequency of sneaking behaviour increased with male density, yet decreased with male age. Old males always displayed fighting and rarely lost females they guarded to young males, whereas young fighting males lost females to old rival males more frequently than young sneaking males. Of the young fighting males that did not lose the female they guarded to old males, about 40% switched to sneaking. We conclude that alternative male mating behaviours in this mite are not maintained as a genetic polymorphism, but arise from phenotypic plasticity in response to the male's environment (male density) and its own condition (age). We hypothesize that young males opt for sneaking behaviour because fighting jeopardises their future reproduction. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In 1964, W. D. Hamilton proposed a novel solution to the long-standing evolutionary puzzle: why do individuals cooperate? Hamilton predicted that, if individuals possess the ability to discriminate on the basis of kinship, then they should gain inclusive fitness benefits by biasing helpful behaviour towards relatives and harmful behaviour away from them. The possibility that kin selection might favour social evolution has now inspired five decades of active research. Here, I synthesize this evidence for social mammals. First, I report on the methodological advances that allow for pedigree construction, and review the evidence for maternal and paternal kin discrimination. Second, I recognize that a substantial body of evidence for the evolution of cooperative breeding via kin selection exists, and then focus on the potential for kin selection to favour less well understood, yet equally salient, targets of selection: social partner choice, coalition formation and social tolerance (withholding aggression). I find that kin selection favours remarkably similar patterns of nepotism in primate and nonprimates with respect to these short-lived social acts. Although social alliances among maternal and paternal kin are common in mammalian societies, kinship largely fails to protect individuals from aggression. Thus, an individual's closest associates and allies, many of whom are kin, are most often an individual's closest competitors within mammalian social groups. Taken together, these findings highlight the value of Hamilton's holistic approach in simultaneously considering the direct benefits of competition and the indirect fitness benefits of cooperation. Despite major empirical advances since the inception of kin selection theory, future tests using newly available molecular and statistical methods in combination with longitudinal behavioural data are required to partition the relative contributions of direct and indirect fitness on the lifetime inclusive fitness. Such approaches will elucidate the relative influences of evolutionary and ecological forces favouring social evolution across the mammalian lineage of social mammals.

AB Sexual selection theory often predicts that dominant males will sire more offspring than males displaying subordinate social tactics. We combined the records of space use by collared lizard, Crotaphytus collaris, females and records of social and spatial behaviour of males displaying two markedly different social tactics (territorial and nonterritorial) with genetic determination of parentage to test how variation in male social tactics influences the distribution of reproductive success. In marked contrast with predictions based on their social and spatial behaviour, territorial males did not monopolize paternity of offspring with the females that they defended, and on average, nonterritorial males obtained reproductive success equal to that of territorial males, both within and among successive clutches. When all males were analysed together, none of the traits that are often hypothesized to promote fitness in other lizards were under strong sexual selection in collared lizard males. Among territory owners alone, however, there was positive directional selection on body size. Both the unexpected success of nonterritorial males and exceptionally high levels of multiple paternity appear linked in part to features of the habitat at our study site that diminish the ecological potential for territorial males to monopolize mating opportunities with females that reside in their defended areas. If female collared lizards derive any fitness benefits by mating with multiple males, it is likely that these are genetic rather than material.

AB The effects of branch size, shape and orientation on arboreal animals' movement across gaps or their choice of destinations when doing so are poorly understood compared to the well-documented effects of habitat structure on the locomotor behaviours and maximal speeds of animals moving on solid surfaces. Some highly arboreal species of snakes, such as the brown tree snake, Boiga irregularis, cross gaps using either a slow-speed crawling or a high-speed lunging behaviour. We expected that wider destination perches would enhance either the speed or maximal distance crossed while bridging a gap, because reaching and touching larger objects requires less precise motor control. Thus, for B. irregularis, we tested whether branch size and shape affected perch preference, maximal distance and the behaviour used to bridge gaps. The snakes usually preferred wider destination perches, some of which significantly increased both maximal distance and the amount of high-speed lunging, which contributed to maximal distance. Cylinders with pegs that simulated secondary branches enhanced lunging success rate across gaps compared to cylinders without pegs. The use of high-speed lunges revealed trade-offs between the speed and the accuracy of head placement when first contacting the destination perch on the far side of a gap. Thus, the structure of destination perches on the far side of a void can have important consequences for what destination is chosen, the distance of the gap that is crossed and how the void is traversed.

AB Animals infected with pathogens often differ in behaviour from their uninfected counterparts, and these differences may be key to understanding zoonotic pathogen transmission. To explore behavioural heterogeneity and its role in pathogen transmission, we studied deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, under field conditions. Deer mice are the natural host of Sin Nombre virus (SNV), a zoonotic pathogen with high human mortality. We live- trapped mice in May, July and September of 2009 and 2010, marked captures with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, recorded physical characteristics and collected blood samples for SNV analysis. For 4 nights after each trapping session, we observed behaviour with a novel surveillance system of nine camera stations, each consisting of a foraging tray, infrared camera, PIT antenna and data logger. We found that deer mice infected with SNV (30.0%) engaged more frequently in behaviours that increased the probability of intraspecific encounters and SNV transmission than did uninfected deer mice. When deer mice were categorized as bold (31.7%) or shy (68.3%) based on these behaviours, bold behaviour was predictive of positive SNV status. Bold deer mice were three times more likely to be infected with SNV than were shy deer mice. These results suggest that a small percentage of bold individuals are responsible for a majority of SNV transmission events, and that behavioural phenotype is an important consideration in transmission dynamics of zoonotic diseases.

AB The research field of semantic communication in animals was initiated by the study on alarm calls of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus (then known as Cercopithecus aethiops) by Seyfarth, Cheney and Marler (Animal Behaviour, 1980, 28, 1070-1094). Based on observations of alarm call production and playback experiments in the natural habitat of the monkeys, Seyfarth, Cheney and Marler provided evidence that the alarm calls designated predators as external referents and conveyed sufficient information to listeners to make distinct adaptive responses in the absence of the stimulus. Their interpretation that 'these calls show semantic properties, potentially based on the formation of internal perceptual concepts' contrasted with the existing consensus of the time, which saw animal signals as 'affective', providing information only about the internal motivational state of the signaller and/or the signaller's likely behaviour. This study, particularly its semantic approach, was hugely influential in revitalizing the discussion of what animal calls 'mean', specifically how they are interpreted in the minds of the animals, and ultimately acted as the impetus for the construction of the 'functionally referential' framework in animal communication. Although this semantic approach has been criticized in terms of anthropomorphizing animal communication, understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms is a crucial component of deconstructing animal communication systems and hence we can greatly profit from such a research trajectory. Applying linguistic concepts to animal vocal communication has opened up an enormous research field regarding the continuity between animal vocalizations and human language, integrating different disciplines including animal behaviour, comparative psychology, neurobiology, linguistics and philosophy.

AB Recent evidence has shown that humans are remarkably sensitive to artificial cues of conspecific observation when making decisions with potential social consequences. Whether similar effects are found in other great apes has not yet been investigated. We carried out two experiments in which individual chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, took items of food from an array in the presence of either an image of a large conspecific face or a scrambled control image. In experiment 1 we compared three versions of the face image varying in size and the amount of the face displayed. In experiment 2 we compared a fourth variant of the image with more prominent coloured eyes displayed closer to the focal chimpanzee. The chimpanzees did not look at the face images significantly more than at the control images in either experiment. Although there were trends for some individuals in each experiment to be slower to take high-value food items in the face conditions, these were not consistent or robust. We suggest that the extreme human sensitivity to cues of potential conspecific observation may not be shared with chimpanzees. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB Cooperation theory puts a strong emphasis on partner control mechanisms that have evolved to stabilize cooperation against the temptation of cheating. The marine cleaning mutualism between the Indo-Pacific bluestreack cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, and its reef fish 'clients' has been a model system to study partner control mechanisms and counterstrategies. These cleaners cooperate by eating ectoparasites; however, they can cheat by taking client mucus, which they prefer. Such a conflict may be the exception. For example, Caribbean cleaning gobies, Elacatinus spp., prefer to eat ectoparasites instead of mucus. While partner control mechanisms and counterstrategies seem to be absent in cleaning gobies, no study has directly compared cleaner wrasses and cleaning gobies by using the same methods. We examined systematic differences in cleaning interaction patterns and strategic behaviour exhibited by 12 closely related parrotfish species in the two systems. Parrotfish seeking cleaner wrasses visited them more often and spent more time with their cleaner than parrotfish seeking cleaning gobies. Moreover, the clients of cleaner wrasses returned more often to the same cleaner following a positive interaction, whereas the clients of cleaning gobies were less influenced by the outcome of previous interactions. We hypothesize that the higher frequency and repeated nature of interactions observed in the cleaner wrasse system, combined with the need to resolve conflicts, might have been prerequisites for the development of complex behavioural strategies.

AB Ideal free distribution (IFD) theory is often used to explain small-scale spatial distributions of organisms. However, few studies have rigorously tested predictions of IFD models in situations involving multiple species and trophic levels. We fully parameterized and tested predictions of a general interference IFD model for both predators and prey in a tritrophic system: seven-spotted lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Hemiptera: Aphididae), and tic bean plants (Vicia faba L., Fabaceae). We used habitat selection treatments having both predators and prey in the presence and absence of one another. We also performed experiments to quantify the strength of interspecific competition, the functional response of predators and several measures of fitness for the prey. Our results show that whether prey were present or not, predators followed IFD predictions and aggregated most strongly in the patch with the highest-quality resource. Prey in the presence of predators followed the predicted IFD, which was similar to a uniform distribution. However, prey in the absence of predators moved infrequently and were far from ideal free, suggesting that predators instigated habitat selection behaviour. Our results underscore the importance of considering trophic interactions and multiple measures of patch quality in studies of habitat selection. The observed departures from theoretical predictions also usefully suggest promising extensions for future theory and experiments. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB All animals are highly plastic and rely on the modulation of gene action, physiology and behaviour to continuously modify their phenotypes. Compared to other types of plasticity, learning, defined as the internal representation of novel information, allows animals to better exploit environmental features unique to certain times and places. This distinctive property of learning gives it an enormous potential to promote evolution through increased robustness, innovation and speciation rate. First, learning can enhance robustness because it allows individuals to adopt new resources and avoid novel threats. Empirical examples include the modification of egg-laying timing and nesting site selection in birds and of egg-laying substrate choice in insects. Second, learning can lead to innovation because it often has an exploratory stage that can lead to the discovery and refinement through trial and error of new, fitness-enhancing features. The best examples are cases of social learning that lead to the exploitation of novel food sources followed by genetic changes that optimize use of the new diet. Finally, learning can increase the levels of assortative mating that lead to population divergence either when young imprint on their parents or when individuals restrict their mate choice criteria based on interactions with prospective mates. While the notion that learning can have strong effects on evolution is backed by theory and some data, we currently lack broad experimental evidence to support that claim.

AB Competing for food by altricial and semiprecocial bird nestlings is a behaviour well known for its sensitivity to maternal androgens during prenatal development. Whether a similar effect is present in precocial species that do not beg is less well known. We therefore increased yolk testosterone levels within the physiological range at the onset of incubation to study its effects on food competition behaviour in the domestic chicken, Gallus gallus domesticus. We found an increase in competitiveness in testosterone-treated male domestic chicks, raising their level to that of the females. This is in line with the decrease in circulating plasma levels of males in the direction of the levels in females, and the overall decrease in androgen receptor densities after prenatal treatment as found previously. Hormones are known to have long-lasting organizing effects on behaviour and to affect sexual differentiation in vertebrates. Although research into hormone-mediated maternal effects has been productive, only a few studies describe (the ambiguous) effects into adulthood. Therefore we followed our animals into adulthood and recorded androgen-dependent social behaviour and secondary sexual characteristics, body mass and circulating plasma testosterone levels and checked whether these variables were treatment dependent. Treatment had a near significant effect on comb colour (both brightness and chroma). Again treatment caused a shift towards a more female-like phenotype. This suggests that, in contrast to earlier suggestions, maternal androgens may interact with (but not disrupt) sexual differentiation of brain and behaviour and the development of secondary sexual characteristics.

AB Males usually compete for mates but, by choosing a favourable social environment (e.g. avoiding stronger competitors), males might increase their reproductive success. We first tested whether the mate choice of male eastern mosquitofish depended on the size of potential competitors. In two-choice trials, focal males preferred to associate with a group of large males over a group of small males. However, when both stimulus groups also contained females, focal males associated equally often with the group with large males and the group with small males. We then quantified the effect of competitor size on the relative mating success (proportion of all mating attempts) of males competing for access to a female. In mating trials, the relative mating success of focal males increased with focal male size. In addition, focal males had higher mating success when competing in a group of small males than a group of large males. We suggest that the benefits of associating with small male competitors in a mating context (greater mating success) are balanced by other benefits that have led to a general preference for associating with larger males.

AB Geographical variation in behaviour may be best explained in terms of culture if ecological and genetic explanations can be excluded. However, ecological conditions and genetic predispositions may in turn also affect cultural processes. We examined the influence of environmental factors on foraging tool use among chimpanzees at the Seringbara study site in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea, where nut cracking and termite fishing are absent, but ant dipping is present. We tested two ecological hypotheses to explain foraging tool use prevalence. The opportunity hypothesis states that encounter rates with nuts, insects or tools explain tool use patterns. We measured the density and distribution of nut trees, nuts, army ants, termites and potential tools in relation to the chimpanzees' ranging patterns. The necessity hypothesis states that tool use is a response to scarcity of preferred foods (i.e. ripe fruit). We measured the temporal availability of nuts, army ants and termites in relation to preferred food sources. Our findings support the opportunity hypothesis: nut trees and Macrotermes mounds were rare and peripheral to the chimpanzees' range, whereas army ants were abundant and widespread. The necessity hypothesis did not explain tool-assisted insectivory, as both army ants and termites were available during ripe fruit scarcity, yet neither ant dipping nor termite fishing functioned as fallback strategies. Nuts were absent at times of fruit scarcity and were not available as fallback foods. Our findings highlight the importance of considering environmental conditions in explaining foraging tool use by wild chimpanzees and emphasize the interplay between environment and culture.

AB Dietary mixing is an important adaptation used by many animals to account for nutritional heterogeneity in their environment, but it remains largely unstudied for specialist insects within crowns of deciduous hosts. We carried out field and laboratory studies to explain dietary mixing by larvae of the larch sawfly, Pristiphora erichsonii (Hartig) (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) of dimorphic foliage types (i.e. long shoots versus fascicles) within a deciduous conifer, Larix kaempferi (Lamb.) Carr. First-instar larvae fed mainly on long shoots, and late instars fed mainly on fascicles; however, during all instars, some individuals could be observed feeding on long shoots or fascicles. A mixed diet yielded higher overall survival due to benefits accrued during both early and late instars. Late instars had similar prepupal mass and developmental rate when provided a mixed or fascicle-only diet, but they suffered significant reductions in both performance parameters when forced to feed exclusively on long shoots. Overall fitness of females was 15-22% higher for larvae provided a mixed diet than for larvae provided one foliage type. Our results support the 'ontogeny' hypothesis, which attributes dietary mixing to changes in nutritional needs of larvae over the course of development, as well as the 'complementary diet' hypothesis, which contends that mixing of different foliage types is associated with nutrient balancing or toxin dilution. Our results suggest that architectural patterns of growth and nutritional quality within crowns of deciduous conifers exert selective pressure similar to that of evergreens on insect herbivores to diet-mix during juvenile development.

AB The notion of a biological marketplace as a framework for explaining cooperative acts among animals is well supported. However, direct evidence for a biological market in a mating context is limited to a handful of studies. We collected data over a 3-year period to test supply/demand predictions of male grooming of swollen females according to a biological market in captive chimpanzees while controlling for other potential interchange. Females received more grooming from and gave less grooming to males when swollen than when not swollen, with parous females receiving more grooming from males than nulliparous females. The central tenet of a biological market that the market value of a commodity should vary according to its availability was supported. Males groomed swollen females less as the availability of swollen females in the group increased. There was also an effect of male dominance rank such that higher ranking males groomed swollen females less than lower ranking males. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for male grooming of swollen females according to a biological market while controlling for potential confounds.

AB Dispersal mechanisms and competition together play a key role in the spatial distribution of a population. Species that disperse via fission are likely to experience high levels of localized competitive pressure from conspecifics relative to species that disperse in other ways. Although fission dispersal occurs in many species, its ecological and behavioural effects remain unclear. We compared foraging effort, nest spatial distribution and aggression of two sympatric ant species that differ in reproductive dispersal: Streblognathus peetersi, which disperse by group fission, and Plectroctena mandibularis, which disperse by solitary wingless queens. We found that although both species share space and have similar foraging strategies, they differ in nest distribution and aggressive behaviour. The spatial distribution of S. peetersi nests was extremely aggregated, and workers were less aggressive towards conspecifics from nearby nests than towards distant conspecifics and all heterospecific workers. By contrast, the spatial distribution of P. mandibularis nests was overdispersed, and workers were equally aggressive towards conspecific and heterospecific competitors regardless of nest distance. Finally, laboratory experiments showed that familiarity led to the positive relationship between aggression and nest distance in S. peetersi. While unfamiliar individuals were initially aggressive, the level of aggression decreased within 1 h of contact, and continued to decrease over 24 h. Furthermore, individuals from near nests that were not aggressive could be induced to aggression after prolonged isolation. Overall, these results suggest that low aggression mediated by familiarity could provide benefits for a species with fission reproduction and an aggregated spatial distribution.

AB Assortative pairing, and its relation to mate choice, has rarely been documented in mammals. Using data collected during 1998-2007, we investigated size-assortative pairing as it relates to discrimination amongst potential mates in humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, dyads in the Hawaiian breeding grounds. Across 67 male-female dyads in which both individuals were measured using underwater videogrammetry, male length was positively correlated with female length. Detailed analyses on the assessment of maturity by comparisons with whaling data revealed that mature-sized females associated almost exclusively with mature-sized males and had a significant preference for large mature-sized males. In contrast, mature-sized males were less discriminating in their associations with females and showed no significant preference for mature-sized females. However, mature-sized males that associated with immature-sized females were significantly smaller than males that associated with mature-sized females. Finally, immature-sized males tended to associate with immature-sized females. The sex differences in size preference by mature whales probably reflect the relatively high costs of mature females mating with small or immature males compared to the lower costs of mature males mating with small or immature females. Body size appears to influence the adoption of alternative mating tactics by males such that smaller mature males avoid the costs of competing for the highest-quality females and instead focus their attentions on smaller females that may or may not be mature. Overall, our results provide the first quantitative evidence of size-assortative pairing and female discrimination amongst potential mates in humpback whales and indeed in any cetacean species.

To make a case for female choice based on male calls, it is necessary to examine male call variation in the field and identify repeatable call features that are reliable indicators of male size or symmetry. Female preference for these reliable call features and the underlying assumption behind this choice, female preference for larger males, also need to be examined. We found that females did prefer larger males during mating, as revealed by the longer mating durations and longer spermatophore retention times. We then examined the correlation between acoustic and morphological features and the repeatability of male calls in the field across two temporal scales, within and across nights. We found that carrier frequency was a reliable indicator of male size, with larger males calling at lower frequencies at a given temperature. Simultaneous playback of male calls differing in frequency, spanning the entire range of natural variation at a given temperature, revealed a lack of female preference for low carrier frequencies. The contrasting results between the phonotaxis and mating experiments may be because females are incapable of discriminating small differences in frequency or because the change in call carrier frequency with temperature renders this cue unreliable in tree crickets.

AB Whether nonhuman primates exhibit population-level manual bias remains controversial. There is a growing body of evidence showing consistent individual lateralization and population-level handedness particularly for complex manual behaviours such as bimanual coordinated actions in both monkeys and apes. Whereas the few published studies on hand preferences in squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus, have focused only on unimanual behaviours and generally failed to elicit population-level handedness, we report in this paper the first set of data on hand use for a bimanual coordinated behaviour elicited by the manipulation of an artificial tube in a sample of 37 captive-born squirrel monkeys. The task consisted of holding an opaque tube with one hand and removing the food inside the tube with the other hand. For comparison, hand use data were collected from 38 subjects for unimanual reaching for food from an experimenter when the squirrel monkeys were clinging vertically on the door of the cage. For bimanual coordinated actions, we found a nonsignificant trend towards left-handedness at a population level, especially in males, whereas unimanual reaching when clinging elicited a significant predominance of right-handedness, especially in females. These results are discussed within comparative approaches across primate species and within different theoretical frameworks about the determining factors of handedness in nonhuman primates.

AB Orb webs built by spiders are an extended phenotype, and spiders can modify their morphology when rebuilding them. Internal and external environmental conditions can affect how spiders rebuild. Most spiders that build vertical orb webs wait for prey at the web hub and orient downwards. Moreover, their webs exhibit up-down size asymmetry; specifically, the area below the hub is larger than the area above it. However, some spiders reverse this asymmetry in their webs. To examine the relationship between phenotypic plasticity and web asymmetry reversal and whether spiders elongate their webs upwards in response to prey capture in the upper web, I manipulated prey capture location in two closely related spider species. Cyclosa octotuberculata build webs with typical asymmetry (larger area below the web hub). Cyclosa argenteoalba build webs with reversed asymmetry, a derived phenotype, and wait in a reversed orientation, facing upwards. I found that, when spiders fed in the lower part of the web, both species elongated their webs downwards and that C. argenteoalba webs lost their asymmetry and became symmetrical. In contrast, webs were not elongated in the upward direction when spiders of either species were fed in the upper part of the web. These results provided evidence that the up-down asymmetry of Cyclosa webs is a plastic trait regardless of whether spiders build webs with typical or reversed asymmetry. However, no significant upward elongation of webs indicates that there is no evidence of a relationship between plasticity in the extended phenotype and web asymmetry reversal.

AB Division of labour (i.e. differential task performance) is the hallmark of social insects. One highly studied component of honeybee division of labour is foraging specialization through collection of protein (pollen) or carbohydrates (nectar). The reproductive ground plan hypothesis proposes that this foraging division of labour is regulated by the same physiological control networks that controlled foraging behaviour during the reproductive life cycle of solitary honeybee ancestors. Based on observed differences in foraging behaviour and reproductive anatomy between bees selected for storing high and low quantities of pollen (high and low pollen-hoarding strains) and observed differences between wild-type pollen and nectar foragers, the reproductive ground plan hypothesis suggests that ovary size in facultatively sterile worker honeybees has a regulatory effect on variation in foraging division of labour, with increased protein bias correlated with increased ovary size (measured as ovariole number). An alternative explanation for the link between ovary size and foraging behaviour is that genes for ovarian development and foraging are inherited together because of genetic linkage or chance gene associations in the selected and natural populations. To address this alternative explanation, we investigated the relationship between ovary size and foraging bias in honeybees where genetic linkage was broken using a backcross mating design. We also studied high-and low-strain bees where ovary size effects were partitioned from other potential linkage effects. We found that ovariole number was related to foraging bias in the backcross bees and in the selected strains, as predicted by the reproductive ground plan hypothesis. An interaction effect between nectar sugar concentration and ovariole number was observed in the backcross and high-strain bees. This result suggests a potential mechanism by which the ovary affects sucrose perception, which in turn influences foraging behaviour. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Chemical communication between reproductives and subordinates within social insects is fundamental to maintaining colony organization. Cuticular hydrocarbons are thought to be the dominant source of fertility signals among ants; however, differences found within the Dufour's glands could also serve as fertility signals. We investigated the function of the queen Dufour's gland in Aphaenogaster cockerelli, an ant species in which cuticular hydrocarbon profiles serve as fertility signals. The queen's Dufour's gland contents distinguish her from all other members of the colony. When she encounters a competing reproductive worker she uses her gland to mark the worker, inducing punishment from nestmates. We show that only the queen's Dufour's gland can induce the observed amount of aggression. The Dufour's gland and the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of A. cockerelli queens are both queen-specific signals, but they have different functions. The cuticular hydrocarbon profile advertises the fertility status of queens, while the Dufour's gland elicits directed-nestmate aggression towards reproductive workers. Our study also points out striking similarities in the use of the Dufour's gland that span several subfamilies and forms of colony organization in ants, leading to a task separation of queen-specific signals.

AB Many animals steal food, termed kleptoparasitism, but attacks are frequently unsuccessful and may incur costs. Some species produce false alarm calls during kleptoparasitism, but the relative benefits of this versus physical attacks are not known. We investigated the kleptoparasitic behaviour of a population of individually recognizable and habituated fork-tailed drongos, Dicrurus adsimilis, which kleptoparasitize food using both false alarms and physical attacks. Drongos made false alarms more frequently when kleptoparasitizing small food items, probably because these can be more profitably stolen by false alarm than attack. False alarms were also more frequent when targets were larger species, which are likely to be more costly to attack since they more frequently defended food. Drongos were able to attack targets when a false alarm had failed but rarely did so, even though such attacks were no less successful than attacks when no false alarm had been made. It therefore appears that false alarms increase opportunities for kleptoparasitism because calls can be made when attacks are unprofitable. False alarm calls also appear to benefit drongos by increasing overall success in kleptoparasitism, because attacks could be made following failed false alarm calls. This is the first study to show the functional benefits of making false alarm calls, illustrating how they may be deployed strategically in kleptoparasitism when attacks would be less profitable or even unprofitable. More generally, false alarms may evolve where animals engage in physical conflict over resources because they can benefit individuals by decreasing the costs of competition.

AB It is generally assumed that begging signals provide parents with reliable information on the state of their young, allowing them to decide accordingly how much to invest in their nestlings. Avian brood-parasitic nestlings exhibit begging displays that are highly exaggerated. In most species, they also increase their begging level in relation to their level of hunger, as predicted by models of honest signalling. However, it has been suggested that great spotted cuckoo, Clamator glandarius, nestlings are an exception to this general rule because they spit out food when satiated and continue begging at a high intensity. We tested this assertion by using both natural observations of food delivery by foster parents and a laboratory experiment in which we hand-fed both cuckoo and host magpie, Pica pica, and carrion crow, Corvus corone, nestlings while controlling for the degree of food deprivation. First, we found that cuckoo nestlings did not throw out food because they are satiated. Second, as in host magpie nestlings, during a period of food deprivation the cuckoo nestlings begged at a significantly higher frequency and intensity than when fed ad libitum (a period of food abundance) and begging signals increased with an increased level of hunger in both species. These results indicate that in this cuckoo species the frequency and intensity of begging are in accordance with food requirements, and, thus, that begging is not dishonest in the sense of being unreliable.

AB The close resemblance between the common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, and the Eurasian sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, is often viewed as Batesian mimicry evolved by the cuckoo in response to the aggression of its host. However, the effectiveness of such mimicry is poorly known. We examined cuckoo-hawk discrimination ability in the great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a well-known and aggressive cuckoo host. We measured the responses of birds to three combinations of simultaneously presented taxidermic mounts of the cuckoo, sparrowhawk and turtle dove, as a harmless control, placed near their nests. Great reed warblers clearly discriminated the two enemies from the innocuous species. They always attacked cuckoos and sparrowhawks more often than turtle doves suggesting they considered both a danger to their broods. However, when we confronted the tested birds with the simultaneously presented mounts of these species, the parents attacked the cuckoo more frequently than the sparrowhawk. The results revealed that although great reed warblers attacked both cuckoo and sparrowhawk mounts near their nest, they were able to discriminate between them. This may suggest that if cuckoos had evolved the visual mimicry of a sparrowhawk to avoid host attacks, this mimicry may be unsuccessful not only because it is imperfect and hosts can learn to discriminate but also because of the generalized nest defence of more aggressive hosts.

AB The phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) skin-swelling test is one of the most widely used methods for cell-mediated immunity measurement in immunoecology. Although several studies have investigated the condition-dependent traits associated with the magnitude of cutaneous inflammatory response to PHA, the results concerning signalling of the responsiveness through ornamental traits are still controversial. This is especially true for carotenoid-based feather ornamentation in birds. We therefore examined the linkage between several condition-dependent traits, including the red ornamental coloration of the plumage, and the magnitude of the PHA-induced immune response in scarlet rosefinch, Carpodacus erythrinus, males. Our results show two important aspects of the PHA-induced inflammation in this species. First, histological analysis showed that the swelling response was dependent on basophil activity. Second, the magnitude of the response (increase in patagium thickness) was associated with individual size, carotenoid-based ornamental coloration and a ptilochronological marker of feather growth at the time of moulting (mean growth bar width), thus mirroring the long-term quality of the individual. The positive linkage between the individual size or mean growth bar width and the PHA response suggests an association between the magnitude of the response and individual metabolic rate. However, as the magnitude of the response was also related negatively to ornament saturation and positively to ornament lightness, our results indicate stronger responsiveness in inferior males. Highly ornamented, healthier individuals recruited fewer basophils into the inflamed tissue causing less intense swelling. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show a negative association between carotenoid-based plumage coloration and the magnitude of the PHA-induced immune response.

AB Infanticide can increase an individual's reproductive success through reduced competition for its offspring. Here we document the occurrence and effects of infanticidal behaviour by dominant female burying beetles, Nicrophorus vespilloides, in nontolerant breeding associations. Burying beetles feed and guard their young on buried carcasses, and on small carcasses, conspecific females engage in intense aggression. Dominants largely exclude subordinates from the carcass and are the sole caregivers for the larvae. Although subordinates and dominants produce similar egg clutches, only one out of five surviving offspring is the subordinate's. We hypothesized that much of this skew is due to temporally cued infanticide by dominants. Females oviposit over the course of 24-48 h, and kill larvae they encounter prior to the hatching of their own larvae. Such infanticide can lead to significant skew only if the dominant's larvae hatch significantly later than the subordinate's, and if more subordinate than dominant larvae hatch during the infanticidal phase. The subordinate's share of larvae hatching during the parental phase must be smaller than her share of eggs, and the portion of subordinate larvae killed by the dominant should increase with an increasing difference in oviposition time between the two females. These predictions were met. Dominant females, who had exclusive access to the carcass and larvae, were able to use temporal cues to destroy over half of the subordinates' first-instar larvae. This is the first study to unambiguously document the primary mechanism underlying reproductive dominance in nontolerant associations of female N. vespilloides.

AB Predatory arthropods that specialize in invading webs and preying on the resident spiders ('araneophagic predators') face special challenges. As webs are exceedingly good at transmitting vibrations, it is difficult for a web invader to move through the web and remain undetected by the spider. An araneophagic predator that generates vibrations in the web may risk prey escaping or even counterattacking. To increase the chances of an undetected approach, predators may exploit episodes of environmental noise to approach, while their prey's ability to detect them is compromised ('opportunistic smokescreen behaviour'). Here we provide the first experimental evidence of convergent opportunistic smokescreen behaviour in an araneophagic insect, Stenolemus bituberus Stal (Reduviidae), which preys on web-building spiders. We tested how two common types of environmental noise, wind and localized vibrations in the web, influence the predatory behaviour and success of assassin bugs when hunting spiders. We found that assassin bugs were more likely to catch the spider in the presence of wind. During episodes of environmental noise, assassin bugs stepped more often and walked in a more continuous manner, apparently exploiting the opportunity to approach while the prey's sensory system is less able to detect the predator. Changes in predatory behaviour in the presence of environmental noise were not evident when S. bituberus was in an unoccupied spider web. This supports our hypothesis that noise-related timing of behaviour reflects decisions made as part of a predatory strategy, rather than responses to physical disturbance.

AB During courtship males often communicate information about their fitness to females. The matching of harmonic components of flight tone in male-female pairs of flying mosquitoes, or harmonic convergence, was recently described. This behaviour occurs prior to mating and has been suggested to function in mate selection. We investigated the hypothesis that harmonic convergence is a component of mosquito courtship. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that harmonic convergence should provide information to potential mates about fitness benefits. We measured the effect of harmonic convergence behaviour on the direct and indirect benefits obtained by females. We found that the sons of pairs that converged at harmonic frequencies prior to mating had increased mating success and that these offspring were themselves more likely to converge prior to mating. These results suggest that males may be able to signal information about their genetic quality to females prior to mating and that this signal may be heritable. These findings are important for our understanding of mosquito behaviour and have applications in the control of mosquito-borne disease. This study also contributes to the study of male-female interactions and signal coevolution. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The formation of kin groups is an important step in the path to evolution of sociality in mammals. We used microsatellite DNA analyses, trapping and radiotelemetry data to investigate spatial and genetic associations of the solitary giant kangaroo rat, Dipodomys ingens. We predicted that, as population densities increase, dispersal distances should decrease to form kin groups. As predicted, females decreased dispersal distances as population densities increased to form female kin clusters of related neighbours. Males also decreased dispersal distances, but only at the highest density, and they did not form kin clusters. Males seemed to adjust their home ranges to overlap unrelated females as a possible strategy to avoid inbreeding. They were not highly related to the majority of females that they overlapped, and the nearest neighbour in most cases was an unrelated female. The significant decrease in distance between female neighbours and the formation of female kin groups at high population density represents a potential increase in social interactions among these solitary rodents. Further research is necessary to determine the extent to which D. ingens is able to discriminate between kin and other familiar animals and whether they interact preferentially to facilitate the success of closely related kin.

AB The presence of eavesdroppers within a communication network can increase the costs associated with signalling. Hence, selection should favour the ability to vary signal structure with social context. One possible mechanism is the flexible combination of the components that form a multimodal signal. This phenomenon clearly occurs in social mammals, particularly primates, and has been identified as one of the foundation elements for the evolution of complex communication. However, this flexibility in signal component composition in relation to social context has not previously been demonstrated in other taxa. Here we show that subordinate male fowl, Gallus gallus, show facultative variation in the structure of their multimodal signals. Intriguingly, signallers were not sensitive to the behaviour of the intended receivers (hens) but rather to the attentional state of eavesdropping rival males. Subordinates switched from multimodal displays (movements and calls) to unimodal (silent) displays when the alpha male was attentive. Unimodal and multimodal displays had equivalent efficacy in attracting hens, but multimodal signals were associated with more rapid approach by the alpha male and increased probability of severe attack. Variation in signal type is hence driven by social costs. This is the first demonstration of facultative multimodal signalling in birds. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Males often display signals from more than one sensory modality when producing courtship displays. In crickets, males produce a courtship song that conveys information about male quality. Although less well studied, male crickets also produce chemical cues that are used in mate choice. Plasticity in chemical cues has been recently reported, but empirical evidence for signal-mediated plasticity in these cues is primarily lacking. We tested whether exposure to acoustic sexual signals in the Australian field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, affects the expression of another sexual signal, cuticular hydrocarbons. We found that the expression of male cuticular hydrocarbons was affected by acoustic experience; in the absence of singing males, males increased the relative concentration of a number of cuticular hydrocarbons that females have previously been shown to find attractive. Our results demonstrate that social cues relating to acoustic signals can stimulate a plastic change in cuticular hydrocarbon expression. Crown Copyright (C) 2011.

AB Social bonds have been construed as mental representations mediating social interactions among individuals. It is problematic, however, to differentiate this mechanism from others that assume more direct exchanges and interchanges of behaviour such as reciprocity, market effects or mutualism. We used naturally occurring shifts in rates and patterns of social interactions among male Barbary macaques to test whether affiliation in the nonmating season predicts coalition formation in the mating season. We carried out 1377 h of observation of all 23 males living in a semifree-ranging bisexual group at Affenberg Salem, Germany. The mating season was characterized by significantly increased rates of aggression, male coalition formation and spontaneous submission as well as decreased rates of affiliation. Rates of coalition formation in the mating season were predicted by affiliation between these males several weeks earlier in the nonmating season after we controlled for affiliation in the mating season. We conclude that social bonding in the nonmating season may build reputations among partners that are crucial for cooperation in risk-prone agonistic coalitions against other males. From the pronounced time lag between bonding and cooperation and the fact that males largely ignored affiliation as well as agonistic patterns in the time-matched mating season, we conclude that short-term reciprocity, mutualism or market effects cannot explain these observations. Instead, we conclude that long-term reciprocity mediated by emotional book keeping may be the basic mechanism. Building on that, males may employ a mental representation of their social bonds when choosing partners for cooperative interactions. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We tested predictions following from the biological market paradigm using reciprocated grooming sessions among the adult females in a sooty mangabey, Cercocebus atys, group with 35 females (Ivory Coast) and in two groups of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops (South Africa) with four and seven females, respectively. Closely ranked females often groomed frequently. The exchanges within such dyads were generally characterized by time matching, but the subordinates groomed for longer than their dominant partners. The reciprocal nature of over 90% of the grooming sessions allowed us to investigate 'partner control' strategies such as 'parcelling' and 'raising the stakes'. Females of both species neither parcelled nor gradually invested more grooming in the course of sessions. Rather, the longer bouts of a grooming session were usually at the beginning of the session and the length of the first bout reliably predicted the length of the whole session for frequently grooming partners. Furthermore, we compared potential trust-building behaviour (or 'strategies') in frequent and infrequent grooming partners. We found that infrequent groomers of both species showed no signs of trust building and that the first bout they invested in a grooming session did not predict the session length. We conclude that each female has a good knowledge of her value as a grooming partner within each dyad and knows how much she has to invest to receive a satisfactory amount of grooming within the same session.

AB Crossing large bodies of water can be extremely risky for terrestrial migrants and yet such migrants have been observed to cross hundreds and even thousands of kilometres of water. However, the mechanisms that enable nocturnal migrants to cross large bodies of water successfully remain unclear. In the north of the Netherlands, autumn migration of birds occurs mainly along a southwesterly axis and can be predicted very successfully. However, on rare occasions, intense and unexpected migration events occur with a significantly different track direction. We hypothesized that these events represent birds arriving from Norway and other Scandinavian countries after crossing the North Sea barrier. We implemented a back-trajectory model calibrated with radar data from autumn 2006-2008 to test our hypothesis, assuming that birds maintain a constant heading and airspeed during flight. A total of 14 events were identified. In some cases measured mean ground speeds were twice as high as mean airspeeds. Model results demonstrated that birds took advantage of atmospheric conditions to cross the North Sea quickly. In the majority of cases, birds could be tracked to Norway, Denmark or Sweden when maintaining a constant airspeed and heading en route, but not in all cases. Thus migrants must be flexible in their reaction to wind to take advantage of dynamic and heterogeneous atmospheric conditions experienced en route. The integration of measurements with simulation modelling provides a powerful framework to improve our understanding of how animals move through a dynamic environment and the consequences of their behaviour.

AB Theory predicts trade-offs between investment in various life history traits, and it is also now generally accepted that reproduction is costly for males. Males must therefore optimize resource allocation across several episodes of reproduction, and this includes investment in both pre- and postcopulatory fitness components. We investigated this in the sperm-polymorphic Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella. Resource-limited males were smaller, and had decreased precopulatory mating success, measured as lifetime number of matings. However, they transferred similar numbers of fertile sperm as males reared under high-quality larval conditions, and more nonfertile sperm. By mating less frequently, resource-limited males may allocate sufficient resources to the matings they achieve to ensure fertilization success under sperm competition.

AB Although personality has been defined as a suite of correlated behaviours, most studies of animal personality actually consider correlations between a few traits. We examined the repeatability and correlational structure of five potential personality traits (activity, neophobia, exploratory tendencies, risk-taking behaviour and obstinacy), in female zebra finches. In addition, we assessed to what extent personality influenced social dominance in a feeding context in this gregarious species. All personality traits were found to be highly repeatable within individuals. In addition, except for obstinacy, all of them were related to each other, thus defining a behavioural syndrome. Social dominance was predicted by personality, with proactive individuals being more likely to be dominant. Our results suggest that personality can be considered as a new static factor influencing within-group hierarchies. We finally discuss these results in terms of the consequences for the evolution of personalities and the need to take several traits into account to provide full descriptions of individual personality.

AB In contrast to numerous studies of scent marking in male mammals, studies of female scent marking are relatively rare. We have previously shown that communally breeding female banded mongooses, Mungos mungo, are more likely to overmark the scent of other females. Here we describe female overmarking patterns in more detail, and discuss these results in relation to hypotheses potentially explaining such 'female intrasexual overmarking'. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate female overmarking in any wild mammal. First, although we found some evidence of individually distinctive scent marks in females, we found no evidence to suggest that female intrasexual overmarking was related to competition for food, as feeding competition was infrequent, and unrelated to overmarking scores. We also found no evidence to suggest that intrasexual overmarking in females was involved in reproductive suppression. Females with the highest and lowest overmarking scores in each group were mate-guarded by males for similar durations. Finally, we found little evidence to suggest that female intrasexual overmarking was involved in competition for males. Although the female with the highest overmarking score in each group tended to be mate-guarded by males in better condition than the female with the lowest overmarking score, a female's overmarking score affected neither the amount of harassment she received from males nor the frequency of mating attempts received. These results are discussed in light of these and other untested hypotheses for female overmarking. (c) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Are wild bearded capuchin monkeys selective about where they place nuts on anvils, specifically the anvil pits, during nut cracking? In the present study, we examined (1) whether capuchins' preferences for particular pits are influenced by the effectiveness of the pit in cracking the nut and/or by the stability of the nut during striking, (2) how capuchins detect the affordances of novel pits and (3) the influence of social context on their selections. Anvil pits varied in horizontal dimension (small, medium and large) in experiment 1 and in depth (shallow, medium and deep) in experiment 2. In both experiments, three different pits were simultaneously presented, each on one anvil. We coded the capuchins' actions with the nut in each pit, and recorded the outcome of each strike. In both experiments, capuchins preferred the most effective pit, but not the most stabilizing pit, based on the number of first strikes, total strikes and nuts cracked. Their choice also reflected where the preceding individual had last struck. The capuchins explored the pits indirectly, placing nuts in them and striking nuts with a stone. The preference for pits was weaker than the preference for nuts and stones shown previously with the same monkeys. Our findings suggest that detecting affordances of pits through indirect action is less precise than through direct action, and that social context may also influence selection. We show that field experiments can demonstrate embodied cognition in species-typical activities in natural environments. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Honest signalling assumes a correlation between an observable signal and a nonobservable quality. There are many mutually nonexclusive mechanisms that can achieve such a correlation; however, for a long time the handicap principle has been identified as the main solution to this problem. In short, it claims that signals need to be costly to be honest and that honest signallers have to pay this extra cost at the equilibrium (i.e. signals have to be handicaps). Honesty, however, is not maintained by the realized cost paid by honest signallers at the equilibrium but by the potential cost of cheating. Whether this potential cost implies a realized cost for honest signallers depends on the biological details of the system and thus this cost cannot be predicted a priori without knowledge of these details. Accordingly, depending on these details, signals need not be costly to be honest, even under conflict of interest. In other words, handicapping equilibrium signals are not the only way to create a high potential cost of cheating. Here I first review the theoretical models supporting the above conclusion, and then I list mechanisms that can maintain a high potential cost of cheating without imposing extra realized cost (i.e. a handicap) on honest signallers at the equilibrium. Identifying and describing those constraints or the lack of them that might create a connection between these two types of cost should be a major research agenda.

AB The waggle dance of honeybees, Apis mellifera, is one of the most remarkable communication systems of the animal kingdom. In this study, we focused on a major gap in the understanding of this striking behaviour: the question of the sensory modality by which meaningful information is transferred from dancers to followers. We revisited the hypothesis that tactile stimuli convey information about the direction relative to gravity and the length of the waggle phase. It has long been suggested that followers use tactile stimuli arising from the wagging movements of a dancing bee to decode information in the dance. Yet, the questions of whether and to what extent such movements are mapped to the tactile experience of the followers have never been resolved. Using high-speed video techniques, we found that the higher the number of the dancer's wagging movements, the higher the number of the followers' antennal deflections. We also documented that most followers faced the dancers laterally and experienced a fairly regular pattern of tactile stimuli; a much smaller proportion of followers faced the dancers from behind and became the subject of a different, although still regular, pattern of tactile stimuli. From these observations, we conclude that tactile mechanosensory input from the antennae, presumably processed by neurons of the antennal joint hair sensilla and the neck hair plates, enables bees to estimate both the direction relative to gravity and the length of the waggle phase.

AB The fighting ability components of 'resource-holding potential' (RHP) may vary with body size, weapon size and energetic status. Theory predicts that agonistic signals should vary with RHP and any decision to 'give up' should be made by the opponent with lower RHP. In some species, an encounter is only resolved when one opponent is killed or critically injured. We investigated fatal fighting between groups of red wood ants, Formica rufa, and determined whether the probability that a focal group inflicts the first fatality in an encounter is influenced by the same correlates of RHP demonstrated to affect noninjurious fight outcome. In addition, we manipulated group size, an additional factor which is likely to be linked to RHP during intergroup conflicts, to determine whether members of larger groups concentrate attacks on their less numerous opponents. We found that, during most encounters, focal groups that inflicted the first fatality contained individuals of larger mean body mass than groups that received the first fatality. There was no evidence that energetic status directly influenced outcome, although groups that received the first fatality experienced a significant reduction in total body sugar compared to nonfighting controls. Finally, we found no evidence to suggest F. rufa concentrate their attacks in a way that leads to enhanced group RHP. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The feeding constraint hypothesis states that an inability of young nestlings to ingest prey included in the diet of older nestlings and adult birds affects the evolution of parental behaviour, and predicts that the extent of prey preparation would increase with prey size and decrease with nestling age. In the Eurasian kestrel, Falco tinnunculus, a small raptor with a wide diet, parents often prepare prey prior to delivery at the nest, most notably by decapitation. We studied this behaviour by video monitoring prey deliveries at 29 nests for a total of about 200 days over 3 years. The probability of a prey item being decapitated prior to delivery differed between prey types and prey sizes; none of the insects or common lizards, Zootoca vivipara, and almost none of the shrews (Soricidae) were decapitated, whereas voles (Microtinae) and birds were commonly decapitated. For voles the probability of being decapitated decreased with nestling age, which supports the feeding constraint hypothesis because the nestlings' gape size limit and swallowing capacity would increase with age. For both voles and birds the probability of being decapitated increased with prey body mass, suggesting that kestrel nestlings may be unable to swallow, digest or egest skulls from larger prey. We suggest that the extent to which kestrel parents decapitate prey prior to delivery is an effect of their nestlings' age-dependent swallowing capacity and that the age of the nestlings therefore imposes constraints on the kestrel parents' foraging behaviour.

AB Animals spend a substantial proportion of their lives resting and consequently the choice of a sleeping site can dramatically affect an individual's fitness. Sleeping sites have been implicated in predator defence and thermoregulation and their distribution can affect breeding and social systems in small mammals. Sleeping sites may constitute a limiting resource for females which experience energetic constraints to breeding and require shelter for their young. Despite the potential importance of sleeping sites, exhaustive studies of the factors determining their usage patterns are limited to a small number of mammal groups. We investigated how seasonal changes in temperature or the presence of young shape sleeping site usage patterns in a small primate, the grey mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus. Females preferred tree holes over nests and open sites and the usage duration of a particular tree hole site was affected by the physical characteristics likely to affect its insulation properties. Furthermore, climate variables strongly affected sleeping site choices and nests were chosen more often than tree holes during the wet season. However, when young were present preferences shifted back to tree holes. Preferred tree species used as sleeping sites as well as the properties of tree holes were rare among trees in the study area suggesting that sleeping sites may indeed be a limiting resource for female grey mouse lemurs. Our results suggest that in the study species sleeping site choices are governed by thermoregulatory considerations and their limited availability could also account for the social grouping.

AB Male-male competition can contribute to honest sexual signalling. Because male bowerbirds steal each other's decorations, decoration theft could lead to an honest relationship between male quality and signal size. To test this hypothesis, I conducted an experiment in which I standardized decoration numbers at bowers of the great bowerbird, Ptilonorhynchus nuchalis, such that all males had equal numbers. I then monitored males for 11 weeks as they stole decorations from other males, defended their decorations against theft, and collected decorations from the environment. For two commonly stolen decoration types (red wire and green plastic), there was a correlation between the numbers at bowers before and after standardization. Males that had more red wires and green plastic pieces before standardization were less likely to have these decorations stolen from their bowers after standardization, although they were not more successful at stealing decorations. These males also collected more red wires and green plastic pieces from the environment, and collecting rate was unrelated to the numbers available near the bower. Males that were more successful at guarding their decorations had longer nuchal crests and had been bower owners for longer periods, although nearest-neighbour distance explained more of the variation in guarding ability than either male characteristic. These results suggest decoration numbers are an honest signal of the male's ability to guard his bower against theft and to locate decorations in the environment, although some variation in stealing behaviours may be related to the spatial arrangement of males rather than to male quality.

AB Perceived risk of predation is considered to influence individual prey vigilance, but little is known about the extent to which the context (e. g. distance to cover, group size) and the immediate presence of predators determine individual prey vigilance. We combined behavioural data on individual vigilance of herbivores at waterholes with fine-scale spatiotemporal data from 27 African lions, Panthera leo, fitted with GPS radiocollars to test whether individual prey vigilance increases when predators are in the vicinity and whether this relationship is influenced by group size and presence of other herbivores. The study was conducted on giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, and plains zebra, Equus quagga, in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, between mid-September and mid-November 2008. Kudu was the only species to adjust its vigilance level significantly in the presence of lions, arguably owing to its higher contribution to lion diet in Hwange. Kudu devoted a significantly higher proportion of time to vigilance when lions were in the vicinity. Furthermore, the proportion of time spent on individual vigilance decreased as group size increased during the approach and drinking phases, particularly when lions were in the vicinity. Finally, the presence of other herbivores at the waterhole enabled kudu to spend less time vigilant while drinking. These adjustments involved changes in the length of vigilance bouts, but not in their frequency. Our study suggests that the interplay between the context (group size, presence of other prey) and the immediate presence of predators determines the level of vigilance in prey.

AB Territory owners often respond with greater aggression to strangers than to neighbouring individuals, a phenomenon known as the 'dear enemy' effect. As strangers are usually 'floating' individuals seeking to acquire a territory they pose a relatively greater threat to a resident than do neighbours, who are already territory owners. This explains why residents are less aggressive towards neighbours but not how they distinguish neighbours from strangers: do residents recognize their neighbours or respond to differences in the behaviour of neighbours and strangers? Using measures of fighting intensity we investigated the dear enemy effect in a fiddler crab, Uca mjoebergi. We then experimentally manipulated the residency status of pairs of neighbours to distinguish between mechanisms enabling the dear enemy response. Fights between resident and nonterritory-owning individuals were longer and more escalated than fights between neighbouring residents, whether the nonterritory-owner was familiar (a former neighbour) or unfamiliar to the resident. Our results are consistent with the 'relative threat' hypothesis to explain the dear enemy effect, and support the suggestion that residents use cues in the behaviour of an intruder to determine the level of threat posed and distinguish between neighbours and strangers. However, we note that the observed patterns can occur even if residents do not differentiate between intruder types, and simply respond appropriately to the aggressiveness and persistence of an intruder.

AB Sexual conflict has an important selective influence on mating strategies, particularly in promiscuous species such as chimpanzees. Males may coerce females to mate and aggression may inhibit female choice. The effect of male coercion on females has rarely been examined in primates. The present study focuses on male aggression towards females and the influence of male coercion on female choice in two communities of wild chimpanzees in the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire to determine (1) whether male-to-female aggression increases in a sexual context, (2) the frequency, context and efficacy of male-female aggression and (3) the influence of male coercion on female choice.
   Our results suggest that direct male coercion was relatively rare, was used by less preferred males, and did not seem to function effectively to constrain female mate preferences as neither (1) a general measure of overall male-female aggression nor (2) a specific measure of direct sexual coercion corresponded to male mating success, and (3) male aggression did not correspond to increased female proceptivity or decreased female resistance rates. Lastly, variation in male-female sexual strategies appears to be yet another important realm for behavioural diversity in chimpanzees. This detailed examination of chimpanzee male-to-female aggression emphasizes the importance of carefully distinguishing male and female influences on sexual interactions in light of their disparate reproductive interests.

AB Research on animal ornaments used in mate choice has largely focused on males, particularly for bird species with sexually dimorphic coloured patches of feathers and integument. Relatively less information is available for coloured ornaments of sexually monomorphic species and the use of these ornaments during mate choice. The king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, is a monogamous marine bird in which both sexes show very similar coloured ornaments (UV and yellow-orange colours on the beak, yellow orange auricular feathers, and yellow to rusty-brown breast feathers). These ornaments have previously been implicated in mate choice. We used manipulative experiments to test the role of coloured feather patches in the choice of partners that occurs during pair formation. Experimental reduction of auricular patch size delayed pairing, and alteration of auricular and breast patch colour from yellow to white caused an even stronger delay (white treatments gave adults the appearance of immature birds). Surprisingly, we found that time to pairing did not differ between treatments for females, but males showed significant delays in pairing in general and especially when treated. Thus, females seemed to be more selective in mate choice than males, a phenomenon that might be explained by a male-biased sex ratio in the colony. Nevertheless, our results indicate that choice of mate may be much stronger in one of the sexes in what appears to be a sexually monomorphic species, for which we expected sexual selection to favour mutually strong male and female mate choice.

AB Unsolicited third-party affiliation is defined as the first postconflict affinitive contact directed by bystanders to victims. To date, it has been found in apes and children but not in monkeys. We investigated the occurrence of unsolicited postconflict third-party affiliation in wolves, Canis lupus, and verified some functional hypotheses using a comparison with solicited contacts. Unsolicited affiliations were more frequent between individuals sharing good relationships and were reciprocated between partners (victims and third parties), thus suggesting the reciprocal nature of this mechanism (mutualistic behaviour). At an immediate level, in wolves unsolicited contacts provided benefits to the victim by breaking off aggression and restoring victims' social cohesiveness. The incidence of unsolicited interactions was affected by the presence of previous reconciliation. This result mirrors what has been found for the great apes, in which consolation may function as a partial alternative to reconciliation. Even though the cognitive skills at the basis of conflict resolution in canids still have to be investigated in detail, our study shows an unexpected similarity between wolves and the great apes.

AB Subterranean termites forage through a network of tunnels. The topology of the networks can be characterized in terms of branch angles and branching rate. When termites encounter depressions in the walls of tunnels, they may excavate the soil from the depression, which could result in the formation of new branches, or they may deposit previously excavated soil from elsewhere, which could fill in the depression. Thus, the likelihood of a branch forming is determined by the balance between soil arriving and filling the void and soil being excavated to enlarge it. We examined the tunneling behaviour of Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki in experimental arenas and found that excavation and deposition do not take place evenly across the face of tunnel wall depressions: excavation ( by unloaded termites moving towards the digging face at the tunnel tip) is more likely at the proximal face ( relative to the tunnel tip), while deposition ( by loaded termites returning from the tunnel tip) is more likely at the distal face. This differential focus of labour within depressions facilitated branch formation by reducing localized competition between loaded and unloaded termites. Once a branch was established, biased excavation and deposition led to a shift in branch heading from about 90 degrees relative to the main tunnel to about 50-60 degrees, close to the theoretical optimum for the efficient flow of termites through tunnels. The basic elements of the excavation/deposition system and feedback between the two may be selected in evolution to optimize the tunnel network and thus the cost/benefit balance of feeding.

AB Territory residency is associated with considerable benefits. In the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria, males fight over ownership of large sunspots in open forest habitats; winners become sunspot residents, and losers become nonterritorial and sit and wait for females in small sunspots. A previous study has shown that residents have higher mating success than nonterritorial males, although females are not more attracted to territorial males or sunspot territories per se. Here we tested the hypotheses (1) that the higher success of resident males is caused by visual mate detection being more efficient in a large than in a small sunspot, and (2) that only sunspots above a certain size are defended as territories. Field assessment of territorial sunspot size showed that defended sunspots were significantly larger than 'average sunspots' on the forest floor. Experimental tests of male ability to detect visually a model butterfly passing through a sunspot showed that males were more successful in pursuing and intercepting a passing model when. own a longer distance in the sunspot. Hence, we conclude that light conditions and associated visual mate detection and ability to complete mate flight pursuit can explain why P. aegeria males defend territories in large sunspots in forest habitats.

AB Honeybees (Apis mellifera) were used as a model insect system to explore how foragers solve problems involving cost as well as reward. Reward difference was created by varying sucrose molarity, whereas cost difference was created by varying flower-handling time in artificial flower patches. Unlike earlier work, flower-handling time was a function of stamen length rather than corolla length, such that longer stamens increased flower-handling time. When changing from short- to long-stamen flowers, access to nectar becomes limited to specific routes, which differ in difficulty. Experiments were performed with 2 mu l and 6 mu l sucrose rewards. Differences in reward and/or handling time were associated with flower colour difference (blue versus white flowers). Higher energy reward (2 M) and shorter handling time were preferred by bees when foraging problems involved only a reward or a handling-time difference, which followed energy maximization expectations. However, when the two variables were combined so that greater handling time was combined with higher reward, behaviour differed between individuals. Some bees made choices based solely on reward, some only on effort (handling time), and some simply on flower colour. These results contrast with early work where handling time was a function of corolla length and all bees avoided longer corollas. Results suggest that honeybees do not always behave as predicted by simple energy maximization principles; rather, individuality in choice arises when the foraging problem becomes more difficult because of increased complexity (dimensionality) of the problem.

   EVOLUTION
AB Age-related task performance, or temporal polyethism, is a prominent characteristic of labour organization in most social insects. In many species, including almost all ants, young workers perform within-nest tasks such as brood rearing and queen attendance and transition to tasks outside the nest as they age. We examined temporal polyethism in the ant Pheidole dentata by constructing single-age cohort subcolonies and directly determining the ability of young and old minor workers to care for the queen and developing brood. In contrast to the predictions of most temporal polyethism models, larvae reared by old workers gained significantly more mass than those reared by young workers, and did not differ significantly in mass from larvae reared by groups of workers of intermediate age. Additionally, old workers were more responsive to brood care and queen care needs than young workers: old workers approached, cared for and retrieved brood more frequently than young workers, and engaged in more queen-directed behaviours even though young workers tended to remain in closer proximity to the queen. These results do not support the traditional characterization of young workers as a discrete temporal caste specialized to respond to queen and brood needs. Although brood and queen care are performed earlier in development than foraging, older workers retain the ability to perform these tasks and do so with high efficiency. Our study suggests that the apparent specialization of young P. dentata minor workers on nursing may be an artefact of their age-related repertoire expansion and development of task proficiencies.

AB Antipredator behaviour theory provides a framework to understand the mechanisms behind human wildlife interactions; however, little is known about the role of visual systems in the responses to humans. We quantified responses of brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater (Boddaert), and mourning doves, Zenaida macroura (Linnaeus), to object approach (a ground-based vehicle) and vehicle lighting regimen, and we examined two visual properties (visual acuity and visual fields) that could influence antipredator behaviour. Brown-headed cowbird groups exposed to vehicle approach and constant illumination of the vehicle-mounted lamp showed alert behaviour earlier than did groups exposed to pulsating treatments or no lamp. Interestingly, light treatments interacted with ambient light; cowbird alert response occurred sooner under sunny conditions and constant illumination of the lamp. Mourning doves were not affected by light treatments. Between species, mourning dove groups had a quicker alert response (and slower flight response) than brown-headed cowbirds. Visual acuity was higher and the visual field was wider in mourning doves than in brown-headed cowbirds. We speculate that brown-headed cowbirds might flush sooner to reduce predation risk costs associated with a relatively lower ability to visually track a given object. Our findings have theoretical and applied implications, as our model species belong to families that show different antipredator responses, and provide insight as to how object lighting might be used to reduce bird-structure/vehicle collisions, an increasing source of mortality in birds.

AB Recognition requires the existence of distinct cues and the ability to detect and discriminate between these signals. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we investigated the chemical composition of 143 anal scent gland secretions from 84 individually known spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, in three clans in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. In total, 252 volatile compounds were detected. Comparison of the chemical composition of individual scent profiles by calculating the Bray-Curtis similarity index and using an analysis of similarities revealed that scent profiles varied significantly between individuals but also changed in composition over time. There was no difference in complexity, in terms of the number of different compounds, between male and female scent or between scent from high- and low-ranking females. Scent profiles of closely related females were as similar as profiles of unrelated females. Although there was no evidence of rank-related changes in profiles across the entire female social hierarchy, the profiles of high-ranking females differed significantly from those of low-ranking females, suggesting the presence of an olfactory badge of status. Behaviourally, adult females responded to scent deposited on vegetation by other females significantly faster and more often, and were more likely to anoint themselves with that scent, as the social rank of the female who had deposited the scent increased. These results suggest that spotted hyaena scent carries both an olfactory badge of status and individually distinct cues that are likely to be useful in the maintenance of a social network within their fission-fusion society.

AB Individuals in many types of animal groups show both reproductive and task-related division of labour. In some social insect species, such division of labour may be related to the spatial organization of workers inside the nest. We examined colonies of bumblebees and found that (1) 11-13% of workers maintained small spatial fidelity zones inside the nest, and all workers tended to remain at a specific distance from the colony centre independent of their age; (2) smaller individuals maintained smaller spatial zones and tended to be closer to the centre; and (3) individuals that were more likely to perform the in-nest task of larval feeding tended to remain in the centre of the nest, whereas foragers were more often found on the periphery of the nest when not foraging. Individuals that performed other tasks did not maintain a predictable distance to the centre, and there was no evidence that spatial preferences changed over time. Instead, spatial patterns may result from inherent differences between individuals in terms of activity level, and may be a self-organized sorting mechanism that influences division of labour among workers.

AB In animals, including humans, free access to high-quality (generally energy-dense) food can result in obesity, leading to physiological and health problems. Consequently, various captive animals, including laboratory and companion animals and certain farm animals, are often kept on a restricted diet. Quantitative restriction of food is associated with signs of hunger such as increases in feeding motivation, activity and redirected oral behaviours which may develop into stereotypies. An alternative approach to energy intake restriction is to provide more food, but of a reduced quality. Such alternative diets are usually high in fibre and have lower energy density. The benefits of these alternative diets for animals are controversial: some authors argue that they result in more normal feeding behaviour, promote satiety and so improve animal welfare; others argue that 'metabolic hunger' remains no matter how the restriction of energy intake and weight gain is achieved. We discuss the different arguments behind this controversy, focusing on two well-researched cases of food-restricted farmed livestock: pregnant sows and broiler breeders. Disagreement between experts results from differences in assumptions about what determines and controls feeding behaviour and food intake, from the methodology of assessing animal hunger and from the weighting placed on 'naturalness' of behaviour as a determinant of welfare. Problems with commonly used behavioural and physiological measures of hunger are discussed. Future research into animal feeding preferences, in particular the relative weight placed on food quantity and quality, would be valuable, alongside more fundamental research into the changes in feeding physiology associated with alternative diets.

AB To test the hypothesis that variation in aerial flocking behaviour is adaptively related to predation risk, we described and quantified the flocking patterns of starlings, approaching two urban roosts, which differed in predation pressure ( by peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus). We predicted that the higher predation pressure in one of the roosts would be reflected in larger and more compact flocks, thought to be less vulnerable to predation than small flocks. Incoming flocks, not under direct attack, were observed during winter for 53 days. We identified 12 flocking shapes. Significantly higher frequencies of compact and large flocks were observed in the roost with high predation pressure, while small flocks and singletons were more frequent at the roost with low predation pressure. Similar patterns were observed in both roosts when other flocks displayed antipredator behaviour, even when far away and in the absence of the predator at the focal roost. This may indicate that social information passed between flocks affects flocking decisions. Predation success was higher at the roost with low predation. These results suggest that aerial flocking patterns are affected by predation risk and possibly by the behaviour of other flocks in response to direct attacks.

AB Kin recognition abilities allow individuals to treat relatives differently. In mate choice contexts, kin recognition can ensure individuals avoid the costs of inbreeding. However, there is also the potential for assortative preferences for genetic similarity as part of an optimal outbreeding strategy. We tested the kin recognition abilities of captive female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in standard mate choice trials. A full individual cross-fostering scheme ensured that all subjects grew up in broods of only unrelated nestmates and were raised by unrelated foster parents. Therefore, individuals could use only self-referent phenotype matching (or recognition alleles), since exposure to genetic kin was excluded completely. Females were allowed the simultaneous choice between an unfamiliar genetic brother and unfamiliar, unrelated stimulus males. We used three cohorts of birds (199 females in total) that allowed three independent hypothesis tests. We found a significant avoidance of the unfamiliar brother in the first cohort, but could not replicate this finding in the other two cohorts. This was not easily explained by differences in the treatment of the cohorts, since the difference between cohorts was nonsignificant and testable differences in treatments did not show significant effects. The combined effect size was very low (d = -0.048) and nonsignificant. The initial finding of disassortative preferences may represent a type I error or there may be a true effect that is very weak and not easily reproducible. In any case, we did not find evidence of assortative preferences based on self-referent phenotype matching. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB According to life history theory, it is particularly important for long-lived iteroparous species to balance effort invested in reproduction against risks to future reproductive potential, leading to a conflict between investment in current versus potential future offspring. If providing care for offspring entails a risk of predation, parents must compromise between ensuring offspring growth and survival and ensuring their own survival. We addressed three hypotheses for the outcome of this conflict, which focus on different costs and benefits, and relate variation in parental effort to: ( 1) the parent's own risk of predation; ( 2) the reproductive value of the offspring; and ( 3) the harm that offspring would suffer in the absence of such care. We tested these hypotheses using Manx shearwaters, Puffinus puffinus, which, in common with many burrow-nesting seabirds, are active above ground only at night as a means of reducing attacks by diurnal avian predators. We found that parents were far less likely to return to the colony on moonlit nights, when they were vulnerable to such predators, and tended to delay their arrival until after moonset, which strongly supported hypothesis ( 1). Also, parents of chicks in good condition were more likely to attend the burrow on moonlit nights than those of chicks in poor condition, which supported hypothesis ( 2) but not hypothesis ( 3). Growth of chicks was suppressed on clear nights around the full moon, such that they experienced well-below average growth during one week in four. This could help explain the accumulation of fat stores by the chick that has evolved in some nocturnal seabirds. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In most cooperatively breeding bird species, individuals live year round in all-purpose territories that may vary greatly in quality. Territory resource availability is likely to influence the investment in provisioning the brood, and different group members may respond in different ways, according to individual strategies of investment in self-maintenance or current reproduction. Although this may be important for understanding division of labour within the group, few studies have investigated how individuals respond to changing conditions 'at home'. In cooperatively breeding carrion crows, Corvus corone, chick provisioning is costly and both breeders and helpers allocate additional resources to self-maintenance, rather than the current brood, when food availability is temporarily augmented during the breeding season. However, here we show that helpers, but not breeders, increased their chick-feeding rate when territory resources were experimentally enhanced throughout the year. These results indicate a role of year-round territory quality in shaping cooperation at the nest in this species. We suggest that the probabilities of reproducing in the following breeding season, which are higher for breeders than for helpers, modulate the effect of long-term resource abundance on individual provisioning decisions, leading to a higher investment in the current brood by helpers only.

AB Historically, intertroop movement by males in female-philopatric species has been investigated without any consideration of the potential for variance in the competitive ability of males. This is despite the fact that in many species, particularly among the primates, males tend to move multiple times between groups and often vary substantially in their competitive ability. We investigated this issue using 7 years' data from a long-term study of chacma baboons, Papio hamadryas ursinus. We predicted that variance in competitive ability would promote differentiation in dispersal strategies, with competitively effective males favouring long-term measures of a troop's potential reproductive output and low-quality males favouring short-term measures. Using time series analysis, we found that overall patterns of movement were significantly associated with two independent measures of a troop's demography: absolute female number and excess male number. Furthermore, when the analysis was broken down by competitive ability, we found that only high-quality males responded to the absolute number of females and only low-quality males were sensitive to excess male number. Therefore, we conclude that variance in competitive ability has promoted the evolution of alternative dispersal strategies in male chacma baboons.

AB In matrilineal societies, competition between females can occur within and between social units. Dominance hierarchies reduce costly conflicts when reliable cues of status are available, and reproductive condition may alter individual or group status. Female African elephants live in matriarchal groups with linear dominance hierarchies occurring within and between groups; elephants use chemical signals to mediate social interactions. If reproductive condition has important implications for inter- or intragroup behaviour, then females should discriminate between chemical signal sources that reveal reproductive condition. We examined whether trunk-tip contacts between females within a social group were related to phase of oestrus. Observations were conducted on 21 reproductively viable females at nine zoological facilities in North America. Females in the follicular phase received contacts to the urogenital region at a higher rate than did luteal phase females, and contacts increased with approaching ovulation. This supports the existence of an oestrous signal. We also examined whether an oestrous signal was evident by female investigation of urine collected from the luteal and follicular phases of unfamiliar conspecifics. Elephants responded to unfamiliar urine more than to the control, but response rates to the urine types did not differ. Females within a social unit detected differences in oestrus, but they did not show such discrimination to urinary signals from unfamiliar females. Further evaluation of the existence of a female-to-female oestrous pheromone requires assessing responses to urine from familiar individuals. Understanding the relationship between oestrous condition and dominance status can shed light on the adaptive value of sociality. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The importance of the acoustic cuescape is often overlooked in studies of animal orientation. Recent studies have shown that reef noise affects the behaviour and orientation of settlement-stage coral reef fish. This response may simply facilitate orientation to reefs; alternatively, acoustic habitat cues could also facilitate the remote selection of suitable settlement habitats. To test which components of reef noise evoke behavioural responses in larval fish, we used light traps to measure the responses of a diverse range of settlement-stage fish to the filtered 'high' (570-2000 Hz)- and 'low' (< 570 Hz)- frequency components of reef noise and compared these catches with those from control 'silent' traps. Of the seven families represented by > 10 individuals, four (Pomacentridae, Apogonidae, Lethrinidae and Gobiidae) were caught in significantly greater numbers in the high-frequency traps than either the low-frequency or the silent traps. The Syngnathidae preferred high- to low-frequency traps, while the Blenniidae preferred high-frequency to silent traps. Only the Siganidae showed no preference between any of the sound treatments. Although some species-level variation in response was found, the general trend was a preference for high- frequency traps. This study suggests that most settlement-stage fish select the higher-frequency audible component of reef noise, which is produced mainly by marine invertebrates, as a means of selectively orienting towards suitable settlement habitats. The results highlight potential impacts of anthropogenic noise pollution and habitat modification in affecting the natural behaviour of reef fish at a critical stage in their life history.

AB Conflict resolution is an essential component of primate sociality that has been studied extensively within primate social groups, but few studies have examined how conflict resolution behaviours covary at evolutionary scales. We assembled a standardized data set on social interactions of sexually mature females to analyse patterns of conflict resolution in 15 groups of nine macaque species. Between-group comparisons revealed no significant difference in nonkin reconciliation levels between groups of the same species, whereas substantial interspecific differences were found. We tested for associations between four behavioural traits involving reconciliation and dominance asymmetry that play a central role in primate social systems. Regression analyses using group values indicated that these traits (conciliatory tendencies, proportions of explicit reconciliatory contacts, kin bias and levels of counteraggression) exist as an integrated suite of characters. We found strong phylogenetic signal in most traits, which further indicates that they evolved during the adaptive radiation of macaques. Using the method of independent contrasts, relationships between conciliatory tendencies and proportions of explicit reconciliatory contacts and between kin bias and levels of counteraggression remained consistent after controlling for phylogeny. This reveals that evolutionary change in one trait leads to correlated changes in other traits. Collectively, these results show how comparative studies of detailed behavioural interactions can be used to elucidate primate socioecology.

AB Intraguild predation is increasingly reported as a population-limiting factor for vertebrate predators. However, long-term coexistence of the intraguild prey with its predator is a common occurrence usually maintained by some form of predator avoidance, which may be achieved through distance-sensitive avoidance (selection of sites as far as possible from the intraguild predator), and/or habitat-mediated avoidance (avoidance of habitats associated with high predation risk). The former is expected when the distribution of the predator is heterogeneous, leaving gaps which can be exploited by the prey, while the latter is expected at high predator densities, when few predation refugia are available. To date, few studies have focused on such switch in predator avoidance under changing scenarios of intraguild predator density. To test this hypothesis, we censused tawny owls (Strix aluco, body mass similar to 0.4 - 0.7 kg) and their intraguild predator, the eagle owl (Bubo bubo, similar to 1.5 - 4 kg), in 12 areas of the Alps. As predicted, tawny owls were indifferent to predator distance in an area of low predation risk, they switched to distance- sensitive avoidance in an area of medium predator density and to habitat- mediated avoidance in an area of high predator density with few available refugia. Actual predation rates were low, but increased with proximity to the intraguild predator nest. Similarly, tawny owl breeding output declined with closeness to an eagle owl nest. Habitat loss associated with predator avoidance translated into population effects, leading to a negative relationship between the densities of the two owl species. The spatial gaps in tawny owl distribution caused by eagle owls indirectly favoured other owl species, resulting in higher diversity of the overall owl community and suggesting that eagle owls acted as keystone predators. Our results suggest that intraguild predation may alter habitat choices and affect density, productivity and guild structure of vertebrate mesopredators. Such effects are probably more common than previously thought.(c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Processes of seed predation and dispersal are crucial for tree regeneration and forest dynamics. To understand the role of the dung beetle, Thorectes lusitanicus (Col., Scarabaeoidea, Geotrupidae) as secondary seed disperser in Mediterranean oak forests, its food preference was investigated in the field and in the laboratory. This paper had for objectives (1) to explore the feeding preferences for acorns of the two species available in the field: Quercus suber and Quercus canariensis, and (2) to study the olfactory and palatability response of T. lusitanicus to different food resources (oak acorns and dung) under laboratory conditions. The number of beetles in the field was curvilinearly related to the number of acorns, being higher when the number of acorns was intermediate. The maximum values of T. lusitanicus density corresponded to those plots located under Q. suber trees with the highest total weight of acorns. Bioassays with a four-armed olfactometer showed that T. lusitanicus was clearly attracted to volatiles of Q. suber acorns more than to of dung. Palatability bioassays also showed significant preferences for acorns of Q. suber in comparison with the typical food previously described for this beetle species (dung). According to our results, we suggest that a diet based on acorns (due to their high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids) probably satisfies the nutritional requirements of T. lusitanicus during winter, larval development, and metamorphosis.

AB Nestling birds could minimize the risk of being overheard by predators by becoming silent after parental alarm calls, begging only when parents arrive with food, and independently assessing cues that a predator is nearby. Begging only to parents is challenging because young that respond quickly can be more likely to be fed, so there is a benefit of using subtle cues of parental arrival, potentially leading to erroneous begging. Parents might reduce the risk of error by giving food calls signalling that they have arrived with food, but there have been few studies contrasting begging to food calls compared with other parental vocalizations. Furthermore, it is unknown whether nestlings can use acoustic cues to independently detect predators. White-browed scrubwren, Seticornis frontalis, nestlings become silent after parental alarm calls, but it is unknown whether they respond specifically to parental food calls or directly to predator sounds. We conducted a field playback experiment, and found that young begged more vigorously to food calls than other parental vocalizations tested, and nearly as strongly to playback as during real feeding visits by parents. However, nestlings also mistakenly begged to playback of superb fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus, song, possibly because of acoustic similarities to food calls. Finally, nestlings responded with silence to playback of the sound of their major predator (pied currawong, Strepera graculina) walking on leaf litter. Scrubwren nestlings can therefore be 'switched on' and 'switched off' by parental vocalizations, are prone to error, and may independently assess risk.

AB Many prey organisms reduce their activity to reduce predation risk. A common argument is that a reduction in activity is one of the highest costs of defence. I exposed predator-induced and predator-naive morphs to a short-term predator environment and recorded behavioural, life-historical, physiological, and morphological responses. In contrast to expectation, reduced activity was not one of the highest costs of responding to predators. Predator-exposed tadpoles ingested the same amount of food with less feeding effort and evacuated food from their guts at a higher rate. Despite these advantages, predator-exposed tadpoles still paid costs in responding to predators, in decreased development rate. They did not have reduced survival or reduced growth. Costs in responding to predators are probably caused by physiological factors, such as reduced conversion rates, increased metabolic rates or by allocation to morphological defences, such as increased tail depth. My results show that feeding activity is not linked to the amount of food ingested and that physiological mechanisms, such as gut evacuation, decouple feeding activity and ingestion from growth, development and survival. There was no adaptive response in gut morphology. My study improves the understanding of the underlying internal and physiological mechanisms mediating the tradeoff between activity and. costs of predator-induced defences.

AB Male-female pair bonds are common to most bird species, and these bonds affect fundamental aspects of mating systems and the strength of selection, for example, by limiting extrapair paternity. Therefore, understanding factors that strengthen and erode pair bonds are important in elucidating the selection pressures that avian populations will experience. Here, we studied the effects of environmental noise on pair bonds and the strength of pair preferences ( i. e. preferences for a pair- bonded partner versus an unfamiliar individual) in the monogamous zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, a model species in studies of sexual selection. Based on a previous study, we hypothesized that high- amplitude environmental noise would decrease the strength of pair preferences. Explicitly, we tested whether females' relative preference for their pair- bonded males, compared with extrapair males, decreased as the amplitude of environmental white noise increased. Our results generally supported our hypothesis, as females' preference for their pair-bonded males significantly decreased under conditions of high environmental noise. This erosion of preference may result from the masking or distortion of the paired males' pair- bond maintaining call, although the decrease in preference could also occur because a female cannot recognize her pair- bonded male. Our findings suggest that songbird populations in areas with high environmental noise may have ( temporarily or permanently) weakened pair bonds, suggesting that extrapair behaviours could increase in areas of greater environmental noise.

AB The value of information on the status of alternative food patches depends upon an animal's ability to exploit those patches; this will depend upon whether it is foraging in a group and its position within the group's social hierarchy. We tested the patch-leaving decisions of sheep, Ovis aries, foraging alone or in pairs in a two-food patch environment. Upon entering an arena the sheep were presented first with a 'stable' patch; a second, unseen patch contained a highly preferred but variable reward. Sheep were individually trained to expect a high or a low probability of reward in the variable patch before the paired tests. When foraging alone, dominant and subordinate individuals left the stable patch earlier when the probability of reward in the variable patch was high; both thus responded to variation in environmental quality. When tested in pairs, dominants followed if subordinates left the stable patch, regardless of their training, whereas subordinates were more likely to follow dominants when the subordinates' training was in a high-quality environment. Thus, while both subordinate and dominant animals can learn the expectation of rewards in a variable environment when foraging alone, dominant animals in pairs use information about both their own and the subordinate's expectation of the environmental quality when deciding whether to move to another patch. In contrast, subordinates may disregard their own experience of environmental quality if it will lead to confrontation with dominants for access to preferred food.

AB Discrimination between conspecifics is important in mediating social interactions between several individuals in a network environment. In great tits, Parus major, females readily distinguish between the songs of their mate and those of a stranger. The high degree of song sharing among neighbouring males, however, raises the question of whether females are also able to perceive differences between songs shared by their mate and a neighbour. The great tit is a socially monogamous, hole-nesting species with biparental care. Pair bond maintenance and coordination of the pair's reproductive efforts are important, and the female's ability to recognize her mate's song should therefore be adaptive. In a neighbour-mate discrimination playback experiment, we presented 13 incubating great tit females situated inside nestboxes with a song of their mate and the same song type from a neighbour. Each female was tested in two trials with the opposite order of stimulus presentation. Eleven females responded to the song of their mate in both trials, while two females responded to those of their mate in one trial and a neighbour in the other. Thus, great tit females are able to perceive subtle individual differences between their mate's song and a neighbour's rendition of the same song type despite being inside nestboxes, which are known to alter the received song structure and intensity. We suggest that this female discrimination ability inside nest holes is mediated by a high perceptual sensitivity towards small variations in song structure that should be adaptive to this hole-nesting bird species.

AB We investigated the influence of caste on nestmate discrimination in the ponerine ant Pachycondyla luteipes, where workers lack functional ovaries and are totally sterile. Both a mark-and-recapture field experiment and an introduction experiment in the laboratory revealed intermixing of both nestmate and non-nestmate workers between nests. In the laboratory experiment, conspecific workers, both nestmate and non-nestmates, were almost always accepted. Workers' internest hostility was weak and did not correlate with the distance between nests over the geographical scale studied (< 130 m). However, workers responded differentially to nestmate and non-nestmate workers, grooming non-nestmates more frequently than nestmates. In contrast, non-nestmate queens were usually violently attacked by resident workers, and as a result only 30% were accepted. Nestmate queens were always accepted with no aggression. Our results indicate that P. luteipes workers have the ability to recognize nestmates but are not aggressive when the non-nestmates are sterile workers. Such caste-biased acceptance has been predicted by kin selection in relation to the avoidance of intraspecific social parasitism and regulation of queen numbers.

AB The ability to learn context-specific information regarding local predation risk is of prime importance for prey individuals balancing the conflicting demands of predator avoidance with other fitness-enhancing activities. Many taxonomically diverse prey species must learn to recognize novel predators and make context-appropriate responses. Predator-recognition learning in freshwater prey fish is commonly facilitated through the association of a novel predator cue with a damage-released chemical alarm cue. While a multitude of laboratory studies have demonstrated the sophistication of chemically mediated predator-recognition learning, no field verifications of this mechanism have been conducted. We conducted an experiment to determine whether the single pairing of a novel odour (lemon essence) with a damage-released chemical alarm cue could function to facilitate learning in wild juvenile Atlantic salmon under fully natural conditions. Tagged juvenile salmon were initially exposed to either a paired stimulus of conspecific alarm cue and lemon odour or a control of stream water and lemon odour. As predicted, salmon exposed to the alarm cue during the conditioning trials showed a significant increase in antipredator response. When salmon were subsequently exposed to lemon odour alone, only those initially exposed to the alarm cue paired with the lemon odour showed a significant increase in alarm response. Those initially exposed to the stream water and lemon odour control did not show any change in behaviour (i.e. did not learn). As such, these data demonstrate that chemically mediated, acquired predator recognition can occur under fully natural conditions. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When males produce ejaculates that ensure only partial fertility of females' eggs, we expect adaptations to increase fertility in both males and females. Males are predicted to allocate their ejaculates strategically between females with respect to female reproductive quality, while females are predicted to prefer to mate with highly fertile males. Males and females cannot directly assess a potential partner's reproductive quality, but quality may be reliably signalled by visible phenotypic traits. We investigated the potential influence of eyespan, a sexually selected trait, on fertility after a single mating in the sexually dimorphic stalk-eyed fly Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni. We found that female eyespan was an accurate predictor of fecundity and large-eyespan females laid more than twice as many eggs as small-eyespan females. Large-eyespan females also laid more fertile eggs after a single mating than small-eyespan females did. This difference can in part be explained by males strategically allocating more ejaculate to large-eyespan females, and we found evidence for this as males produced larger spermatophores when mated to large-eyespan females. In contrast, we failed to find evidence that male eyespan had any effect on female fertility after a single copulation. However, female mate preferences for large-eyespan males may still be an adaptation to cope with male ejaculate limitation in C. dalmanni as males with a large eyespan have larger accessory glands and mate more frequently.

AB We examined whether behavioural variation within an enemy complex attacking the willow leaf beetle, Phratora vulgatissima, influences the population dynamics of this gregarious prey. The most common enemies are three species of heteropteran arthropods: the two mirids Orthotylus marginalis and Closterotomus folvomaculatus and the anthocorid Anthocoris nemorum. When attacking egg clusters on plants in the laboratory, the two mirids consumed a greater proportion of eggs within egg clusters than the anthocorid. The anthocorid visited and ate eggs from more egg clusters than both the mirids. The two foraging strategies have been characterized as 'find and stay' for the mirids and 'run and eat' for the anthocorid. By using a stochastic exponential growth model we showed that model prey experienced different temporal dynamics when exposed to predators that differ in the probabilities of finding prey aggregations and of consuming prey within aggregations. Model prey exposed to the find and stay type of predator was less likely to become established and to increase in abundance than model prey exposed to the run and eat type. In a field study, we found a correspondence between high abundance of find and stay mirids and low densities of leaf beetles. The results suggest that, even when average predation rate is constant, the foraging strategy of the predator can have population level consequences for the prey. The consumption of prey in dense patches seems to be important in the control of gregarious prey, especially in the early phase of prey population establishment.

AB The behavioural and physical mechanisms involved in the tactics used by predators to catch their prey have been explored for a wide variety of vertebrate taxa but most studies have considered the viewpoints of predator and prey independently. We tackled this issue using an ecologically relevant predator-prey model: wolf spiders (Pardosa spp.) and wood crickets, Nemobius sylvestris. Crickets are particularly challenging prey to catch because their air-sensing systems enable them to detect small air movements caused by approaching predators. Using a high-speed video camera, we found that freely behaving spiders adopted either a fast or a slow velocity tactic to approach crickets. We then developed a device using a piston to simulate, as faithfully as possible, the spider's attack. The air flow generated by the piston was quantified by particle image velocimetry and then used to test the escape success of crickets at different attack velocities. Cricket escape success was lower for low and high piston velocities, matching the two tactics adopted by the spiders. Based on our results, we propose that the escape probability of prey after a given predator signal can be explained by the distance between the prey and the predator, the velocity of the predator and the strength of the signal. Both methodological and conceptual approaches presented in this study could provide useful methods to understand the biological and physical basis of predatory tactics in other animals.

TI Fighting for harems: assessment strategies during male-male contests in

AB Females often aggregate at particular sites for feeding or shelter, thus giving adult males the opportunity to defend harems and increase male reproductive success. Rival males compete for control of harems via ritualized displays or direct combat using weaponry. Contests for harems or the resources required by females can be settled based on asymmetries in fighting ability or resource ownership. Males that accurately assess a rival's fighting ability prior to engaging in potentially costly combat should be favoured by selection. Game theory and optimality models provide three models to explain how individuals decide to persist in or flee from a fight. These models are the energetic war of attrition, the sequential assessment model and the cumulative assessment model. Using staged contests in the laboratory, I tested predictions of these models using the Wellington tree weta, Hemideina crassidens, a sexually dimorphic insect native to New Zealand. Male H. crassidens use their enlarged mandibles as weapons in fights for access to adult females that reside in cavities in trees. My results supported a prediction common to each assessment model: contest duration was negatively correlated with the asymmetry in opponent's weapon size. The sequential assessment model of contest settlement was partially supported but the strongest support was for the cumulative assessment model. Predictions of the latter model were supported because: (1) fights are apparently settled based on own-size assessment; (2) fights occur in a single phase and escalate; and (3) contests involve physical combat and injury. I suggest that, in nocturnal species, cumulative assessment will generally be most applicable. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB High tides force shorebirds from intertidal feeding areas to sites known as roosts. We investigated the roost selection of great knots, Calidris tenuirostris, and red knots, Calidris canutus, on a tropical coastline in northwestern Australia, assessing several roost attributes and recording the frequency of use of each site through automatic radiotelemetry. To model roost choice we used two approaches: (1) conditional logistic regression models that assumed roost selection to be a trade-off based on a probabilistic assessment of several environmental characteristics; and (2) bounds-based models that assumed that birds selected the nearest roost site to their feeding grounds, provided that threshold values for certain environmental characteristics were met. Bounds-based models were more effective, and we suggest that they offer a closer approach to real roost choice mechanisms. By day, roost choice was affected by distance from the feeding area and microclimate; birds selected nearby roosts where they could stand on cool, wet substrates. Different roost selection criteria were used at night when birds chose safer, but more distant, roosts. Models that assumed that roost choice was influenced by recent experience of roost sites performed better than models that assumed constant assessment of roost quality. This effect was significant only at night, suggesting that memory was used more when information on roost quality was limited. Evidence that roost availability may influence selection of foraging areas is also presented. Our results suggest that shorebirds select roosts by using simple mechanisms, making roost choice models a potentially valuable tool in conservation planning.

AB The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis posits that androgen-mediated signals honestly indicate the responsiveness of the immune system because of the immunosuppressive effect of androgens. However, androgen levels may also be related to nutritional status, and differences in body condition could be a more parsimonious explanation for variation in the expression of the signal. We maintained captive male red-legged partridges, Alectoris rufa, under regulated food shortage until they reached 85% of their initial body mass. Controls were provided with food ad libitum. After food shortage, experimental birds had lower androgen and higher corticosterone levels than controls. The condition dependence in androgen levels suggests that androgen-mediated signals could be indicating general nutritional state rather than immune function specifically. We propose that androgen-dependent signals may act as indicators of body condition or indicators of immune system quality, depending on the nutritional status of the individual.

DT Article
ID MATE-CHOICE; EXPERIENCE; PERCEPTION; SPARROWS
AB Male song development has been studied in detail across a range of different songbird species. Very little, however, is known about the development of preferences for songs in females. Here we describe a method to study female preferences outside the breeding season by documenting female responses to playbacks of songs of different developmental stages and of varying quality. We compared 'wingstroke' responses of juvenile and adult females in four groups across autumn, winter and spring. We found that adult, but not juvenile, females showed preferences for variable song that was developmentally advanced. We assessed female preferences for the songs in the breeding season by playing back songs in sound-attenuation chambers and recording the number of copulation solicitation displays females gave to each song. We detected a strong relationship between wingstroke patterns in spring and song preferences, but we did not detect this relationship in the autumn or winter. Female preferences, like male songs, appear to show seasonal and developmental plasticity. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   BEHAVIOR; HOST; SUSCEPTIBILITY; TESTOSTERONE; ENVIRONMENT
AB An individual's social environment can substantially affect its physiology, but few studies have examined how social behaviour influences individual immune responses. Here, I use a within-individual experimental approach to test whether social status within a group has a direct effect on immunity. I quantified humoral immunocompetence for male house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, in both randomized and manipulated social environments. For initially dominant males, forced decreases in social status resulted in proportional decreases in antibody response to sheep red blood cells. However, for initially subordinate males, changes in social status did not alter antibody titres. Differences in aggressive behaviour between and within flocks suggest that this asymmetry of effects between initial dominants and subordinates may relate to the extent of aggression experienced within each social context. Aggression rates increased dramatically in flocks when initially dominant males were placed together, but did not change when initially subordinate males were combined. Furthermore, the degree of increase in defeat rate for an initially dominant male was the strongest predictor of resulting decreases in immune response. Taken together, these results suggest that physiological changes in response to aggressive interactions, and defeat in particular, probably mediate the association between social status and immunity in this system. This study represents the first experimental demonstration that changes in social status can cause corresponding changes in immunity in an outbred vertebrate population. Results of this work suggest that an individual's social environment may directly mediate its ability to resist parasites and pathogens, an important component of fitness.

AB How work is organized varies in social insect colonies. Some investigators have argued that the queen plays an active role in regulating worker activity in species with small, simple colonies, but that work is self-organized in species with large, complex colonies. Here, we present data that suggest that two species of paper wasps do not fit this pattern. Polistes wasps are traditionally classified as primitively eusocial wasps, showing characteristics of simple insect societies, such as small colony sizes, lack of queen-worker dimorphism, and queen control of both reproduction and worker activity. Colony activity in Polistes is episodic; quiet periods are followed by periods of intense activity when most wasps in the colony are active. We tested whether queens in P. instabilis and P. dominulus controlled work by initiating active periods, goading workers into activity. Instead, we found that colony activity was initiated by the behaviours of workers arriving at the colony, walking across the nest face or, less commonly, antennating, leaving or gaster wagging. Queens initiated no more activity periods than the average worker. Furthermore, activity levels in colonies of P. dominulus in which the queen was removed did not differ significantly from activity levels in colonies with queens. Polistes instabilis and P. dominulus colonies showed characteristics of primitively eusocial insect societies, but also showed worker initiation of colony activity, suggesting that these two species represent examples of an intermediate level of colony organization in which queens control reproduction but do not control the organization of work.

AB Home range size in birds and mammals appears to be influenced by a number of factors including food availability, body mass and population density. However, few studies have convincingly shown population density to influence the extent of space use in a population of free-ranging carnivores without a corresponding increase in food availability. We investigated the relative effects of food availability, body weight and increased density on the size of adult bobcat, Lynx rufus, home ranges and core areas in Mississippi, U.S.A. during 1989-1997. We observed an increase in population density and a decrease in annual mean home range and core area sizes for males and females during this 9-year study. Population density explained 64% and 56% of the variation in home range size for males and females, respectively, whereas food availability and body weight failed to explain the observed reduction in bobcat home range size. Population density was also the most important variable explaining variation in core areas for both sexes, although food availability also appeared to contribute to variation, especially for females. We suggest that population density should be considered along with energy acquisition and metabolic factors such as food availability and body size when investigating variability in home range and core area sizes of mammals.

AB In the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, hatchlings do not benefit from parental care and have to search independently for their own food. We investigated the effect of exposing newly hatched cuttlefish to a nonpreferred prey on their subsequent choice of prey. We tested the choice of food between crabs (nonpreferred) and shrimps (preferred) made by 3-day-old cuttlefish that had been exposed visually and chemically to crabs at hatching, or had been exposed visually only to crabs, or had had no exposure to crabs. juveniles that had been exposed to crabs significantly preferred crabs, whereas hatchlings that had had no crab exposure preferred shrimps. These results show that a simple visual exposure to a naturally nonpreferred prey immediately on hatching is sufficient to change the juvenile cuttlefish's innate preference.

AB Interspecific territoriality is usually interpreted to result from interspecific interference competition, although it may also originate from mistaken species recognition. In the latter case, it may be based on Similarity of secondary sexual characters. In the damselfly Calopteryx splendens, males have pigmented wing spots as a sexual character, and males with the largest spots resemble males of another species, Calopteryx virgo. Probably because of this resemblance, C. virgo males are more aggressive towards large- than small-spotted C. splendens males. We examined whether wing spot size of C. splendens males affects territorial interactions between the species. In a removal experiment, the number of territorial C. splendens increased after C. virgo males were removed. However, interspecific territoriality was incomplete since before the removal the territories of the species partially overlapped. Wing spot size of C. splendens seemed to affect interspecific territoriality: before the removal territorial and nonterritorial C. splendens males had similar spot sizes and the distance to the nearest C. virgo territory increased with wing spot size of C. splendens. In addition, after the removal of C. virgo, the relation between wing spot size and the distance to the nearest old C. virgo territory disappeared. Our results suggest that mistaken species recognition may account for the interspecific territorial behaviour in the two species. Furthermore, interspecific territoriality may cause negative selection on wing spot size and thus may explain character displacement in wing spot size of C. splendens males.

This study examined relationships between social behaviour and androgens excreted by adult male spotted hyaenas. In this species, males rarely direct reproductive aggression towards other males, but they actively court females that are socially dominant to them. We tested,whether intersexual interactions were associated with elevated androgens in adult males. We combined behavioural data collected over 7 years from one large clan in Kenya with analysis of faecal androgens (fA) to determine which of the following were the best predictors of fA concentrations in males: social rank, tenure in the clan, courtship, association with females in particular reproductive states, reproductive aggression among males or nonreproductive aggression among males. We found no systematic influence of age or social status on fA in either adult natal or immigrant males. Concentrations of fA were greater in immigrants when they courted females than at other times, and greater fA concentrations were also associated with male-male aggression involving defence of a female but not with male-male aggression occurring in other contexts. fA concentrations in immigrants were also positively correlated with degree of association with females near the time of conception, but not with lactating females. These findings suggest that androgen concentrations in immigrant male hyaenas are more related to interactions with attractive females than to competitive male interactions. The most important challenge to adult males may be interacting with attractive females to which males are socially subordinate.

AB We tested whether migrating Aphrissa statira butterflies orient with a magnetic compass. We captured migrants flying over Lake Gatun, Panama, and exposed experimental butterflies to a strong magnetic field. These and unmanipulated control butterflies were released back over the lake. Experimental butterflies had a more dispersed pattern of orientation than control butterflies. The average direction adopted was northeast, 160 degrees anticlockwise to the natural migratory direction. Unmanipulated control butterflies adopted two diametrically opposed orientations: one shifted 33 degrees clockwise, and another 147 degrees anticlockwise, to the migratory direction. Control and experimental butterflies differed in that some controls oriented towards the migratory direction. These differences in orientation support the hypothesis of a sense for magnetic orientation cues. Unmanipulated butterflies released over the lake when the sky was completely overcast were significantly oriented towards their direction before capture (187 degrees and 203 degrees, respectively), further supporting the magnetic compass hypothesis. In a third experiment, we obstructed sun compass cues and reversed the horizontal component of the local geomagnetic field to position magnetic north towards the geographical south pole within a flight arena into which we released individual butterflies. Experimental butterflies experiencing the reversed magnetic field oriented on average 180 degrees opposite to their natural migratory direction. Control butterflies, for which the position of magnetic north was unaltered, were oriented both towards and 180 degrees opposite to the natural migratory direction. This difference between orientations of control and experimental butterflies also supports the hypothesis of a sense for magnetic orientation cues.

AB Using the Strange Situation Test originally developed for testing the mother-infant relationship in humans, we compared the attachment behaviour of extensively socialized (hand-reared) dog, Canis familiaris, and wolf, Canis lupus, puppies towards their human caregiver with that of pet dog puppies of the same age. The experiment was designed to study whether (1) dog puppies as young as 16 weeks show attachment to a human caregiver, (2) extensive socialization by human caregivers affects attachment behaviour of dog puppies and (3) evolutionary changes (in the form of species-specific differences between wolf and dog pups) affect the emergence of dog-human attachment. We found a characteristic selective responsiveness to the owner in young dogs, similar to that observed in adults. This finding supports the view that puppies show patterns of attachment towards their owners. Extensive socialization had only a minor effect on the attachment behaviour in dog puppies, as the behaviour of pet dogs and hand-reared dogs was basically similar. However, we found a significant species-specific difference between wolves and dogs: both extensively socialized and pet dog puppies were more responsive to the owner than to an unfamiliar human participant, whereas extensively socialized wolves were not. Behavioural differences could be best explained by assuming that selective processes took place in the course of domestication (genetic changes) that are related to the attachment system of the dog.

AB Many aquatic organisms use chemical signals as a method of detecting the presence of a predator, but it is not known whether annelids do so. Nereis (Neanthes) virens is a common interticial marine polychaete that is vulnerable to predation from aquatic predators, such as crustacean and fish species, when it partially leaves its burrow. We investigated whether chemical cues associated with predation affect the feeding activity of this polychaete. Exposure of N. virens to conspecific whole-body extracts significantly reduced out-of-burrow activity and the number of individuals feeding in comparison to a sea water control. The addition of whole-body extracts of the congener N. diversicolor, both sexes of the sympatric Arenicola marina and muscle extract of the flatfish predator Pleuronectes platessa (plaice) did not significantly reduce activity levels. The fish muscle extract, however, did significantly reduce the number of individuals feeding. The pattern of activity and timing of feeding through the scotophase was not altered in the presence of extracts, although feeding did occur during the photophase.

ID SELECTION; POLYMORPHISM; PSYCHOLOGY
AB Many signals found in nature seem exaggerated, for instance in size or colour. According to the receiver bias hypothesis such signal features evolve as a consequence of nonfunctional response biases in receivers. In this study we tested this hypothesis using chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, in a virtual evolution experiment testing the potentiality of receiver bias to drive the evolution of exaggerated signals. The chickens played the role of receivers that can respond to the preferred stimuli displayed by the sender on a peck-sensitive computer screen. The preferred stimulus was kept and evolved, in the direction specified by the chicken, before being introduced to the next chicken of the successive generation. The chickens were tested on signals changing in three dimensions: length, intensity and area. In all three cases, the signals became considerably exaggerated and beyond what was required for accurate discrimination. Our results support the hypothesis that response biases emerging in discrimination tasks are sufficient to cause the evolution of signal exaggeration.

AB Multiple signals from different sensory channels can enhance, diminish, or have no effect on one another when they are combined into a multisensory signal. Simultaneous auditory and visual signals are known to be important in avian courtship behaviour, but less is known about how the signal components from the two sensory channels interact and which channel is relied upon more. Here we use audio and video playback methods to test the significance of multisensory signals in the pigeon. We used audio- and videotaped male pigeon courtship behaviour as stimuli to assess behavioural reactions of conspecific females to silent video, to audio alone, to the combination of video and audio stimuli, and to a control video of an empty cage. Females responded to the test presentations by watching, circling, tail spreading and cooing. Considered alone, the audio channel elicited higher female response than did the video channel alone, particularly for female cooing responses. Together, however, the multisensory audio/video signal was more effective than either component alone at eliciting typical female courtship responses of circling and tail spreading. Courtship behaviour of these male pigeons is therefore considered an example of multisensory enhancement, in which the combination of signal channels functions to increase the impact of the communication signal.

ID REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; MATE SELECTION; FEMALE CHOICE; EVOLUTION; BIRDS
AB The degree of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in the cichlid Lamprologus callipterus is the greatest recorded among species in which males exceed females in body size. Males collect and defend empty snail shells in which females breed. We report on the potential importance of different selection mechanisms and constraints on male and female body sizes. To test for the importance of sexual selection, we measured the reproductive behaviour of differently sized males and their reproductive success in the field. Larger males did not have larger nests than smaller males. In the laboratory, we performed male-male competition and female choice experiments and found an indirect effect of large body size on competitive ability and male reproductive success. Neither in the field nor in the laboratory did females choose particular males. To test for the importance of ecological constraints, we studied the significance of shell size for male and female body sizes. Shell-carrying experiments revealed a minimum male threshold size for the ability to carry Neothauma shells. Females chose larger shells than available on average in males' nests, and their reproductive success increased with shell size. However, their size is limited by the availability of large shells. We conclude that the divergent influence of an ecological constraint on male and female body sizes is primarily responsible for this extreme SSD, in combination with size-dependent mechanisms of intrasexual selection.

AB Internally fertilizing hermaphroditic animals show a bewildering variety of mating behaviours and mechanisms and many species have reciprocal sperm exchange. When matings are frequent and costly, partners are predicted to donate more sperm when they receive more sperm (i.e. conditional sperm exchange), but this has been shown experimentally only in sea slugs, free-living flatworms and possibly cestodes. We studied mate choice and sperm reciprocity patterns in the hermaphroditic land snail Succinea putris. Mate choice was random with respect to shell size. However, in matings where the partners were of unequal size, significantly more matings were observed where a small active individual mated on top of a larger inactive individual than the reverse. We suggest that this may be the result of mating on a vertical substrate or hanging underneath a horizontal substrate, because under these conditions it may be easier for a larger, inactive individual to carry a smaller, active one, than vice versa. The number of sperm transferred during mating was highly variable and was not related to the size of the donor, the size of the recipient, the size difference between the two partners or mating duration. Twelve of the 87 matings involved unilateral sperm exchange. There was no evidence for conditional sperm digestion. There was a significant, but weak positive relation between the numbers of sperm donated by the two partners. Hence, it remains unclear whether sperm exchange in S. putris is conditional or not.

AB Whether foragers encounter resources sequentially (one at a time) or simultaneously has received relatively little explicit attention, given its potential importance for success. Here I evaluate the efficiency of naive spiderlings Misumena vatia (Thomisidae) in exploiting hunting sites presented in these two ways. The spiderlings significantly preferred goldenrod (Solidago canadensis) inflorescences over aster (Aster umbellatus) inflorescences, both when these blooms were presented to them one at a time and simultaneously, if they were in physical contact with these blooms, a result that matched the numbers of prey these flowers attract. However, they accepted goldenrod significantly more frequently one at a time than in simultaneous presentations. Even when their substrates were then switched in a reciprocal cross, spiderlings favoured goldenrod over aster, although those moved from goldenrod to aster responded significantly more strongly (negatively) than did the reciprocal crosses. However, spiderlings did not distinguish between goldenrod and aster inflorescences simultaneously presented 10 cm away, and only two-thirds of them managed to recruit via lines to either of the flowers. They responded similarly to two-goldenrod inflorescences or two-aster inflorescences as to mixed goldenrod-aster pairs, and they recruited roughly half as often to a single inflorescence of either species as to pairs. At 50 cm, less than one-fifth recruited to the mixed substrate. Thus, the spiderlings first recruit to a site and then accept or reject it, a time-consuming activity. Costs in time for making simultaneous choices exceed those for one-at-a-time choices, due to their lower success rates in recruiting to the more profitable species.

AB We conducted a series of experiments to investigate the temporal development and sensory basis of social discrimination by young chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus. In the initial experiment, 1-day-old chicks were housed in pairs for 6-9 or 11-14 h. After this treatment period, interactions between paired chicks that had been housed together for 6-9 h did not differ from those of unfamiliar chicks. However, pairs of chicks that had been together for 11-14 h pecked each other significantly less than did unfamiliar pairs. Reduced pecking by the familiar partners indicates that 11-14 h of direct contact is sufficient for the establishment of individual discrimination. In a second experiment we assessed the role of olfaction in the development of social discrimination. Chicks in the anosmic condition were housed in pairs after their external nares were blocked with acrylic cement. Control chicks had cement applied to the beak (the nares remained uncovered) before being housed in pairs. When tested after the pair-housing period, pecking frequencies were lower among familiar cagernates than among unfamiliar pairs of chicks in both the anosmic and control conditions. Anosmic chicks, unlike the controls, showed little reaction to mint odour, thereby verifying that the blocked-nares treatment disrupted olfactory perception. In a final experiment, there was no reliable difference between the pecking rates of paired chicks that had been housed together in the dark and those of unfamiliar dark-reared pairs. We conclude that access to social partners' visual phenotype, but not olfactory familiarization, is necessary for the rapid development of individual discrimination by chicks.

AB In experiments designed to measure the extent to which Mongolian gerbils use the behaviours of conspecifics to assess threat, we presented gerbils with a laboratory simulation of an approaching overhead predator in a variety of different physical and social contexts. In the first experiment, we showed that gerbils adapt their evasive tactics to the presence of other individuals to maximize the probability that they will reach shelter quickly. In the second and third experiments, we showed that in the presence of a very mild threatening stimulus, defensive reactions were either enhanced or depressed depending on the behaviour of a nearby conspecific. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate a mechanism by which gerbils can use the behaviour of conspecifics to calibrate thresholds for flight from predators.

AB In gregarious species, males may wound or kill females during intermale contest competition, which directly affects females fitness. However, male-male agonistic encounters may also have more subtle effects on females by creating a stressful social environment in which females live. We examined whether male-male aggression affects female fitness and odour preference in house mice. We tested (1) whether pairs of brothers would be less likely to fight than pairs of nonbrothers; (2) whether females housed with two males that were brothers would have higher reproductive success than females housed with two males that were not brothers and (3) whether females would show a preference for the odours of brother or nonbrother pairs. Males that were brothers were less aggressive towards each other than were nonbrothers, and females housed with males that were brothers produced significantly more litters than those housed with males that were not brothers. Females did not show a preference for the odours of brothers or nonbrothers, but they did prefer odours of less aggressive pairs of males. These findings suggest that while contest competition favours fighting among males, female choice and kin selection favour tolerance. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   FITNESS; AVOIDANCE; PARENTAGE; CONSEQUENCES; POLYANDRY
AB The benefits of extrapair mating behaviour for females of socially monogamous bird species are unclear despite substantial research effort. The genetic compatibility hypothesis proposes genetic benefits such that females paired to social mates of low genetic compatibility avoid or diminish negative fitness consequences by mating with a more compatible extrapair mate, resulting in offspring of higher genetic quality. Furthermore, within the context of inbreeding depression observed in natural populations, a high degree of overall genetic similarity between social pair mates may be regarded as a special case of genetic incompatibility. We tested the hypothesis that female extrapair matings represent an adaptive behavioural response to avoid negative consequences of being paired to a genetically similar social pair male in the coal tit, Parus ater, a socially monogamous passerine with high rates of extrapair paternity. In contrast to what was predicted, we found no evidence for a positive association between the genetic similarity of social pair mates (measured as band-sharing coefficients from multilocus DNA fingerprints) and the occurrence of extrapair paternity. Furthermore, the genetic similarity of the cuckolding female with its social mate was not higher when compared pairwise to that of its extrapair mate in 63 uniquely composed triplets. Finally, three parameters of reproductive success were not related to the genetic similarity of social pair mates. We conclude that avoiding the potentially negative fitness consequences of being paired to a genetically similar social pair mate did not select for and thus cannot maintain female extrapair mating behaviour in our study population.

AB We used a 'variable-drift' paradigm to investigate the relation between the angle of solar orientation and the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in Talitrus saltator. We recorded the circadian rhythms of individual sandhoppers in constant darkness before testing them at a set time during the day. Because of differences in the free-running period between individuals, they were thus tested at different phase points in their circadian cycle, so that the angular measurements were distributed across the subjective scotophase and photophase. To investigate the association between sun orientation angle and circadian time we used circular correlation statistics, and constructed circular-circular regression models for comparison with the biometric data. The sun orientation angles were strongly dependent on time of day, suggesting that orientation and locomotor activity are regulated by the same time-keeping system. The model fitting the experimental data best was a sinusoidal one, and the distribution of angular orientation predicted on this basis followed closely that of the nonparametrically smoothed data. During the day this followed the arc of movement of the sun, with a phase delay of about 90 degrees and the sign of the angle of orientation reversed around 1200 and 2400 hours. We interpret the data in terms of a mean angular velocity register and discuss their ecological significance. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent reviews of mate choice have concluded that this phenomenon is rare or nonexistent in lizards. However, direct tests of lizard mate choice are few and generally limited in scope. We present results of a mate choice experiment with Urosaunts ornatus in which two male lizards differing in morphology, colour and behaviour were given the opportunity to attract a female lizard. Pairwise comparisons of selected and unselected males revealed that variation in individual traits failed to account for much of the variation in mate attraction success. However, a multivariate analysis revealed that mate attraction was related to multiple cues from a male's phenotype: body mass and head size as well as body and tail coloration all contributed to mate attraction. We argue that the additive and interactive effects of several traits combined may be more important than single traits in mate choice. We suggest that mate choice studies should account for multivariate effects of male traits, and also allow mate attraction to occur over variable spatial and temporal scales, paralleling mate choice under natural conditions.

AB I examined the relation between courtship and mate choice in convict cichlids by presenting females with the option of courting and spawning with one of two males that were isolated from each other. I quantified the amount of courtship performed by females towards males they selected as mates and males they rejected, and the amount of courtship performed by each male towards the female. I measured courtship using two rates: (1) daily courtship rate, the total number of courtship events per number of days until spawning; and (2) contact courtship rate, the total number of courtship events per day per total time spent with a given individual. Females showed similar contact courtship rates to each male, whereas both types of courtship rates between females and only rejected males were significantly and positively correlated. Females showed a nonsignificant tendency to select larger males. Females spent significantly more time with the males they selected and therefore females' daily courtship rate towards selected males was significantly higher than that towards rejected males. Although females showed a preference early in their search for the male they eventually selected, they continued to spend time with, and court, the rejected male until spawning with the selected male, indicating that females continuously assess males throughout their search. Male courtship differed from female courtship in that while the daily courtship rates towards, the females did not differ significantly between males, the contact courtship rate of rejected males was significantly higher than that of selected males. Thus, rejected males may court more because they know they are not the preferred male, or selected males may court less because they know they are the preferred male, or a combination of both.

AB Unlike individually distinctive territorial calls, contact calls, or calls that aid in the recognition of young by their parents, the function or functions of individually distinctive alarm calls (vocalizations produced in response to predators) is not immediately apparent. Yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, ground-dwelling sciurid rodents, produce individually distinctive alarm calls. Using an habituation-recovery playback protocol, we show that marmots can perceive differences between the calls of different adult females. We further show that marmots are able to discriminate between at least one broad age-sex category. In contrast to what has been reported in other species, playback of calls from juveniles elicited a greater response (i.e. marmots increased vigilance and suppressed foraging) than did playback of calls from adult females. No other age-sex category led to responses significantly different from adult females. Future studies will seek to understand why individual discriminative abilities exist, but we have shown that individuals are able to identify when young, and presumably vulnerable, marmots are calling, and to respond by engaging in vigilance.

AB The movement path made by an organism in search of a resource contributes strongly to the success of that search. But are similar search strategies used at very different spatial scales? Using painted turtles as our model organism, we ask (1) whether terrestrial search paths, both shape and rate, are similar at small (30 m) and large (> 500 m) spatial scales, (2) whether those search paths are linear, and (3) what environmental conditions affect the shape of the search path? We found that movement paths at both small and large spatial scales were nearly straight and statistically indistinguishable from one another. The mean turning angles at small and large spatial scales were statistically similar and were best represented by an angle of 1.8degrees. Net displacement rates were, however, quite different between small- and large-scale paths. At small spatial scales, path shape and movement rate were most strongly affected by cloud cover and turtle size, respectively. Our results indicate that the shape of a search path is consistent over small and large spatial scales and gives support for extrapolating larger-scale path shape from small-scale observations. Net displacement rates, however, were scale dependent and thus caution must be taken in using behaviours detected at small scales to predict movement rates over larger areas. An unexpected result was that painted turtles did not follow drainages in search of aquatic habitat in this study system. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Kin-selected conflict over reproduction in social groups is predicted to occur when group members are unequally related to progeny. Whether kin-selected conflict is expressed may depend on individuals' ability to obtain and use information about their social environment to make decisions affecting their fitness. In some colonies of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, workers delay laying male eggs until approximately 21 days after the queen starts (at the 'switch point') to lay male eggs. This delay is difficult to explain with kin selection theory, because workers are more closely related to their own sons and so should commence reproduction immediately after the switch point. Bourke & Ratnieks (2001, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 268, 347-355) hypothesized that the delay occurs because workers detect the sex only of older larvae (ca. 10 days after emergence from the egg) and hence are delayed in detecting the switch point. We tested this hypothesis by adding male larvae greater or less than 10 days old to each member of nine pairs of B. terrestris colonies. We found no significant difference between the treatments in the timing of the start of worker reproduction, which occurred ca. 19 days after male larvae were added. The results therefore failed to support the hypothesis. We conclude that workers have access to information that would allow them to take a reproductive decision enhancing their inclusive fitness, but for unknown reasons do not act on it. Workers may use other cues to begin reproduction, possibly a queen signal (cessation of pheromone production) to female larvae to start development as queens.

AB We examined how different facets of guira cuckoo sociality influence reproductive investment in eggs (mass, volume, albumen, yolk, shell weight and thickness). The highly variable egg size in this species suggests the possibility of reproductive manipulation by females. Our data support the hypothesis that investment in eggs and clutches reflects a social context. The lowest egg ejection probabilities occurred in very small communal clutches where there were fewer laying females. Eggs retained in the nest had larger yolks than those ejected, a possible mechanism for minimizing energy expenditure in eggs with high chances of failure. Results showed that eggs laid in smaller communal clutches had, on average, less investment in all nutrient measures, except yolk, compared with eggs from larger communal clutches. It may be important for eggs to be of high quality in larger communal clutches, where competition between hatchlings will most likely be intense. Larger guira cuckoo eggs in this study produced heavier chicks. We found that chicks that were smaller and lighter at hatching were victimized by infanticide significantly more than chicks that were heavier and bigger at hatching.

AB In species where there is postcopulatory competition between males in the form of sperm competition, theory predicts that males should show prudent sperm allocation. Specifically, males should adjust the number of sperm that they inseminate in response to variations in the risk and intensity of sperm competition. Some experimental evidence for nonmammalian species indicates that ejaculate expenditure can be dynamic and adjusted in accordance with sperm competition theory. However, most studies have not used within-subject experimental designs to demonstrate ejaculate adjustments by individual males, and there have been no unequivocal demonstrations of prudent sperm allocation in mammals. In the present study, copulatory ejaculates were collected from 12 male rats that each mated under two experimental conditions: alone in a cage with a female (monandrous) and (accompanied by a 'rival' male who observed the copulation from behind a perforated plastic screen (polyandrous). As predicted by sperm competition theory, males ejaculated significantly more sperm when copulating in the presence of a rival than when copulating alone. Furthermore, the magnitudes of these ejaculate adjustments were highly predictable and were relatively consistent across individual males. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Female call preferences in tree-hole frogs: why are there so many
   unattractive males?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID EVOLUTION; CHOICE; VOCALIZATION
AB In tree-hole frogs, Metaphrynella sundana, the fundamental call frequency varies widely between males. In field playback experiments, females strongly preferred calls from the lower range of frequencies found in the population. There was no correlation, however, between male size and call frequency, as is normally the case for anurans, so large males were not necessarily more attractive to females. Presence or absence of upper harmonics in the call had no effect on female choice. Tree holes with shallow air columns were more often used by calling frogs, and were presumably more common, than deep holes. Since male M. sundana actively exploit the resonant properties of tree holes for mate attraction, and high frequencies match comparatively shallow holes, the benefits of attaining acoustic matching probably select for high-frequency calls. In addition, males with high-frequency calls may be heard from a greater distance in the vicinity of torrent streams. Since the level of such noise in the forest varies in time and space, different frequencies may prove optimal in different contexts, thereby preserving the observed variation within the population. Having an 'unattractive' high-frequency call should be potentially beneficial only when calling males do not congregate, a condition that our data suggest is fulfilled in this system.

AB Although cleaning interactions are deemed a textbook example of mutualism, there is limited evidence that clients benefit from cleaning in terms of reduced ectoparasite loads. The proximate causes of cleaning behaviour are also contentious. We examined the effect of ectoparasite load (i.e. the number of larval gnathiid isopods) on client behaviour under natural conditions. Diel variation in gnathiid loads of longfin damselfish, Stegastes diencaeus, a common coral reef fish client of cleaning gobies (Elacatinus spp.), was correlated with variation in gnathiid emergence from the substratum at sites in both Puerto Rico and St John, northeastern Caribbean. Both benthic emergence of gnathiids and their infestation on damselfish peaked in the morning. Concomitantly, clients spent significantly more time posing for and being inspected by cleaners in the morning than at other times of day. Our results corroborate recent experimental results on captive clients and are consistent with the mutualistic interpretation of cleaning symbioses.

AB In several groups of songbirds, including the North American wood warblers (Parulidae), males subdivide their song repertoires into two different categories, or 'modes', of singing. Previous studies of wood warblers suggest that the two singing modes in this group are each specialized for interacting with one of the two sexes: Type 1 singing for interacting with females and Type 2 for interacting with other males. Here I examine the responses of male and female yellow warblers to the two singing modes produced by males. Using song playback experiments, I found that male yellow warblers responded to potential intruders with Type 1 singing, rather than Type 2 singing, as predicted. In tests using the copulation solicitation assay, females implanted with oestradiol responded equally strongly to both Type 1 and Type 2 singing. These results suggest that male wood warblers use both singing modes to interact with males and females, and that the singing modes do not have distinct, sex-specific functions as previously thought. Factors other than intra- and intersexual selection are therefore likely to have helped shape the evolution of distinct singing modes. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Six brown lemurs and four black lemurs were presented with two stimulus arrays of one and four raisins. Under a reverse-reward contingency, they received the array they did not choose. All subjects showed a strong preference for the larger array and developed a strong side preference bias. When a large-or-none reward contingency was applied (i.e. no reward followed the choice of the larger array, but this array was given for the choice of the smaller array), six of the 10 subjects overcame their side bias and learned to select the smaller array. When a correction procedure was added, all the remaining subjects mastered the task. Performance was maintained when the original reverse-reward contingency was rerun, and when novel array pairs were presented. Several months after the study, six subjects retained a significant preference for choosing the smaller of the two arrays. The results demonstrate a form of self-control in two prosimian species.

AB Woodpecker finches are famous for their spontaneous tool use behaviour in the wild. They use twigs or cactus spines to pry arthropods out of crevices and use this ability more than any other tool-using species known. We experimentally investigated the cognitive abilities related to tool use. We chose three experimental designs that have been used to test several primate species (trap tube task and modification task) and New Caledonian crows (tool length task). One of six woodpecker finches was able to solve the trap tube task, and several individuals modified tools and chose twigs of appropriate length. Most subjects mastered these new tasks quickly, but we found no evidence that they were able to assess the problems in advance. These findings resemble those obtained for primates in these tasks.

AB Bird vocalizations are produced under various social contexts. It could therefore benefit: birds, as social contexts change, to alter the amplitude of their signals. We tested this by recording male and female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, when they were placed in isolation, in auditory contact, and in visual and auditory contact with each sex. The majority of females increased call amplitude only when in auditory contact with either sex. Most males increased both song and call amplitudes only when in visual and auditory contact with either sex. We found no changes in patterns of harmonic suppression (timbre) for males or females across social conditions. One explanation for the sex difference is that females increase amplitude for affiliative reasons, whereas males increase amplitude to advertise fitness.

AB Song has been proposed to function in mate choice, and such a role has been demonstrated experimentally in a number of species. We presented captive female house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, with a choice of two songs, each of which was identical except for a single parameter that had been either accentuated or minimized. To ensure that our playback tapes offered choices within the normal range of variation in house finch song, we recorded wild male finches, then created playback tapes using values for the song parameters under consideration that were above or below the mean for the local population, but within the natural range of variation. We presented females that had not previously mated with choices between songs that (1) were long or short, (2) were given at fast or slow rates, and (3) included a large or small repertoire of unique song elements. Females showed significant preferences for long songs and for songs presented at a faster rate, but there was no significant preference for large or small repertoires of unique song elements. Song length and rate each seem likely to indicate a male's energy reserves, and thus could be important sources of information for females choosing mates.

AB A detailed understanding of the behavioural interactions between males and females is crucial for elucidating the selection pressures shaping mating system evolution; however, these interactions are often difficult to observe, particularly in free-living populations. We simulated extraterritorial intrusions by presenting conspecific models on to territories of a Neotropical migratory passerine, the yellow-breasted chat, Icteria virens. Simulated intrusions elicited different responses based on the sex of the focal individual and the sex and species of the model. Behavioural responses of the focal individuals were largely directed towards conspecific models, whereas simulated heterospecific intrusions, using a Carolina wren, Thryothorus ludovicianus, model, elicited minimal response. Male song was not related to any particular model presentation. Males directed mating behaviours, including courtship displays and copulations, exclusively towards the female conspecific model. Males behaved aggressively towards the conspecific male model. In contrast, females never showed any courtship behaviour towards the male model and showed significant aggression towards the conspecific female model. The results of this study reveal that territorial aggression in yellow-breasted chats is strongly intrasexual. Additionally, simulated female extraterritorial intrusions, but not male intrusions, resulted in extrapair courtship and copulation. This pattern is likely to be typical of many socially monogamous species and points to the behavioural mechanisms underlying both monogamy and extrapair mating systems.

AB We evaluated the ability of two Brazilian stingless bee species, Melipona mandacaia and M. bicolor, to recruit nestmates to a specific three-dimensional location. We used experimental feeder arrays and provide the first detailed evidence demonstrating that recruitment communication in Melipona can lead to large, rapid and highly significant increases in the number of nestmates visiting a specific location. Melipona bicolor and M. mandacaia foragers both recruited nestmates to the correct distance and direction, but differed in their ability to recruit nestmates to the correct height. These differences may relate to their respective habitats. Melipona mandacaia inhabits semi-arid areas of Caatinga where most food sources occur close to the ground, and its foragers evidently cannot recruit nestmates to the correct height. Melipona bicolor, an Atlantic rainforest species, evidently does not communicate height when the food source is at ground level, but can communicate height when the food source is at the forest canopy level (12 m high), where major food sources occur. Species-specific variation in three-dimensional location communication is intriguing because it suggests that Melipona may be a good model for studying the evolution of recruitment communication systems in highly social bees.

AB Females of many catharrine primates show a periodic and often pronounced swelling of the perineum, the functional significance of which is unclear. Several hypotheses that exist to explain the function of this conspicuous trait are based on assumptions about the temporal relation between the period of maximum swelling and ovulation, and remain largely untested. We examined this relation in free-living chimpanzees of the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, and assessed the reliability of perineal swelling as an indicator of ovulation in this species. We used noninvasive urinary progestogen analysis of female reproductive status, together with observational data on swelling characteristics, to determine the variability of timing of ovulation within the maximum swelling phase in 36 cycles from 12 females. The period of maximum swelling was highly variable, lasting from 6 to 18 days. Although ovulation was virtually restricted to the second half of the period of maximum tumescence, its timing varied considerably in relation to both the onset and the end of the maximum tumescence phase. Probability of ovulation, however, was not random, but peaked on day 7 after the onset of the maximum swelling phase, and was almost 60% between days 7 and 9. Thus, in wild chimpanzees perineal swelling indicates the probability of ovulation, but does not provide sufficient information to deduce its exact timing.

AB Studies have documented the presence of behavioural lateralization in many groups of lower vertebrates, demonstrating that these behaviours are not limited to mammals and birds. These studies suggest that the evolution of brain lateralization, often linked to lateralized behaviours, may have occurred early in evolutionary history and may not have been the result of multiple independent evolutionary events as previously thought. The goal of this study was to further document behavioural lateralization in another group of lower vertebrates, snakes. Given the importance of the coiling posture to snakes, I examined the coiling behaviour of a cottonmouth population. Coiling asymmetries were found at both the individual and population levels. However, the adaptive significance and mechanisms influencing this behaviour remain undefined. Additional research is needed to explore these areas and to link the lateralized behaviours documented in this and other studies directly to brain asymmetries before the evolutionary history of brain lateralization can be further resolved.

AB I examined multiple mating and its function in female earwigs, Euborellia plebeia (Dermaptera: Anisolabididae). Like other earwigs, females of this species care for their eggs and intermittently lay eggs in clutches (iteroparity). Analysis of two polymorphic allozyme loci revealed that wild-caught adult females laid clutches with low within-brood genetic relatedness (0.210), indicating that females were promiscuous under natural conditions. Rearing experiments in the laboratory revealed that: (1) repeated mating with a single male increased female fecundity (number of clutches laid) and hence the number of hatchlings produced; (2) estimated sperm number was positively correlated with hatchability; (3) when frequency of mating was controlled, polyandry enhanced hatchability, although this effect was not statistically significant; (4). duration of maternal care varied for clutches with low hatchability, and sometimes exceeded the mean interclutch interval. Thus, although a possible benefit of polyandry is suggested, the greater beneficial effect of repeated mating on female fecundity can explain polyandrous mating in this species. Because female earwigs invest considerable effort in brooding their clutches, it may be adaptive to suppress oviposition unless stored sperm ensures high fertility.

AB As ravens have pronounced learning capabilities, especially in the vocal domain, cultural transmission might be a relevant factor affecting the composition of their vocal repertoires. We investigated how important cultural transmission is in establishing a raven's vocal repertoire and whether there are different pathways of transmission. We studied individually known free-ranging breeding pairs whose vocalizations were recorded during interactions with a caged pair. The mean repertoire size of these vocalizations was 12 call types per individual (from 79 types recorded from 74 individuals), with no difference between the sexes. In 81% of individuals the repertoire was composed entirely of calls also used by other individuals. Analysis of the distribution of call types among individuals regarding sex, partnership and neighbourhood and aspects of the geographical distribution of calls showed that the main pathway of cultural transmission was within the sexes. In addition, transmission occurred between pair partners, as well as between neighbouring and more distant pairs. About 40% of the calls in a raven's repertoire were transmitted within a sex and 10% between pair partners. Any two given birds in the population shared on average 20% (0-77%) of their calls. Cultural transmission within the sexes led to a pronounced sexual dimorphism in vocal behaviour. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Group-foraging ravens scatter-hoard when they are competing for food and, to some extent, also raid the caches made by others. We investigated the effects of observational spatial memory on individual caching and raiding tactics. With captive ravens, we found visual observation was essential for locating and raiding the caches of conspecifics. Both captive and free-ranging ravens, food cachers as well as potential cache raiders, responded to each other's presence. Cachers withdrew from conspecifics and most often placed their caches behind structures, obstructing the view of potential observers. Raiders watched inconspicuously and kept at a distance to cachers close to their cache sites. In response to the presence of potential raiders or because of their initial movements towards caches, the cachers frequently interrupted caching, changed cache sites, or recovered their food items. These results suggest that ravens, regardless of whether they act as cachers or raiders, are capable of withholding information about their intentions and, hence, manipulate the other bird's attention either to prevent or to achieve social-learning opportunities. Such interactions may qualify as 'tactical' deception and may have created a considerable pressure selecting for social cognition in ravens.

AB Size and aggressiveness are determinants of social dominance in many vertebrate species, including juvenile stream-dwelling salmonids. We used seminatural stream channels, landscaped to provide a range of depths, to test whether the factors influencing the formation of social hierarchies are similar in single- and mixed-species groups of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and brown trout, Salmo trutta. We also tested whether these species have similar feeding rhythms during the day and whether dominant and subordinate individuals feed at different times, under both allopatric and sympatric conditions. Size, appeared to be a good predictor of feeding success of both species in allopatry, but not when they were in direct competition. In contrast, rate of aggression was positively correlated with feeding success in both allopatry and sympatry. However, the timing and rate of feeding of dominants and subordinates differed significantly only in the allopatric trials, with subordinate individuals in the sympatric trials being able to adopt a nonaggressive alternative strategy and continue feeding. These results highlight the behavioural plasticity of juvenile salmonids, which can adapt their feeding behaviour to the social environment, and suggest that the presence of another species with similar, but not identical, ecological requirements may increase the opportunity for the expression of alternative behavioural strategies. We conclude that the advantages of social dominance may to a large extent be specific to the species assemblage. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   HYMENOPTERA; OVIPOSITION; STRATEGIES; FEMALE
AB Pollinating fig wasps are often used to study sex ratio evolution in structured mating populations. Theory predicts a female-biased sex ratio, becoming less female biased as female (foundress) density increases. We used Liporrhopalum tentacularis to test two mechanisms of sex-ratio control when foundresses oviposit simultaneously: (1) foundresses facultatively adjust the number,of males in clutches, and (2) they produce the same number of males regardless of clutch size, which, given limited numbers of oviposition sites, would lead to increases in sex ratio with increasing density. We then examined whether foundresses,can oviposit sequentially into figs. When oviposition was simultaneous, brood composition indicated facultative adjustment, although sex ratios were more female biased, than predicted. Instead, foundresses appeared to adjust their sex ratio in response to both others ovipositing and their own fecundity. We also found that foundresses are able to oviposit completely sequentially, with those arriving second adjusting their sex ratio in response to the previous oviposition. Hence, pollinating wasps may fail to fit, the predictions of classical sex ratio theory because the conditions under which foundresses oviposit, and their responses to changes in such conditions, are more complex than once assumed.

TI Alternative forms of song matching in song sparrows
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID TIT PARUS-MAJOR; PERCEPTION; WRENS; MATE
AB Song matching, replying to a song with a similar song, occurs in many songbird species. Almost all investigations of song matching have been of type matching, where one bird's reply is unambiguously similar to the other's song (i.e. the same song type). In many populations, however, neighbours do not share song types, and therefore cannot type-match. We hypothesized that a bird lacking a true type match could still song-match a stimulus song with a song from his repertoire that was similar in some way the birds recognized. We tested this hypothesis in song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, in two playback experiments. We played the subject a stranger song that was similar to one or more of his songs, but a type match to none of them. In the first experiment, we used playback songs that began with two buzzes ('double-buzz' songs). In the second experiment, we used songs that began with a slow trill that increased in tempo ('speed-up' songs). Birds replied at rates significantly above chance with their own double-buzz, or speed-up song match to the respective types of playback. The results suggest that birds who do not share true song types, can still song-match each other. This broad-sense form of song matching may also occur in populations with low song type sharing.

AB For a sit-and-wait predator, the choice of ambush site may be a crucial determinant of foraging success. During fieldwork on a small island in northeastern China, we explored the availability and use of arboreal ambush sites (tree branches) selected by Shedao pit-vipers, Gloydius shedaoensis. The snakes were highly selective at a variety of spatial scales. For example, they displayed strong biases in terms of which tree species were used, which individual trees within each species were used and which branches were used within a tree. Snakes disproportionately used trees that were on the edge rather than the interior of thickets, and branches that faced out towards the clearing rather than back towards the thicket. Branches at an angle slightly above horizontal were preferred. The snakes used branches visited at high rates by potential prey, that provided effective camouflage, and with thermal and visual backgrounds (cool, bright) that contrasted strongly with avian prey items (hot, dark). The snakes used perches close to the ground (the area of greatest bird activity) despite suboptimal visual and thermal backgrounds. Use of thicker branches by larger snakes, and by snakes containing recently ingested prey items, may contribute to effective camouflage. Thermoregulation did not appear to influence foraging site selection. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Female mammals sometimes nurse offspring that are not their own. The causes and function of allonursing for females remain puzzling given that lactation is energetically costly and augments the risk of pathogen transmission between mothers and alien offspring. To date five hypotheses have been put forward to explain why females nurse alien offspring. (1) Allonursing results from misguided parental behaviour. (2) Females reciprocate by nursing each other's offspring. (3) Females nurse related juveniles for inclusive fitness benefits. (4) Females nurse alien offspring to evacuate milk that their own offspring did not drink. (5) Inexperienced females that lactate spontaneously without reproducing themselves or that have lost their litter nurse alien offspring to improve their maternal skills. A review of empirical evidence showed that observations were consistent with predictions of the misdirected parental care, kin selection and milk evacuation hypotheses but not with predictions of the reciprocity and parenting hypotheses. However, probably because the study of mammals is not a trivial exercise, it is unclear to what extent each hypothesis can account for inter- and intraspecific variation in the female propensity to nurse alien offspring. Since the five hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, some observations said to support a given hypothesis may also be consistent with an alternative one. To tease apart the exact role of competitive hypotheses I propose some experimental designs. A detailed discussion of each hypothesis also reveals that the reason why females nurse alien offspring may be more intricate than was previously believed.

AB Vigilance behaviour is thought to be largely controlled by the threat of predation on foragers. In addition, an inverse relationship between group size and vigilance has been documented repeatedly and is known as the group size effect. We suggest that groups of beach-foraging northwestern crows are vigilant for predators and for opportunities to steal ('scrounge') from conspecifics. We collected data using 5-min focal samples that recorded search time, scanning frequency and bout lengths, predator presence, prey type and theft. We also recorded group size, time of day, temperature, and tide height and direction, resulting in 2950 foraging trials. Results indicated that increased scanning during a trial predicted trials that would end in theft. Group size did not significantly influence the proportion of scanning in a trial, but scan bout length increased with increasing group size. This result is opposite to that predicted by the group size effect and suggests that more birds means more opportunities to scrounge or be scrounged upon. This rejection of the group size effect is most likely due to the trade-offs between group size and scrounging opportunities. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mexican jays live in stable social groups of 5-25 individuals. Groups show complex social organization, with dominance hierarchies and defence of territories against nonmembers. We tested whether Mexican jays displayed vocal recognition of group membership in a population of colour-banded birds in southeastern Arizona, U.S.A. We conducted playback trials of primary calls recorded either from an identified member of the target group or from a member of a nearby but noncontiguous group. Calls were played near established feeding stations during regular feeding sessions. The jays responded differently to calls from outsiders and insiders, with more calling, faster approach latency and more entries into a response circle (i.e. within 5 in of the speaker) in response to calls from outsiders. Thus, the primary calls of jays are used to recognize group membership. Mechanisms by which this recognition is mediated are discussed. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The interaction between parasitic chicks and their hosts can have three outcomes: parasitic chicks might be favoured over the host young, disfavoured, or hosts might behave towards the parasitic chicks as towards their own young. I tested these hypotheses in a study of shiny cowbirds, Molothrus bonariensis, parasitizing rufous-bellied thrushes, Turdus rufiventris. Parasitic chicks were fed significantly less than the host young. I tested whether this was because parasitic chicks were outcompeted by the larger host young, or were disfavoured by the host adults. I videotaped parasitized broods containing a shiny cowbird raised with one host chick and nonparasitized broods containing a large and a small thrush that matched the size difference between the host and the parasitic chick. Parents used different rules for feeding chicks in the parasitized and nonparasitized nests. In nonparasitized nests, parents fed the chick that was positioned highest in the nest. However, in the parasitized nests, host chicks had a significantly greater chance of getting fed if they were higher or at the same height as the cowbird. When the cowbird chick was positioned higher than the thrush chicks, there was no difference between the chicks in the probabilities of their being fed. In addition, even when parents offered food to the cowbird chick, they then removed it from the cowbird's gape to feed their own chick as soon as it started begging. These results suggest that the poor success of shiny cowbird nestlings at nests of rufous-bellied thrushes is not simply due to competition with their larger nestmates, but may also involve parental discrimination. I discuss why hosts with chicks larger than the parasitic chicks may be more likely to evolve discrimination against parasitic chicks. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The banded mongoose, Mungos mungo, is a social species that forms multimale and multifemale family groups. Earlier studies suggest these family groups are relatively egalitarian with small differences in reproductive opportunities among individuals of different rank. In contrast, previous studies of other social mongooses have focused on species with more despotic control of reproduction (meerkats, Suricata suricatta, dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula). in these species, the distribution of reproductive opportunities amongst individuals of different rank has met the predictions of reproductive skew theory: dominant,individuals accrue greater reproductive benefits,than subordinates, with subordinates breeding less often than dominants. In this paper we test how well two predictions of reproductive skew theory explain variance in measures of reproductive effort, and its correlates, in a wild population of banded mongooses in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. We measure dominance rank in males and females, and we investigate whether individuals of higher social rank accrue greater benefits than subordinates in terms of survival and reproduction. Banded mongoose dominance hierarchies showed linearity, but low reproductive skew. Rank was not significantly correlated with age. Furthermore, there were only small effects of dominance rank on nutritional levels, and no effects on reproduction and survival, suggesting that banded mongoose societies are indeed relatively egalitarian. No evidence of reproductive suppression was found and other forms of reproductive control were not observed. However, we do not exclude the possibility of increased reproductive competition in circumstances of higher ecological constraints. These findings show that reproductive skew theory is equally useful in explaining variation in reproduction in societies with law reproductive skew, as it is in explaining the allocation of reproductive effort in despotic social systems.

   ORGANIZATION; PREDATION
AB We recorded the responses of individual intertidal crabs, Heterozius rotundifrons, to stimuli presented singly and in combinations in the laboratory. Undisturbed crabs did not respond to the introduction of odour from a crushed conspecific but did respond strongly to food odour. Undisturbed crabs responded equally to food odour alone and a combination of food and odour from a crushed conspecific. When tactile stimulation was applied, as when the crab is grasped by a predator, individual H. rotunidfrons assumed a rigid, appendage;extended posture for several minutes, rests with predatory fish showed that this catatonic posture is a very effective predator-defence mechanism. The duration of the catatonic state was decreased by the addition of food odour but increased by the addition of alarm odour (crushed conspecific) or the combination of alarm and food odours. Thus, which chemical stimulus was dominant was reversed by tactile input (i.e. dominance was contingent upon context). The effect of alarm odour on food odour responses lasted 4 h. Visual input in the form of a shadow passing over the crabs, either before or after tactile induction of the catatonic state, also increased the duration of that state. However, the duration of the catatonic state following exposure to both cues associated with danger (shadow + alarm odour) was similar to that of the control level. The crabs appeared to switch strategies when three cues associated with danger (tactile grasping, alarm odour and shadows) were detected, either simultaneously or over a 4-h period. The results illustrate the highly contingent nature of the behaviour of these crabs. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sexual selection is hypothesized to favour small body size,in males of scrambling species, that is, those in which males obtain matings by actively searching for females. I tested this hypothesis in a natural population of the scrambling emerald damselfly, Lestes sponsa. Mating efficiency (matings/visit to the pond) was the most important factor explaining variation in male lifetime mating success (LMS; 71%). This suggests a large potential for sexual selection. Path analysis of male LMS suggested a quality factor that positively affected both mating efficiency and life span. In contrast with the small-male mating advantage hypothesis, part of this potential for sexual selection was realized as stabilizing selection on male body size, indicating that there may also be a lower limit to body size for mating efficiency. This also illustrates that the constancy of body size may be explained by sexual selection alone. Survival explained about 20% of the variation in LMS and random processes were potentially important for determining LMS. My results show the problems of using mating efficiency as a measure for the intensity of sexual selection and the need to distinguish between. potential and realized selection pressures, especially when comparing the importance of natural and sexual selection. I discuss mechanisms that may have caused the intermediate-male mating advantage in this scrambling species. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The reproductive behaviour of brood-parasitic birds has been of long-standing interest to evolutionary biologists but key features such as the mating system, patterns of host use and degree of overlap of female egg-laying ranges are largely unknown for particular species. Here we use microsatellite DNA markers to obtain such information for one of the best-studied brood parasites, the brown-headed cowbird, Molathrus ater. Parentage analyses of young and adults from a marked population at Delta, Manitoba for I year revealed the following key features of the reproductive behaviour of this species. (1) Monogamy is the predominant genetic mating system in this population, although matings by a single male with more than one female occur infrequently. (2) There is substantial variance in reproductive success among individuals, with only 23 out of 34 (68%) of all resident females and 21 out of 54 (39%) of all resident males in the study population identified as producing offspring. (3) Nonbreeding adults are seen less frequently and have shorter periods of residency on the study site suggesting they may form a subpopulation of 'floaters'. (4) Roughly half the females on site laid their eggs in the nests of a single host; most strikingly, the most fecund female laid all 13 of her eggs in red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus, nests. This raises the possibility that cowbird populations may consist of combinations of females some of whom are host generalists and others host specialists. (5) Female egg-laying areas rarely overlap. (6) Realized annual fecundity of females may be lower than previously suggested. These results provide important information that can be used to clarify the mechanism and the selection pressures that have led to the evolution of different features of the reproductive behaviour of these birds.

AB As animals aggregate with others, the time they allot to social and nonsocial activities changes. Antipredator models of vigilance and foraging group size effects both predict a nonlinear relationship between group size and the time allocated to behaviour. Group size effects were experimentally studied in captive adult female tammar wallabies, a small macropodid marsupial, by increasing group size from 1 to 10. Tammars foraged more, looked less, groomed more, engaged in more aggressive interactions and moved about less as group size increased. Nonlinear regression models explained more variation in the time allocated to foraging, looking, locomotion and affiliative behaviour than linear models. Variation in self-grooming and aggression was better explained by linear models. Wallabies lay down significantly more, and walked significantly less, as group size increased: these relationships were significantly nonlinear. Thus, changes in perceived predation risk, which are characterized by nonlinear relationships, explain tammar wallaby group size effects for most activities. These results support the assertion that predation has played an important role in macropodid social evolution. Moreover, the findings suggest that conservation biologists should pay particular attention to group size when translocating or reintroducing endangered macropodids.

AB We used minisatellite DNA profiling to assign parentage to stitchbird, Notiomystis cincta, chicks from a breeding population on Tiritiri Matangi Island off the coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The small population size allowed samples to be collected from all potential parents and nearly (33/34 nestlings) complete assignment of paternity. Analysis revealed that 35% of nestlings (12/34) were the result of extrapair copulation and that extrapair young were present in 80% of nests (8/10). About half of the extrapair nestlings were the offspring of unpaired males. This is substantially higher than predicted from the literature, which suggests that extrapair paternity is typically gained by paired males.

AB We investigated undertaking behaviour in the desert leaf-cutter ant to determine whether colonies show undertaking specialization, how task specialization is regulated and the consequences of specialization on colony performance. Task specialization has been hypothesized to be a result of internal physiological or genetic factors that govern worker behaviour. On the other hand, it has been suggested that task specialization could be a result of spatial structuring of workers allowing only a subset to have the opportunity to perform certain tasks. To test between these two hypotheses, we experimentally introduced dead ants into laboratory colonies with individually marked workers, and recorded all encounters and undertaking behaviours. Workers demonstrated individual specialization, in that some workers removed the dead ant more frequently than expected from encounter rate. Although individual workers differed in their opportunity to perform undertaking, this did not account for the specialization. These results suggest that undertaking specialization is governed by internal differences among workers. In addition, undertaking specialists removed corpses more successfully, and in the largest colony, more quickly, than nonspecialist workers, indicating that internally governed specialization is an important part of overall colony efficiency.

ID PIGEONS; RATS; ENHANCEMENT; IMITATION
AB Juvenile European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were allowed to observe a conspecific demonstrator using its beak to remove one of two distinctively coloured objects (i.e. a red or a black plug) from a hole in the lid of a plastic box. Both plugs could be removed by either pulling up on a loop of string inserted through the centre of the plug, or pushing down on the plug. When subsequently allowed access to the plugs, and rewarded with food for all removal responses, regardless of the object to which they were made and their direction, observer birds removed the same plug in the same direction as their demonstrator. These results suggest that the two-object/two-action paradigm is a valuable procedure for testing for the simultaneous effects of learning about a stimulus and a response, an object and an action, through conspecific observation.

AB I measured locomotor endurance capacities of lizards on a motorized treadmill in the laboratory and compared average values for different species with quantitative measures of their movement in the field (percentage of time moving, N=15 species; moves/min, N=13; daily movement distance, N=11). I hypothesized that endurance would be positively related to all three movement indices. Relationships between log endurance and log movement were computed as conventional Pearson product-moment correlations and as the equivalent with phylogenetically independent contrasts. Endurance was significantly positively related to both the percentage of time moving and the daily movement distance. This is the first study to demonstrate such relationships with phylogenetically based statistical methods. These results suggest that endurance capacities of lizards are coadapted with their typical locomotor behaviour. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Signals and assessment in African elephants: evidence from playback

ID LOXODONTA-AFRICANA; FEMALE CHOICE; BEHAVIOR; MUSTH; STRATEGY; CALLS
AB A series of playback experiments using two elephant vocalizations, the 'musth rumble' and the 'oestrous call', was carried out in Amboseli National Park to examine signalling and assessment in African elephants, Loxodonta africana. In response to the musth rumble of a high-ranking male other musth males approached the speaker aggressively, whereas nonmusth males walked away from the stimulus. The call of an oestrous female, too, attracted musth males who approached the speaker rapidly, while nonmusth males listened and then walked away. Females listened and often showed considerable interest in the musth rumbles of males, approaching the speaker and sometimes responding by vocalizing and or secreting from the temporal glands. The experiments bear out earlier observational data and game theory predictions which suggest that by being in or out of musth a male may be conveying information about the relative value he places on contesting his dominance rank and his access to oestrous females. When not visibly in musth, a male may be indicating his intention not to contest access to oestrous females. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I tested the prediction that the hydracharinid mite Unionicola ypsilophora reduces mating success in the chironomid midge Paratrichocladius rufiventris. Males of the midge form mating swarms through which females fly to emerge after a few minutes with a mate. This mating system is believed to depend upon the male capturing a mate after aerial competition between males. Thus aerobatic ability is expected to determine success and a large ectoparasite should impair aerial performance. The proportion of infested males in swarms (ca. 4%) was less than that in mated pairs (ca. 15%). Infestation thus improved the expected mating success of the male midge. This finding is counterintuitive and may be a chance effect of no adaptive value to host or parasite. Alternatively, it may be an adaptive manipulation of the host by the parasite. This study provides evidence for the latter explanation. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI The role of urine marking in the foraging behaviour of least chipmunks
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Least chipmunks, Tamias minimus, occasionally deposit urine on buried patches of seeds after sampling the patch, a behaviour never before reported for rodents. The results of these experiments show that (1) patch-marking is a deliberate act, bearing no resemblance to routine excretion, (2) marking deters both the marker and conspecifics from harvesting attempts, (3) chipmunks can discriminate their own marks from those of others, and (4) the incidence of marking in the wild is at least as frequent, and its deterrent effect as strong as in the laboratory. Although the message conveyed by a mark is clearly exploited by conspecifics, and may benefit kin, the results accord best with prevailing theory advanced for canids, that an olfactory reminder of patch value improves the marker's foraging efficiency.

AB Both territorial breeding common ravens and nonbreeding vagrants scatter-hoard carcass meat extensively. We show experimentally with four captive nonbreeders in a large semi-natural enclosure that common ravens alter their caching behaviour in the presence of conspecifics. When four birds were simultaneously given a small amount of food, which any one bird by itself could easily remove in several trips, all four birds decreased the latency to begin caching and increased caching speed. In contrast, when the four birds were given only enough food for a single individual to control, caching was greatly-delayed. If, as these results suggest, competition between conspecifics over food sources induces caching behaviour, then individuals should cache close to the food source to reduce travelling time and increase the time available to effectively compete for food in the presence of conspecifics. Here we show, that in the presence of competitors, common ravens instead cached further from the food source, provided they had space into which they could escape from the sight of the competitors. When escape from competitor vigilance was not possible, common ravens delayed caching and/or hid food when the competitor was preoccupied. A second factor that influenced caching behaviour was cache robbing; ravens not only recovered their own caches, but also:routinely recovered the caches they saw others make.

DT Article
ID MAGNETIC-FIELD; ORIENTATION; BIRDS
AB The aim of the present study was to test whether the directional distributions found in ringing recoveries could be explained if night-migrating passerines use only a simple clock-and-compass strategy during autumn migration. I developed a mathematical model that predicts the expected directional distributions as a function of distance covered by birds using a clock-and-compass strategy. The predictions were compared with data from natural migration: all ringing recoveries of pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, ringed in Scandinavia and recovered elsewhere in Europe and North Africa within the same autumn. The predictions of the model correlated strongly with the distribution of ringing recoveries. This suggests that at least young pied flycatchers, and perhaps night-migrating passerines in general, use a simple clock-and-compass strategy to reach their wintering area. If so, all the prerequisites (a compass and an internal clock) that they need to orient during migration seem to be known at present, at least at the behavioural level, and navigational abilities or any elusive map-sense are not needed for migration.

TI Flower choices by raspberry beetles: cues for feeding and oviposition
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID RUBUS-IDAEUS; PLANT; DROSOPHILA; VOLATILES; GENOTYPE; STRESS
AB Raspberry beetles, Byturus tomentosus, use raspberry as the host plant for feeding, mating and oviposition; the larvae are a major pest on the fruit. This study seeks reasons for their choices between flowers of different cultivars. Beetles showed consistent diurnal movements between different cultivars of raspberry, which were linked to differential behavioural patterns; they fed predominantly on Glen Clova canes in the morning and moved to Glen Prosen later in the day where oviposition behaviour was commoner and substantially more effective. Hence two closely similar cultivars of the same plant species received very different levels of flower damage (from adult feeding) and of fruit damage (from larval infestation). These patterns were linked to subtle differences in cues from the host plant; Glen Clova produces unusually copious nectar which may limit oviposition opportunities because of osmotic threats to eggs and larvae, whereas Glen Prosen has drier flowers for egg laying and apparently emits a short-lived volatile cue that principally attracts female beetles. Selective breeding of the host plant has therefore had unexpected side-effects on interactions with a major pest species, mediated by the behaviour of the insect, and perhaps accentuating natural behavioural preferences that serve to reduce competition between adult and larval stadia.

AB Male pine engravers, Ips pini, assist their mates during reproduction by clearing debris from breeding galleries constructed beneath the bark of host trees. I measured duration of parental care provided by individual male pine engravers in the field, as well as the reproductive success of these males as indicated by the total number of eggs laid in their galleries and the mean distance between the eggs. Males remained in their galleries for 13-54 days (N=78, X +/- SE=33.0 +/- 0.9 days). Male residence time was positively correlated with the mean distance between eggs in a gallery, as well as the total number of eggs laid in a gallery when the effect of male length was controlled statistically. Male-removal experiments corroborated these effects of male care on reproductive success, and showed that female mortality was higher in galleries from which the male had been removed than in controls. Duration of male care was inversely related to breeding density and male length. Despite remaining for less time in their galleries, larger males acquired the biggest harems. There was a positive correlation between the length of a male and the number of eggs laid per female, but this was not due to size-assortative mating. Because large male size is associated with a number of traits that are advantageous for securing mating opportunities, earlier departure from the gallery by larger males may be a consequence of those males having greater opportunities for future reproduction.

AB We present evidence that nestmate discrimination in the eusocial paper wasp, Polistes dominulus, is context dependent. We compared aggression levels between nestmates and non-nestnates in dyads consisting of a pair of either nestmates or non-nestmates, and triads consisting of either three nestmates, three non-nestmates, or two nestmates and a non-nestmate. In 130 of the 237 total trials, a nest fragment (containing both brood and eggs) from the nest of some, all or none of the interactants was placed into the interaction arena. Polistes dominulus workers recognized and discriminated nestmates from non-nestmates, familiar from unfamiliar nest material and neighbours from non-neighbours. These findings suggest that nestmate and neighbour discrimination are context dependent: discrimination occurs when either the presence of a nestmate pi a familiar nest fragment indicate the proximity of the colony. The context-dependent variation in aggression levels is best described by multiple, context-dependent shifts in an acceptance threshold. Thus this Study provides the most extensive, critical support yet obtained for Reeve's (1989, American Naturalist, 133, 407-435) optimal acceptance threshold model.

AB For many parasites with complex life cycles, manipulation of host behaviour is an adaptation to increase the probability of successful transmission. Since manipulation is likely to be costly, other parasites may exploit hosts already manipulated so as to ensure their transmission without investing in manipulation. Such a cheating strategy, called 'hitch-hiking', could be adaptive in a range of situations. We first propose and discuss criteria that should be met by any parasite to be considered a hitch-hiker. Then, to understand the evolution of the hitch-hiking strategy, we use simple mathematical models to analyse the influence of several variables on the potential benefits for a nonmanipulative parasite of actively seeking a ride to the definitive host with a manipulative parasite. The models suggest that the prevalence or abundance of manipulative parasites will be a key determinant of whether hitch-hiking can be an advantageous option for other parasites.

ID ORB-WEAVING SPIDERS; BEHAVIOR; STRATEGIES
AB In this study we used field surveys and experiments to investigate silk stealing, a unique form of kleptoparasitism. We studied the role that silk stealing plays in the interactions between a kleptoparasitic spider Argyrodes lanyuensis and its giant wood spider host Nephila maculata by testing: (1) if silk stealing generates any cost to the hosts; (2) if the amount of web lost to kleptoparasites varies with the size of the host; and (3) how prey stealing by A. lanyuensis affects N. maculata. Compared with uninvaded webs, N. maculata webs invaded by A. lanyuensis suffered an average orb reduction of 21%. There was a significant negative correlation between the percentage web reduction and body length of N. maculata, indicating that the impact of silk stealing was greater on younger hosts. No significant correlation was found between the number of A. lanyuensis on orbs and orb loss, but there was a significant negative relationship between percentage orb loss and silk diameter of N. maculata. These results suggest that the finer silk of smaller hosts may be at least partially responsible for their higher percentage orb loss. While prey stealing by other Argyrodes species greatly affects the foraging gain of hosts, A. lanyuensis did not seem to affect N. maculata. This was because the host took larger prey than the kleptoparasite did, and less than 3% of the host's biomass intake came from prey that A. lanyuensis would steal.

Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, frequently utter coo calls and exchange these calls with other group members to maintain contact vocally. I conducted a playback experiment to examine whether monkeys that respond vocally match the acoustic features of their reply to those of the calls they have heard. Six to eight stimulus calls with different acoustic properties in terms of fundamental frequency components were played back to each of seven females, in an attempt to elicit replies from the subjects. There were significant positive regressions of the frequency range of stimuli with that of the replies. Japanese macaques thus matched some of the acoustic features of their replies to those of the preceding calls, suggesting that they might be able to modify the acoustic features of their calls according to the features of the prior calls of another group member.

AB In facultatively monogamous mammals, females are thought to be too widely dispersed for males to defend more than one female range. We tested this hypothesis in a monogamous antelope, Kirk's dik-dik, Madoqua kirkii. Dik-dik territories were compared across three indices of quality to investigate whether males are monogamous because of constraints on the area, or resources, that they are capable of defending. Territories varied substantially in size and quality, with some containing up to five times the resources of others. Moreover, the territories of four temporarily polygynous males were not of higher quality than those of monogamous males. These results are inconsistent with the idea that dik-diks are facultatively monogamous: males can, and often do, defend enough resources and sufficient area to support two or more females. We investigated,the relationship between resource dispersion and monogamy further by providing food to territories over a 3-month period. Although provisioned pairs obtained 20% of their daily requirements from the food, there was no change in the territory size of either sex. Female dispersion does not account for monogamy in the dik-dik; instead we argue that monogamy has evolved as a result of male mate guarding.

AB In previous mate choice experiments, we found no relationship between dominance rank and pairing success in male northern pintails, Anas acuta. Once chosen by a female, however, males became aggressive, initiated fights with higher-ranked males and quickly established dominance. In the present study, we tested a variation of the 'challenge' hypothesis, that the behavioural stimuli associated with acquiring and defending a mate induce an increase in testosterone level, which in turn facilitates aggressive behaviours required for males to establish dominance. We measured plasma hormone levels (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, luteinizing hormone and corticosterone) before and after mate choice in two experiments in which males competed for a single female (experiments 1 and 2) and in a control experiment in which no female was introduced (experiment 3). We used groups of either three adult males (experiment 1) or one adult and two yearling males (experiments 2 and 3). Contrary to expectation, in experiment 1, plasma levels of corticosterone increased significantly and testosterone levels decreased in chosen males following mate choice. The magnitude of change in corticosterone was positively correlated with the rate of aggression by males. Chosen adult males in experiment 2 showed similar patterns of hormone change (corticosterone increase and testosterone decrease), although not all changes were significant. Hormone levels of unchosen yearlings in experiment 2 and control adults and yearlings in experiment 3 showed no changes. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that behavioural stimuli associated with successful pair formation induce a transitory increase in circulating levels of corticosterone, which in turn mediates the behavioural response of increased aggression leading to the establishment of dominance following mate choice. A short-term increase in corticosterone may be adaptive in this situation because it would mobilize energy stores needed by the: male to defend the new pair bond and establish dominance.

TI Red howling monkey use of specific defecation sites as a parasite
   avoidance strategy
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Red howling monkeys, Alouatta seniculus, in the central Amazonian basin move to specific sites before defecating. Differences in the vegetation profile of behavioural sites, defecation sites and random sites within the ranging area of howler groups were examined. The defecation sites used differed in the number of leaf intercepts at the levels of the forest the monkeys used for foraging and travelling. Defecating in areas free of underlying vegetation decreases the likelihood of contaminating potential food sources or arboreal pathways. This defecation behaviour may be an important parasite avoidance strategy of red howling monkeys. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Response of domestic chicks to methyl anthranilate odour
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Methyl anthranilate is widely used to make ingestive stimuli taste aversive in studies of visually mediated passive-avoidance learning in domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus. However, since methyl anthranilate smells strongly to the human nose, its odour may be involved in the learning process. We sought (1) to determine whether chicks can use the odour of methyl anthranilate as a disciminative stimulus in passive-avoidance learning and (2) to evaluate the use of denatonium benzoate as an alternative odourless reinforcer. In experiments 1 and 2, chicks were presented with familiar- or novel-coloured food or water, with or without the odour of methyl anthranilate or denatonium benzoate, to see whether either odour would elicit neophobia. Methyl anthranilate odour increased chicks' latency to eat or drink when it was presented in conjunction with novel-coloured food or water, showing that chicks can detect it. Denatonium benzoate had no effect. In experiment 3, chicks learned to avoid food or water that was made unpalatable by means of denatonium benzoate and paired with the odour of methyl anthranilate, showing that chicks can use this odour as a discriminative stimulus in taste-avoidance learning. In experiment 4, chicks learned to avoid pecking at a pin-head coated with denatonium benzoate or paired with the odour of methyl anthranilate, showing that denatonium benzoate is a satisfactory reinforcer for one-trial passive avoidance learning and that the odour of methyl anthranilate is in itself a punishing stimulus. We conclude that methyl anthranilate odour does influence avian learning and that denatonium benzoate is a suitable odourless alternative for use as a punishing stimulus.

AB Parasitic wasps are commonly found to learn olfactory and visual cues that are associated with successful host location. For many parasitoids the cues that are associated with hosts vary in space and time, and are therefore unpredictable. An ability to learn allows the wasp to concentrate on those cues that will lead it to new hosts most effectively in a particular area. In contrast, parasitoids that forage in a predictable homogeneous environment and/or make only a few foraging decisions do not need to learn and should rely on innate responses to specific cues. The role of learning in host foraging was studied in Cotesia flavipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a parasitoid of stemborer larvae with an ecology where learning is expected to be of low adaptive value. There was no evidence that C. flavipes uses odour learning in host-micro-habitat location. There was no significant effect of the development and emergence environment on the response level or preference towards the odour of infested plants. Neither was there evidence that experience with a particular plant-host complex during foraging influences subsequent foraging decisions in C. flavipes females. The absence of learning in C. flavipes, which seems an exception among the parasitoids studied, is discussed in relation to its ecology. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, were reported to produce qualitatively different alarm calls in response to different predators. To test this claim rigorously, yellow-bellied marmot alarm communication was studied at two study sites in Colorado and at-one site in Utah. Natural alarm calls were observed and alarm calls were artificially elicited with trained dogs, a model badger, a radiocontrolled glider and by walking towards marmots. Marmots 'whistled', 'chucked' and 'trilled' in response to alarming stimuli. There was no evidence that either of the three call types, or the acoustic structure of whistles, the most common alarm call, uniquely covaried with predator type. Marmots primarily varied the rate, and potentially a few frequency characteristics, as a function of the risk the caller experienced. Playback experiments were conducted to determine the effects of call type (chucks versus whistles), whistle rate and whistle volume on marmot responsiveness. Playback results suggested that variation in whistle number-rate could communicate variation in risk. No evidence was found of intraspecific variation in the mechanism used to communicate risk: marmots at all study sites produced the same vocalizations and appeared to vary call rate as a function of risk. There was significant individual variation in call structure, but acoustic parameters that were individually variable were not used to communicate variation in risk.

AB The relative contribution of parental behaviour to nest predation rates in blackbirds, Turdus merula, was estimated by comparing the mortality of natural nests (with parents) with the mortality of the same nests immediately after the breeding season with artificial clutches (but without parents). Nest predation rates during the egg stage were equally high (ca 5% per day) in both experimental and natural nests. Nest predation rates were independent of clutch size for natural nests, but clutch size was lowest in nests that were further from the edge of nest bushes. Nest predation rates of experimental nests were greater for nests that were less than 10 m apart. The probability of nest failure was independent of all measured physical characteristics for natural nests, but for experimental nests probability of nest failure was dependent on the nest's detectability, and to a lesser extent height. There was no relationship between the outcome, or the duration before predation, of a natural nest, versus the same nest used with an experimental clutch. The results suggest that nesting blackbirds altered their nest defence to compensate for the predation risk associated with a nest's location.

AB Previous studies have shown that female Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) can accurately assess the number of eggs already laid on a bean; an absolute measure of egg load probably determines the female's egg-laying decisions. In this study relative fitness gain is assumed to determine the probability that a female accepts beans with different egg loads. Models were constructed to describe the egg-spacing dynamics of females that follow three decision rules: a random, an absolute and a relative rule. Comparison of the uniformity of egg distribution achieved by the females under different conditions and of four other geographical strains with the predictions of the models leads to the conclusion that a relative rule incorporating the degree of larval competition determines egg-laying decisions for the females of the four geographical strains with strong larval competition, while an absolute rule is used by the strain with weak larval competition. Based on the model, a quantitative relationship between larval competition and the female's egg-spacing behaviour was also constructed. The evolution of egg-laying decision rules is discussed.

ID EGG PREDATION; HABITAT SELECTION; MIXED COLONIES; TREE SWALLOWS;
   DEFENSE; BIRDS; AGE; POPULATION; SUCCESS; REPRODUCTION
AB Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, breeding on Kent Island, New Brunswick, Canada, have two types of nest predators, one of them (herring gulls, Larus argentatus) abundant but relatively ineffective, the other (American crows, Corvus brachyrhynchos) scarce but highly effective. We hypothesized that the net effect for Savannah sparrows of nesting near gulls would be to reduce the overall risk of nest predation. Despite being surrounded by predators, the eggs and offspring of sparrows that nested among gulls survived as well during the incubation and post-fledging periods as did those of sparrows that did not nest among gulls. During the nestling period, sparrows nesting among gulls had significantly lower predation rates. In defending their own nests from predatory crows, gulls apparently shielded nearby sparrows from the more dangerous predator. Experiments with model predators demonstrated that sparrows reacted to gulls as potential predators of their eggs and nestlings. Sparrows apparently recognized crows as a far greater threat, however. The tendency to nest near gulls appeared not to be heritable or influenced by early experience. Sparrows nesting among gulls were indistinguishable from sparrows nesting away from gulls in terms of body size, age and date of nesting. By choosing nest sites in microhabitats that gulls avoided, such as dense patches of goldenrod and blueberry, and by adopting more cautious approaches to their nests, sparrows nesting near gulls reduced their risk of predation by gulls. The density of Savannah sparrow nests was inversely correlated with the density of gull nests, which suggests that sparrows avoided gulls despite the apparent advantage in terms of reduced nest predation by crows. A strong nesting association between gulls and birds like Savannah sparrows is unlikely to evolve because of the low heritability of the trait, gene flow from other populations where avoiding gulls and other potential predators is selectively advantageous, and constraints on short-lived birds in learning to differentiate situations in which a predator presents a threat from those in which it provides protection.

AB Go-existence in a species-pair of pond-breeding salamanders has been attributed to a trade-off in the competitive abilities of their larvae: the mole salamander, Ambystoma talpoideum, is aggressively superior to the spotted salamander, A. maculatum. Conversely, A. maculatum inhibits the growth of both conspecifics and a. talpoideum, yet the mechanism of this growth inhibition is unknown. Interspecific variation in foraging behaviour was examined to test the hypothesis that A. maculatum reduces the growth of competitors through its superior performance as a forager. In replicated trials, the behaviour of individual larvae was recorded as each foraged on a single type of prey, Daphnia pulex, provided at a constant density. A. maculatum was exploitatively superior to A. talpoideum: larvae of the former species had significantly faster rates of prey capture than did their interspecific competitors. Moreover, relative to the behaviour of A. talpoideum, A. maculatum looked towards prey items at a significantly greater rate, spent a greater proportion of time in pursuit of prey and spent less time handling each prey item. These interspecific differences in foraging behaviour provide a mechanism by which larvae of A. maculatum may inhibit the growth of competitors. The results support the hypothesis that exploitative superiority in A. maculatum counteracts aggression by A. talpoideum, thus emphasizing the importance of 'trade-offs' in competitive abilities to co-existence in this species-pair.

ID MALE 3-SPINED STICKLEBACKS; GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS; NUPTIAL COLORATION;
   INTERSPECIFIC AGGRESSION; BEHAVIOR
AB Although Tinbergen found that red nuptial coloration of male three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, elicited attack by other males, subsequent researchers have had difficulty replicating his results (Tinbergen 1948, Wilson Bull., 60, 6-51; 1951, The Study of Instinct. Oxford: Oxford University Press). Rowland et al. (1995, Anim. Behav., 50, 267-272) found that males tested in neutral tanks attacked a moderately coloured video image of a conspecific male more than either a bright or dull image in simultaneous presentations. These results suggest that a dual-effect process representing an interaction between aggression and fear might determine attack response. Based on this hypothesis, males tested in home tanks should attack the video images more than males tested in neutral tanks and should attack the brighter images most because their attack:fear ratio is higher. Males in their own territories spent more time attacking video images than males in neutral tanks. Males in their own territories also spent more time attacking the brighter image than they spent attacking either the moderate or the dull image. These results demonstrate the influence of spatial location on the response of male stickleback to rivals. Furthermore, a dual-effect model provides a heuristic tool for understanding the agonistic behaviour of male stickleback. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Males of the dung fly Sepsis cynipsea (L.) (Diptera: Sepsidae) mate guard before copulation by mounting the female's dorsum upon her arrival at the dung. After completing oviposition, females walk off the dung and vigorously shake to attempt to dislodge the guarding male. Only males that succeed in remaining on the female's dorsum will establish genital contact and copulate. Males are smaller than females, and engage wing clamps (specially modified areas on the femur and tibia of each foreleg) to grip the female's wing bases during guarding. The foretibiae of males and females collected at three phases of pairing (prior to struggling, during struggling and in copula) were measured. No differences in the foretibia size of either males or females across the three phases were found. However, the absolute fluctuating asymmetry of the foretibiae of males differed significantly between phases. On average, males paired in copula were the most symmetrical whilst those paired prior to struggling were the least symmetrical. It was concluded that males with more symmetrical foretibiae are indirectly selected as mates by females because of their better competitive ability to grip the female's wing bases and thereby remain on the dorsum of a struggling female during guarding.

ID POPULATION
AB Chestnut-sided warbler, Dendroica pensylvanica, song repertoires contain two distinct categories of songs, accented-ending and unaccented-ending, which differ in patterns of geographical variation, mode of development and circumstances of use. To determine whether the song categories also differ in the information they make available to listeners, a multivariate model of associations between song category and social and environmental factors was derived from two large samples of singing behaviour. The model showed that song categories encode information about a singer's location, immediate social situation and behavioural tendencies. Accented-ending songs were connected to unmated status, interaction with females and stationary singing in territory centers, but unaccented-ending songs were associated with singing near territorial borders or other males and with tendencies to move and/or fight. The predictive power of song category was not absolute. Instead, each song category encoded a set of behavioural possibilities. More specific messages are probably encoded in finer-level signal variation. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ID INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION; FISH
AB Five experiments were performed to determine the level of social recognition in captive-reared adult cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis L. No evidence of discrimination of familiar from unfamiliar individuals was found in either females or males. Despite good evidence for mate guarding, no recognition of individual mates was found. Within sex classes, associations between freely moving animals were not different from random (f-f, f-m and m-m). Male dominance, measured by displacement success, was consistent from day to day, was related to size and was consistent with number of copulations obtained. Dominance ranks were not learned or recognized and did not result in energy savings through a reduction in agonistic encounters. Social interactions of these marine invertebrates depend upon relative size, internal motivation and the behaviour patterns of conspecifics, rather than upon any direct recognition of social partners.

AB In many primate species, former opponents engage in friendly behaviours after aggressive conflicts. These kinds of interactions are labelled reconciliation because they are thought to repair relationships damaged by conflicts and help to preserve group cohesion. This study assessed the form and function of reconciliation between free-ranging female baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. The rate of interaction between former opponents was higher during the minutes that followed conflicts than in the days that preceded or followed conflicts. Baboons reconciled vocally, grunting quietly to their former opponents after conflicts ended. Grunts after conflicts facilitated infant handling. Females were particularly likely to reconcile with high-ranking opponents, the mothers of young infants and related mothers of older infants. Reconciliation had no consistent effect upon the rate of interactions during the days that followed conflicts. This study is the first to demonstrate that primates reconcile vocally and the first to assess the long-term consequences of reconcilation in a naturalistic setting.

AB Dominance status in birds may involve a trade-off in foraging costs and benefits. This study tested the hypothesis that the cost of being a subordinate species may be offset by the benefit of being better at finding novel food locations compared to their dominant competitors. In a pair of flight-cage experiments, the ability of two tropical hummingbird species to find novel locations of food was measured. A dominant species (steely-vented hummingbird, Amazilia saucerottei) and a subordinate species (fork-tailed emerald, Chlorostilbon canivetii), tested both as solitary birds and in competing heterospecific pairs, did not differ significantly in (1) the time required to first discover novel food locations, (2) the number of feeding visits made to such sources or (3) the number of novel food locations one bird could discover before its cage-mate. The dominant Amazilia, however, was twice as fast as Chlorostilbon at finding novel food locations previously discovered by a competing heterospecific cage-mate. This behaviour pattern could facilitate the pre-emption of newly found food sources from Chlorostilbon in the wild. Other possible mechanisms that could confer an advantage on the subordinate species are discussed: (1) ability to locate cryptic food sources, (2) ability to recognize as food a novel item that has never been used before and (3) specialization on finding food sources that dominant species cannot pre-empt.

AB Black rats inhabit Jerusalem pine forests in Israel, where they nest in the trees and feed on the seeds extracted from the pine-cones. The rats obtain the seeds by systematically stripping the cone's scales in a spiral pattern, using a sequence of stereotyped behaviour patterns termed the spiral technique. This stripping behaviour is culturally transmitted from mothers to their pups. Adults do not learn this task culturally, and only a few adults require it spontaneously even under favourable conditions. Experiment 1 tested whether the age of separation from the mother, sex of the pups, litter size and age at first exposure to cones affected the pups' stripping ability. Only the age of separation from the mother affected the proportion of pups that learned to strip cones; litter size, sex or age when pups were exposed to cones had no affect. Under laboratory conditions pups obtained pine seeds by using a second technique, termed shaving, which required a greater energy expenditure than the spiral technique. Experiment 2 tested whether the age at which pups were first exposed to cones influenced the type of stripping technique which they would acquire. Most pups (76%) exposed to pine-cones since birth used the shaving technique, and most pups (68%) exposed to pine-cones from age either 20 or 30 days developed the spiral technique. A third experiment examined whether developing pups can learn to strip cones when exposed only to mature brown cones, which are woodier and tougher than the green cones. None of the pups that were exposed only to brown cones learned to strip cones, even following exposure to cones for 80 days. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Fifteen captive pairs from two subspecies were studied: 11 pairs (aviary formed) of Z l. familiaris (an Australian mainland subspecies) and four breeding pairs of Z. l. chlorocephala (confined to the islands of the southern Great Barrier Reef). Each contact call displayed sufficient individuality in call structure such that individuals could be distinguished statistically. Male and female silvereyes recognized their mates when sequentially presented with three categories of calls: mate, familiar and stranger. This study represents the first evidence of vocal mate recognition in a species that maintains pair bonds within mobile foraging flocks. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ID SELECTION; HYPOTHESIS
AB Male black wheatears, Oenanthe leucura, carry on average almost 2 kg of stones to cavities inside caves before each clutch is laid. This costly behaviour may play a role in post-mating sexual selection, if females adjust their reproduction to the amount of stones carried by their mates, an hypothesis tested in two field experiments. First, breeding sites with many new stones also contained many old stones from previous breeding seasons. In a stone removal experiment, in which all old stones were removed from half of the territories, but not from control territories, males carried the same amount of stones following the two treatments. Reproductive success was similar in the two treatments, and the number of old stones carried was thus an unimportant feature of the display. Second, either the number of new stones present or those carried could be the important cue of the display; this was tested by manipulating stones during the display period. When the number of new stones was doubled every second day, males reduced their stone-carrying activity, and when the number of new stones was halved every second day, males compensated for the removal. Laying date and annual reproductive success were positively affected by the treatment and the number of stones carried, but not by the number of stones present, suggesting that females pay attention only to the number of stones carried.

AB This study addresses the short-term behavioural mechanisms that underlie nutrient balancing by a herbivorous insect. Fifth instar Locusta migratoria nymphs were given one of four pairings of artificial foods, with each food containing different levels of protein and carbohydrate. The foods were chosen such that the treatment groups would have to ingest very different ratios of the foods to attain similar nutrient intakes. Over 6 days all four groups achieved a very close convergence of nutrient intakes, thus providing strong evidence that they simultaneously regulate both the quantity and balance of protein- and carbohydrate eaten, that is they show defence of an 'intake target'. Measurements of intake combined with detailed behavioural observations made over a 16-h period on the fifth day were used to investigate the behavioural mechanism by which insects attained this target. These revealed that the ratio of intake of foods was achieved by eating different numbers of meals on the two foods and not by eating different meal sizes. Differential meal numbers were, in turn, the result of switching between the two foods after different length runs of meals rather than any change in intervals between meals. The mean trajectory used to reach the intake target involved switching foods after 3.7 h and 4.6 meals. The functional consequences of such switching behaviour are considered.

AB A review of the literature, together with a reanalysis of existing data and some additional data, was used to show that Heyes' (1994, Anim. Behav., 47, 909-919) recent critique of self-recognition research in primates is without merit. Heyes' contention, that self-recognition is an artefact of incomplete recovery from anaesthetization and species differences in ambient face touching, is contrary to (1) the temporal parameters of the mark test, (2) responses that chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, make to control body marks (i.e. those that can be seen without a mirror), (3) results from studies that have not used anaesthesia, (4) responses that chimpanzees make to unmarked portions of the face, (5) the absence of a correlation between developmental changes in face touching and self-recognition, (6) differences among chimpanzees in patterns of mirror self-directed behaviour and normal self-grooming and (7) the absence of substantial species differences in face-touching behaviour.

AB Parental behaviour was directly observed during two 30-min bouts on each of the first 18 days after birth for both Djungarian, P. campbelli, and Siberian, P. sungorus, dwarf hamster litters. Results were consistent with predictions based on earlier studies that demonstrated a positive impact of paternal presence on pup survival in P. campbelli, but not P. sungorus. The presence of the father or an aunt significantly decreased, by about half, the proportion of time that pups were alone in P. campbelli. Because brief parental absences were unlikely to result in pup cooling, analyses also considered only those absences that were 3 min or longer. By those criteria, P. campbelli pups housed with a second adult were rarely alone. In contrast, the father had little impact on the parental care received by pups in P. sungorus. Phodopus sungorus males were rarely alone in the nest with the pups, whereas both fathers and aunts in P. campbelli were alone with the pups significantly more often than the mother from mid-lactation until weaning. This behaviour reflected temporal coordination between the behaviour of the adults. Pups were left alone. less often than expected based on the independent behaviour of each adult. Because there was no reason to expect alloparental care by aunts in the wild, the presence of a second adult, rather than specific parental behaviour by that adult, may be the essential component of increased pup survival. Limited observations of male parental care in the wild demonstrated that significant paternal care could occur in P. campbelli. Both field and laboratory data, however, suggest that biparental care would be facultative and adaptive under certain environmental conditions (e.g. extreme temperatures) but not all.

AB Experience-dependent development of the nervous system is now recognized among insects, in which its functional significance can be studied readily. Depriving normal Drosophila melanogaster of visual stimulation during their first few days of adult life ('dark-rearing') had a dramatic effect on mate choice. Dark-reared males were at a disadvantage when they competed with males reared in alternating light-dark cycles ('light-rearing') for light-reared females. Dark-rearing also affected reproductive success when deprived males or females were paired with light-reared flies of the opposite sex; the pairs that had the same rearing histories had higher copulation frequencies and lower copulation latencies than those that did not. Dark-reared males tested with light-reared females under dim red light to reduce the use of visual cues were less successful at copulating than light-reared control males. The effects of dark-rearing thus may not be limited to the visual system. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Wild turkeys, Meleagris gallopavo, exhibit a particularly striking array of ornamental characters, including a bare, brightly coloured head covered with bumpy caruncles and a distensible snood, a black hair-like beard, tarsal spurs and a large fanned tail. These characters are hypothesized to be maintained by female choice. Good genes models of female choice propose that these ornaments serve as indicators of the bearer's heritable ability to resist parasites, maximize fat deposition or attain greater age. Aesthetic models propose no such ability of ornaments to indicate these correlates of fitness. These models were tested by (1) determining the male characters assessed by captive females, using artificial and live males in mate-choice trials, and (2) examining the correlates of ornamentation in wild-caught males. Females preferred males with longer snoods and wider skullcaps. These traits were negatively correlated with coccidian oocyst loads in the faeces of wild-caught males. Snood length may also be an indicator of male energy reserves. These results are consistent with good genes models of female choice. Other aspects of male ornamentation in wild turkeys were not explained by inter-sexual selection. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ID PECKING; YOUNG; CARE
AB The feeding interactions of ring doves and their squabs were observed during the squabs' transition from dependent to independent feeding, on days 12-28 of life. Pecking and begging by squabs and regurgitative feeding, withdrawal and pecking by the squabs' parents were scored. Squabs began to peck on days 12-17, and all pecked at substantial levels by day 24. Overall, squab pecking and regurgitative feeding by parents showed strong negative correlations, but the initial occurrence of squab pecking was not tightly linked to declines in regurgitative feeding. Regurgitative feeding did not occur immediately after squab pecking but did tend to occur within a few minutes of squab pecking, Pecking by parents was frequent on most days and increased during the transition period. A high percentage of early squab pecks occurred in close temporal proximity to parental pecking. These findings are consistent with the possibility that decreases in regurgitative feeding, an association between seed and nutritional consequences, and experience observing their parents peck may influence squabs' transition from dependent to independent feeding.

AB The role of female flehmen behaviour in maintaining reproductive synchrony was investigated in 11 adult female sable antelope and their associated offspring maintained on a 13.2-ha pasture at the National Zoological Park's Conservation and Research Center near Front Royal, Virginia. All occurrences of aggression and flehmen by adult females were recorded during 274 h of observation over a 10-month period (1987), and the timing of births was recorded for four birth seasons (1986-1989). In each year, dominant females tended to give birth in temporal proximity to other females (birth clustering), while subordinates gave birth asynchronously. Flehmen frequency fluctuated seasonally, reaching highest levels just prior to the approximated time of conception. Adult, multiparous females were the primary targets of flehmen. There was positive assortment by reproductive state: pregnant females attended to urinations by other pregnant females and postpartum females responded to other postpartum females. Prepartum flehmen rates reliably predicted subsequent birth synchrony, and the degree of synchrony between a given pair of females was directly proportional to the frequency with which they sampled each other's urine in the preceding year. These results indicate that flehmen is a potential mechanism by which female sable antelope can manipulate the timing of both conception and parturition.

AB Despite contradictory evidence, it is widely believed that venomous snakes carefully control, or 'meter', the quantities of venom expended when feeding upon rodent prey. The major purpose of this study was to clarify experimentally whether juvenile prairie rattlesnakes inject more venom into larger mice than smaller mice. The subjects (N=7) were videotaped as they struck at small, medium and large mice in each of two separate trials. The quantity of venom expended was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of whole-animal homogenate. In the first ('naive') trial, the snakes injected similar quantities of venom into all size classes of prey. But in the second ('experienced') trial, the snakes injected significantly more venom into larger prey. No other aspect of striking varied among prey sizes or changed in the two trials. Thus, venom expenditure was probably not a consequence of, or constrained by, some extrinsic aspect of striking, such as duration of fang contact. More likely, the rattlesnakes, with experience, attempted to inject (or meter) more venom into larger prey through intrinsic control of venom delivery. Both natural (snakebite) and artificial (syringe) envenomations indicated that mice injected with larger quantities of venom died more quickly. Because larger prey succumb less rapidly to venom, metering more venom into larger prey may be an adaptive strategy for immobilizing and killing large prey more quickly.

AB Vocal learning in birds often results in geographically distinct 'dialects'. To examine whether genetic variation underlies intraspecific differences in vocal development, young male white-crowned sparrows from sedentary (Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli) and migratory (Z. I. oriantha) populations were reared in standardized conditions in the laboratory, and tutored throughout the first year of life with a changing roster of tutor songs. Male nuttalli acquired their tutor imitations at a later age, and over a broader range of ages, than did oriantha males. All males eventually crystallized a single song type, but male oriantha sang imitations of more tutor songs in plastic song, and persisted in plastic song twice as long as nuttalli males. Nuttalli imitations of tutor songs were fragmentary, but their imitations of specific syllables were more accurate than those of oriantha. These genetically based differences in vocal learning may be different strategies to achieve song matching with territory neighbours in migratory and sedentary populations. Young migratory oriantha face a shorter singing season during the early sensitive phase for song acquisition and greater uncertainty over where they will breed as yearlings relative to nuttalli males, who may occupy territories relatively closer to their birthplace, and may settle as early as their first autumn. Male oriantha acquire several song dialects when young, and then, through a process of selective attrition, retain the song that matches the local dialect where they settle to breed. In contrast, nuttalli may retain the ability to acquire an accurate song copy from a neighbour when they establish a territory. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB In a wide range of animal species, males coerce females to mate with them, either by physically forcing them to mate, by harassing them until they mate or by punishing persistent refusal to mate. The first section of this paper argues that the possibility of forced copulation can generate arms races between males and females that may have substantial costs to both sexes. In the second section, it is suggested that sexual harassment commonly represents a 'war of attrition' between the sexes; existing game theory models that may apply to sexual conflict over mating decisions are reviewed. The third section develops a simple prospective model for the evolution of intimidation by punishment in situations where males can raise the probability that females will accept their advances in future by punishing them for refusal to mate. Where the benefits of sexual coercion to males are high, all three male strategies may develop to a point where they have substantial costs to females. In the final section, evidence that female behaviour is adapted to minimizing these costs is reviewed.

AB Bracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a gregarious parasitoid of phycitine moth larvae that infest stored grain. It has been hypothesized that B. hebetor females produce proportionately more female offspring under conditions of superparasitism (when laying eggs on previously parasitized hosts) because daughters are reproductively more valuable than sons when resources are limiting and adult body sizes are reduced. This hypothesis was reexamined by measuring the effects of body size on male and female performance and by monitoring the sex ratios and clutch sizes of individual females. The results of this study provide only weak evidence that small size differentially affects the reproductive success of male and female B. hebetor. Sex ratios were more female-biased on superparasitized hosts, but the difference arose as a consequence of two aspects of oviposition behaviour. First, male eggs were laid later within ovipositional sequences, and second; females laid smaller clutches when superparasitizing. A larger sex-ratio shift towards male progeny was seen, however, in females that committed ovicide (i.e. killed some of another's eggs by piercing them with the ovipositor). The offspring sex ratios of ovicidal females were much less female-biased because these females laid male eggs earlier in the ovipositional sequence. Ovicidal females shifted their sex ratios whether superparasitizing or ovipositing alone. None of the females killed their own eggs, even though they were observed probing among them with their ovipositors. It is hypothesized that oviposition behaviour and sex ratio in B. hebetor may be grouped into two syndromes: ovicidal and non-ovicidal. The variation in sex ratio and ovicide may be a consequence of density-dependent selection, favouring non-ovicidal behaviour when population density is low and ovicidal behaviour when the density is high and competition for larval resources is acute.

AB The ability to change expression of a behaviour through experience with contingencies among important stimuli can enhance the survival and fitness of animals under certain ecological conditions. It would seem paradoxical if strong variability in learning performance persists even when those conditions are met. In the honey bee, learning about the relationship between floral odours and the rewards offered by flowers is important for colony survival. Yet several studies have identified a significant amount of inter-individual variability in olfactory learning performance among workers within colonies. This variability could be due to changes in learning performance due to age, to caste-specific alteration of motivational state, or to genotypic variability among paternal lines within colonies. Experiments reported herein were designed to establish the contribution of all three variables under controlled environmental conditions within which significant variability in a measure of learning performance exists. The results indicate that, at least under these conditions and when genotype is not manipulated, neither age nor caste had an effect on motivational state or learning performance. Genotype was the only variable that could account for a substantial portion of the variability within colonies of honey bees. Therefore, manipulation of genotype will be necessary in future studies designed to establish the reasons underlying variability in learning performance in natural populations.

AB The relationship between size, dominance and copulatory success was investigated in male northern elephant seals to determine the importance of size in male intra-sexual competition for mates. The study was conducted over four breeding seasons at the Ano Nuevo rookery in central California. Mass was estimated using a photogrammetrical technique in three seasons and measured directly in one. Copulatory success was positively correlated with size (mass and length). This correlation was mediated through the positive effect of size on dominance rank; variation in arrival mass, for example, accounted for 29-44% of the variation in dominance. Copulatory success was positively correlated with dominance rank for mid- to high-ranking males, but not for low-ranking males, which obtained few copulations. Copulatory success was not significantly correlated with size when the effect of dominance was removed statistically. These results support the hypothesis that male reproductive success in this species is principally determined by dominance rank, which, in turn, is affected by male size. However, they also suggest that large size is just one of a number of important factors that affect the outcome of male intra-sexual competition and hence, reproductive success.

AB The immune-competence hypothesis predicts that the expression of secondary sex traits should be positively related to testosterone levels, but that androgens should simultaneously have negative effects on the immune defence system. Relatively high levels of circulating androgens should therefore result in elevated levels of parasite infections. Parasite load and testosterone levels will be uncorrelated, or even negatively correlated, however, if males with high testosterone levels and large secondary sexual characters are reliable advertisers of genetic resistance to parasites. In male barn swallows, testosterone concentrations peaked during the pre-laying period. Males that had high levels of testosterone (adjusted for the stage of the breeding cycle) at one stage of the breeding cycle also had relatively high levels at other stages. The length of the outermost tail feathers, which are secondary sexual characters currently involved in sexual selection, was positively related to adjusted circulating levels of testosterone, even when potentially confounding variables were controlled statistically. The prevalence (proportion of hosts infected) and intensity (number of parasites per host individual) of ecto-parasites (two species of Mallophaga, one species of Acari) infecting barn swallows were unrelated to adjusted testosterone concentrations. Intensities of ecto-parasite infections were negatively related to tail length of male barn swallows, and unmated males had higher intensities of infections than mated males. These results are consistent with the immune-competence version of the handicap principle.

TI EMBRYONIC FINE TUNING OF PIPPED EGG TEMPERATURE IN THE AMERICAN WHITE
   PELICAN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Upon pipping of the first (a) egg, the second (b) egg of the American white pelican, Pelecanus erythrorhynchos, is sometimes exposed to lower and more variable temperatures. Poor temperature control may arise at this time because the parents lack information about the current temperature state of the b-egg. Once chilled, embryos exhibit a graded response to cooling, which may restore the embryo''s communicative link with the parent and enhance egg temperature control. This possibility suggested the hypothesis that pipped eggs are maintained at warmer temperatures than unpipped eggs during the final stages of incubation. At the onset of pipping, pipped a-eggs were significantly warmer than unpipped b-eggs in the same nest. This difference was not due to egg size. At more advanced nests, where the older a-egg had already hatched, temperatures of b-eggs increased significantly after pipping. Embryonic heat production was not a confounding variable in either situation. Results  support the interpretation that late-stage embryos are able to influence their own incubation temperature by communicating with their parents.

TI ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF INDIVIDUAL SPATIAL CHOICE IN FORAGING GROUPS
   OF BROWN CAPUCHIN MONKEYS, CEBUS-APELLA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individuals in a foraging group of brown capuchin monkeys choose different spatial positions relative to the rest of the group. An individual''s choice of spatial position affects its foraging success and perceived predation risk (as measured by vigilance behaviour). The two most dominant group members preferred to forage where their expected foraging success was greatest. Juveniles chose to forage where their perceived predation risk was least, not where they would achieve the highest foraging success. The positions used by non-dominant adults neither maximized foraging success nor minimized predation risk. It is likely that subordinate adults accept spatial positions with suboptimal ecological consequences to avoid the costs of frequent confrontations with the dominant members of the group over foraging sites in preferred positions.

   CRABEATING MACAQUES, MACACA-FASCICULARIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behaviour patterns of non-human primates that are labelled ''cultural'' may arise and diffuse through several processes. Assessing the contribution of various processes requires full knowledge of the history of the phenomenon. In the present study, food washing, the most quoted example of protocultural behaviour in monkeys, was investigated. All individuals in small groups of capuchins and crabeating macaques treated sandy food and water as they had previously treated toys and water. The majority  of individuals consistently washed sandy food. In two large groups of capuchins, however, only a few individuals did so. There was no evidence of imitation, in either the large or the small groups. Individual discovery within a supportive social context can account for the appearance of food washing among several members of a group.

TI TERRITORIALITY IN DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER AS A CONDITIONAL STRATEGY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Factors affecting the establishment of territories and incidence of territorial defence in Drosophila melanogaster males were examined, as well as their influence on the relative mating success of territorial and non-territorial males. Males were more likely to establish territories when females or recently eclosed males were present. Territorial defence was not influenced by female age and reproductive state and was more likely on food areas of 20 mm than on either larger or smaller ones. Very large food areas were not defended at all. Territorial males defending large food areas did not have a mating advantage. Males were more likely to defend resources that were attractive to females for oviposition. Sex ratio did not influence the tendency of males to establish territories and territorial males had a mating advantage even when females were twice as common as males. Males were less likely to establish and defend territories when more than 12 males were present with only one food area. This coincided with the absence of a mating advantage for territorial males at a high male density. The findings suggest that D. melanogaster males are more likely to express territorial behaviour when territory defence is associated with a mating advantage.

TI COURTSHIP AND FEMALE MATE SELECTION IN A MARINE ISOPOD CRUSTACEAN,
   PARACERCEIS-SCULPTA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Females are semelparous in Paracerceis sculpta, a harem polygynous isopod that breeds in intertidal sponges in the northern Gulf of California. Reproductive females locate males established in spongocoels, and initiate courtship, which involves oral contact of males by females, and lifting and shaking of females by males. Despite this apparent assessment, females do not discriminate among males that differ by 10% in body length, by 30 days in age, or that lack appendages used in courtship. In  most cases, females pair with the first male they encounter. Males, moreover, show no reluctance to pair with any female that approaches their spongocoel. Females as well as males are attracted to spongocoels occupied by multiple gravid females. Males attempt to control such sites, and body size confers and advantage in spongocoel takeover. Predation risks incurred by females while searching for spongocoels may favour individuals responding to chemical cues that reliably indicate breeding site quality, e.g. those emanating from estabilished breeding aggregations. That sponges containing gravid females attract unmated females may explain why males attempt to monopolize these sites.

   ASYMMETRICAL CHANGE IN ACCEPTANCE AND REJECTION DUE TO ODOR TRANSFER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Transferability of coloy-specific odours in the queenless and worker-parthenogenetic ant, Pristomyrmex pungens, was tested. Individuals that were exposed to members of other conspecific colonies for 3 days in the laboratory were completely rejected by their nestmates in the field as were alien conspecifics. On the other hand, alien ants that were exposed to nestmates were also completely rejected. Thus it is suggested that labels of individual workers were transferred to other conspecific  individuals, and that colonial label formation in this species is based on (1) a worker-gestalt model, i.e. worker-produced labels were blended within the colony and formed a collective colony odour or (2) environmental chemical substances. Further, template formation may be based on (1) a mean template model (if the dosage of the chemical components of an individual''s label deviates significantly from the criterion, the mean template, the individuals will be rejected) or (2) rejection of foreign labels (qualitatively different labels).

TI HATCHING ASYNCHRONY, SIBLING COMPETITION AND SIBLICIDE IN NESTLING BIRDS
   - STUDIES OF SWIFTLETS AND BEE-EATERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The consequence of hatching asynchrony for fledging success and sibling competition in white-bellied swiflets, Collocalia esculenta, and blue-throated bee-eaters, Merops viridis, was studied by observation and manipulation of nest contents at breeding colonies in Malaysia. A greater synchrony of hatching tended to increase fledging success amongst swiftlets, a result consistent with most other similar minipulative studies to date. Sibling competition in blue-throated bee-eaters invariably led to nest fatalities, which were induced by sibling attacks with an apparently unique, but developmentally temporary, hook at the tip of the upper mandible. Measurements of energy expenditure using a doubly labelled water technique showed that synchrony also reduced the energy cost of nestling competition in bee-eaters, thereby providing a possible mechanism for improved growth and survival of synchronous broods. No universal adaptive function for hatching asynchrony was identified, so it is proposed that a primary function is to encourage distribution of food amongst the brood in a way that permits resource tracking, but can also allow brood reduction under extreme adversity (i.e. sustained food ''crash'', parental death or desertion).

TI BOUNDARY DISPUTES IN THE TERRITORIAL ANT AZTECA-TRIGONA - EFFECTS OF
   ASYMMETRIES IN COLONY SIZE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Neighbouring colonies of the arboreal ant Azteca trigona estabilish distinct territory boundaries that unequally partition foraging space. This paper presents a series of field experiments designed to reveal how boundaries are established and how space is divided during contests between colonies that differ in worker population. In battles staged at territory edges, ants from the colony with the greater local density of workers were more likely to recruit nestmates and were more likely to  retain control of the contested area. The decision to attack or to withdraw depended upon the relative number of nestmates and intruders. Experimental manipulation of bridges leading to baited platforms showed that prior owners were more likely to win contests, due to strong recruitment by the first ants to discover new regions. On a larger scale, when colony strength was lowered by removal of nests and by application of pesticides, weakened colonies lost more territory to their neighbours than did size-matched controls. These results show that the outcome of boundary disputes depends upon asymmetries in strength between adjacent residents.

TI CAUSES OF ASSORTATIVE MATING IN ARTHROPODS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Assortative mating by size, one of the most common mating patterns in natural populations may be explained by three hypotheses: (1) mate choice, whereby large males, large females or large individuals of both sexes choose large mates because they benefit reproductively and are differentially capable of exercising choice; (2) mate availability, whereby large females or large individuals of both sexes are differentially available for mating because of size-differential variation in mating  probability to timing that is unrelated to mate choice; and (3) mating constraints, whereby relative size differences between males and females cause physical or energetic difficulties with courtship, pairing or mating. Analysis of the causes of assortative mating in well-studied arthropod species provides some support for each hypothesis in one or more species. However, comparative analysis of many species indicates that assortative mating is most closely associated with the pattern of large  size of paired males and females relative to unpaired males and females and the occurrence of long pairing durations and male fighting. These comparative data therefore implicate two hypotheses for the causes of assortative mating in most arthropods: male choice of large females combined with male-male competition, and increased availability of large females combined with male-male competition. The female availability hypothesis may be more plausible because male choice and male-male  competition are apparently antagonistic processes whose effects usually do not coincide. Distinguishing between hypotheses based on mate choice, mate availability and mating constraints is crucial to understanding the roles of natural selection and sexual selection in causing assortative mating.

TI RELATIVE DOMINANCE AMONG MALES IS EXPRESSED IN THE ELECTRIC ORGAN
   DISCHARGE CHARACTERISTICS OF A WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The spectral characteristics of the electric organ discharge (EOD) of a species of pulse-type electric fish, Hypopomus occidentalis, can rapidly change during aggressive interactions. Pairs of animals were matched in aggressive displacement tests to score for dominance. The winning males displayed a reduction in the peak-power frequency of their EODs within 2 days. In addition, a correlation was found between the maintenance of dominant status and the display of the largest-amplitude EOD.  Thus, in an interacting group of this species, a male with an EOD characterized by a lowest peak-power frequency and largest-amplitude holds the dominant status. Mechanisms are discussed as to how aggressive behavioral interactions may rapidly effect physiological changes in the EOD.

TI CONSISTENCY IN THE TIMING OF MIGRATION FOR INDIVIDUAL BEWICKS SWANS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It is widely accepted that the timing of migration in avian species is determined by both external and endogenous factors. The possibility that individuals of the same species may have differing migration thresholds, however, has not been explored in such detail. This study shows that consistency from year to year in the migratory pattern of individual Bewick''s swans, Cygnus columbianus bewickii, exceeds a level referable to chance, despite fluctuation in the data due to other variables.  Photoperiod controls the timing of migration in many species and it is suggested that the factor that regulates the onset of migratory activity in individual swans is the individuals'' response threshold to changes in daylength. A comparison of the arrival and departure dates obtained for each bird showed an inverse relationship between the two sets of data: swans that arrived early were more likely to leave late. Consideration of the data obtained for parents and their full-grown offspring indicated that the offspring may acquire, either genetically or by learning, their parents'' migratory thresholds. Heritability levels were low, however, accounting for 10-20% of the variation in the arrival and departure data.

TI CHILLINGHAM CATTLE - SOCIAL AND MAINTENANCE BEHAVIOR IN AN UNGULATE THAT
   BREEDS ALL YEAR ROUND
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The Chillingham cattle, Bos taurus, range over a 134-ha park in northern England. No bulls are castrated, and breeding takes place all year round; groups of two or three bulls live in shared home ranges. Observations were made of social and maintenance behaviours. In comparison with cows, bulls (1) spent a smaller proportion of their non-grazing and non-ruminating time lying and (2) had shorter bouts of grazing and other maintenance behaviours during daytime, but longer bouts at night. In  cows, duration of grazing bout was correlated with the time to the next grazing bout. This correlation was not observed in bulls, implying that the factors determining when a grazing bout starts differed between the sexes. Bulls were more easily distracted than cows. Though calves were conceived all year round, social behaviour peaked in the summer. Some social behaviour took place at night. Physical interactions were seldom seen between bulls from different home ranges, but were frequent among the bulls who shared a home range. Displacements involving animals of different sex were infrequent. Cow-cow displacements were usually preceded by maintenance behaviour, while bull-bull displacements usually involved display. Horn-to-horn contact was as likely to be followed as preceded by display; this ''symmetry'' of contests is discussed with reference to some other species.

TI SELECTION FOR TERRITORIALITY IN DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER - CORRELATED
   RESPONSES IN MATING SUCCESS AND OTHER FITNESS COMPONENTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Lines of Drosophila melanogaster previously selected for increased territorial success were characterized for mating success and other fitness components. The selection response had not diminished after more than 10 generations of relaxed selection. Males from selected lines had a mating advantage over males from unselected lines in large population cages, but not in matings with virgin females or when male density was low and not all the available territories were defended. Selected males had a small mating disadvantage when they were relatively more common than control males. Selection had no effect on the remating speed of males held singly with females, or on larval fitness. The longevity of males from selection and control lines differed when there was territorial defence, but not when territoriality was absent. Implications for genetic variation in territorial success within D. melanogaster populations are discussed.

TI DESIGN-FEATURES AND DEVELOPMENTAL MODIFICATION OF PIGTAIL MACAQUE,
   MACACA-NEMESTRINA, AGONISTIC SCREAMS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Scream vocalizations produced by pigtail macaques during agonistic encounters were studied using spectrographic and multivariate analyses. These calls are important in the recruitment of support from allies against opponents. Direct discriminant analysis was used to classify screams recorded from 45 monkeys living in a stable captive group at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center. Pigtail macaques employed acoustically distinct classes of screams depending upon features of the agonistic context: four types of screams were associated with the relative rank of the opponent and with the severity of the aggression. A comparison of rhesus macaque, Macaca mulatta, screams with those of pigtail macaques revealed that the acoustic features of screams used by the two species in identical agonistic contexts were very different. Matrilineal relatedness did not emerge as a factor related to specific call types in pigtail monkeys as it had for rhesus monkey screams. Significantly more classification errors were made for the calls recorded from monkeys under 3 years of age than for older monkeys in each of the four agonistic contexts. Calls correctly classified into the four agonistic contexts were assigned with a significantly higher probability for older monkeys, suggesting that call renditions of older monkeys were closer to the ''prototype'' for a particular context than were those of younger monkeys. Proper contextual usage and the production of screams appear to undergo  developmental modification.

TI THE PERFORMANCE OF NEST BUILDING BY DOMESTIC HENS - IS IT MORE IMPORTANT
   THAN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEST
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Domestic hens were presented with three different types of littered nest: a flat litter surface (A), a preformed hallowed nest (B) and a preformed nest with an egg (C). Nests B and C had been previously constructed by the hen under test. The overall duration of pre-laying behaviour was greater in nest type C than in both nest types A and B. Of the three nest-building behaviour patterns, gathering, in which the hen moved litter nearer to her body with head and beak movements, and litter-placing, in which she picked up particles of litter and dropped them over her shoulder, increased in the performed nests compared with the control. Rotating, in which the hen crouched on the nest, rotated and scraped outwards with her feet, did no differ between treatments. Thus, nest-building behaviour was not inhibited by the existence of a preformed nest. This finding does not support the hypothesis that animal welfare in intensive housing can be safeguarded merely by providing that environment which could have been created by the animal''s own activities. Rather, it suggests that performance of behaviour can in itself be reinforcing and that provision is required for such behaviour to be carried out. This finding may also have important implications for general motivational theory.

TI GROUP FISSION AMONG WILD TOQUE MACAQUES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF FEMALE
   RESOURCE COMPETITION AND ENVIRONMENTAL-STRESS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB At Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka, four out of 29 groups of toque macaques, Macaca sinica, divided in a period of 16 years. Temporary peripheral subgroups of varying sizes and compositions preceded fission by 9-40 months. Fission crystallized within a month through an increase and stabilization of subgroup membership and permanent division. All members in the newly seceded groups had been frequent participants in pre-fission subgroups, and belonged to subordinate matrilineages. Subgroups, and hence  group divisions, were initiated by cores of mutually loyal females and occurred mostly along kinship lines. In the year of fissions, the rate of change in female dominance relations was significantly greater among groups that divided than among those than did not. It is hypothesized that low-ranking females secede to form new groups when the costs, especially of intragroup competition for food resources, outweigh the benefits of group membership. Such seceding females were easily available and familiar mates for group males that had recently lost rank. Final division, therefore, resulted from a coalition of subordinate females and males acting according to their respective interests. It was triggered in this population by rapid growth of some groups to large size and by environmental stress (the reduction and fragmentation of food resources caused by drought and a cyclone), which accentuated the costs of resource competition. Male aggression, such as infanticide, which negatively  affects female fitness, might also have contributed to one group fission.

TI CACHING BEHAVIOR BY EASTERN WOODRATS, NEOTOMA-FLORIDANA, IN RELATION TO
   FOOD PERISHABILITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two experiments were conducted on eastern woodrats to determine whether the preference for food items gathered for their caches and the sequence of use of items in the cache varied with perishability. In the first experiment, woodrats were given either 2 kg each of two non-perishable items, laboratory chow and bur oak acorns (which they used more than chow), or 2 kg each of preferred, but perishable, grapes and the non-perishable chow. As hypothesized, the woodrats both ate and stored acorns  they were paired with chow (there would be no advantage to either eating or storing the less-used chow). In contrast, when given grapes and chow, the woodrats continued to eat grapes but stored primarily chow. That is, the utility of the items appeared to change depending on whether they were to be eaten or stored. In the second experiment, woodrats were given excess amounts of chow or grapes that were 2, 4, 6 and 8 days old. They ingested chow in the proportions available, as the chow did not spoil with age. However, they consumed grapes in proportions significantly different from those available. It was anticipated that they would eat the oldest grapes first and store the freshest grapes, but neither this pattern nor any other was obvious in relation to the age of the grapes. The results suggest that woodrats discriminate between food items based on their perishability, and vary their decisions about what to ingest and store accordingly.

TI EXPERIMENTAL-EVIDENCE FOR SEXUALLY SELECTED INFANTICIDE IN TREE SWALLOWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sexually selected infanticide, the killing of young to secure a mating opportunity, appears to be rare in birds, although it is relatively common in mammals. To examine the frequency of occurrence and the conditions under when male tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, commit infanticide, resident males were removed from 15 nests shortly after the eggs hatched. Of seven replacement males, two were directly observed killing nestlings, and three were strongly suspected of killing nestlings. Three  of the infanticidal males proceeded to mate; one with the widowed female, and two with a new female. A subadult female floater was also observed committing infanticide at a nest where both residents were present. For male tree swallows, a nest site is essential for acquiring a mate. Intense intrasexual competition among males for nest sites results in a floating population of males with no mating success. It is argued that infanticide in male tree swallows is a sexually selected behaviour, because unmatted males that are infanticidal obtain a nest site and therefore have a higher probability of mating than males that refrain from infanticide.

TI ALARM RESPONSE IN LARVAL WESTERN TOADS, BUFO-BOREAS - RELEASE OF LARVAL
   CHEMICALS BY A NATURAL PREDATOR AND ITS EFFECT ON PREDATOR CAPTURE
   EFFICIENCY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An alarm response in larvae of the western toad, Bufo boreas, was examined in the laboratory. A natural predator, the giant water bug, Lethocerus americanus, while capturing and feeding on a tadpole, can cause sufficient damage for the release of toad alarm substance and subsequent alarm response in prey conspecifics. Larvae increased their activity and avoided the side of the tank that had a predator feeding on a conspecific tadpole in a visually isolated but interconnected container.  Larvae did not increase activity or avoid the side of the tank that had a predator feeding on a heterospecific tadpole. Performance of the alarm response in conspecifics increased survivorship. The capture efficiency of predators (naiads of the dragonfly Aeshna umbrosa) hunting larvae that had been exposed to the alarm substance of conspecifics was reduced: predators required more capture attempts per successful attack compared to control tests.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effect of seed dispersion on the rate of seed consumption by dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, feeding in dyads and in triads. In the dyad experiments, dominants consumed significantly more seeds than subordinates when seeds were clumped in a patch of 0.09 m2, but subordinates obtained as many seeds as dominants when food was dispersed in a larger 1.44-m2 patch. In the triad experiments, there was a significant difference in seed consumption between dominants, intermediates and subordinates when food was dispersed in patches of 0.09 m2 and 1.44 m2, but there was no significant difference between ranks when it was dispersed in a larger 2.88 m2 patch. Dominants had significantly more agonistic interactions with intermediates than with subordinates. This was not related to differences in distances maintained between birds. Dispersion of seeds in the environment can have a marked effect on whether dominants realize an immediate foraging advantage over subordinates.

TI VOCALLY MEDIATED RECIPROCITY BETWEEN NEIGHBORING GROUPS OF MANTLED
   HOWLING MONKEYS, ALOUATTA-PALLIATA-PALLIATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The hypothesis that acoustic communication mediates spacing between groups of mantled howling monkeys, Alouatta palliata palliata, was tested experimentally in a Costa Rican forest. Previous work showed that reverberation increases with the distance sound propagates within the forest and thus could provide distance cues to monkeys. Two series of barks were therefore played back to test groups: the first series simulated the calls of a male withdrawing from the test group; the second series simulated the calls of an approaching male. In response, males approached the sounds of an apparently approaching male and withdrew from an apparently withdrawing male. Thus reverberation provided cues about distance to the howling monkeys. The direction in which the monkeys moved depended on the direction of movement simulated by the call sequence. Furthermore, the pattern of reciprocated movements, which exemplifies a form of the evolutionarily stable strategy ''Tit-For-Tat'', helps to regulate  relations between neighbouring males and hence spacing between neighbouring groups.

TI FLOWER CHOICE AND BOWER DECORATION IN THE SATIN BOWERBIRD
   PTILONORHYNCHUS-VIOLACEUS - A TEST OF HYPOTHESES FOR THE EVOLUTION OF
   MALE DISPLAY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Flowers are a common decoration used on the bowers of male satin bowerbirds. The characteristics of flowers that promote their use as decorations by males are evaluated. Out of a total of 70 species recorded along transects, inflorescences from 29 species were found on bowers. Seven flower species accounted for 93% of the inflorescences used on bowers. Blue and purple species occurred on bowers at a greater frequency than they occurred in the habitat. White and yellow species appeared on bowers proportionately less often, and orange, pink and red not at all. Male satin bowerbirds used a wider range of colours of flowers than has been previously reported, and preferred blue and purple over yellow and white flowers. Flower choice experiments showed that males may discriminate between flowers only on the basis of colour, and that males favour flowers that appear infrequently on bowers. The results suggest several conclusions about how flowers are used on bowers. (1) Male flower  preferences and male ability to collect inflorescences affect how flowers are used on bowers. The common use of flowers shown to be less preferred in choice tests implies that there are constraints on the gathering of more preferred flowers and this causes males to produce suboptimal displays. (2) Male preference for novel flowers suggests that flower choice by males is due to a set of general selection criteria and does not result from preferences for specific flower species. (3) The strong male preference for, and the high rate of use of, rare blue flowers supports the hypothesis that the rarity of colours may influence the evolution of male flower preferences. This strong preference for scarce flowers offers some support for models that suggest that male displays are not arbitrary, but may serve as indicators of male quality as sires.

TI SANDBATHING AS A TERRITORIAL SCENT-MARK IN THE BANNERTAIL KANGAROO RAT,
   DIPODOMYS-SPECTABILIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sandbathing by the bannertail kangaroo rat, Dipodomys spectabilis, was studied in the laboratory and field to determine its possible function as a territorial scent-mark. Rats were tested for their responses to body oil and dorsal gland scents from familiar and unfamiliar rats and to the sandbathing sites of rats in different hormonal conditions. Field evidence showed that adult and juvenile rats of both sexes sandbathed at similar rates in their territories. Rats recognized scents of different conspecifics from body oils and dorsal gland secretions. The sandbathing marks of intact males, castrated males, oestrous females and non-oestrous females were equally attractive to rats in reproductive and non-reproductive conditions. Sandbathing scents apparently do not communicate information on reproductive status in this species. Rats sandbathe to scent-mark their territories and may use the scents to distinguish familiar neighbours from unfamiliar conspecifics. Neighbour  recognition is probably important in maintaining the territorial social organization of D. spectabilis.

TI A FIXED TIME-INTERVAL BETWEEN 2 BEHAVIORAL ELEMENTS IN THE
   MATING-BEHAVIOR OF MALE CRICKETS, GRYLLUS-BIMACULATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the sequence of mating behaviours of male crickets there is a fixed time-interval between two behaviours: spermatophore protrusion and courtship stridulation. During the fixed time-interval, courtship activities are specifically suppressed and self-maintenance activities such as feeding, drinking and aggressive stridulation appear. This paper reports on an experiment to investigate an interval timing mechanism controlling behavioural time sharing. Isolation experiments revealed that the  presence of a female was necessary as a releaser for a male to stridulate the courtship song. However, the presence or absence of a female did not affect the length of the interval between the two behaviours. Even when spermatophore protrusion was postponed or the spermatophore was removed, the time-interval from spermatophore protrusion to courtship stridulation was unaffected. The interval seemed to depend on an internal mechanism, because (1) sensory feedbacks from genital organs were not necessary, (2) the interval length was about 1 h, and (3) the temperature coefficient Q10 was 2.0.

TI SEASONAL-CHANGES IN AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR OF THE WESTERN RED-BACKED
   SALAMANDER, PLETHODON-VEHICULUM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the behaviour of adult western red-backed salamanders, P. vehiculum, in intrasexual encounters, and (2) to test specific hypotheses to elucidate the adaptive contexts in which agonistic behaviour occurs in this species. Two alternative hypotheses were tested. (1) Levels of aggression peak during the mating season in the autumn and are relatively low among individuals of both sexes at other times of the year (agonistic behaviour is associated  with mating), or (2) levels of aggression are relatively high among individuals of both sexes throughout the year (agonistic behaviour is associated primarily with competition for resources other than mates). A further prediction, based on the theory of sexual selection, was that males are more aggressive than females during the peak mating season in the autumn. The behaviour of P. vehiculum was to a large extent similar to that reported for other species of plethodontids, but a few  behaviours, tentatively designated as threat displays, have not been previously described. Seasonal changes and sexual differences in the frequency of agonistic behaviour were in accordance with hypothesis (1) as stated above. Agonistic behaviour was largely confined to male-male encounters in the autumn and was infrequent in these encounters outside the mating season as well as among females at all times of the year. As predicted, in the autumn males were more aggressive than females.  Agonistic behaviour of P. vehiculum is therefore primarily associated with mating behaviour.

TI FEATHER STEALING IN THE SATIN BOWERBIRD (PTILONORHYNCHUS-VIOLACEUS) -
   MALE COMPETITION AND THE QUALITY OF DISPLAY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male satin bowerbirds use feathers to decorate their bowers and often steal feathers and other decorations from the bowers of other males. Decorations are a key element in sexual display and tracking their movement between bowers provides the first detailed information about this unique pattern of sexual competition. For two field seasons the movement of marked feathers was followed. Males varied greatly in stealing activity. The most active feather thieves were often from areas where bowers  were close together and they were involved in reciprocal stealing with males at adjacent bowers. The rate of stealing by males was significantly correlated with the number of feathers on their bowers. This suggests that stealing is important in determining the level of bower decoration and mating success. Patterns of stealing behaviour support models of sexual selection which suggest that male interactions are important in influencing female choice through their effects on the quality of male  display.

TI FEMALE CHOICE, MALE STRATEGIES AND THE ROLE OF VOCALIZATIONS IN THE
   AUSTRALIAN FROG UPEROLEIA-RUGOSA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of Uperoleia rugosa call from aggregations around ponds in southeastern Australia on warm, humid nights between September and February. Within the aggregations the males maintain an acoustic territory; they attack calling intruders that are smaller than themselves, but retreat from larger intruders or become their silent satellites. Only males call. They produce three distinct vocalizations: (1) an advertisement call that attracts both males and females, and is used to maintain the male''s spatial distribution; (2) an encounter call which is used in territorial interactions; and (3) a courtship call that is only produced when males perceive a female in their immediate vicinity. Females only visit the pond when gravid and spend three or four nights moving slowly through the aggregations of males, apparently listening to a sample of males before initiating amplexus with one of them. Females placed between two loudspeakers playing recordings of the advertisement calls of a heavy and light male always select the calls of the heavier male. There is a strong correlation between the weights, but not the lengths, of males and females found in amplexus; females select mates that are about 70% of their body weight. Females undoubtedly choose particular males on the basis of acoustic cues; if amplectant pairs are separated, the female consistently returns to her original mate, despite repeatedly being released beside other calling males. The probable acoustic cue is dominant frequency (kHz) which is inversely correlated with the callers'' body size and weight. The mating system is a lek, in which males compete intensively for exclusive display sites that contain no resources for females or their offspring, and females sample the displaying males before selecting a mate.

TI BREEDING ROLES AND PAIRING PATTERNS WITHIN COMMUNAL GROUPS OF
   GROOVE-BILLED ANIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The objective of this study was to determine how the breeding roles of males and females in communal groups of groove-billed anis (Crotophaga sulcirostris) are related to mating patterns. We found that, in the majority of groups (68%), the nocturnal incubator male was mated to the last-laying female, which tossed out some of the eggs of other females and usually obtained the largest number of incubated eggs in the communal clutch. However, in the remaining groups (32%), the nocturnal incubator male was mated to the first-laying female (reversed pairing pattern), Many of the first layers that were mated to nocturnal incubators attempted unusual counter-strategies to obtain more incubated eggs, such as laying many extra eggs and/or abandoning the nest to force renesting, with a high probability of changing the laying order. Reversed groups in which the first layer did not achieve the greatest relative clutch size always disbanded. We conclude that these interactions are a  normal part of female strategies to obtain the most eggs in the nest, and find that age and certain physical traits are better predictors of relative female fitness than laying order. Dominant males who assume the risky nocturnal incubation duties apparently use these latter cues to choose the most fecund female. In cases of incorrect assessment, the first layer and her nocturnal-incubator mate often emigrate out of the group.

TI ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF MATERNAL RESPONSIVENESS IN POSTPARTUM
   WISTAR RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Maternal responsiveness towards 4-10-day-old pups (retrieving, crouching over and licking of pups) was measured in primiparous Wistar rats over a period of 40 days postpartum in a daily, 30-min test. It was found that maternal responsiveness is gradually established during a critical period lasting up to 48 h after parturition. Extended tactile stimulation by young, presumably on the female''s ventral surface, was indispensable for the establishment of maternal solicitude and for its subsequent  maintenance during the course of lactation. Neither teat stimulation by sucking nor exteroceptive stimuli from pups contributed to the establishment or the maintenance of maternal solicitude. It is suggested that the need for physical access to pups may vary among colonies of laboratory rats according to their respective inherent tendencies to care for young.

TI SEXUALLY SELECTED INFANTICIDE BY ADULT MALE BARN SWALLOWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Since 1980, 3 definite and 5 suspected instances of sexually selected infanticide by unmated males in the monogamous barn swallow, Hirundo rustica were documented. This is the 1st report of this type of infanticide by males in any bird species, or by either sex in any monogamous species. In this population, infanticide appears to be an adaptation serving 2 functions. It speeds the reproductive cycle of victimized females so that males can breed with them sooner than if they had been permitted  to raise their young. In addition, it may enable unmated males to acquire females by causing them to desert their mates.

   VARIABLE MATING SYSTEM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mating system of a population of 90 breeding dunnocks (or hedge sparrow, P. modularis) included monogamy, polygyny, polyandry and polygynandry. Monogamous males guarded females during their fertile period to prevent neighboring males from copulating. The most intense guarding occurred where 2 (unrelated) males shared a territory. Here, the alpha male tried to prevent the beta male from copulating with the female. Beta males were seen to copulate in only half the cases. They were more likely to succeed when the alpha male found it difficult to guard the female closely because her range was large, the vegetation was dense or there were other females breeding synchronously on the same territory. Close guarding and chasing by males reduced the female''s feeding rate and was correlated with unhatched eggs in the nest. Females attempted to escape the alpha male''s attentions and actively encouraged the beta male to mate. Beta males only helped to feed the young if they copulated  with the female. Nestlings fed by 2 males and a female got more food and weighed more than those fed by just 1 male and a female. Indirect evidence suggested that when beta males failed to copulate, they destroyed eggs or young chicks. Females laid larger clutches when 2 males mated with them as opposed to one, thus adapting their clutch size to the amount of parental care they expected. The results of natural removal experiments and matched comparisons of the same female in different mating systems support these conclusions. For females, selection favors cooperative polyandry; for males it favors polygyny; the variable mating system may reflect the different outcomes of this sexual conflict.

TI INFLUENCE OF ASYMMETRIES IN RESOURCE QUALITY AND AGE ON AGGRESSION AND
   DOMINANCE IN BLACK-CHINNED HUMMINGBIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB According to current theory, dominance relationships may depend on asymmetrices between adversaries in their expected net gain from contested resources. A prediction derived from this theory was confirmed in the field by experimentally creating asymmetries between neighboring territoral hummingbirds with regard to their net energy gains from the territories, and the forcing them to fight for ownership of the combined resources of the 2 territories. When territory productivity was increased to levels well above the daily energy requirements of each contestant, energetic asymmetries no longer detectably influence dominance, and the amounts of aggression per contest was lower. Contents in which an energetic asymmetry was partially offset by an age-related asymmetry involved more fights than contests in which opponents belonged to different age classes but controlled feeders of identical productivity. The predicted negative correlation between the magnitude of the asymmetry in net  energy gain and agonistic investiment in the contest did not occur.

TI TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR OF LARVAE ENHANCES MATING SUCCESS OF MALE
   DRAGONFLIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Laboratory experiments showed that the predatory aquatic larvae of the dragonfly P. nymphula, are territorial, defending feeding sites against intruders, and also that body length in the final instar is positively correlated with the provision of food during the last 3 or 4 larval instars. Larval length is positively correlated with larval head width which is likewise correlated with both the weight and head width of 1-day-old adults. Field observations demonstrated that larger male adults win more territorial disputes and obtain more matings near water. So the success of larvae in defending territories enhances short-term mating success in adult males.

TI MALE-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN AN ALL-FEMALE LIZARD - RELATIONSHIP TO OVARIAN
   CYCLE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A quantitative analysis of the relationship between pseudocopulatory behavior and the ovarian cycle in the parthenogenetic lizard Cnemidophorus uniparens indicates that this behavior is frequently and regularly expressed by captive individuals, and that the sexual role, either male-like or female-like, exhibited by an animal is correlated with its ovarian state. The expression of female-like behavior patterns was associated with and primarily limited to the vitellogenic stage of the cycle. Male-like behavior patterns occurred most frequently during post-ovulatory stages but was not limited to these stages. Neither behavioral role was ever expressed by non-reproductive individuals. Reproductive individuals often alternated in assuming the female-like and male-like roles during the progress of the ovarian cycle. These observations suggest that pseudosexual behavior is hormonally activated in this species. It also appears that the prevailing social situation is an important factor determining which behavioral role is taken. This work strengthens the hypothesis that pseudosexual behavior in all-female lizards occurs as the result of natural selection.

TI THE COMMUNICATIVE COST OF CRYPSIS IN A HERMIT CRAB PAGURUS-MARSHI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB P. marshi is a highly cryptic hermit crab. Experimentally removal of epibiota and detritus from the legs and shell resulted in increased communication efficiency during agonistic bouts. Interactions began sooner, more brief initial bouts occurred, initial bouts were resolved with fewer acts and fewer leg displays were used overall. The lack of strong differences in bout durations and of a difference in mean information transmission indicates that the crypsis is broken early in interactions. Crypsis costs less, in terms of lower intraspecific communication efficiency, than was predicted under the null hypothesis of no special ability to decode conspecific crypsis.

TI SLEEPING AND VIGILANCE IN BIRDS .1. FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF THE MALLARD
   (ANAS-PLATYRHYNCHOS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sleep in birds involves a period of eye closure interrupted by peeks of eye opening. Peeking allows a bird to scan the sleeping site for predators. Observations of mallards sleeping on a jetty at Folly Bridge, Oxford, revealed that peeking rates of both males and females fell with increasing distance from the riverbank. In the breeding season males peeked faster than females. These high levels of male vigilance were maintained even after females had left Folly Bridge to rear their young. Male peeking rates fell to the same level as that of females once males had adopated cryptic eclipse plumage following the post-breeding moult. The bright, conspicuous nuptial plumage probably makes males more vulnerable to predators, forcing nuptial males to be more vigilant than eclipse males and females. Females exploit these high levels of male vigilance: as the number of nuptial males in a flock increases, females lower their peeking rates.

TI MOTHER OFFSPRING RELATIONSHIPS IN CHIMPANZEES AFTER WEANING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Juvenile chimpanzees at Gombe National Park associated almost constantly with their mothers for several years after they were weaned from suckling. This association declined abruptly in 3 contexts: when mothers resumed estrous cycles and consorted with individual males, when females left their mothers at adolescence to mate with males and when males reached puberty. Males spent more time at a distance from their mothers and were more gregarious than females. Mothers supplanted daughters more than sons from food. The contexts of separation and the positive interactions between mothers and offspring of all ages suggest that conflicting social requirements rather than increased rejection by the mother eventually draw mother and offspring apart. The costs and benefits to mothers and offspring of continued association are discussed in the context of the unusual social structure of chimpanzees.

TI PREY ASSESSMENT BY PLOVERS (CHARADRIIDAE) - NET RATE OF ENERGY-INTAKE
   AND VULNERABILITY TO KLEPTOPARASITES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A cost/benefit analysis was made of the crouching posture (for prey assessment) used by plovers (Charadriidae). The size and profitability (calorific yield/unit travel, crouch and handle time) of earthworm (Lumbricidae) prey were greatest at the maximum depth to which a plover could probe. Plovers selected these more profitable prey and preceded deep captures with longer crouches. Plovers did not crouch for long enough to maximize their potential net rate of energy intake, possibly because too  much time devoted to crouching would have prevented detection of an attacking predator or kleptoparasite. When kleptoparasitic black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus) were present, plovers reduced their tendency to crouch and took a less profitable, but more superficial, mixture of prey. The shorter crouches used by the majority of individuals did maximize potential net rate of energy intake, mainly because larger prey would have been stolen by gulls. When crouching was a poor predictor of prey  size taken there was a high probability of unprofitable prey being captured and therefore rejected. Reasons for plovers avoiding potentially-profitable deep worms are discussed and likely constraints acting on prey-assessment time are highlighted.

TI ATTRACTION OF LIOMY MICE TO HORSE DUNG AND THE EXTINCTION OF THIS
   RESPONSE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When horse dung containing the large seeds of Enterolobium cyclocarpum (the guanacaste tree) was experimentally placed in a tropical deciduous forest in Costa Rica (Santa Rosa National Park), L. salvini (Heteromyidae) spiny pocket mice went to it and dug out the seeds. When the Liomys in a particular area were repeatedly offered dung containing E. cyclocarpum seeds, they developed an attraction response to the dung that was so strong that seed-free fresh horse dung made better bait in traps than did an oatmeal-peanut butter mix. A single exposure to seed-rich dung was not adequate to generate this response, but 2 exposures generated a mild response. Once moderately seed-rich dung was no longer forthcoming, the mice in an area lost their strong attraction to horse dung in 3-4 mo.; this loss was due at least in part to the mice learning that the dung no longer contained seeds, since the same individual mice that earlier had been attracted to horse dung were still present as demonstrated by capturing them with other baits.

TI PLAY AS A REINFORCER FOR MAZE-LEARNING IN JUVENILE RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The reinforcing value of play for juvenile rats was examined, relative to that of other social experiences. Successive experimental groups chose, in a T-maze, between normal companions and companions whose social behavior was rendered abnormal by physical confinement or by amphetamine or chlorpromazine treatment. Both drugs inhibited play, as did physical restriction, but they had opposing effects on other social behaviors, so that the choice presented was between social experiences with and without play. Young rats learned these social discriminations as easily as a food/no food discrimination in the same apparatus, developing a preference for the playing partner. Nonplaying partners indulging in large amounts of amicable social behavior were chosen more frequently than unsociable animals.

TI HOME-RANGE USE BY COYOTES IN IDAHO
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Radio-collared coyotes (C. latrans) were relocated every 15 min during continuous 24-h sampling periods. The data were used to estimate patterns of home-range use by coyotes. Utilization of the home range varied spatially and behaviorally. Spatial use was determined by relative amounts of time coyotes spent and amounts of distance they travelled within each area of their home ranges. Behavioral use was based on identification of 3 types of movement patterns that were postulated to represent 3 general kinds of behavior: resting behavior, hunting or investigative behavior and ranging or travelling behavior. Spatial and behavioral uses of the home range area were interrelated; core areas in which animals spent most of their time were also used primarily for resting or hunting. In areas in which animals spent little time, coyotes exhibited primarily ranging behavior. Use patterns were postulated to be the result of coyotes'' selection of areas due to unique vegetal, faunal or physiographic characteristics. Temporal variations in home-range use were found and were postulated to result from seasonal and diel changes in coyote behavior due to the annual reproductive cycle, the seasonal and diel cycle of temperature, and possible cycles in prey behavior.

TI AN INVESTIGATION OF SIBLING RECOGNITION IN RANA-CASCADAE TADPOLES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sibling recognition was studied experimentally in tadpoles of the Cascades frog, R. cascadae. Sibships were divided into 2 groups at an early developmental stage. One group was reared with siblings and the 2nd with a mixture of siblings and non-siblings. When given a choice of associating with a sibling or nonsibling group, individuals reared with siblings preferred siblings. One mixed-reared group spent more time associating with unfamiliar siblings than unfamiliar nonsiblings. Tadpoles of another mixed-reared group preferred to associate with pure siblings over a mixture of siblings and non-siblings with which they were reared. When the stimulus animals were taken exclusively from the mixed-rearing tank, 2 mixed-reared groups showed no sibling preferences. Early association with non-siblings probably does not affect sibling recognition in this species.

TI RATTLESNAKE PREDATORY BEHAVIOR - MEDIATION OF PREY DISCRIMINATION AND
   RELEASE OF SWALLOWING BY CUES ARISING FROM ENVENOMATED MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Responses of rattlesnakes to envenomated mice were examined in 5 experiments. In experiment 1 rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus terrificus and C. viridis viridis) discriminated mice that they had envenomated, as indexed by number of tongue flicks and accumulated investigation time, when these prey items were paired with control mice killed by the experimenter. Rattlesnakes also exhibited this discrimination when presented with mice envenomated by a conspecific and controls killed by the experimenter. In experiments 1 and 2, rattlesnakes delivered a large number of tongue flicks to exudates associated with nasal-oral tissues of envenomated mice. Rattlesnakes typically swallow envenomated, dead mice head first. In experiment 3 this observation was statistically verified. Evidence obtained in experiment 4 indicated that nasal-oral tissues of envenomated, dead mice were discriminated from anogenital tissues by rattlesnakes. Cues arising from the nasal-oral tissues probably assisted the snakes in locating the head-end of the rodent, and released the swallowing modal-action pattern, the final phase of the predatory sequence. Rattlesnakes exhibited no discrimination between nasal-oral and anogenital tissues of non-envenomated, dead mice; the results of experiment 4 were probably dependent upon effects of envenomation.

AB Male olive baboons decreased the probability of their being threatened by other males and increased their relative dominance if they were carrying infants during encounters with other males. Carrying of infants by males could be hazardous to the infant. Males also showed other behaviors which were beneficial to infants. Choice of infant for exploiting and certain forms of caretaking by males varied with the age of the infant. Exploitation and caretaking by males were almost completely restricted to those infants which were born after the males'' immigration into the infants'' troop. Males which exploited infants most often also showed most caretaking behaviors and had resided in that troop the longest. Males that had infants carried against them by other males most often were the most dominant and the youngest sexually mature males. Males still residing in their natal troop chose their matrilineal sibilings most often for exploiting and certain caretaking behaviors. The overall effects of close male-infant relations on the fitness of the male and the infant were discussed.

Competition between wild and domestic males tested simultaneously in pairs produced only minor changes in copulatory behavior. The reproductive success of wild and domestic male pairs simultaneously exposed to naturally cycling females was nearly equal in both the laboratory and an outdoor enclosure. Genotype of the female had little effect on male copulatory behavior. The copulatory behavior of sexually naive and experienced domestic rats did not differ. Most sexually naive wild males failed to exhibit copulatory behavior under the test conditions employed.

Dominant animals of the pairs usually did almost all the panel pressing whether the pair lived together or apart. In pairs tested together with only 1 member trained, the untrained pigs did not learn to respond. In trios tested for 10 min, the dominant pigs did not press most but if 1 animal was satiated before testing, the dominant pigs in the remaining pairs tended to press more. In trios tested for 3 h, 1 pig pressed most and this was unrelated to rank.

TI HOMING BY THE SLUG LIMAX-PSEUDOFLAVUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The nocturnal movements of the terrestrial pulmonate slug L. pseudoflavus Evans were observed under laboratory conditions in dim red light. Slugs introduced into a tank in a home brick always returned to the brick. In experiments with air currents, slugs left home downwind and homed upwind. Individuals did not necessarily follow their outward routes home and were able to return to an established home in a clean trailless tank. These results imply distant chemoreception. The animals nevertheless often followed trails made by themselves and/or other individuals for a while so that preferred routes tended to be set up. It would seem that at least 2 mechanisms of homing are potentially available and that at least two pheromones are involved.

TI RESPONSE OF PREDATORS TO VARYING DENSITIES OF GREGARIA LOCUST NYMPHS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The response to varying densities of prey was investigated by presenting predators (4 human volunteers and a lizard Lacerta lepida Daudin) in an arena, with 5-12 fifth instar phase nymphs of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria Forskal). The activity of the nymphs was also varied by varying the feeding and temperature conditions. Above a certain prey density (which differed between predators) human catching efficiency declined, while the lizard became totally incapable of catching locusts. Efficiency of all predators was reduced by increasing activity of the prey.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observation of 8 kitten litters under semi-natural conditions revealed that maternal and littermate behaviors were associated with increases or decreases in the probability of kitten vocalization. Experimental study, in which kittens were exposed to cold, restraint and isolation during the first 6 wk of life, revealed differences in the rate of vocalization across weeks and across stimulus conditions. Analyses of peak fundamental frequency, duration of cry units and peak amplitude of kitten vocalizations showed significant differences across either stimulus conditions or weeks. Development of physiological mechanisms such as homoiothermy, crucial changes in the litter situation and the vocalization''s role in affecting mother-infant relations were discussed.

TI SOCIAL HIERARCHY, SHELTER USE, AND AVOIDANCE OF PREDATORY TOADFISH
   (OPSANUS-TAU) BY THE STRIPED BLENNY (CHASMODES-BOSQUIANUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A 3-part examination of the predatory relationship between oyster toadfish (O. tau) and striped blennies (C. bosquianus) is described. In the 1st laboratory study, blennies avoided the toadfish when placed in a choice situation. During the 2nd laboratory study, dominant blennies escaped attack significantly more than did subordinates by using a protective shelter. Toadfish will attack active by tethered blennies under natural conditions. As predators, toadfish appear to use a mixed strategy. During the day, when they are relatively inactive, they may feed as ambush predators. At night they probably move about actively, stalking benthic invertebrates and small fishes. They also feed as scavengers, consuming a variety of foods.

TI INTERSPECIFIC AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR BY LONG-TOED LAPWINGS
   (VANELLUS-CRASSIROSTRIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Interspecific aggression is related to ecological relationships between bird species. Three kinds of relationships are distinguished according to the presence or absence of aggression and the degree to which resources are exclusively utilized: interspecific territoriality (aggression, exclusive use), partial exclusion (aggression, no exclusive use) and tolerance (no aggression, no exclusive use). Aggression by long-toed lapwings (V. crassirostris) is examined within this framework, using quantitative data gathered through observational sampling. Lapwings were interspecifically territorial with 1 sp., partially excluded 5 spp. and tolerated 4 spp. The function of interspecific aggressive behavior may be related to competition, predation or both. [Aythya erythrophthalma, Estrilda astrild, Poliocephalus ruficollis, Thalassornis leuconotus, Jacana spinosa, blacksmith plover, squacco heron, black crake, shrike and wattled starling were also discussed.].

DT Article
AB Territory utilization of blackbirds and song thrushes is examined in relation to spatial and temporal changes in the distribution of prey. Pairs within a territory showed similar preferences for particular areas. There was considerable diurnal variation in foraging localities and overall the 2 spp. tended to concentrate their search effort in areas of high prey density. Rates of feeding attempts and feeding techniques also varied with time of day. Changes were similar in the 2 spp. At high rates of feeding during the middle of the day the foraging range was more restricted than at other times. Over short time periods individuals searched non-randomly by avoiding recently exploited areas.

TI SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY AND COLOR-VISION IN GROUND-DWELLING SCIURIDS -
   RESULTS FROM GOLDEN MANTLED GROUND SQUIRRELS AND COMPARISONS FOR 5
   SPECIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behavioral measurements of several indices of visual sensitivity and color vision for the golden-mantled ground squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis) are reported. The spectral sensitivity functions for this animal show a change from having a single peak at about 520 nm to having a strongly bipartite appearance with peaks at about 540 and 460 nm as the level of light adaptation is increased from low to higher levels. Discrimination tests reveal that these squirrels have dichromatic color vision with spectral neutral points centered at 507.5 nm. Comparisons are made of the visual capacities of 5 spp. [S. mexicanus, S. tridecemlineatus, S. beechyi and Cynomys ludovicianus] of ground-dwelling sciurids, all of which have been tested in the same situations. These comparisons indicate that the retinas of all of these species contain a small number of functional rods in addition to a much more obvious cone population; the spectral sensitivity functions of these species do not show systematic variations; the cone pigments found in the retinas of these animals have sensitivity peaks at about 440 and 525 nm; all of these species have dichromatic color vision; there is no evidence for systematic differences in visual sensitivity or color vision among these 5 spp.

AB The olfactory preferences and behavioral responses of sexually naive and sexually experienced male hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) towards anaesthetized conspecifics were investigated. Olfactory preference tests, in which the odors of a pair of anaesthetized stimuls animals were presented in a 2-choice olfactometer, revealed that both sexually inexperienced and experienced males preferred female (estrous and diestrous) to male conspecific odors, but did not discriminate between the odors of receptive and non-receptive females. Similar results were obtained when a pair of unfamiliar anaesthetized conspecifics were presented in a neutral arena (supine test) to sexually naive and experienced male hamsters. Experienced males direct significantly more mounts to anaesthetized females than did sexually inexperienced males.

TI MODELS OF PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT .1. MONOGAMY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Theoretical models for Trivers (1974) concept of parent-offspring conflict were examined for species in which the effects of the conflict are felt by full sibs. A rare conflictor gene will spread if f(m) > 1/2(m + 1), where f(m) is the fitness gained by a conflictor relative to a non-conflictor offspring (f(m) > 1), and m is the amount of parental investment taken by a conflictor relative to m = 1 for a non-conflictor. The range of m alleles which can spread against the parent optimum decreases as the cost to the parent increases until a point is reached where there is no conflict of evolutionary interests. There would be no polymorphism for conflictor: non-conflictor alleles unless special conditions prevail. The conflictor allele which spreads most rapidly as a rare mutant against the parental optimum is not an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). The ESS for parent-offspring conflict in monogamous species has m0 = f(m0)/2[df(m0)/dm0]. The analytical solutions are confirmed throughout by simulations.

TI CONDITION OF PELAGE REGULATES SANDBATHING AND GROOMING BEHAVIOR IN
   KANGAROO RAT (DIPODOMYS-MERRIAMI)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous work suggested that peripheral input from the pelage regulates sandbathing and grooming in D. merriami. To investigate this possiblity kangaroo rats were observed on sandbathing substrate after 4 pre-test treatments. Animals deprived of suitable substrate for 3 days directed equal numbers of sandbathing and grooming components to the left and right sides of the body and the ventrum. Animals treated with lanolin on one body surface directed more behavior to the treated area and changed the temporal organization of their cleaning bouts. Animals treated with water, or stimulated tactually showed only non-significant shifts in behavior. Kangaroo rats can adjust the organization of their care of the body surface (COBS) behavior in response to different types of peripheral input stemming from differing local conditions of the body surface.

The purpose is to illustrate similarities between a human adolescent group and other primate groups in the establishment and stability of a dominance hierarchy, indices and frequencies of dominance interactions and characteristics of dominance relations. A hierarchy was evident after 3 days of camp and remained operative throughout the 5 wk, becoming more stable over time. The dominance rank-order was significantly related to athletic ability, leadership and bed position but not to trail position, popularity, body surface area and physical maturity. The possible social effects of the dominance hierarchy are also discussed.

LA English
DT Article
AB Mongolian gerbil (M. unguiculatus) readily attacks an unfamiliar gerbil intruding into its territory. After several attacks, subordinated intruders seldom scent-mark in the occupied area. This inhibition of scent-marking is a response to stimuli associated with the defended territory, since subordinated males mark normally elsewhere. Previous research suggested that olfactory cues were primarily responsible, but data presented here do not support this. Subordinated males scent-marked as often as controls in a neutral arena contaminated with the dominant animals'' bedding odors but seldom scent-marked in an area resembling the defended territory, even though defeat-related odors were absent. Repeated exposure without attack to the visually similar, but clean, test area did not enhance marking in subordinated males.

Straight line nip-right hierarchies were the most frequent type of dominance relationship. In heterosexual groups separate homosexual hierarchies were formed, and females were the more dominant sex. Dominant males performed significantly more reproductive behavior than lower rank individuals. Agonistic behavior appears early in young P. reticulata. Factors involved in determining dominance were size, sex and aggressiveness. Individual or role recognition or both may occur in this species. Advantages of dominance are discussed.

TI GENOTYPE AND RETENTION OF EJACULATORY REFLEX IN CASTRATED MALE MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Genotype proves to be an important factor affecting the retention of sexual responsiveness following castration. Male F1 hybrids between C57BL/6 females and DBA/2 males (B6D2F1) show very prolonged retention. Experiment 1 used a diallelic design using C57BL/6, DBA/2 and BALB/c strains and showed that heterosis per se is not an adequate explanation of the superior retention of the B6D2F1 genotype. Experiment 2 showed that neonatal injections of 100 .mu.g TP [testosterone propionate] to B6D2F1 male mice did not result in better retention of the ejaculatory reflex after castration in adulthood. B6D2F1 males from both experiments who exhibited the ejaculatory reflex for many months after castration went through a difficult period in the 1st 10-12 postcastration wks. During this time, ejaculation latency increased 4-fold, and then returned to the original level. The proportion of males reaching the ejaculatory threshold during this period 1st declined then increased.

AB Female ring doves were exposed for 7 days to stimulation (through a glass partition) from intact or castrate males, either with or without ambient sounds from the breeding colony. Intact males induced more ovarian development than did castrate males, and more ovarian development was induced with sounds from the colony milieu than without, whether the female was with the intact or with the castrate male. In the normal colony situation, stimuli from the mate and those from the surrounding colony environment combine in inducing ovarian development in female doves.

TI AUDITORY SENSITIVITY IN MICE - PEROMYSCUS AND MUS MUSCULUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Auditory evoked potentials from the posterior colliculus were used to measure auditory sensitivity in Peromyscus leucopus, P. boylii, feral Mus musculus, and strain BALB/cJ and DBA/2 J laboratory mice. Moderate Nembutal anaesthesia had no consistent effect on the shape, amplitude, latency, or threshold of the potentials. P. boylii and young P. leucopus appear to have a high frequency sensitivity similar to that of the bat Myotis lucifugas up to about 70 kHz. The feral Mus musculus were more sensitive to higher frequencies than any of the laboratory mice tested, having lowest thresholds at about 20 kHz. The high frequency sensitivity of strain DBA/2J mice declines rapidly with age, which probably explains their loss of audiogenic seizure susceptibility with age. Mice of strain BALB/cJ were most sensitive to frequencies of about 12 kHz. Their high frequency sensitivity tends to decline with age, but not as rapidly or consistently as in strain DBA/2J. The high incidence of sensory deficits in laboratory mice, and the difficulty of detecting them, can confound the results of behavioral studies on inbred laboratory mouse strains.

TI SEX DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOUR OF HAMSTERS IN OPEN FIELD AND EMERGENCE
   TESTS - EFFECTS OF PRE- AND POST-PUBERTAL GONADECTOMY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The extent to which sex differences in behavior not directly associated with copulatory activity are under the influence of gonadal hormones was studied. The first part is concerned with the standardization of 2 tests of behavior for hamsters (ambulation in the open field and emergence) which show a marked sex difference, and an analysis of some of the causes of variation. Female hamsters ambulate about twice as much as males and emerge from a small box in about half the time. Defecation and grooming in the open field are minimal in both sexes, but females rear up significantly more than males and show other signs of greater exploratory activity. The ambulation score is not affected by the prevailing stage of the estrous cycle. Individuals are consistent in their performance on consecutive test days as well as when re-tested several months later and there is a strong similarity between litter mates. These sex differences are independent of the actual presence of gonadal hormones since post-pubertal gonadectomy (age [plus or minus] 100 days) failed to alter the sex-typical behavior patterns even 5 mo. after the operation. Gonadectomy before the attainment of sexual maturity (age 17 days) did not influence the behavioralscores of females when tested as adults. Males castrated before puberty obtained socres between those of intact males and females. These results suggest that although androgens tend to suppress exploration, there seems to be another factor which pre-diposes morphological males towards the male type of behavior. The behavior of females in these test situations is completely independent of gonadal hormones.

TI A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIGGING MOVEMENTS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO
   AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR IN CICHLIDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Cichlids of the species Pelmatochromis subocellatus kribensis Boul. can alter an eating movement (shifting) into digging movements, in which the fish bites into the substrate. This alteration occurs most frequently when the readiness of the animal to bite other fish (as measured by the number of attacks in a standardised situation) is high, especially when the animal is momentarily prevented from attacking other fish. The readiness to attack fluctuates "spontaneously", so that attacks tend to occur in bouts. Sifting and digging movements often occur during attack bouts. If the fish is going to sift, attacks become less probable. After sifting, the attack frequency rebounds in most cases, the average overshoot being of the same magnitude as the decrease before and during the sifting bout. This not observed during digging, or during attacking itself. During sifting the readiness to attack can still rise, whereas during digging and attacking it does not rise. The readiness to attack can be lowered by releasing very many attacks in a fixed time interval. Therefore one should expect that infrequent attacking can at least cancel a spontaneous rise in attack readiness. This expectation is supported by the above observations which show that biting the substrate in the form of digging has the same effect as biting other fish.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The daily activity of the quokka under natural conditions is influenced both by climatic conditions and by light from the sun and moon. The basic bimodal activity cycle is tied primarily to the solar rhythm with the greatest activity occurring just after sunset and just before dawn. The cycle is modified by the distance from shelter, the time of year and the effect of moonlight at dawn. During the dry part of the year, high activity is generally associated with falling barometric pressure which directs a flow of warm, dry, easterly air over the study area. During the wetter part of the year, high activity is often associated with heavy rainfall; however, the animals appear to prefer non-rainy nights and hence are more active under clearing conditions with rising barometric pressure and cooler temperatures.

TI VOCALIZATION IN CHICKS + CONCEPT OF STIMULUS CONTRAST
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Stimuli which provoke alert responses (i.e. stimuli possessing "contrast") also produce vocalization in the domestic chick. Sudden contrast with background stimulation produces twitters. Stimuli which are intrinsically inconspicuous evoke twitters when they become conditioned stimuli for feeding (or drinking). The longer the preceding deprivation, the greater the rate of calling. Persistent and relatively intense contrast, such as results from cold, is needed to evoke the more intense peep calls. The association between twitters and approach to the stimulus source, and between peeps and avoidance, can be explained by assuming that approach may be elicited by moderate contrast, and avoidance by intense contrast. Certain other groups of responses (e.g. protective responses, some autonomic responses) may also be primarily evoked by stimulus contrast.

AB 221 rats of 5 different inbred strains were measured in respect of their brain cholinesterase values, body-build indexes and defecation and ambulation scores in the openfield test of emotionality. Significant strain differences were detected in true brain cholinesterase (the pseudo-fraction being shown to be dependent upon age), body build and both behavioral scores. Sex differences in the last 3 were also detected. Intercorrelation showed little relationship between true cholinesterase and other measures, though body build correlated with both defecation and ambulation in a complex way apparently dependent upon sex. The negative correlation between defecation and ambulation was confirmed.

TI STUDIES IN DOMINANCE-SUBORDINATION RELATIONSHIP IN GROUP OF
   SEMI-DOMESTIC REINDEER ( RANGIFER TARANDUS L )
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Dominance-subordination relationship in semi-domestic reindeer was studied in a group of 16 animals. They were enclosed and for identification they were marked with figures. Observations were made during 3 periods in autumn and winter of 1962-63, and studies were also made in free-ranging reindeer. The purpose of the studies was to observe whether the rank order was changed with season, after the shedding of antlers and with other changes in the reindeer and in their environment. During the rutting season the mature bulls were at the top of the dominant list. Within each sex group, age seemed to be an important factor for the rank order, while size and strength were more important between the sex groups. During this time the mature cows were very aggressive to the young bulls. In winter time the reindeer exchanged their feeding craters after a pattern that corresponded to the dominance order in the herd. The mature cows were relatively high-ranked during this time and the calves shared the status of their mothers only when mother and calf were grazing in the same crater. The unantlered bulls were then rather low-ranked, while the bullock in the group remained on a high level in the ranking list. A test was made to discover the influence of antlers upon the hierarchy. Antlers were cut from some animals of the highest status and a drop in the hierarchy after this change was observed. The discontinuity in the ranking lists is discussed as well as some aspects of the biological significance of antlers in reindeer.

Two responses indices were recorded the time taken for an animal to reach for a food reward placed close to the test object, and emotional behavior displayed by the animal. Wild-reared monkeys showed intense avoidance responses to the live snake; moderately intense avoidance responses to all the snake models; mild avoidance responses to the sinuous tubing; and practically no avoidance responses to the straight tubing, woodblock and food. Lab-reared monkeys showed mild avoidance responses to the live snake and practically no avoidance responses to the other objects. It is concluded that these observations supplement the accumulating evidence that early experience contributes importantly to the development of species characteristic behavior patterns in the rhesus monkey.

TI SAND DIGGING CONTINGENT UPON BAR PRESSING IN DEERMICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii, P. m. gracilis, P. leucopus, and P. floridanus were tested for the quantity of sand they could dig in 24 hours. P. m. gracilis dug less than other species, which did not differ. P. leucopus learned a position discrimination for sand reinforcement in 12 days, but not a position reversal. Habitat selection and utilization may depend upon the non-ingestive reinforcing properties of the environment, which enables the phenotypic expression of the genotype.

AB Animal behaviour is commonly modelled by fitness-based optimization or individual-based simulation. Each has limitations: the premises for fitness-maximizing modelling are violated in most ecological and sociobiological settings while individual-based modelling generally does not include an evolutionary approach to behaviour. We propose a new approach focusing on the bodily mechanisms that vertebrates (and some other animals) use when making behavioural decisions. Our hypothesis is that decision making in vertebrates is a two-step process where emotion (a cognitive mechanism that for a while may become a state controlling the body and driving behaviour) is the common currency: (1) determining through competition among emotions the organism's current priority and (2) choosing the behaviour that maximizes imagined near-future emotional wellbeing, aided by episodic-like memory. Animals with subjective experience use awareness of their strongest emotional need to concentrate attention, which is a higher level of agency than the unconscious robustness mechanisms in all life forms. Furthermore, animals with imagination-based prediction maximize emotional wellbeing in their decision making. That is, evolution started out without a goal, but from it, animals that live for short-term wellbeing emerged. We show that wellbeing and other mechanisms of organismal robustness can be used in a new class of models that is broadly applicable to animals in natural and artificial settings. This modelling approach can make novel predictions about the links between wellbeing, behaviour and function. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

AB The social intelligence hypothesis suggests that cognitive capacities evolved because of selection pressures related to increasing social complexity. For instance, social animals may need to monitor the relationships of others and intervene in them if that is ultimately beneficial to themselves. Traditionally, such third-party interactions are studied by examining coalitionary support during conflicts. However, growing evidence shows that some animals also intervene in others' positive social interactions. To aid our understanding of the patterns of such interventions in the wild, we examined third-party interventions in both positive and negative interactions in a population of individually marked wild ravens. Although we found that interventions in negative interactions were more frequently observed than those in positive interactions in this wild population, both were relatively common and, in fact, occurred in almost exact proportions relative to the number of such interactions (similar to 10% of ad libitum interactions in both cases). Interventions were mostly active (compared to mere approaches) and aggressive. However, the mode of intervention varied across interactions. In positive interactions, interventions were mostly impartial, whereas in negative interactions, interventions were not, targeting one of the two partners. Neutral or policing interventions in negative interactions were rare. More than half of negative interventions reflected coalitionary support for the aggressor and a quarter for the victim. Furthermore, the likelihood of initiating an intervention and being the target of an intervention varied according to age, sex, rank, residency status and affiliation index. Taken together, our results provide a complete overview of third-party interventions in wild ravens and suggest that ravens use these interventions selectively and potentially even strategically. Future comparative studies may allow investigations into whether the necessity of such social strategies may have been a selection pressure regarding intelligence in animals. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB In many taxa, young can recognize their parents using olfactory cues. Yet this possibility has been overlooked in birds, because they were long assumed to have a poor sense of smell. While evidence is growing that birds use odours to communicate, olfactory parent recognition has only been documented in two altricial bird species. Whether chicks of precocial species use olfaction to recognize parents is currently unknown. Parent recognition is particularly important in precocial species, as chicks leave the nest shortly after hatching, and may lose contact with their parents and encounter other conspecific adults. We conducted Y-maze trials in the wild to test whether chicks of a precocial shorebird, the whitefronted plover, Anarhynchus marginatus, can recognize parents via olfaction. We tested first whether chicks show a preference for the odour (preen oil) of an unfamiliar adult over a control (no odour), and second whether chicks show a preference for the odour of a parent over that of an unfamiliar adult. Plover chicks spent as much time with the odour of an unfamiliar adult as with the control, and as much time with the odour of a parent as with that of an unfamiliar adult. Therefore, we found no evidence that chicks react to the preen oil odour of a conspecific adult, nor that they can discriminate a parent using preen oil odours. It may be that chicks of this species can discriminate parental and foreign odours but that our experiment failed to detect it, that they rely on other (e.g. auditory) cues, or that they do not need to discriminate between parents and foreign conspecific adults.

AB Predation is a powerful driving force leading to the evolution of antipredator defences in prey. The effectiveness of the antipredator defences can depend on various ecological contexts such as predator density and the development stages of the prey species. Males and females often exhibit remarkably different morphologies, behaviours and life histories, and the sexual differences are expected to generate different ecological contexts for males and females, potentially driving the evolution of sex-specific antipredator defences. In the horned beetle Gnatocerus cornutus, males have enlarged mandibles, but females lack this exaggeration. As potential defences against predators, these beetles either become immobile or run away. In this study, we established populations subjected to sex-specific predation. We found that male locomotion was increased in populations subjected to male-specific predation and that female immobility was increased in populations subjected to female-specific predation. We also found that males appeared on the surface of food resources more frequently than females. Given such differences in microhabitat preferences, the males are more likely to be detected by predators than the females. The sexual differences in morphology and microhabitat preferences may generate different predatory environments for males and females, resulting in males using locomotion to escape from predators and females using immobility to hide from them. In this laboratory selection experiment, we did not observe the evolution of the opposite sex's antipredator traits in response to sex-specific predation. We detected no intersexual genetic correlation of immobility and locomotion. The genetic decoupling and different predatory contexts for the two sexes may promote sexually different antipredator defences in G. cornutus.

AB Through the effort required to construct them, the microenvironmental conditions they impose on the family and their indirect influence on posthatching care, nests play a key role in influencing family life. We combined experimental evolution with cross-fostering experiments on laboratory populations of Nicrophorus vespilloides to investigate three ways in which the nest can contribute more broadly to parental investment. We used replicate populations of N. vespilloides that had evolved for 42 generations under contrasting regimes of care. Populations were either able to supply posthatching care ( 'Full Care ') or prevented from supplying any posthatching care ( 'No Care '). Research on these populations has previously shown that the No Care populations evolved to build rounder nests, more rapidly, by Generation 14. Here we found (1) larvae raised by Full Care parents on nests prepared by parents from the No Care population did not attain a higher mass by the end of larval development than larvae in other treatments. However, we did discover that (2) cross-fostering nests between families consistently reduced larval mass, and to a similar extent whether nests were cross-fostered between or within the populations. We suggest that cross-fostering disrupted the chemical environment on and around the nest since we found no evidence that (3) nests mediate interactions between males and females. The duration of paternal care was consistently shorter than the duration of maternal care, and even shorter for males from the No Care populations than males from the Full Care populations. Nevertheless, the duration of male care did not predict variation in duration of female care. In short, although the nest is the substrate for burying beetle family life, we found little evidence that it had evolved divergently in our experimental populations to influence parental investment.

AB Chorusing animals constantly face the challenge of overcoming background noises. To minimize the masking of their own calls by conspecific or heterospecific calls, plasticity in call timing serves as an alternative tactic for chorusing animals. We examined how male rhacophorid treefrogs, Zhangixalus prasinatus, adjust their call timing in response to various noisy environments. When exposed to periodic white noise disturbances with brief silent intervals, the frogs accurately avoided overlapping with the noise and delivered their calls in the silent gaps. Moreover, they delivered long calls earlier than short calls during the silent periods to accommodate the longer duration within a brief silent gap. When exposed to noises of varying frequencies, the frogs specifically avoided medium-frequency noise, which closely matched their own call frequency. This phenomenon was also observed in experiments testing the aggregating behaviour of male frogs; they ceased to aggregate towards conspecific calls when interfered with by medium-frequency noise, whereas high-frequency and low-frequency noise interferences did not elicit the same behaviour. Compared to high-quality males, frogs with low SMi i (scaled mass index) exhibited greater plasticity in call timing, indicating a condition-dependent tactic for energy allocation. Such behavioural plasticity in call timing was reflected in natural soundscape recordings. Our recordings revealed that, as a result of these adaptive strategies, males tended to avoid overlapping their calls with background noises in their natural habitats. Our research provides evidence that call plasticity is an effective strategy for chorusing animals to respond to noise at both individual and population levels. Furthermore, our study suggests that plasticity in call timing is a complex decision-making behaviour involving the consideration of noise properties and an individual's body condition.

AB Current environmental changes can drastically affect aquatic freshwater ecosystems. Salinization is one such change that affects freshwater species due to osmotic costs, which induce a wide variety of behavioural responses, including altered response to predation. This is particularly important in larval anurans, known to modulate their morphology, physiology and behaviour in response to salinity. Although these responses are known for long-term exposure, the effects of shorter exposure to salinity, relevant for coastal biodiversity as a result of sea water intrusions and precipitation variation, have rarely been assessed despite their importance in understanding the speed at which impacts on biodiversity occur. In this study, we experimentally acclimated larvae of the spined toad, Bufo spinosus, for 2 weeks to freshwater or to moderate levels of salinity (4 g/litre). The response to predation, activity and spatial movements of each individual were then assessed both at the salinity of acclimation and after a change in salinity. We demonstrated that medium -term exposure to salinity decreased activity, decreased growth and increased mortality. In contrast, sudden changes in salinity increased the escape distance of tadpoles in response to a predation stimulus but decreased activity. These results suggest that exposure to both stressors (predation cues and varying salinities) led to increased activity presumably linked to a stress response. However, individuals exposed to a change in salinity or to moderate salinity for medium durations expressed similar behavioural responses, indicating that the detrimental effects of high salinity can occur rapidly. Future studies should investigate the dynamics of osmolality in larval anurans exposed to brackish water to assess whether these behavioural shifts are linked with hydromineral dysregulation, and how long after exposure this occurs.

AB Nest building is an important subsistence behaviour that young great apes must learn to become competent adults. Orang-utans show a remarkable degree of variability and selectivity for a broad range of features in their nest building. However, the details of when different aspects of nest-building skills emerge remain unclear. We used data on 27 immature Sumatran orang-utans and 20 mothers collected over a decade at Suaq Balimbing, Sumatra to investigate when immatures develop their nest-building skills and examine when nest tree species preferences emerge. We found that young orang-utans showed interest in nest building from 6 months of age and begin to construct day nests at around 1 year of age, whereas night nests were not practised until close to the third year of life. Nest-building practice peaked around age 3-4 years and then steadily decreased as immatures approached the age of nutritional independence, around age 8 years. By then, immature orang-utans were competent nest-builders, but their nests differed from adult nests in several aspects, such as fewer multitree nests and additional comfort elements, which seemed to be mastered later in development. All age classes demonstrated stronger selectivity towards tree species used for night nests and immatures eventually had similar preferences to mothers. We conclude that the ontogeny of nest-building behaviour and the selection of nest tree species in Sumatran orang-utans is a multiyear learning process that requires intense practice.

AB As anthropogenic activity encroaches on wild populations, it is imperative to understand how behaviours may be altered, given that behavioural changes could affect individual survival through adulthood. While there is growing evidence of how human activity affects primate energy budgets and social behaviours, how it affects play behaviour is unknown. Given that play has connections to adult fitness and skill acquisition, understanding how anthropogenic change alters these behaviours can provide insight into primate survival. We investigated the effects of human -derived food and conflict on play behaviour in six groups of green monkeys, Chlorocebus sabaeus , on the island of Barbados. We designed a scale to gauge the intensity of all play behaviours we observed while also recording all occurrences of human -derived food and conflict. Further analyses were conducted at one site over 2 years to assess whether the return of tourists after the height of the Covid-19 pandemic influenced play. Higher levels of human -derived food in green monkeys were generally associated with lower play intensity, suggesting that supplemental food may counter the need to build extensive foraging and exploratory skills compared to monkeys in lowprovisioned environments. Postpandemic increases in human conflict were also associated with decreases in play intensity, suggesting a reallocation of energy away from play and towards navigating human interactions. These findings illustrate that food availability may not always be the best predictor of play in primate groups and emphasize the need to avoid generalizations. Future studies of play should consider the types and intensity of human -animal interactions and other environmental stressors. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In highly organized animal societies, behavioural heterogeneity of the members can be crucial for group success. In contrast to eusocial insects, in which task specialization is common, a clear division of labour is often absent in cooperatively breeding species. In these species, contributions to different tasks are sometimes positively correlated across individuals; this phenomenon is called helping syndrome. Previously, eusocial naked mole-rats, Heterocephalus glaber, were thought to display a helping syndrome consisting of burrowing, food carrying and nest building. However, previous studies combined different burrowing tasks in which the locomotive patterns varied widely, possibly missing substantial variation in the behavioural types of individuals. Therefore, it is necessary to reexamine the relations between task contributions among naked mole-rats in more detail. This study analysed six types of activities including four tasks in captive naked mole-rats, and partially confirmed the presence of a helping syndrome in nonbreeding individuals. Frequencies of different activities were significantly positively correlated across individuals in some combinations, but were not significantly correlated in other combinations. Also, individual behavioural types did not simply depend on activity time. Although age- or size-based polyethisms were found in different trends across task types, the results of the correlations between tasks remained mostly unchanged after controlling for the effects of age or body mass. This suggests large interindividual variation that could not be sufficiently explained by age- or size-based polyethisms. The partial support of a helping syndrome suggested that the task allocation system among these eusocial mammals may be more complex than previously assumed.

AB Evolution towards complex forms of sociality is dependent on overcoming conflicts of interest between prospective social partners. Competition for limited resources is a key aspect of such conflicts. Behaviour that results in conflict resolution without termination of the social relationship is thus predicted to be more prevalent in more social species. We here tested this hypothesis by staging contests between conspecifics over a crucial resource, using three lamprologine cichlid species that differ in their sociality. The cooperatively breeding species (Neolamprologus pulcher) indeed demonstrated improved conflict resolution, showing more egalitarian sharing of the resource and establishing mutually tolerant relationships more often compared to the pair-bonded species (Variabilichormis moorii) and the mostly solitary species (Lepidiolamprologus elongatus). We suggest that this is the result of behavioural differences between these cichlids: N. pulcher already showed more de-escalating behaviour during the earliest stages of the contests and increased rates of de-escalating behaviours more in response to heightened levels of aggression. Our results thus provide comparative support for the notion that socially competent behaviour, resolving conflicts while maintaining social relations, is a key behavioural aspect of evolutionary transitions to complex societies.

AB Evidence is accumulating that foraging behaviour and diet link to personality traits, yet little is known about how these associations emerge during development. Behaviour is expected to become more consistent with age and with foraging experience. We compared exploratory behaviour and diet variances of juvenile and adult red knots, Calidris canutus islandica, shortly after migration to marine intertidal mudflats from terrestrial tundra breeding grounds. By identifying the timing of the switch from terrestrial to marine isotopic signatures, we were also able to ask whether juveniles that arrived earlier, and thus had longer experiences in a particular environment (nonbreeding grounds), were more consistent in exploration behaviour. We found that juveniles had a more diverse diet and were less repeatable in their exploratory behaviour than adults. This change in repeatability was largely driven by greater within-individual behavioural variance in the juveniles compared to the adults. The amount of time juveniles experienced in a marine environment did not affect the variation in their exploratory behaviour, suggesting that consistency in exploration was developed over a longer period than the 4 weeks of our study. Our findings suggest that after initial exploration of a novel habitat, juveniles likely try out foraging techniques which later develop into consistent behaviours that differ between individuals. This study illuminates how personality can develop with experience in a free-living animal. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB In cooperatively breeding species, sexually mature individuals may delay natal dispersal and become subordinates, helping a dominant pair raise offspring. To understand how cooperative breeding evolved, it is important to determine the mechanisms leading to delayed dispersal. Adult sex ratio (ASR) variation may affect dispersal by limiting breeding vacancies available to the more abundant sex, and cooperative breeders often have a more biased ASR than noncooperative breeders. However, no studies of cooperative breeders have related ASR at both the local and population level with dispersal. Using the long-term Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis, data set, we tested the influence of population-wide and local ASR, and density, on natal dispersal of yearlings. Our ASR - density hypothesis predicts that the probability of natal dispersal is lower when the ASR is biased towards the sex of the focal individual, but only when the population density is high. Dispersal was associated with population density and population-wide ASR in males, but not in females; males were more likely to delay dispersal when ASR was male biased and density was high. Our findings illustrate a complex association between demographic factors and cooperative breeding and suggest that individuals alter their dispersal behaviour in response to the demographic composition of the population.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB It is well known that several nonhuman animal species can show negative emotional responses after receiving unfavourable outcomes (i.e. disappointment-like emotions). Previous research, carried out in neurophysiological laboratories, indicates that, when making decisions, nonhuman animals may also experience regret-like emotions (i.e. negative emotional responses arising when comparing the outcome of a chosen option with the outcome they could have obtained if they had chosen differently). However, little is known about whether nonhuman animals housed in less constrained conditions than the typical neurophysiological laboratory also show regret-like emotions, as well as whether and how these emotions influence subsequent choices. Here we assessed whether tufted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus spp., showed behavioural responses compatible with disappointment- and regret-like emotions in a risky decision-making task and whether these responses were related to their subsequent choices. Twelve capuchins were repeatedly offered a choice between a safe option (corresponding to four food units) and a risky option (corresponding to either one or seven food units) with different probabilities of receiving the larger pay-out. We measured scratching behaviour, as well as capuchins' attempts to change their choice (switching behaviour), after the outcome of the chosen option and of the forgone option were revealed. We found that capuchins flexibly chose according to the probability of receiving the larger payout and attempted to modify their initial choice more often after receiving an unfavourable rather than a positive outcome (disappointment-like behaviour) and after seeing that the outcome of the forgone option was better than the outcome of the chosen option (regret-like behaviour). Moreover, males showed more attempts to modify their initial choice than females and capuchins increased their preference for the risky options after showing both disappointment- and regret-like behaviours. These results indicate that capuchins, as other species, show disappointment-like behaviour for receiving a bad outcome and demonstrates, for the first time in a zoo population, the occurrence of regret-like behaviour for not having chosen differently.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Acoustic communication is prevalent throughout the animal kingdom, from insects and fish to birds and mammals and has been strongly conserved over evolutionary time. It is influenced by environmental variables, such as light, through direct and indirect mechanisms. Whereas visual perception depends on light for the majority of species, acoustic communication does not, yet nocturnal vocalizations can be affected by natural light at night from the moon. Subtle changes in illumination across the lunar cycle promote population and community level changes in acoustic communication. These are often driven by intra-and interspecific factors, such as social interactions, foraging and predation pressures. We have some understanding of how moonlight affects acoustic communication across a limited number of species. However, given the recent worldwide spread of artificial light at night (ALAN), the lack of knowledge of broader baseline effects of natural light at night is critical to understanding the effect of ALAN on communication behaviours. ALAN has rapidly and drastically changed the night-time light environment resulting in shifts in the timing, duration, rate and structure of acoustic communication. Inconsistencies in research methods and lack of diversity in taxa studied make results hard to compare and generalizations challenging. Further, aspects of light beyond its presence or absence, such as its intensity, colour and scale, have seldom been examined. Here, we review the current evidence for the relationship between acoustic communication and light at night, both natural and artificial. We highlight gaps in our understanding and potential methodological oversights and suggest directions for future research.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Disputes over resources are initially resolved by signals, which reveal the resource-holding potential (RHP) of the contestants. Contests in social animals can simultaneously involve numerous individuals, raising the question of what determines group RHP. We employed a series of novel field experiments to investigate the outcome of individual and group contests over food resources between neighbouring colonies of meat ants, Iridomyrmex purpureus. Body size, a taxonomically widespread proxy of fighting ability, did not influence the outcome of individual contests. The outcome of colony level contests was instead determined by colony size, with the numerically larger colony usually gaining exclusive access to the food, but neither colony obtaining exclusive access if matched in colony size. These results help explain why numerous workers are deployed to display grounds, where they apparently signal colony size and thus group RHP to their neighbour.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The spatiotemporal behaviour of animals may be determined by interactions with competitors, predators and humans. Nonconsumptive effects, or risk effects of predation, whereby predators induce behaviour changes in prey through their perceived risk, are increasingly seen as important determinants of prey behaviour and spatiotemporal landscape use, which may scale to have population and ecosystem level consequences. Similarly, human disturbance, even that from recreational activity, may result in behav-ioural changes analogous to the risk effects of predation. As landscapes steadily urbanize, these effects are likely to become common and understanding behavioural responses to human activity may be a crucial component of conservation and management of species in the Anthropocene. We propose using time-to-event analysis based on remote camera images as a behavioural indicator to compare the in-fluence of competitors, predators and humans on the length of time between successive deer events (i.e. deer return times), by season, as a case study. We found that the mere presence of humans was the most important determinant of deer return times in spring and autumn, whereas in summer, competitor (i.e. moose and elk) presence was most important. In winter, a combination of human presence and the number of predators (i.e. canids) was the strongest determinant of deer return times. We suggest human recreation is a major driver of fine-scale, spatiotemporal behavioural responses of deer and that using time-to-event analyses provides a novel framework to identify these behavioural responses. Under-standing an animal's behavioural response to humans, competitors and predators has important im-plications for conservation areas and multiuse landscapes in urbanizing landscapes.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sex allocation theory predicts that species with reversed sexual size dimorphism frequently overproduce the cheapest sex at the brood level. A sex ratio deviation from parity is frequently documented among the offspring of raptors and is largely produced by sex-biased survival or parental adjustment as a response to environmental variability or demographic conditions. The Eleonora's falcon is a long-distance migrant wintering in Madagascar and southeast Africa and breeding colonially primarily in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands. It feeds on migratory passerines and thus depends greatly on the autumn migration flow and the prevailing winds. Being sexually size dimorphic (i.e. females are larger than males) and depending greatly on the migration, the species is a good case for investigating whether brood sex ratio variation is adaptive. In the present study, we examined the proportion of males and females reared during 2009-2020 in a falcon colony in southeast Crete (Greece) in relation to specific ecological and biological attributes. Female nestlings were shown to be costlier to produce as they are heavier than males. Overall, an unbiased sex ratio was observed across the years, although a consistent trend was recorded towards females early in the breeding season and first-hatched chicks and males late in the breeding season and third-hatched chicks. Our results provide strong evidence that parental condition, habitat quality and a brood reduction effect were the significant drivers for the observed sex ratio patterns. The overproduction of the costlier sex and a high survival of the cheaper one during food-rich years should be regarded as an adaptive evolutionary strategy of the species for maximizing its fitness returns per clutch and for maintaining a balanced offspring sex ratio in the population.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While many animals utilize socially transmitted information, there is still much to understand about how individuals form social networks and how these networks influence social information use. Here, we tested the hypothesis that food distribution and availability can influence social structure and social information transfer when discovering novel food sources. We experimentally manipulated distribution and access to food in wild food-caching mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, by randomly dividing existing individuals between two feeding locations, with birds only allowed to obtain food at one of the two locations. We carried out such manipulations at multiple sites associated with two montane elevations of different environmental harshness, where birds show differing use of social information. Following 2 weeks of manipulation, we measured social networks and then introduced novel feeders to test how the manipulation affected social information use. The manipulations effectively split the resident chickadees at both elevations into two distinct communities, and when subsequently discovering novel feeders, information transmission about novel food sources followed the new, rather than the premanipulation, network structure at both elevations, although low-elevation birds used social information more than high-elevation birds. Our data show that chickadees can quickly adjust their social associations in response to short-term changes in the distribution of available resources and that these changes influence who they learn from socially when searching for food. Overall, we observed that chickadees are highly flexible in their use of social information despite their rather stable social group structure and that this information use reflects the most current social environment that individuals experience.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Intraspecific variation in personality traits is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of invasion success and is associated with the dispersal ability of several invasive species. However, pre-vious studies have focused on the dispersal of invasive species through continuous habitats, despite the high levels of anthropogenic fragmentation in modern environments. This study investigated how personality influences the behaviour of aquatic invasive species at an anthropogenic barrier to dispersal, using the passage behaviour of American signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, at an experimental Crump weir as a model system. Personality was characterized by determining the repeatability of boldness, activity and sociability, with correlations between traits indicating behavioural syndromes, while passage behaviour was quantified as motivation and subsequent ability to pass the weir. Boldness and activity were repeatable and positively correlated, indicating a boldness-activity syndrome. How-ever, sociability was not repeatable and was therefore not classified as a personality trait, potentially as a result of the confounding effects of social hierarchy formation. Bolder individuals tended to be more motivated to pass the weir, although motivation was not related to activity. Few individuals passed the weir, and personality was not related to passage success. This study evidences the presence of behav-ioural syndromes in signal crayfish and demonstrates that personality can influence the motivation of invasive species to expand their range in a fragmented habitat. Although no relationship with passage success was observed, the higher levels of motivation in bold individuals may lead to differential passage success in natural situations where the time to attempt passage is not constrained by experimental conditions.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Securing females is a crucial determinant of male fitness in many species. Mate-searching efficiency is often associated with increased mobility in males, but an increased investment in movement may reduce other fitness traits via potential trade-offs. In precopulatory sexual selection via female mate choice, the rate of encounter with females and the attractiveness of males are essential to increase male mating success. If there is a trade-off between mobility and attractiveness in males, males with higher mobility may show lower attractiveness. We here assessed whether artificial selection of mobility affected male attractiveness in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. We compared the olfactory attractiveness of males (due to 4,8-dimethyldecanal) between strains having genetically higher mobility or lower mobility. The results indicated that females were significantly more attracted to the odours of lower mobility males. Therefore, our results suggested that a genetic trade-off might have occurred between mobility and attractiveness in males. This cost-benefit balance may lead to the maintenance of indi-vidual differences in mobility within a population.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Learning is a process that allows animals to develop adaptive behavioural responses to novel situations within an individual's lifetime. The simplest form of learning, habituation, acts a fundamental filter mechanism, which allows animals to ignore irrelevant recurring stimuli, thereby freeing up fitnessrelated resources, such as time and energy, as well as neural capacity. Although earlier studies have demonstrated that habituation occurs in a variety of taxa ranging from insects to mammals, our knowledge of this process in elasmobranchs is limited. Sharks and rays face an increasingly popular shark-diving industry, so it is important to understand how sharks respond to attractants used by tourism operators. Our study investigated whether sharks habituate to the smell of a potential food source, which has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to actively feeding sharks. We exposed 11 captive juvenile sharks individually to the smell of squid for 4 min, three times per day for 21 days in the absence of a food reward. We found declining responses to the stimulus within and across daily exposure sessions, indicating both short- and long-term habituation. Our findings suggest that sharks learn to avoid wasting time and energy on inaccessible food sources. Given the decreasing response observed in our study, the use of olfactory cues only may have limitations in its efficacy to attract sharks for tourism purposes. Habituation may act as a driver of optimal foraging strategies, enabling sharks to quickly abandon low-yielding foraging patches in search of more productive sites.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Quantifying variation in individual resource acquisition and allocation to costly life-history functions is critical to understand the evolution of life-histories. Individuals should adaptively respond to changes in resource requirements throughout their lifetime through flexibility in resource acquisition behaviours. Empirical investigation of behavioural adjustments in wild settings are scarce and rarely consider more than one behaviour. Resource acquisition, however, involves several behaviours and should be considered in a multivariate framework. We measured four resources acquisition behaviours -bite rate, rumination rate, chews per bolus and bolus processing time in bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis. We then tested whether individuals adjust these behaviours as expected based on individual differences in resource allocation to lactation and annual mass gain. Using a multivariate mixed effects model, we also evaluated the prediction that bite rate and rumination behaviours are repeatable and show strong covariation among individuals. Both bite rate and rumination effort increased with allocation to lactation. Allocation to mass gain, however, was positively correlated with rumination effort but not with bite rate. Rumination behaviours also showed significant variation with sex and mass, suggesting potential morphological and/or physiological constraints. Although all four behaviours were significantly repeatable, contrary to our predictions, bite rate was not significantly correlated with rumination behaviours among individuals. This study highlights strong correlations between expected resource allocation to costly life-history functions and multiple resource acquisition behaviours. There was, however, no evidence that variance in multiple resource acquisition behaviours originates from a single axis of variation among individuals.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) exist when individuals of one sex (usually males) adopt different strategies to achieve reproductive success. Although it is well known that the males adopting the different tactics often vary in their morphological, physiological and mating-based behavioural traits, what is not well understood is whether variation also exists in their behaviour outside the mating context. Here, we used the round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, a globally prolific invasive species where males exhibit ARTs, to address this knowledge gap. The nonmating behaviour of sneaker and guarder males were compared for differences in boldness, exploration, activity, aggression, sociality and dispersal. We found that sneaker males were more active, explorative and bold, as well as less aggressive compared to guarder males. Additionally, in an exploratory analysis, we found that while many behavioural traits were positively correlated in guarder males, few were correlated in sneaker males, suggesting that sneaker males might be more behaviourally plastic. The results of this study help expand our knowledge of the many ways that alternative reproductive tactics may differ from each other, particularly in nonmating contexts.

AB Territory acquisition and pair compatibility are determining factors for the fitness of territorial animals. Although these aspects are often studied separately, for territorial monogamous species acquiring a territory and obtaining a mate are not mutually exclusive. In this study, we investigated territory acquisition and mate choice characteristics in a saturated population of the Eurasian beaver, Castor fiber, by comparing individuals that successfully acquired territories with ones that were available in the study area (potential competitors). We used body mass and familiarity with an area as proxies for competitive ability, and genetic measures of inbreeding and relatedness, as well as age difference between pair members as proxies for mate compatibility. Comparatively older individuals and ones familiar with an area had a higher probability of territory acquisition, indicating that competitive ability was important for territory acquisition, whereas mate compatibility characteristics generally were not. However, in pairs that had a large age difference (between pair members), annual reproductive success decreased in more inbred pairs. These findings indicate that there might be a trade-off between territory acquisition and pair compatibility in saturated populations, that is, individuals accept being paired with a suboptimal mate when acquiring a territory, owing to intense competition. Our study emphasizes the importance of incorporating both factors related to competitive ability and mate compatibility when investigating territory acquisition in animals.

AB Territorial threat is costly and variable across contexts and behavioural flexibility is favoured to maximize any cost/benefit ratio. This is well illustrated in how animals react to familiar or unfamiliar outgroup members. In some situations, neighbours are better tolerated than strangers, resulting in a 'dear-enemy effect'; in other situations, the pattern is reversed, resulting in a 'nasty-neighbour effect'. Typically, the effects are species-specific traits, although both can also occur within the same species. Here, we investigated wild Diana monkeys of Tai Forest (Ivory Coast) in their reactions to outgroup individuals using playbacks of both familiar and unfamiliar male alarm calls to eagles. We found that groups living in primary forest (high group density, high food availability and low predation pressure) followed a 'nasty neighbour' strategy whereas groups living in secondary forest (low group density, low resources and high predation risk) followed a 'dear enemy' strategy, suggesting that group density, predation pressure and food availability can impact how hostile behaviour is displayed in nonhuman primates. Our results confirm a high behavioural flexibility in primate relationships between conspecifics of different identities depending on ecological traits of the habitat.

AB Size-assortative mating and sexual selection on size are common across species. Since both may be a result of mate choice, mate choice based on size should also be a widespread process. This behaviour is, however, rarely studied directly and thus the biological causes that determine size-based mate choice are poorly understood. To address this, we studied the size-based mate choice in an intertidal snail, Echinolittorina malaccana, that has been used as a model to understand this process. Previous studies, assuming a quantitative Gaussian mating preference function, have inferred that mate choice in this snail is caused by a size similarity mechanism (males prefer to mate with females slightly larger than themselves). To further test and quantify this proposed mechanism, we conducted mate choice experiments with alternative designs (single, male and multiple choice) in the laboratory and compared the results to mate choice data observed in natural populations. This integrated approach allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of mate choice by evaluating alternative mating models that best fitted the observed data of various designs. Results confirmed the similarity-based mechanism but showed deviations at extreme size classes. The single choice design indicated that mate choice was exercised during one-on-one male-female interactions, but the strength of mate choice increased with the presence of additional individuals (males in the male choice design, and both males and females in the multiplechoice design). Multiple-choice experiments are, therefore, the most valuable and useful design to infer how males choose mates in the wild, as they best mimic the natural scenario and the results are the most similar to those observed in natural populations. To elucidate the mechanisms causing this male choice for particular female sizes, the next steps are to identify the genetic basis as well as potential physiological benefits associated with choosing slightly larger females.& nbsp; (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Theoretical models predict that virgin females at risk of not mating should strategically adjust their signalling investment as they age, with older, virgin females investing more to attract males. We explored how adult age influences the 'calling' (pheromone-releasing) behaviour of virgin female gumleaf skeletonizer moths, Uraba lugens, over four consecutive 10 h scotophases (dark periods). Adult virgin females commenced calling shortly after the onset of the scotophase. We found that female investment in calling behaviour changed with age: but in contrast with theoretical predictions and empirical observations in other species, older females were less likely to call and spent less time calling than younger females. Older females, however, commenced calling earlier in the scotophase, suggesting that there may be selection on older females to avoid competition from younger conspecific females. We also examined male olfactory preferences for pheromones from females of different ages. Y-maze assays showed that males preferred the pheromones produced by younger females, and that pheromone quality probably plays a role in this choice. Combined, these results suggest that female U. lugens may adaptively adjust their calling behaviour with age to mitigate against the risk of mating failure through competition with other females. The preference of males for pheromones produced by younger females is consistent with this interpretation. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Given the vulnerability of early life stages to predation, many species elicit antipredator responses to predator-associated cues (e.g. alarm cues, necromones). However, the response used may vary between predatory stimuli. Antipredator responses, while ostensibly enhancing survival, are costly, either resulting in missed opportunities (e.g. foraging) through decreased activity and crypsis strategies (i.e. predator avoidance) or incurring high energetic costs through the use of generalized stress responses and increased activity (i.e. predator evasion). Juvenile Port Jackson sharks, Heterodontus portusjacksoni, were exposed to the scent of dead conspecifics (conspecific necromones) coupled with a simulated predator chase to determine the energetic effects of a predator ?attack?. When exposed to necromone cues alone, juvenile sharks depressed their oxygen uptake rates for up to 3 h following exposure, indicating that they used crypsis to avoid detection by predators. However, when forced to swim and evade a predator, sharks increased their oxygen uptake rates, regardless of whether or not they were exposed to predatory cues. Juvenile sharks exposed to conspecific necromones may primarily rely on strategies that depress activity to avoid detection by predators; however, if forced to evade capture they use energetically costly escape strategies similar to typical ?fight or flight? responses.

AB The sublethal effects of infectious disease on reproductive behaviour and mating success are not well understood. Here, we investigated predictors of male mating success in one of Australia's most critically endangered vertebrates: the northern corroboree frog, Pseudophryne pengilleyi. Using a genomic approach to assign parentage, we explored whether infection with the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen responsible for amphibian declines globally, influenced male calling behaviour and mating success. We also explored whether male mating success was predicted by phenotypic traits (age, body size, coloration, call characters) that potentially signal genetic quality, and the soil moisture (water potential) of male-constructed terrestrial nests, which may directly impact offspring survival. We found that Bd significantly influenced male advertisement; Bd-infected males produced calls with significantly higher pulse repetition rates than uninfected males. Older males had a higher probability of mating; however, variation in the number of eggs in a nest was most strongly explained by an interaction between male Bd infection status and call pulse repetition rate. We propose that these relationships may result from either pathogen-mediated changes to host behaviour or host-mediated changes to behaviour (e.g. terminal investment). Regardless of the mechanism, this is the first evidence that male mating success in an amphibian can be influenced by male Bd infection status, highlighting a novel mechanism through which this virulent pathogen can affect amphibian fitness. More broadly, these findings add to a growing body of evidence that pathogens can alter the reproductive biology of their hosts. From a conservation perspective, increased consideration of how sexual selection operates in altered environments has the potential to assist with the management of threatened amphibians worldwide.

AB Social behaviour is a key component of animal behaviour that facilitates the spread of parasites. Traditionally, group size has been used as a primary metric for quantifying the impact of social behaviour on parasite transmission; however, with the emergence of social network analysis an increasing number of studies are using this more nuanced tool to study links between social behaviour and parasite infection. In this study, we synthesized insights derived from empirical studies on social networks and parasites using a meta-analytical approach. We analysed 210 associations between parasite burden and individual level network metrics extracted from 18 published articles. Overall, we found a positive effect of social behaviour, measured by social network metrics, on parasite infection at the individual level, with no evidence of publication bias. The magnitude of the mean effect size for associations between social network metrics and measures of parasitism was nearly twice as large as that observed for group size in previous meta-analyses. However, there was significant heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies, and this pattern could not be explained by either host traits, parasite traits or the social network metric examined. We discuss potential reasons for this unexplained heterogeneity, such as possible mismatches between focal host social behaviour and focal parasite biology as well as methodological considerations. We also suggest future research directions that can help fill gaps that remain in our understanding of the drivers of variation in interactions between social hosts and parasites.

AB Successful biological invasions are characterized by the spread of a population across a landscape. Range expansion conditions can favour different phenotypes at the leading edges of the range compared to those at the core. Although Cyrtophora citricola is a non-native spider species that was documented in Florida, U.S.A. almost two decades ago, the status of its populations remains unstudied. We report two populations that have spread northward along both eastern and western coasts from a putative common origin. We asked whether the leading edges of these two range expansions are composed of different personality types compared to the original core and whether core-to-edge patterns in personality are consistent between the two replicate populations. More voracious, more exploratory and bolder spiders were predicted to occupy the leading edge, because these personality types are assumed to be associated with dispersive, successful colonizers in novel environments. While leading-edge spiders were indeed faster to respond and attack prey stimuli and active longer in novel environments compared to spiders from the core, the two populations diverged in boldness. On average, western spiders were less bold and exploratory towards newer colonization sites, whereas eastern spiders were bolder at newer sites. The divergence in exploratory behaviour and boldness between these populations highlights the difficulties in generalizing how traits may become assorted across an expanding range and stress the importance of using replicate populations when possible. These results suggest that range level processes can be inconsistent and highlight the importance of investigating how the strength of local adaptation may swamp processes such as spatial sorting.

AB A long developmental period in animals is often needed to learn skills for adult reproduction and survival, including feeding behaviour. The nocturnal Javan slow loris, Nycticebus javanicus, is unusual in that it consumes a specialized diet of difficult to extract resources, as well as disperses up to a year after sexual maturity. Here, we examined the ontogeny of its feeding behaviour to understand whether learning to feed on difficult resources, including by co-feeding, is related to delayed dispersal. We collected feeding and proximity data on developing and adult wild slow lorises at a long-term field site in Cipaganti, West Java from 2012 to 2018. To determine whether acquisition of insects, exudates, nectar and flowers varied by age, we ran logistic generalized additive mixed models. We found that intake of insects and exudates occurred significantly more in the early stages, and feeding on nectar significantly more in the later stages, of development. Co-feeding occurred for all food types, with insects showing the most co-feeding events during early development, and co-feeding on exudates remaining high throughout development. Social learning via co-feeding is a potentially important factor in transmission of dietary information from older individuals, including siblings and parents, to young slow lorises. Differences between immature and adult diets levelled off after sexual maturity and before average dispersal. Together these factors suggest that the period required to learn to forage on difficult items could help explain the delayed dispersal patterns seen in mammals with similar foraging strategies.

AB Rapid colour change is widespread in animals and allows them to respond dynamically to the physical and social environment. However, few studies have examined the information conveyed by dynamic colour signals in different social contexts, such as courtship and rivalry contests. Furthermore, dynamic colour change on different body regions may be subject to different selection pressures and therefore serve different functions. We tested whether male colour or colour change predicts contest outcome in male-male interactions or the likelihood of copulation attempts in male-female interactions in the central bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps. The extent of beard darkening strongly predicted contest outcome, but neither colour (beard, dorsal) nor colour change predicted copulation attempts. Dorsal colour showed little consistent change and did not predict contest outcome or copulation attempts. Previous work shows that dorsal but not beard colour change occurs in response to both background colour and temperature in the laboratory and in the wild. Taken together, these results indicate that dynamic colour change in bearded dragons varies in relation to social context and can serve different functions depending on the body region. Our results add to the growing appreciation of how rapid colour change enables animals to accommodate the multiple functions of colour, including communication to different receivers, camouflage and thermoregulation.

AB Resource value assessment, in which competitors adjust behaviours according to the perceived value of a contested resource, is well described in animal contests. Such assessment is usually assumed to be categorical or linear; for example, males fight more aggressively when females are present than absent, or as female fecundity increases. Here, to our knowledge for the first time, we show quadratic resource value assessment, in which resource value is highest at a certain level and decreases in either direction. The mantis shrimp Neogonodactylus bredini occupies coral rubble burrows in a size-assortative manner: individuals of a certain body size inhabit burrows of a certain size. Using mock burrows of various sizes, we tested whether mantis shrimp (1) chose burrows predicted to be the best fit for their body size and (2) were more aggressive during, endured higher costs during and were more likely to win contests over burrows predicted to be best fit. Individuals chose burrows larger than their predicted best fit burrows. In contests, intruders without burrows were more likely to evict burrow residents when the burrow was slightly smaller than the intruder's predicted best fit size. Intruder success decreased as relative burrow size increased or decreased from this value. Intruders won by delivering more strikes and by being aggressive first. In contrast to intruders, burrow residents showed little evidence of resource value assessment. A literature review revealed that quadratic resource value assessment may play a role in contests over resources from territories to parasite hosts. Therefore, our results impact theoretical models of contest behaviour and may lend insight to how contests affect resource distributions. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Insect societies are challenged by harmful pathogens that originate from waste, such as faeces, food leftovers or corpses. The discarding of waste to outside the nest reduces these sanitary risks and contributes to the social immunity of ant colonies. In this study, we tested whether the nest-cleaning behaviour in Myrmica rubra colonies differed depending on the pathogenicity of waste or the presence of brood as well as over successive exposure to waste. We introduced waste items covered with entomopathogenic Metarhizium brunneum conidia and items without conidia in either broodright or broodless colonies. The greater the pathogenicity of waste, the faster it was discarded by the ants, although this did not prevent higher mortality rates in workers and larvae. When exposed a second time to waste items, ant colonies improved the discarding of nonpathogenic waste but became less efficient at removing infected waste, probably due to morbidity in the workers' population. Most surprisingly, we found that the presence of brood enhanced the hygienic responses of workers, with ant colonies doubling their probability of discarding waste items to outside the nest. Overall, we show that ants can detect entomopathogenic conidia on waste and take steps accordingly to hasten the removal of infected items. Furthermore, we demonstrate the upregulating role of larvae which results in enhanced performance of hygienic tasks and reinforces sanitary control inside the colony.

AB The sensory drive hypothesis states that selection acts on signals to make them more detectable in the habitat conditions in which they occur, resulting in signal divergence for species occupying different habitats. For colour signals, visibility depends on the luminance contrast and the chromatic contrast between the signal and the viewing background. Sensory drive has been tested in studies of the colourful dewlaps of anolines occupying different habitats. These studies found that red or orange dewlaps were more visible than yellow or white dewlaps across all habitat types, counter to the predictions of sensory drive that a species' signal should be more visible in its own habitat than in habitats of other species. However, in these, and other sensory drive studies, chromatic contrast was calculated with a visual perception model that assumed that total light intensity has little or no effect on chromatic contrast perception. We carried out behavioural experiments testing the probability of detection of green, yellow and red stimuli presented against luminance-matched green backgrounds, at low and high light intensity typical of shaded and unshaded habitats. We found that the red stimulus was most detectable in the high light condition, while in low light, yellow and red stimuli were equally detectable. We modelled the stimuli with a receptor noise model that takes total light intensity into account. The model predictions were consistent with the behaviour results. We conclude that there is an important interaction between total light intensity and chromatic contrast in determining the visibility of colour signals, which should be taken into account in visual ecology studies. For animals with small eyes, shade level, which strongly influences total light intensity, may be as important as, or more important than habitat spectral quality in the evolution of signal colour diversity through sensory drive.

   REPRODUCTION; PERFORMANCE; EVOLUTION
AB Acclimation conditions may affect the fighting ability of individuals involved in agonistic contests through their oxidative status. For instance, exposure to high temperatures might increase the metabolic rate of opponents and their production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Animals investing more strongly in antioxidant defences to minimize the damaging action of heat-induced ROS may therefore be deprived of antioxidant defences and hence less able to sustain fight effort during subsequent contests. Here, we examined the interplay between acclimation temperature, oxidative status and fight outcome in male field crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus. Relative to nonfighting males, males involved in agonistic contests staged at 27 degrees C showed lower antioxidant defences when acclimated to cool conditions (19 degrees C) and higher oxidative damage when acclimated to higher temperatures (27 and 35 degrees C). This shows that fights represent an oxidative challenge, which is differently regulated depending on acclimation temperature. Furthermore, males with higher antioxidant capacity were more likely to win contests. Antioxidant defences therefore appear to contribute to the resource-holding potential of opponents, presumably because they reflect their ability to sustain the physical effort associated with fighting. Moreover, antioxidant defences may be used by opponents to assess their relative fighting ability to terminate contests before related costs become too high. However, antioxidant asymmetry reflected fight outcome only when both opponents were previously acclimated to the same thermal conditions. In contrast, when opponents were acclimated to different temperatures, males from the higher temperature were more likely to win these fights. This suggests that the effects of thermal conditions on fight outcome are independent of and preponderant over the effects of antioxidant defences. Antioxidant defences may still be an important determinant of fight outcome in the wild when opponents, occupying homogeneous habitats, are exposed to comparable conditions before fighting.

We documented structural changes on both inquiry and response calls during ontogeny by recording single individual vocalizations in a flight cage and triggering response calls with playbacks of adult inquiry calls. Most ontogenetic changes in response calls were sex dependent. In addition, individuality was high for both call types across age categories. Despite the observed changes during development, both call types resembled the structure of adult calls from early ontogenetic stages, suggesting little influence of social learning in call development. Finally, we found sex dependent ontogenetic changes and high levels of individuality of calls early in life, which may indicate additional functionality in sex and pup recognition. Overall, the findings bring novel insight into the complex developmental process of the call types comprising the communication systems of Spix's disc-winged bats, and contribute to a better understanding of signal development in complex social communication systems.

AB To characterize the early ontogeny of dog cognition, we tested 168 domestic dog, Canis familiaris, puppies (97 females, 71 males; mean age = 9.2 weeks) in a novel test battery based on previous tasks developed and employed with adolescent and adult dogs. Our sample consisted of Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers and Labrador x golden retriever crosses from 65 different litters at Canine Companions for Independence, an organization that breeds, trains and places assistance dogs for people with disabilities. Puppies participated in a 3-day cognitive battery that consisted of 14 tasks measuring different cognitive abilities and temperament traits such as executive function (e.g. inhibitory control, reversal learning, working memory), use of social cues, sensory discriminations and reactivity to and recovery from novel situations. At 8-10 weeks of age, and despite minimal experience with humans, puppies reliably used a variety of cooperative-communicative gestures from humans. Puppies accurately remembered the location of hidden food for delays of up to 20 s, and succeeded in a variety of visual, olfactory and auditory discrimination problems. They also showed some skill at executive function tasks requiring inhibitory control and reversal learning, although they scored lower on these tasks than is typical in adulthood. Taken together, our results confirm the early emergence of sensitivity to human communication in dogs and contextualize these skills within a broad array of other cognitive abilities measured at the same stage of ontogeny.

AB In group-living species, particularly cooperative breeders, all group members contribute to various behaviours but there is considerable variation between and within individuals in their contributions. While it is well established that there is variation due to differences in the costs and benefits for individuals of different sex, age and dominance status, shorter-term social, internal and environmental factors are also likely to be important. Sentinel behaviour, where individuals adopt a raised position to scan for danger while groupmates forage, offers an opportunity to test hypotheses about context-dependent differences in contributions to group behaviour. Here we used field experiments to manipulate the conspecific audience, satiation state and perceived danger level of dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, to investigate how sentinel contributions are modulated by individual context. In addition to standard measures of sentinel behaviour (likelihood of becoming a sentinel, number of bouts, bout duration), we considered within-bout behaviour in terms of surveillance calls and attentiveness (head-scanning rate and distraction levels). We found that the presence of a neighbouring forager (audience) decreased sentinel contributions, while individuals increased their sentinel investment when satiated and experiencing an increased danger level. Changes in head-scanning rate provided evidence for an interaction between the effect of satiation and danger levels, demonstrating that sentinel attentiveness was influenced by changes in context. Our results demonstrate that sentinel behaviour is strongly context dependent, with effects seen in initial bout and bout quantity decisions, as well as within-bout characteristics, and that individual contributions to group behaviours can vary depending on social, internal and environmental factors.

AB In 1948, British geneticist A. J. Bateman published in the journal Heredity the results of his experiments on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Bateman hoped he was bringing evidence for the 'greater dependence of males for their fertility on frequency of insemination' (Bateman, 1948, Heredity, 2(3), p. 364), thus purportedly explaining `an undiscriminating eagerness in the males and a discriminating passivity in the females' (p. 365). At first rather neglected, Bateman's results were increasingly cited in the 1970s, especially as Bateman had suggested that what he had discovered in Drosophila could also be applied to humans. However, throughout the years, criticisms of the paper accumulated to the point that biologists are now divided into two groups: those who praise Bateman as one of the founding fathers of the discipline of behavioural ecology, and those who claim his paper was fatally flawed. The present paper follows the 'strange fate' of Bateman's article: initially barely cited, the paper was 'rediscovered' by Robert Trivers in 1972 (Trivers, 1972, Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. G. Campbell (Ed.), Sexual selection and the descent of man: The Darwinian pivot, pp. 136-179, New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers) and finally, the paper received numerous scathing critiques in more recent years, on a methodological and empirical basis.

AB Many animals have colour patterns that appear to change dynamically when the animal moves. Experiments have suggested that such colour patterns, termed 'dynamic flash' coloration, can reduce predatory attacks by misrepresenting the prey's location. However, the conditions that make this coloration effective are not known. We here tested the influence of two factors, target size and unpredictable movement, on the efficacy of dynamic flash coloration. Both these factors have independently been shown to affect the predator's ability to attack a moving prey accurately, but whether they interact with prey coloration remains unclear. Using a virtual predation experiment with human participants, we found that the effectiveness of dynamic flash coloration, when compared to background-matching coloration, declined as the size of the target increased, but only when the target movement was linear (i.e. predictable). However, when the movement was unpredictable (i.e. when the target adopted a 'protean' motion), we found dynamic flash coloration to be effective in reducing the number and accuracy of attacks irrespective of target size. Under most conditions, the effectiveness of dynamic flash coloration did not differ from that of a uniform luminance-matched grey target. Our results suggest that the efficacy of dynamic flash coloration is limited by prey size, but animals can overcome this constraint by employing an unpredictable movement trajectory. The study also provides direct empirical evidence that protean antipredator behaviour influences the effectiveness of prey coloration that works in motion.

AB Understanding the causes and consequences of dispersal is key to identifying selective pressures underlying species-level variation in biogeography, metapopulation dynamics and adaptive capacity. We tested the hypotheses that nest predation and/or brood parasitism avoidance drive breeding dispersal decisions and that dispersal functions to reduce subsequent reproductive failure in grasshopper sparrows, Ammodramus savannarum, breeding in eastern Kansas, U.S.A. Over 2 years, we monitored the fate of 222 nests and the movements of 144 parents. We established the spatiotemporal patterns of nest success among all nests, then related nest predation and parasitism to subsequent dispersal behaviour and reproductive success. Birds were more likely to disperse following nest predation, but decisions were unaffected by parasitism. Dispersers experienced higher chances of subsequent nest survival than did site-faithful individuals. Although second nests were parasitized less often than were first nests, dispersers did not experience substantially lower parasitism than did site-faithful individuals, suggesting that the challenges of predation and brood parasitism may be solved in different ways. This study represents one of few tests of alternative hypotheses explaining dispersal decisions of songbirds within seasons and represents a rare case study of the consequences of breeding dispersal on subsequent reproductive success. Our results suggest that differences in dispersal tendencies may result from variation in risk-response thresholds rather than alternative causal drivers.

AB The rapid sequestering hypothesis predicts that scatter-hoarding animals quickly sequester food items by storing seeds in caches near seed sources to reduce competition. However, tests of this hypothesis usually use food-hoarding animals with a single load or a small load size. How multiple-load animals place their caches between food sources and nests remains largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that multiple-load animals, compared to single-load animals, may not necessarily sequester food items but adopt alternative hoarding strategies due to their multiple-load ability. In this study, we presented seeds at different distances from the nests of the multiple-loading Siberian chipmunk, Tamias sibiricus, and mapped the spatial distribution of their caches in multiple-compartment enclosures to test our hypothesis that a multiple-prey loader will consistently establish caches near nests rather than rapidly sequester near the seed source. By using multiple-compartment enclosures with different distances between the seed source and nests, and given potential intra- and interspecific competition, we found chipmunks consistently placed their caches near nests but away from the seed source. Cache placement near nests may serve as an alternative strategy that not only guarantees a maximum harvest rate at the seed source but also ensures effective cache defence near nests. Moreover, scatter-hoarding seeds near nests may alternatively guarantee a food supply if larder-hoarded seeds are depleted or lost. Unlike seeds sequestered near food sources, caches near nests imply long dispersal distances for seeds in our study. Therefore, scatter hoarding by multiple-prey loaders is expected to be ecologically important for the structure and function of tree communities, especially in ecosystems in which seeds depend on food-hoarding animals for dispersal and germination.

ID TRACKING
AB The analysis of animal behaviour often requires uniquely marking and tracking many individuals simultaneously for long periods. However, these identifying marks can often be partially removed, erased or obscured, preventing accurate differentiation between individuals. Modern computer-readable tags can mitigate some of these challenges while also creating others, such as not being human-readable. Here, we apply several fundamental principles from the engineering of communications systems to the design of human-readable animal identification schemes that are robust to mark removals. These techniques allow biologists to fully reconstruct the identities of individual animals even as marks degrade over time or become only partially observable due to obstructions. Additionally, we supply an open-source R software package called rabi to make the implementation of these methods painless and accessible to researchers unfamiliar with coding theory. More generally, we hope that exposure to these techniques from engineering will narrow the disciplinary gap, albeit slightly, between experts in animal and technological communication.

AB Parental care is costly, and theory suggests that caregivers should reduce parental investment or even stop caring altogether when the costs of caring are too high or the benefits too low. Brood cannibalism is one tactic by which parents can divert investment away from current offspring and towards potentially higher-quality future offspring, but the various selective factors underlying partial brood cannibalism and their relative importance remain poorly understood. Here we used the plainfin midshipman fish, Porichthys notatus, to concurrently examine three hypotheses for partial brood cannibalism and test whether cannibalism increases when (1) parental body condition is low, (2) brood sizes are large and/or (3) brood paternity is low. To investigate these predictions, we combine multiyear, multisite field data with genetic paternity testing and show that partial brood cannibalism is not related to low parental body condition or to large brood sizes, but rather is linked to low paternity. In particular, males that had taken over nests from other males, and were thus unrelated to the broods present in the new nests, consumed the largest number of young (similar to 15 or more eaten at a time). Our data also suggest that the consumption of only a few young (similar to 1-2 at a time) appears to be governed by other factors that are not clearly related to paternity. Overall, we highlight the utility of concurrently testing multiple hypotheses for partial brood cannibalism within the same system to better understand this otherwise puzzling behaviour.

AB For territorial species, the ability to be behaviourally plastic in response to changes in their social environment may be beneficial by allowing individuals to mitigate conflict with conspecifics and reduce the costs of territoriality. Here we investigated whether North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, are able to minimize costs of territory defence by adjusting behaviour in response to the familiarity of neighbouring conspecifics. Since red squirrels living in familiar neighbourhoods face reduced intrusion risk, we predicted that increasing familiarity among territorial neighbours would allow squirrels to spend less time on territorial defence and more time in the nest. Longitudinal behavioural data (1995-2004) collected from the same squirrels across several different social environments indicated that red squirrels reduced rates of territorial vocalizations and increased nest use in response to increasing familiarity with neighbours. In contrast, cross-sectional data (2015-2016), which provided observations from each individual in a single social environment, did not provide evidence of this plasticity. Post hoc analyses revealed that evidence of social plasticity in this system is primarily due to within-individual changes in behaviour, which we were unable to estimate in the cross-sectional data. Our results demonstrate that red squirrels respond to changes in their social environment by adjusting their behaviour in a manner that reduces the costs of territoriality. However, our results also suggest that estimating plasticity by comparing behaviour among individuals (i.e. cross-sectional analyses) may not always be reliable. Our ability to detect these effects may therefore depend on having data with multiple observations from the same individuals across different social environments.

AB Understanding the origins and evolution of language remains a deep challenge, because its complexity and expressive power are unparalleled in the animal world. One of the key features of language is that the meaning of an expression is determined both by the meanings of its constituent parts and the syntactic rules used to combine them; known as the principle of compositionality. Although compositionality has been considered unique to language, recent field studies suggest that compositionality may have also evolved in vocal combinations in nonhuman animals. Here, we discuss how compositionality can be explored in animal communication systems and review recent evidence that birds use an ordering rule to generate compositional expressions composed of meaningful calls. Also, we suggest that bird-songs, particularly when incorporating calls, may represent unrecognized examples of compositionality in animal communication. Finally, we outline future research directions to uncover the development, neural mechanisms and evolution of compositionality. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sexual size dimorphism is widespread among dioecious species, but its underlying driving forces are often complex. A review of sexual size dimorphism in marine gastropods revealed two common patterns: first, sexual size dimorphism, with females being larger than males, and, second, females being larger than males in mating pairs. Both patterns suggest sexual selection and sexual size dimorphism are causally related. To test this hypothesis, we investigated, first, mechanisms driving sexual selection on size in three congeneric marine gastropods with different degrees of sexual size dimorphism, and, second, the correlation between male/female sexual selection and sexual size dimorphism across several marine gastropod species. Male mate choice via mucus trail following (as evidence of sexual selection) was found during the mating process in all three congeneric species, even though not all species showed sexual size dimorphism. There was also a significant and strong negative correlation between female sexual selection and sexual size dimorphism across 16 cases from seven marine gastropod species. These results suggest that sexual selection does not drive sexual size dimorphism. There was, however, evidence of males utilizing a similar mechanism to choose mates (i.e. selecting a female slightly larger than their own size) which may be widespread among gastropods, and, in tandem with sexual size dimorphism varying between species, provides a plausible explanation of the mating patterns observed in marine gastropods.

In comparison to solo bouts, the bouts of countersinging males had increased syntax diversity, with higher numbers of simple paths and transition types (but not syllable types) in comparison to solo song, which had high sequence consistency. Both the proportion of introductory syllables and the degree (number of transitions to and from those syllables) increased in countersinging bouts and were an important source of syntactic variability. In contrast, courtship bouts included longer songs and longer syllables than both solo and countersinging bouts, but were similar to solo songs in sequence consistency. The longest courtship songs often included concatenated sequences that formed 'compound songs', or repeating strings of main song syllables, which slightly increased the degree of those syllables. Our results suggest that interactions between males are associated with increased syntactic variability in song delivery while female choice favours signals that maintain species-typical syntax and demonstrate fitness in terms of a male's capacity to sing extended songs.

AB Research on cooperatively breeding birds usually focuses on social dynamics within the breeding group, but conflict between groups can also affect individual fitness and the evolution of sociality. Here we investigate the causes and consequences of competition between groups of communally breeding greater anis, Crotophaga major, over a 10-year field study. Social groups were spatially clustered into loose aggregations that showed a moderate degree of reproductive synchrony. However, competition between neighbouring groups for nesting sites was intense, occasionally leading to wholesale destruction of a group's nesting attempt and abandonment of the site. We documented 18 cases in which a group's entire clutch of eggs was ejected from the nest during the laying or incubation period, often accompanied by behavioural observations of conflict with a neighbouring group. Clutch destruction typically occurred when two groups attempted to nest in close proximity on high-quality sites: nearest-neighbour distance and nest site type were the strongest predictors of clutch destruction. Surprisingly, group size did not predict whether or not a group's clutch would be destroyed, and small groups sometimes ousted larger groups. By contrast, 'home field advantage' did have a significant effect: groups that had previously nested on the site were more likely to destroy the clutches of newly established groups, and this effect increased with the number of years that the group had nested there. Together, these results support previous evidence that competition between groups for high-quality nesting sites is an important driver of communal breeding, and they highlight the importance of location and past history in determining the outcome of intergroup contests in social species.

AB Eavesdropping is predicted to evolve between sympatric, but not allopatric, predator and prey. The evolutionary arms race between Asian honey bees and their hornet predators has led to a remarkable defence, heat balling, which suffocates hornets with heat and carbon dioxide. We show that the sympatric Asian species, Apis cerana (Ac), formed heat balls in response to Ac and hornet (Vespa velutina) alarm pheromones, demonstrating eavesdropping. The allopatric species, Apis mellifera (Am), only weakly responded to a live hornet and Am alarm pheromone, but not to hornet alarm pheromone. We observed typical hornet alarm pheromone-releasing behaviour, hornet sting extension, when guard bees initially attacked. Once heat balls were formed, guards released honey bee sting alarm pheromones: isopentyl acetate, octyl acetate, (E)-2-decen-1-yl acetate and benzyl acetate. Only Ac heat balled in response to realistic bee alarm pheromone component levels (<1 bee-equivalent, 1 mu g) of isopentyl acetate. Detailed eavesdropping experiments showed that Ac, but not Am, formed heat balls in response to a synthetic blend of hornet alarm pheromone. Only Ac antennae showed strong, consistent responses to hornet alarm pheromone compounds and venom volatiles. These data provide the first evidence that the sympatric Ac, but not the allopatric Am, can eavesdrop upon hornet alarm pheromone and uses this information, in addition to bee alarm pheromone, to heat ball hornets. Evolution has likely given Ac this eavesdropping ability, an adaptation that the allopatric Am does not possess. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social parasites exploit resources of other social species, to the detriment of their host. In order to enter and integrate in a host colony, social parasites must avoid being detected as a non-nestmate. The parasites, therefore, use one or a combination of chemical strategies: (1) producing recognition cues that match host's (mimicry), (2) acquiring recognition cues from the hosts or its nest (camouflage), (3) not producing recognition cues (insignificance) and/or (4) using substances for confusing, suppressing or appeasing the host (weaponry). In this study, we investigate the integration strategy of Megalomyrmex symmetochus ants into colonies of the fungus-growing ant Sericomyrmex amabilis. We compared the chemical odour profiles of parasitized and nonparasitized S. amabilis colonies with the profiles of the parasites. Additionally, we conducted behavioural assays, where we introduced a single ant, being either a nestmate, a conspecific non-nestmate or a parasite into an arena with five S. amabilis workers and scored the behaviour of the latter ants. The chemical analysis revealed that the social parasites have distinct odour profiles and share only one hydrocarbon with its host, have a low overall abundance of cuticular hydrocarbons and have high concentrations of venom-derived alkaloids. In behavioural experiments, we found that workers of nonparasitized colonies fight against parasite intruders, whereas workers of parasitized colonies treat introduced parasites (from their own and from another parasitized colony) similar to their conspecific nestmates. All workers (parasitized or not) show more submissive behaviour towards parasitized workers and parasites than towards nonparasitized workers. The chemical analysis of odour profiles suggests that the parasites use a chemical insignificance strategy. Furthermore, the chemical and behavioural data suggest that the parasites use weaponry to maintain an amiable association with their host ants. We discuss the biological significance of the lack of aggression in S. amabilis workers from parasitized colonies. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Association indices have been a mainstay of social behaviour analysis for decades. However, researchers have long recognized that these indices can be biased under certain conditions. In this paper, I develop a process map of the steps necessary to transform social behaviour into estimates of association rates. This helps to distinguish the subject population's behaviour from the researcher's data collection protocol. By doing this, we can isolate the sources of bias. I also show that bias in association indices is often a function of the true association rate. This means that while bias does not affect the ordering of associations, it can impact analysis in unpredictable ways. Performing network analysis with biased association indices can lead researchers to arrive at different conclusions than if they had used unbiased estimators. To simplify the mathematical task of deriving unbiased estimators, I introduce three properties of maximum likelihood estimators that allow one to treat association data as output from a multinomial distribution, then use the functional invariance property of maximum likelihood estimators to solve for estimators. I apply these properties to a selection of common data collection protocols to show that there is no single association index that is appropriate for all cases. Instead, each of the commonly used indices is unbiased under appropriate conditions. Furthermore, when it is possible that some of the individuals are not identified, I introduce some new unbiased estimators. I close with a discussion of nontraditional techniques of collecting data that provide an opportunity to increase the number of outputs from the data collection process. These techniques may ultimately make it possible to specify association behaviour more carefully by allowing for more parameters in the data generation process.

AB Previous studies have shown that mammals exhibit two distinct forms of magnetic behaviour: spontaneous magnetic alignment and learned magnetic compass orientation. However, it remains to be determined whether the type of magnetic response is species specific (i.e. species exhibit either learned magnetic compass responses or spontaneous magnetic orientation). Alternatively, learned and spontaneous magnetic orientation may be context dependent and expressed in the same species under different conditions, e.g. motivational, physiological and/or environmental. Using C57BL/6J laboratory mice, we provide evidence for multiple spatial responses to magnetic cues in the same species. In a series of three similar nest-building experiments in which mice were trained to construct nests in one of four magnetic directions, mice either positioned nests along a fixed northeast-southwest magnetic axis (Series 1), independent of the trained direction, and similar to spontaneous magnetic alignment responses in other vertebrates, or exhibited learned magnetic compass orientation in the direction away from (Series 2) or towards (Series 3) the sheltered end of the magnetic axis they had been exposed to during the training period. Importantly, the responses elicited in each series paralleled changes in the experimental protocols and may help to explain the variation in magnetic behaviours. Furthermore, the plasticity in the magnetic orientation exhibited by laboratory mice suggests that magnetic cues play important role in the spatial ecology of epigean rodents. Characterizing the factors that elicit these responses will shed light on the adaptive significance of spontaneous magnetic alignment, a widespread but poorly understood spatial behaviour. In addition, future studies with similar nest-building assays will likely play a role in helping to determine whether magnetic compass orientation and spontaneous magnetic alignment are mediated by the same underlying mechanisms of magnetoreception.

AB Mate-guarding strategies are known to evolve in response to changes in the environment, but little is known about the genetic and plastic components of this source of variation. Here, we investigated how risk associated with aggression shapes postcopulatory association time between mates in the bulb mite, Rhizoglyphus robini, a species in which aggressive, armoured fighters often coexist with unarmoured scramblers. In some populations, scramblers have been reported to prevent females remating by remaining in copula for over 6 h. In this study, we investigated whether mate guarding by scramblers is affected by the presence of aggressive fighters in populations. We investigated whether guarding is riskier in the presence of fighters and found that guarding males were more likely to be attacked. Our data allowed us to determine whether the presence of fighters can affect mate-guarding duration, by comparing guarding duration between populations (both natural and artificially selected). We found that in both types of population, males guarded longer when fighters were absent. Comparisons between lines selected for the presence of fighters, lines selected for the presence of scramblers and their source populations indicated that scrambler morphs evolved prolonged guarding. We also investigated whether males show plasticity and shorten guarding in response to the presence of fighters in a social group. Surprisingly, we found that males in a mixed-morph context copulated significantly longer than males from single-morph groups. Our results demonstrate that mate guarding may evolve in response to the presence or absence of fighters in populations, but males are not able to adjust guarding behaviour to the risk of being attacked by fighters. The study provides insight into the role of genetics and plasticity in guarding strategies. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Knowing how naive migrants respond to intrinsic and extrinsic factors experienced en route will allow a more thorough understanding of the endogenous migratory programme. To understand how inexperienced individuals respond to ecological features, we tracked the migratory departures of juvenile ruby-throated hummingbirds, Archilochus colubris, one of the smallest (similar to 3 g) and least-studied migrants, along the Gulf of Mexico during southbound migration using an international automated radiotelemetry system. The recent miniaturization of radiotags provides a novel method to track one of the smallest migratory birds, rendering the first information on departure decisions of known hummingbirds in relation to an ecological barrier. Using weather conditions and individual attributes, we also determined which factors influenced the time and direction of departure from a coastal stopover site. Most migrants (83%) departed in the morning, and daily departure time was only influenced by stopover duration, the amount of time spent at a stopover site. The majority (77%) of departure orientations paralleled the coastline, and we found little influence of any factor on departure direction. Our results reveal that (1) juvenile hummingbirds departing coastal Alabama move in a direction indicative of a circum-Gulf path during southbound migration and (2) departure decisions support a fly-and-forage strategy in which hummingbirds likely take advantage of resources along the coast while moving towards their destination.

   CONSEQUENCES; DISPERSAL
AB We describe a conceptual framework integrating animal personalities, movement ecology, social networks and parasite transmission. For directly transmitted parasites, parasite transmission depends on social interaction patterns that can be quantified using social network metrics. For indirectly transmitted parasites, the key can be transmission networks that quantify time-lagged contacts (e.g. where potential hosts visit locations used earlier by infected hosts). Social network connections (time-lagged or not) often result from shared space use determined by individual movements in response to key environmental factors. Movement ecology provides a framework for understanding these responses. Finally, individuals with different personalities likely respond differently to environmental factors in ways that influence the movements and space use that underlie network connectivity, which, in turn, affects parasite loads and transmission. We illustrate these key points with recent work on sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, and their ticks. By GPS tracking of nearly all adult lizards at our site, we found that lizards that more frequently shared the same refuges (where ticks detach and reattach to a new host) used earlier by other lizards tended to indeed have higher tick loads. Higher shared refuge use was associated with greater shared space use, in general. Shared space use with conspecifics was reduced by the lizards' general propensity (quantified by analyses of 279 985 GPS locations for 72 lizards) to avoid conspecifics, but enhanced by their general tendency to prefer areas with more resources and better refuge (in particular, late in the season when food was scarce and conditions were hotter and drier). Both of these tendencies were personality dependent. Less aggressive lizards exhibited both a stronger attraction to areas with more food and better refuge, and a stronger tendency to avoid other lizards. We conclude by discussing implications of our results for the general conceptual framework and suggest future directions.

AB Personality-dependent dispersal is a key ecological and evolutionary process that is likely to facilitate the successful movement and colonization/invasion success of species. This dispersal syndrome suggests that dispersers should possess a suite of behavioural tendencies that differ from those of nondispersers, thus influencing the composition of populations in the new range and, ultimately, colonization success. However, dispersal is also often condition dependent, and is probably mediated by the interaction between an individual's personality and environmental and social factors such as competition. Accordingly, we investigated whether dispersal tendency was linked to an activity, exploration and social syndrome and/or aggression in a reptile, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, which has had a successful invasion history via accidental introductions. Contrary to our prediction, we found that dispersal was not related to activity, exploration or social personality traits. Instead, dispersal tendency was associated with aggression: the most aggressive individuals dispersed further and faster than less aggressive individuals. The presence of aggression-dependent dispersal could be due to either (1) dispersers generally being more aggressive than nondispersers or (2) aggressive individuals forcing nonaggressive individuals into hiding, thus impinging on the ability of subordinates to disperse regardless of their personality. Our study highlights the need to consider the ecological context when examining personality-dependent dispersal and suggests that aggression and the social environment can play an important role in dispersal decisions.

AB Although bat-insect interactions are often described as an 'evolutionary arms race', conclusive evidence for bat counterstrategies to insect defences has been difficult to acquire. Previous studies have indicated that some bats use low-amplitude, 'stealth' echolocation to counter moth hearing. However, actual bateinsect interactions have not been documented to validate this finding. We hypothesized that the bat Corynorhinus townsendii uses stealth echolocation to overcome prey defences. We measured C. townsendii call intensities as they attacked tethered moths in the field and in a large outdoor flight cage. We also used three-dimensional videography to document C. townsendii and Myotis volans, which uses intensities more typical of aerial-hawking bats, as they attacked free-flying moths in a flight cage. Source levels of C. townsendii calls were 93.6 +/- 6.1 dB at 0.1 m in open field conditions and 81.9 +/- 6.9 dB in the more enclosed flight cage, values that are 20-45 dB lower than other aerial-hawking bats under similar conditions. Sound levels arriving at prey were mostly below known thresholds for eliciting late-attack defences. Free-flying moths were 49-66% less likely to exhibit evasive manoeuvring and sonar-jamming defences during attacks by C. townsendii compared to M. volans. Prey also exhibited lower peak velocities and accelerations during attacks, factors that are known to affect bat capture success. Accordingly, C. townsendii had 31% higher capture success against moths overall and 52% higher capture success against the sonar-jamming moth Bertholdia trigona. We conclude that stealth echolocation is an evolutionary counteradaptation to insect defences because there is no known benefit for C. townsendii to use low-amplitude calls outside of predator-prey interactions, and such calls come with considerable cost in reduced prey detection distances.

AB Many songbird species are socially monogamous while exhibiting varying extrapair paternity frequencies. Song complexity, often subject to sexual selection, similarly varies across songbird taxa. Some species form highly complex songs whereas others produce simple songs. The basis of this variability, however, is unresolved. Because selection pressures generally favour the evolution of sexually selected characteristics reflecting male quality, such as song complexity, it should be subject to extrapair mate selection. We therefore predicted a positive association between extrapair paternity frequency and songbird song complexity. In addition, we predicted that broadcast (long-range) rather than interactive songs (short-range) would be more likely to contain sexually selected characteristics, such as higher complexity, especially in species with high extrapair paternity frequencies. This was tested using tui, Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae, a species with high extrapair paternity frequency. First, analyses on 78 songbird species indicated a significant positive association between extrapair paternity frequency and within-song complexity (the level of complexity within a species-specific song) but not between-song complexity (size of species-specific song or syllable repertoire), while no phylogenetic trait conservation was found. Additionally, our results suggested tui broadcast songs had higher song complexity than interactive songs. The findings in this study indicate extrapair mate selection may play a role in the evolution of within-song complexity in songbirds. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many animals form dynamic societies in which the fission and fusion of subgroups occurs on a regular basis. Such societies are intriguing, because it is unclear whether stable dominance relationships that form within subgroups are retained upon fusion with other subgroups, and what the implications of rank instability may be at higher levels of ecological organization. Additionally, little is known about how environmental change affects the fission-fusion process, even though environments often fluctuate and are predicted to become increasingly variable, in part due to climate change. Here we investigated the social organization, levels of conflict and stability of dominance relationships during group fusion in a globally invasive fish, the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki. To assess the effect of environmental variation, we conducted group fusion experiments at high and low water depths, to simulate normal and drought conditions, and recorded dominance interactions during prefusion, early fusion and late fusion stages. Individuals formed size-based hierarchies within prefusion groups, although the relationship between size and dominance varied with group fusion. Levels of conflict were affected by group fusion and water depth, with higher levels of conflict after fusion and at low depth. Rank relationships in early and late fusion groups were stable and unaffected by water depth. Finally, there was no evidence of coat-tail effects, as familiarity with the alpha dominant in postfusion groups did not lead to a significant increase in subordinate dominance rank. All in all, these results provide key experimental evidence that environmental change in terms of water level is unlikely to impact social organization or rank stability in response to group fusion in this species. More generally, they indicate that sociality in fissionefusion societies may be relatively robust to changes in both social and environmental contexts.

AB In long-lived species with delayed maturity, prebreeders are expected to gather information by visiting and sampling the quality of potential nesting areas (prospecting), before they choose where to breed. In most seabirds, this process is important because, once recruited, individuals generally remain sitefaithful throughout their long reproductive life. As many seabirds are believed to display low levels of natal dispersal, it is possible that natal philopatry is an obligate strategy for most individuals, with prospecting being a negligible activity during the prebreeding stage. Using ringing information and GPS technology, we tracked breeding adults and prebreeder black-browed albatrosses, Thalassarche melanophris, from a colony of the Falkland Islands, during the breeding season. Breeding adults rarely engaged in prospecting, whereas prebreeders showed a high propensity to visit other colonies. Most prebreeders started prospecting ashore when 4e5 years old and most of the younger individuals prospected more than one breeding colony, with some prospecting up to five colonies in just 9 days. Prospecting activity did not differ between males and females and rapidly declined as prebreeders aged, by which time individuals had probably already selected their future nesting site. Nestling body mass at 60 days of age and hatching date did not influence prospecting behaviour later in life. Prospecting was mostly directed at colonies within 10 km from the natal place, but occurred regularly up to 55e65 km. While distance from the natal place was a strong predictor of the probability of a colony being prospected, colony size and growth rate were not. Our results provide new insights into the role of prospecting in the process of recruitment, showing that even for highly philopatric birds, recruitment to the natal colony (or to another nesting site) has the potential to be informed, not done blindly.

AB Why a variety of social animals vocalize during agonistic foraging interactions remains obscure. One possibility is that these signals advertise the signaller's competitive ability, playing a role in the defence of food resources, yet there is limited evidence in support of this idea. Here, we used adult female Asian particoloured bats, Vespertilio sinensis, to test whether individual variation in competitive ability when foraging can be explained by social calls. Using synchronized infrared video and audio recording, we monitored bat social vocalizations, dominance rank and weight gain in triads under controlled food conditions. Additionally, subsequent playbacks, consisting of experimental stimuli, echolocation pulses and silence, were presented to feeding bats in a laboratory. Analyses showed that females uttered low-requency social calls composed of one to five syllable types during feeding competition. The rates of social vocalizations increased with reduced food availability. Interestingly, dominance score and weight gain correlated weakly with body size, but positively with call rate and associated parameters. Playback of social calls inhibited the visits of bats to the focal food dish compared to playback of silence and echolocation pulses. The amount of food consumed was greatly reduced in the presence of experimental stimuli versus controls. Collectively, these results highlight that acoustic signals serve as an honest indicator of bat competitive ability. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social complexity and communicative complexity appear to have coevolved in terrestrial vertebrates. Understanding the information conveyed within the social signals of group-living taxa can illuminate the selection pressures impacting on a species and help to identify the factors promoting sociality. Within vocal communication, recruitment calls are of great importance to many social species, helping to maintain group cohesion and facilitating cooperative behaviour. Yet recruitment vocalizations have received limited scientific attention and it is not clear whether they convey context-specific information to receivers. We investigated the recruitment calls of wild dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, to ascertain whether they showed context-specific acoustic differences and whether receivers displayed context-specific responses to recruitment calls in the absence of external cues. We recorded recruitment calls (from four wild groups of dwarf mongooses) from two contexts: when an individual became separated from its group and when an individual encountered a snake. Acoustic analysis revealed that calls from the two contexts differed in acoustic structure and were distinguishable with a discriminant function analysis. Playbacks of calls from both contexts successfully recruited target mongooses, but snake calls elicited a stronger reaction (with mongooses vigilant for longer and approaching the speaker more closely). More importantly, target mongooses also displayed behaviours that were unique to call context, exhibiting head bobbing, creeping and searching of the vegetation during snake call playbacks but never during isolation call playbacks. We conclude that dwarf mongoose recruitment calls refer to context and are perceived as functionally referential by receivers. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Oviposition decisions can have important fitness consequences for offspring. We investigated the responses of European bitterling, Rhodeus amarus, a freshwater fish that spawns in the gills of living unionid mussels, to oviposition site cues. Using an artificial mussel, we manipulated the flow velocity, dissolved oxygen concentration and odour cues of mussels presented to pairs of R. amarus. Females responded positively to mussel odour and to dissolved oxygen cues. Male response was dependent on mussel odour and the flow velocity of water emerging from the artificial mussel. These responses are potentially adaptive, with females responding to cues that indicate the quality of oviposition sites for incubation of eggs. Males responded to cues with implications for optimal sperm allocation. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In species wherein males display elaborate sexually selected traits or ornaments, conspecific females may also express these traits in full or partial form. This is called mutual ornamentation, and the co-occurrence of such traits in males and females remains poorly understood. In many sulphur butterflies (subfamily Coliadinae), males have a brilliant ultraviolet (UV) iridescence on their dorsal wing surfaces that functions as a sexual signal in courtship. In some of these sulphurs, such as the large grass yellow, Eurema hecabe, females also display dorsal iridescent patches, albeit smaller, restricted to the forewings and less bright than the male's, but the reasons for its occurrence in females are unknown. Here we present a study testing two functional hypotheses for the female UV-reflecting patch: an antiharassment hypothesis and a male mate choice hypothesis. The daily activity pattern of this species suggests that males are most likely to harass or choose among females from midday on. Observations made at this time of day on the characteristics of females related to male courtship duration suggest that males may preferentially court females with a large UV patch. Experiments with colour-manipulated models also suggest that males court with equal intensity females with and without a basal UV patch. Taken altogether the results provide no support for the antiharassment hypothesis. Because support for the male mate choice hypothesis was relatively weak and because of the limited potential for selection on female coloration due to male choice in these butterflies, the nonfunctional sexual correlation hypothesis remains a viable explanation for the female ornament.

AB Social bonds between group members affect individual fitness and wellbeing. While the impact of bond strength is well studied, the consequences of bond predictability and equitability are often overlooked. Similarly, whether bonds reflect short-term contingencies and/or long-term social strategies remains understudied. We investigated these questions in female crested macaques, Macaca nigra, which display a tolerant social style within a nepotistic hierarchical social structure. We analysed the structure of social bonds by testing whether similarity within dyads (in kinship, dominance and age) predicted the strength, predictability and equitability of bonds. We then tested the value of social bonds by analysing the effect of their characteristics on three fitness-related behaviours: coalitionary support, feeding-inproximity and aggression. We found that the bond characteristics of females differed substantially from those of other species with comparable data: bonds were of average strength, of moderate endurance and relatively balanced. Stronger bonds were more equitable but less predictable than weaker bonds. Closely ranked females, but not kin or age peers, had stronger, more predictable and more equitable bonds than others. Coalitionary support was not related to any of the bond characteristics, feeding-in-proximity was positively associated with strength and predictability and aggression was positively linked to strength and negatively to equitability. These results highlight the complex picture of the benefits of social bonds in this species. They reflect the degrees of freedom tolerant macaque females can express in their social relationships within their stable social structure, a pattern that may not be given enough consideration in stable nepotistic hierarchical societies. Comparative research is necessary to establish whether these patterns are more general than previously thought or a specific feature of tolerant macaques. Investigating various characteristics of bonds together is paramount to appreciate the dynamics of social relationships and to better understand the social components of fitness.

AB Theory stipulates that females should prefer to mate with higher-quality mates to maximize their fitness. As such, traits that females prefer should be honest indicators of male quality. Dominant males are often higher quality, and mating with dominant males may confer indirect fitness benefits to females. Male Jamaican field crickets, Gryllus assimilis, fight more aggressively in front of a female audience than when there is no audience present. Males may increase their aggression because females prefer to mate with males who they have seen win a fight. To test this hypothesis we first allowed females to observe (treatment) or not observe (control) fights and then mated females to either fight winners or losers. We then assessed the following fitness measures: number of eggs oviposited, egg viability, offspring viability and offspring size at adulthood. Neither male fight victory status nor female observer/nonobserver status influenced any of the aforementioned female fitness measures; however, the aggressiveness level of the fight did. Females that mated with males that had participated in more aggressive fights produced offspring that were larger at adulthood. Given that females find larger males more attractive, and larger females oviposit more eggs, these larger offspring may experience greater reproductive success and as a result provide females with indirect fitness benefits.

AB Precopulatory mate guarding is often observed when the availability of female gametes is limited. However, in the lek-mating lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella, this behaviour would result from a constraint on the release of male ejaculate. After a recent mating, males can quickly take hold of, and thereby monopolize, a female until they are able to transfer a new spermatophore. In the present study, we investigated how perceived male competition and female mass affected precopulatory mate guarding as well as eupyrene sperm allocation in this species. In our first experiment, both males and females of a pair were exposed to the playback of either a courtship song (competitive environment) or a silent environment (control) prior to and during the second mating of the male with a virgin female of varying body mass. To disentangle male versus female contributions to the observed behaviours, we conducted a second experiment where either the male only or the female only was exposed to the playback. In both experiments, pairs involving males exposed to playback showed shorter mating latencies and longer copulation durations than control pairs, while the sum of both durations was statistically indistinguishable between groups. Differential mating latencies in both experiments demonstrate a male, not a female, response to perceived male competition. Similar total durations across treatments suggest similar spermatophore production times and the differences in copulation durations probably represent a by-product of differential mating latencies. We found no difference in the number or proportion of sperm transferred during second copulations between treatments or according to female size. Together, these results suggest that plastic precopulatory mate guarding may be adaptive, as it allows males to maximize their reproductive success by securing mates under intense male competition and simultaneous sperm depletion, a combination particularly prevalent in lek mating systems.

AB The traditional definitions of tool use typically operationalize the functionality of an object and the effect of its use on the environment and, typically, do not account for the dynamic relation among the body, task and environment that result in actions with a tool. This omission severely restricts the utility of these definitions for comparisons of tool use behaviour across individuals, populations and species. To address this issue, we propose an embodied theory of tool use based on the premise that a tool transforms the body-only system into the body-plus-tool system. It (1) explains the development of a tool use behaviour in terms of constraints on the development of tool use movements imposed by different features of the body, task and environment, (2) measures the dexterity of an actor in terms of the spatiotemporal organization of tool use movements that optimize at least one composite performance outcome variable and (3) measures the complexity in the use of a tool in terms of the control of the biomechanical degrees of freedom of the body-plus-tool system. Such an embodied theory of tool use is applicable across species, tasks and environments. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hatching asynchrony is common among bird species. It results from starting incubation before clutch completion and is often accompanied by brood reduction, an adaptive strategy of the parents to selectively starve the younger chicks in times of food scarcity. The different developmental stages of nestlings are expected to affect their competitive abilities, their hunger state and thereby parental food allocation patterns. Here we used the combination of a correlative and an experimental field study to investigate sex-specific feeding patterns in the hoopoe, Upupa epops, in relation to a chick's rank and hunger state. Male parents showed a strong bias in their feeding pattern towards larger chicks, while females' feeding pattern was significantly more even. Only females were responsive to experimentally altered chicks' hunger state, especially so with small chicks at the lower end of the size hierarchy. This differential food allocation pattern mainly resulted from females mostly entering the nestbox to feed the chicks, while males more often delivered prey from the nestbox entrance hole without entering the cavity. Hence, when entering the nestbox, females can exert some parental control over food allocation, whereas competition among chicks to access the entrance hole mainly rules food allocation when the parents feed from the nestbox entrance hole. Similar sex-specific feeding patterns might be widespread in cavity breeders and it remains to be investigated to what extent variation in these male and female feeding patterns can affect nestling mortality and ultimately breeding success.

AB Prey mortality depends on the likelihood of encountering a predator and of being killed following such an encounter. While the proactive responses of large herbivores to the risk of predation have been well documented, the reactive responses of prey following encounters have been less well studied and restricted mostly to northern temperate ecosystems. We postulated that the reactive response should depend on the habitat selection of the prey species as well as the hunting tactic (cursorial versus stalking) of the predator. We investigated the reactive responses of a selective grazer, the blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, and a generalist grazer, the plains zebra, Equus quagga, to encounters with lions, Panthera leo, their main predator, in Kruger National Park. We used simultaneous global positioning system (GPS) locations of prey and predators to identify encounters and assess their frequency and characteristics (e.g. time of day). We compared both the immediate response (stay or flee) and subsequent movement (remain in the habitat patch or relocate) of the two ungulate species following encounters with lions. Despite being more predictably located in open short grass areas, wildebeest encountered lions no more frequently than zebra. However, being more selective for these particular habitat types, wildebeest more often stayed near the encounter site than zebra. Specifically, wildebeest were less likely to leave when located in more open areas with short grass providing both high-quality food and little concealment for stalking lions. We suggest that this is because wildebeest incur higher risks and greater feeding costs than zebra should they relocate, owing to their narrower preference for areas of short grass. Our findings show how the adaptive responses of wildebeest and zebra following encounters with their major predator depend on their habitat requirements.

AB Besides being recognized as a potential welfare indicator, play behaviour has long been considered to have immediate and/or long-term benefits. In particular, it has been suggested that in play animals learn to cope physically and emotionally with unexpected events. Given that the propensity to play varies greatly between conspecific individuals, such interindividual variability in playfulness may be associated with differences in the animals' future behaviour, a prediction that has rarely been tested. To investigate whether different levels of playfulness in juvenility indeed coincide with behavioural differences in later life, 30 female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to the following series of behavioural observations and tests: (1) quantification of juvenile play behaviour; (2) behavioural testing in paradigms that assess anxiety-like behaviour and exploratory locomotion in an unfamiliar environment; and (3) observation of spontaneous behaviour in the familiar home cage environment. Surprisingly, a high level of juvenile playfulness was predictive of high levels of state anxiety and low levels of exploratory locomotion in later life. While this relationship existed already in adolescence, it became even more prominent in adulthood. By contrast, no substantial differences between playful and less playful mice were found with respect to home cage behaviour. While these findings may reflect better coping abilities in novel and dangerous environments in those mice that played the most during juvenility, they may also argue for the existence of different types of mice. Thus, despite genetic homogeneity and identical housing environments, preferences for either local or global use of space were observed that indicate the emergence of individuality. Concerning animal welfare, our findings suggest that play may constitute a plausible welfare indicator at the population level, but is probably less meaningful for the individual.

AB Although one of the hallmarks of personality traits is their consistency over time, we might expect personality traits to change during life history shifts. Becoming a parent is a major life history event, when individuals undergo dramatic behavioural and physiological changes. Here we employ a longitudinal experiment to ask whether personality changes in response to the experience of parenting in male threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Life history theory predicts that males should be less risk averse after successfully parenting, and the neuroendocrinology of parenting suggests that parenting could reorganize the hormonal landscape and behaviour of fathers. We randomly assigned males to either an experimental group (reproduced and parented) or a control group (did not reproduce and parent), and repeatedly measured a personality trait ('boldness') and 11-ketotestosterone levels (11-kT, the major androgen in fishes) in individual males. In the control group, males became bolder over time. However, in the experimental group, boldness did not change. Furthermore, 11-kT changed dramatically in the experimental group, and changes in 11-kT in parents were associated with boldness after parenting ceased. Our study is one of the first to assess proximate and ultimate explanations for changes in personality as a function of reproduction and parenting.

AB In some species of Old World monkeys and apes, females exhibit exaggerated swellings of the anogenital region that vary in size across the ovarian cycle. Exaggerated swellings are typically largest around the time of ovulation, and swelling size has been reported to correlate positively with female quality, supporting the hypothesis that exaggerated swellings are honest signals of both female fecundity and quality. However, the relationship between swelling size and timing of ovulation is weak in some studies, and the relationship between swelling size and female quality has also not been consistently reported. Here, we collated empirical studies that have reported either swelling size and estimated timing of ovulation (N = 26) or swelling size and measures of individual quality (N = 7), to assess the strength of these relationships using meta-analytical methods. Our analyses confirmed that the period of maximal swelling size is closely associated with the most fertile period of the ovarian cycle and that a large proportion of ovulations occur during the maximal swelling period. A small, positive effect size was also found for the relationship between swelling size and body condition. In contrast, the relationships with age and social rank were not significant. Swelling size, therefore, potentially signals both female condition and timing of the fertile phase. Males are likely to benefit from allocating mating effort according to swelling size, while females with large swellings potentially benefit from exerting control over matings in species in which female control is compromised by male mating strategies.

AB Extrapair copulations (EPCs) occur widely in socially monogamous birds. How cuckolded males respond to the infidelity of their social mates is still problematic. We addressed this question in the ground tit, Pseudopodoces humilis, in which EPCs occur frequently and successful reproduction relies on biparental care. In solitarily breeding pairs, we calculated the feeding rate of social pairs at polyandrous and monogamous females' nests. Compared with that at monogamous nests, cuckolded males increased their feeding rate whereas polyandrous females reduced theirs. Polyandrous females had larger extrapair partners, although their extrapair young were neither heavier nor had higher heterozygosity than their within- pair young. Extrapair males never provided paternal care for the mixed brood and polyandrous females had no opportunity to forage on the territory of extrapair males. Therefore, the energetic benefit polyandrous females obtained was due to the increased parental care of their social mates. Even losing some share, cuckolded males still gained most of the paternity within the mixed brood. By increasing parental care for the current brood, they could ensure the survival of their own offspring. Thus, we suggest that females place their social male in a cruel bind by creating a larger brood containing some unrelated young: if the social male does not step up provisioning to meet the demands of the larger brood, overcrowding may reduce the survival of his offspring. Polyandrous females maintain the fitness incentive for their social males to provide parental care by limiting the paternity of extrapair males to a minority of the brood.

AB Conflict and aggressive interactions are common phenomena in group-living animals and vocal behaviour often plays an important role in determining their outcomes. In some species, vocal signals seem to provide bystanders with information about the nature of an ongoing aggressive interaction, which can be beneficial for the victims. For example, in chimpanzees and some other primates, victims adjust their screams depending on the composition of the by-standing audience, probably to solicit their support. Considerably less is known, however, about the role of other call types produced by victims of aggression. In this study, we focused on the fact that, immediately after screams, chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, victims often produce 'waa' barks, but little is known about their function. Our results showed that for screams, but not 'waa' barks, production was dependent on the audience composition with victims being more likely to scream when adult or late-adolescent males were in close proximity. We also found that after 'waa' barking, but not screaming, victims were more likely to retaliate against and less likely to reconcile with their aggressors, and that 'waa' barking was more common after victims had received support from other party members. These results suggest that, in chimpanzees, victims of aggression vocalize with a dual social strategy of attempting to recruit support from bystanders and to repel their attackers by signalling readiness to retaliate. We conclude that victim scream and 'waa' bark calls, although often produced during the same agonistic event, are directed at different audiences and fulfil different social functions, and that these calls can mediate both aggressive interactions and aggressor-victim relationships following aggression.

AB General concepts of sexual selection assume that females benefit from mating with more competitive or attractive males. By contrast, sexual conflict theory assumes that females suffer greater costs from mating with such males. To understand how mate choice evolves, it is necessary to examine these different predictions regarding costs and benefits. Moreover, environmental factors may play an important role in the consequences of mate choice benefits. Here, we examined how mate choice benefits and sexual conflict costs are affected by an environmental condition (single or repeated interaction with a mate) in Gnatocerus cornutus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). The males have enlarged mandibles to fight rivals and for courtship display to attract mates, and these characters provide a mating advantage to males. In G. cornutus, compared with a single mating, continuous housing with a male directly enhances female fitness due to increased mating frequency and sperm replenishment. In a single mating situation, there were neither direct benefits nor costs from competitive and attractive males. By contrast, when females were continuously housed with a competitively superior male, female fitness was reduced, probably because of misdirected attacks by the competitive male. Thus, our result suggests that females suffer direct costs from competitive males in G. cornutus but this cost is not incurred when there are few sexual interactions.

AB The availability and spatial distribution of reproductive resources determine female distribution, thus affecting the organization of mating systems and the intensity of sexual selection. Females of the harvestman Serracutisoma proximum lay eggs on specific plant species, which are defended by males of the large morph (majors). After oviposition, females remain inside the major's territory, forming a harem, which may be invaded by males of the small morph (minors) to sneak copulations. We experimentally manipulated the availability of the plants used as oviposition sites, and investigated how it affected the mating system of S. proximum. Our results show that females and minors moved preferentially to plots with high plant availability. Plots with high plant availability had more harems, which were established on the preferred plants. In plots with low plant availability, many females laid eggs on plants where S. proximum clutches had never been observed previously, rather than choosing to be a part of a harem on a preferred plant. Harem invasions were accomplished by both minors and majors, and the frequency of harem invasions was not influenced by plant availability. Finally, male-male competition for harems and the potential for sexual selection were also not influenced by plant availability. Female plasticity in oviposition site use probably attenuates competition among majors, allowing males with poorly developed weaponry to establish a territory and achieve copulations. Minors apparently adjust their distribution in response to harem density, but the income of minors does not increase the frequency of harem invasions in plots with high plant availability. Plasticity in the major mating tactic probably accounts for the high frequency of harem invasions, regardless of plant availability. We argue that behavioural plasticity may thus profoundly affect our ability to make predictions about the effects of oviposition site limitation on mating systems and the intensity of sexual selection in species exhibiting resource defence polygyny.

AB Recent developments in the study of mating behaviour have emphasized the importance of strategic investment of limited reproductive resources. However, in many cases it can be difficult to interpret traits such as copula duration, because they are interacting phenotypes that ultimately depend upon both the male and female mating partner, and the sexes may frequently disagree over the optimal outcome. Here we report the results of experiments designed to establish which sex controls copula duration in the birch catkin bug, Kleidocerys resedae, and to test for strategic investment by the controlling sex. First, we found that matings of field-caught individuals were relatively short, but that copula duration increased following a period of sexual isolation, reaching a maximum after 2 days. However, copula duration was again shorter in re-pairings of the same individuals 1 h after their first mating. Because these results could be interpreted as a response to sexual isolation by either sex, we next investigated whether copula duration is under male or female control in this species. Experimental pairings between males and females isolated for 1 h or 48 h in all four possible combinations revealed that copula duration depended strongly on the period of male but not of female sexual isolation, implying that this trait is under male control. Finally, if males mated once were re-paired after 1 h with either the same or a novel (but still recently mated) female, we found that they mated for significantly longer with the latter. Collectively, our results imply that male birch catkin bugs in nature are frequently time-, sperm- or seminal fluid-limited, and that, as predicted by theory, they strategically allocate more of their mating effort and ejaculate reserves to novel females, a form of (cryptic) male mate choice.

AB Aggregating and moving with relatives may enable animals to increase opportunities for kin selection to occur. To gain group-living benefits, animals must coordinate their behaviour. Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, demonstrate both territoriality and schooling: the two key social behaviours performed by fish. In this investigation we compared the migratory timing and behaviour of six distinct full-sibling groups of tagged S. salar smolts with a large control sample from the same wild population. The results clearly demonstrate that the incidence of schooling and diel migratory timing is not significantly influenced by relatedness, and this adds further support to the hypothesis that S. salar smolt migration is primarily an adaptive response to environmental conditions, rather than a behaviour based solely on genetics or kin-biased behaviour. Used in conjunction with the results of two previous investigations, this is the first study to illustrate that kin discrimination among full-sibling groups of parr does not lead to kin-biased schooling in smolts. Thus, even within the same full-sibling groups, the extent of kin-biased behaviour in fish can both differ within a life history stage under varying ecological conditions and shift from one life history stage to the next.

AB Following human gaze in dogs and human infants can be considered a socially facilitated orientation response, which in object choice tasks is modulated by human-given ostensive cues. Despite their similarities to human infants, and extensive skills in reading human cues in foraging contexts, no evidence that dogs follow gaze into distant space has been found. We re-examined this question, and additionally whether dogs' propensity to follow gaze was affected by age and/or training to pay attention to humans. We tested a cross-sectional sample of 145 border collies aged 6 months to 14 years with different amounts of training over their lives. The dogs' gaze-following response in test and control conditions before and after training for initiating eye contact with the experimenter was compared with that of a second group of 13 border collies trained to touch a ball with their paw. Our results provide the first evidence that dogs can follow human gaze into distant space. Although we found no age effect on gaze following, the youngest and oldest age groups were more distractible, which resulted in a higher number of looks in the test and control conditions. Extensive lifelong formal training as well as short-term training for eye contact decreased dogs' tendency to follow gaze and increased their duration of gaze to the face. The reduction in gaze following after training for eye contact cannot be explained by fatigue or short-term habituation, as in the second group gaze following increased after a different training of the same length. Training for eye contact created a competing tendency to fixate the face, which prevented the dogs from following the directional cues. We conclude that following human gaze into distant space in dogs is modulated by training, which may explain why dogs perform poorly in comparison to other species in this task. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Theory suggests that aggressive signals must be costly if they are to be reliable. Recent research in birds has shown, however, that in many species the best predictors of impending attack are low-amplitude vocal signals, soft songs or soft calls, that seem cheap to produce and easy to cheat. This observation leads to two related but separate questions: (1) why use low-amplitude signals to communicate aggressiveness and (2) what maintains the reliability of soft signals of aggression? We review potential answers to both questions and present evidence relevant to each. While some hypotheses are logically sound, others have logical flaws, and most of the hypotheses have yet to be critically tested. One exception is the hypothesis that the reliability of soft signals of aggressiveness is maintained by receiver retaliation, which has been supported by experimental evidence in multiple species. We emphasize the need for further research, particularly to answer the question of why soft song is soft, and outline future research directions.

AB Masquerade describes a defence by animals that have evolved to closely resemble inedible objects such as twigs, stones or bird droppings. Animals that masquerade often match their models in size or shape, and may even adopt specific postures in order to enhance their resemblance, causing predators to misclassify them as their model objects. The caterpillars of some moth species resemble bird droppings, and bend their bodies while resting on branches or leaves. We hypothesized that such bending might enhance the caterpillars' resemblance to real bird droppings. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by pinning artificial caterpillars with green or bird dropping coloration onto tree branches in both straight and bent postures, after which we exposed them to bird predation in the wild. We found that the adoption of a bent posture resulted in a lower attack rate by birds on the artificial caterpillars with the bird dropping coloration, while green caterpillars experienced no benefit from the same treatment. This study is the first experimental demonstration of the protective value of a specific posture in masquerading prey, and highlights the importance of considering an organism's shape and posture in the study of masquerade.

AB Parasites show a wide variety of strategies to maximize the successful transmission of themselves and/or their offspring, by exploiting hosts. One such strategy occurs when parasites manipulate host behaviour in a way that increases their probability of transmission to an uninfected host. Here, we examine whether brood parasitic brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, attack and cause nest failure in latestage, and hence, inappropriate host nests, which theory suggests they may do to parasitize the replacement nests at an opportune time, effectively manipulating their host's reproductive behaviour and improving their own transmission. Critical to this 'farming' hypothesis, cowbirds must be attuned to the reproductive stage of their host and act accordingly by destroying nonparasitized clutches they find late in the nesting cycle. We conducted a series of experimental manipulations in which we presented captive cowbirds with nests simulating early and late stages. We found that cowbirds caused significantly greater destruction in the late-stage nests. Moreover, our results suggest that cowbirds are capable of using both direct assessment and absolute egg number to assess which clutches to destroy. Corroborating our findings in the laboratory, 10 years of field data show that cowbirds significantly increase the intensity of their attacks (i.'e. the proportion of the clutch destroyed) on nonparasitized host nests as the nesting cycle progresses; however, we found no such trend for parasitized host nests. These results indicate that cowbirds evaluate the reproductive stage of their hosts using multiple mechanisms and use this information to vary the intensity of their attacks.

AB Many animals face the task of locating and settling on a territory where they can produce offspring. Over the past 36 years, theoretical and empirical studies have provided growing support for the 'foothold hypothesis', which attempts to explain territorial settlement of long-lived animals. The hypothesis maintains that a young prebreeder lives within or intrudes into a cluster of breeding territories, accumulates site-dependent dominance there, then outcompetes other prebreeders for a territory within the cluster when it becomes available. We examined patterns in territorial intrusion and settlement among prebreeders of known age and natal origin to test the foothold hypothesis in the common loon, Gavia immer. We tested two other hypotheses for territory settlement: the maturation hypothesis, which posits that animals await physical and/or behavioural maturity before territory acquisition; and the assessment hypothesis, which maintains that prebreeders intrude into territories to assess fighting ability of territory owners, one of which they ultimately evict. We found no evidence for footholds in loons: prebreeders focused their intrusions within roughly 10 clustered territories, but intruded infrequently into the lake on which they later settled. Furthermore, prebreeders that waited years to usurp a territory had reproductive success no different from those that settled more rapidly on a vacant territory. The maturation hypothesis, in contrast, was supported in both sexes: prebreeders showed a sharp increase in fighting ability with age, and males exhibited age-related increases in mass and tendency to confront territory owners. The assessment hypothesis also gained support because intruders interacted extensively with owners and intruded frequently after territorial turnovers. Our study adds to a small but growing number of studies that fail to support the foothold hypothesis for territory settlement and support the conclusion that modes of territory acquisition might be more varied than previously thought.

AB The ability to suppress and/or change behaviour on the basis of negative feedback, often conceptualized as cognitive flexibility, has rarely been investigated in nonhuman great apes across a broad age range. In this study, 25 chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, eight bonobos, Pan paniscus, seven orang-utans, Pongo abelii, and three gorillas, Gorilla gorilla, whose ages ranged from 5 to 48 years, were presented with a transparent Plexiglas rectangular box horizontally attached to their cage mesh. A square container, 7.5 cm(2), fixed inside the apparatus contained a food reward (i.e. a grape). While the container rested on its central position the grape was not accessible. To retrieve the grape the subjects needed to grasp the handle connected to the reward container and displace it sideways to reach one of the lateral access windows. Subjects were intensively trained to displace the handle to a specific side (right or left, depending on the group) and then the rewarded side was reversed during the test. Performance in this reversal task did not differ significantly between species. However, a U-shaped relation between age and perseverative responding (i.e. moves to the previously rewarded side) was observed, extending findings with humans to our closest living primate relatives.

AB Pollinator fig wasps serve as useful empirical models for studies of sex ratio evolution because females adjust their offspring sex ratios in relation to the number of foundresses that share a fig. Placement of pollinator offspring within figs is not random and more centrally located flowers are more likely to support pollinator development. We compared components of fitness of female fig wasps developing in central and peripheral flowers and whether this influenced the sex ratios of their offspring. We used Ceratosolen solmsi marchali, a pollinator of the Asian dioecious fig tree, Ficus hispida. Mating frequency was determined from the number of mating holes in females' flowers. Most females mated once, but some had the opportunity to mate up to four times and multiple mating opportunities were more frequent among centrally located galls. Body size was not linked to flower location, although the females that mated most were significantly larger than others, and came from significantly larger galls. Females that had multiple mating opportunities produced more daughters but similar numbers of sons, resulting in more female-biased broods. These females are likely to have produced more offspring because of their larger size but may have also benefited from mating with more males. The results demonstrate that differences in the natal locations of foundresses can modify offspring sex ratios and obscure sex ratio adjustment in response to the number of foundresses sharing a fig.

AB The ecological constraints hypothesis states that as group size increases, groups travel further and occupy larger home ranges in order to meet basic energetic needs for survival and reproduction. In this paper we used 19 years of demographic and ranging data on a study population of golden lion tamarins, Leontopithecus rosalia, to examine this hypothesis. Significant variation in rate of predation on lion tamarins during the study affected group size, membership and population density, which allowed us to test for predicted correlations between these changes and home range size. We found that predation-mediated changes in group composition and population density explained 71% of variation in home range size. Increased predation decreased lion tamarin home ranges because of the effects of decreased group size, fewer adult natal males and fewer reproductive females in the group. The effect of these factors on decreased ranging was offset somewhat by lower population density during high predation, which resulted in range expansion due to reduced pressure from neighbouring groups. We also found that groups with high future reproductive potential (i.e. with multiple breeding females) increased their range size. This effect was independent of group size. We propose a new hypothesis, that taxa with high rates of reproduction, such as lion tamarins, will increase home range size to accommodate future energy needs, rather than current needs, as would be predicted by the ecological constraints hypothesis. No or low production of infants and litters on the smallest lion tamarin ranges in our study supports this new hypothesis. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The coordinated vocal duets of tropical animals often play a role in territorial signalling. Duet timing is dependent upon each animal's attentiveness to its partner and its ability or motivation to cooperate, and therefore precise coordination of duet elements could be an important signal to territorial rivals. We used a playback experiment to test the hypothesis that territorial animals distinguish between highly coordinated duets, poorly coordinated duets and alternating solos. We studied three related species of wrens that show natural variation in the coordination of their male and female songs: banded wrens, Thryophilus pleurostictus, occasionally perform loosely coordinated duets but more commonly sing solo songs; rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, regularly perform loosely coordinated duets; and plain wrens, Cantorchilus modestus, regularly perform highly coordinated duets. We used stereo duet playback to simulate highly coordinated duets, poorly coordinated duets, alternating solos and a heterospecific control. We played back these four treatments to 63 territorial pairs of wrens. Responses to experimental treatments were stronger than responses to control treatments. Response to the three experimental treatments varied among species. Banded wrens responded more strongly to both types of duets than to alternating solos, in terms of closest approach and number of passes over the speaker. Rufous-and-white wrens responded more intensely to alternating solos and coordinated duets than to uncoordinated duets, in terms of closest approach, number of passes over the speaker and number of songs initiated. Plain wrens responded most intensely to alternating solos in terms of closest approach, and no less intensely to alternating solos than to the other treatments in terms of other measures of response. Together, our results indicate that these three species of wrens distinguish between coordinated duets, uncoordinated duets and alternating solos. However, highly coordinated duets do not incite categorically stronger responses than uncoordinated duets or alternating solos in any of these species.

AB The white-throated sparrow is a promising model for behavioural neuroendocrinology and genetics because behaviour and endocrine function may be linked to a chromosomal rearrangement that determines plumage colour. The notion that the two colour morphs, tan-striped (TS) and white-striped (WS), differ predictably in aggression and parenting has been widely accepted, despite conflicting evidence. It is also hypothesized that morph-typic behaviour is hormone-mediated, yet no field study has measured sex steroids and behaviour in the same birds. Here, we re-evaluate the TS and WS phenotypes, describe the conditions under which they differ and investigate relationships between sex steroids and behaviour. We report that (1) during territorial intrusions, WS males were more aggressive than TS birds, but this difference was restricted to singing; WS males sang more than TS males but showed identical levels of physical aggression. WS females sang more than TS females and were also more physically aggressive. (2) TS males provisioned young more frequently than did WS males, but only during first broods. The parental strategy of WS males was flexible, and during replacement broods, WS and TS males provisioned at equal rates. (3) Consistent with previous studies, we detected no morph difference in female provisioning. (4) Plasma testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were higher in WS males than in TS males during periods of peak territorial defence and during first broods; within breeding stages, male androgen levels were positively correlated with singing and negatively correlated with provisioning. Plasma oestradiol levels were higher in WS females than in TS females and higher during peak territorial defence; oestradiol levels tended to be positively correlated with singing. Overall, our results refine the TS and WS phenotypes, show that behavioural differences between them are restricted to periods with relatively high mating opportunity, and demonstrate an association between sex steroids and morphtypic behaviour. These results will inform future studies of this promising model. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cultural variation can be conceptualized in two main ways: as culture-specific qualitative differences in behavioural form, and also as quantitative variation in performance of constellations of universal behaviours (cultural style). Despite observation of both types in wild nonhuman primates, diffusion of qualitative culture has been scrutinized extensively experimentally while within-species transmission of cultural style has remained entirely unexplored. Here we investigated whether a cultural style of high affiliation could be artificially generated in a nonhuman primate (Callithrix jacchus), by daily playback of conspecific affiliative calls simulating nearby amicable individuals. We found that vocalization playback influenced monkeys to spend more time in affiliative behaviours outside playback hours, relative to silent playback. The effect was specific to affiliation, with no impact on other categories of affect. This change did not persist into the final phase of observation after all playbacks were complete. Findings are consistent with a temporary shift in cultural style effected through vocalization playback, supporting existence of this conception of culture in wild primates and indicating auditory social contagion as a potential diffusion mechanism. The method presented here will allow researchers to test hypotheses concerning cultural transmission of cultural style, and the underlying processes, across a range of contexts and species.

AB Among species providing uniparental care, the caring parent faces time constraints and may have to compromise offspring care/protection for self-maintenance. In most mammalian species females raise their offspring without receiving help from males. Communal nesting, when multiple females share a single nest where they rear their pups together, may have evolved as a mutually beneficial cooperative behaviour to reduce mothers' nest attendance without increasing the time their offspring are left alone. We tested this hypothesis using data collected in a free-living house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, population in which reproduction occurred in nestboxes and was closely monitored. Individuals were fitted with transponders allowing automatic recording of their location, and a genetic parentage analysis confirmed maternal identity. Compared with mothers raising their pups solitarily, communally nesting mothers spent less time inside their nest. Their pups, however, were left alone for a similar amount of time as solitarily raised pups. The time communal litters were left alone did not covary with the kinship of communally nesting females. These results indicate that communally nesting mothers can allocate more time to foraging or territorial defence without impairing the amount of maternal attention received by their offspring. Nevertheless, communally nesting mothers showed some overlap in their stays at the nest. Offspring may benefit from more regular meals while mothers may gain information on the partner's contribution to combined maternal care which could potentially prevent cheating.

AB Although marsupials have well-developed olfactory systems and complex scent-marking behaviours, relatively little is known about the actual function of chemical signals in this group of mammals compared to eutherian species. In this study I investigated whether koalas are able to assess the sex and reproductive state of signallers using chemical cues present in urine. Male urine induced more chemosensory investigation by males and oestrous females than female urine, and nonoestrous female koalas displayed an aversion to male urine. When presented with oestrous versus nonoestrous female urine, males but not females displayed a significant investigatory preference for oestrous urine. Taken together these results indicate that koala urine contains chemical cues permitting the discrimination of sex and female oestrous stage. These findings also add to a growing body of literature showing that chemical cues serve to advertise female reproductive state in mammals, and the first clear evidence of this in a marsupial.

AB Although previous studies have shown that many species follow gaze, few have directly compared closely related species, and thus its cross-species variation remains largely unclear. In this study, we compared three great ape species (bonobos, Pan paniscus, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, orang-utans, Pongo abelii) and humans (12-month-olds and adults) in their gaze-following responses to the videos of conspecific and allospecific models. In the video, the model turned his head repeatedly to one of two identical objects. We used a noninvasive eye-tracking technique to measure participants' eye movements, and used both conspecific and allospecific models as stimuli to examine their potential preference in following conspecific rather than allospecific gaze. Experiment 1 presented to great apes the videos of conspecific and human models. We found that all species followed the conspecific gaze. Chimpanzees did not follow the human gaze, whereas bonobos did. Bonobos reacted overall more sensitively than chimpanzees to both conspecific and human gaze. Experiment 2 presented to human infants and adults the videos of human, chimpanzee and orang-utan models. Both infants and adults followed the human gaze. Unlike adults, infants did not follow the ape gaze. Experiment 3 presented to great apes the videos of allospecific ape models. Consistent with experiment 1, chimpanzees did not follow the allospecific ape gaze, whereas bonobos and orang-utans did. Importantly, preferential following of conspecific gaze by chimpanzees (experiment 1) and human infants (experiment 2) was mainly explained by their prolonged viewing of the conspecific face and thus seems to reflect their motivation to attend selectively to the conspecific models. Taken together, we conclude that gaze following is modulated by both subject species and model species in great apes and humans, presumably a reflection of the subjects' intrinsic sensitivity to gaze and also their selective interest in particular models.

AB The payoffs of an individual's behaviour vary with changing environmental conditions. Animals often modify their behaviours according to those environmental conditions (i.e. plasticity), but also retain consistent individual differences across environmental change (i.e. personality). These patterns of behavioural variation are often measured with respect to a single environmental variable, which raises the question of how individuals respond to change in combinations of environmental variables, and whether individual differences in behaviour persist across change in multiple variables. Furthermore, an individual's amount of plasticity in response to a change in one environmental variable may or may not be repeatable across change in a second environmental variable. To answer these questions, we experimentally manipulated combinations of mating, foraging and predation risk to determine their effect on the antipredator behaviour of male Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi. We found that the combination of environmental variables had an interactive effect on antipredator behaviour, but among-individual variation persisted along with within-individual variation in behaviour. The plasticity of squirrels' responses to change in one environmental variable, such as change in antipredator behaviour from high to low predation risk, was repeatable when measured in a mating environment and foraging environment, and vice versa. These results demonstrate patterns of behavioural variation across complex environments such as animals encounter in nature, and point towards the benefit of addressing greater environmental complexity in studies of animal behaviour.

AB Foraging animals must choose between familiar prey and novel prey of uncertain profitability and potential toxicity. Owing to a healthy aversion to potentially dangerous prey, foragers show an initial transient wariness of novel food (neophobia). In addition, some individuals display a much longer period of avoidance before incorporating the novel food into their diet (termed dietary conservatism). There are two stable foraging strategies found within forager populations: (1) adventurous consumers (AC) which rapidly accept novel foods and (2) foragers showing dietary conservatism (DC). The expression of these two strategies may also vary with environmental conditions. We measured the effect of competition on the plasticity of foraging strategies when domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, foraged for familiar and novel coloured crumbs with or without competitor chicks. In addition we investigated the effect of prey detectability on the response of foragers to a competitor, by making the familiar food cryptic or conspicuous. AC birds responded to competition by accepting the novel prey more quickly than when foraging alone, regardless of how hard familiar food was to find. In contrast, DC birds failed to reduce their wariness in response to competition when the competitor's food choice was obscured. The foraging strategies of the birds were thus found to be plastic in their expression, but this plasticity differed between inherently AC and DC individuals. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the foraging strategies of wild and domestic birds.

AB Tandem marking occurs when both members of a pair scent-mark the same location in quick succession. This widespread behaviour, common in canids and monogamous antelopes, is generally believed to be involved in pair bond formation and advertisement. Despite their potential utility in determining tandem mark function, observations of individual contributions to tandem marking within pairs are rare. To this end, we made detailed observations of free-ranging dominant African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus, uncovering differences in the tandem-marking behaviour of pairs depending on their relatedness. In all packs, dominants were more likely to overmark their partner's scent mark than their own, but dominant-initiated scent marks were more likely to become tandem marks in related (full-sibling) pairs than in unrelated pairs. Despite this, females were more frequently on top at the end of marking bouts in related pairs than in unrelated pairs, because females in related pairs were more likely to overmark initial scent marks left by males, and less likely to have their scent marks subsequently overmarked by males. Scent-marking bout length was also significantly longer in related pairs. These differences suggest that advertising the presence of a mated dominant pair may be the main function of tandem marking in African wild dogs, but when mating opportunities are absent within the pack, contributions to tandem marking are altered, with individual advertisement perhaps becoming more important.

AB Sensitivity to the gaze of other individuals has long been a primary focus in sociocognitive research on humans and other animals. Information about where others are looking may often be of adaptive value in social interactions and predator avoidance, but studies across a range of taxa indicate there are substantial differences in the extent to which animals obtain and use information about other individuals' gaze direction. As the literature expands, it is becoming increasingly difficult to make comparisons across taxa as experiments adopt and adjust different methodologies to account for differences between species in their socioecology, sensory systems and possibly also their underlying cognitive mechanisms. Furthermore, as more species are found to exhibit gaze sensitivity, more terminology arises to describe the behaviours. To clarify the field, we propose a restricted nomenclature that defines gaze sensitivity in terms of observable behaviour, independent of the underlying mechanisms. This is particularly useful in nonhuman animal studies where cognitive interpretations are ambiguous. We then describe how socioecological factors may influence whether species will attend to gaze cues, and suggest links between ultimate factors and proximate mechanisms such as cognition and perception. In particular, we argue that variation in sensory systems, such as retinal specializations and the position of the eyes, will determine whether gaze cues ( e. g. head movement) are perceivable during visual fixation. We end by making methodological recommendations on how to apply these variations in socioecology and visual systems to advance the field of gaze research.

AB Recreational hunting can disrupt the population structure or alter the morphology of target populations. More subtly, such hunting may alter the behaviour of individuals in the target population, especially if individuals are culled nonrandomly. We assayed the behavioural temperaments of a sample of hand-reared and released pheasants, Phasianus colchicus. We could place birds on a behavioural continuum between bold or fast and shy or slow. Individual differences could not be explained by sex or mass. Birds were released into the wild and we followed their fate over a single hunting season. Birds that survived the hunting season were shyer or slower as juveniles than the original population mean. Males that died of disease or predation were relatively bold or fast as juveniles, while females dying of disease or predation were relatively shy or slow. Males that were bold or fast as juveniles were shot early in the season compared to females. Unselective hunting can skew the expression of behaviours in released gamebirds. This skew may explain why released birds subsequently fail to reproduce or are especially likely to die of natural causes once the hunting season has finished, and hence why it is difficult to establish wild populations of these species through reintroduction to an area where shooting takes place.

AB Infanticide is a widespread but seldom observed behaviour that has been shown to convey strong selection forces on some social mammals. However, infanticide in nonsocial species is less clearly understood, particularly the evolutionary function of infanticide. Here we present direct and indirect evidence of infanticide in a large, solitary felid, the African leopard, Panthera pardus, and determine its likely causes in light of six explanatory hypotheses. Observed and inferred rates of infanticide for leopards were among the highest recorded for mammalian carnivores, accounting for almost half of juvenile mortality and nearly a third of all offspring. Our results demonstrate that infanticide in leopards is mainly an adaptive behaviour which provides reproductive benefits to perpetrators. Infanticidal males were typically unrelated to their victims, the death of unweaned offspring shortened the interbirth intervals of mothers, and perpetrators increased their chances of mating with and siring the mother's subsequent litter. Female leopards also appear to have developed a profusion of strategies to counter the risk of infanticide, providing further support for the sexual selection hypothesis. Cannibalism may provide some incentive for infanticide (perpetrators usually consumed their victims) but this is probably an added, minor benefit rather than the primary driver for the behaviour. Our findings suggest that infanticide is a key factor shaping the sociospatial ecology of leopards. They also highlight the importance of accounting for functional components of population dynamics when managing large carnivores, particularly for invasive activities that artificially elevate adult male turnover.

AB We examined the effects of soil water content (SWC) on scatter-hoarding decisions of Siberian chipmunks, Tamias sibiricus, when caching acorns of Quercus mongolica. We hypothesized that higher SWC, which favours germination in this and similar oaks, would also be favoured for caching and cache recovery in this rodent. We conducted three sets of experiments: one in small arenas, a second in larger seminatural enclosures, and a third in the field with free-ranging chipmunks in a temperate forest of the Xiaoxing'anling Mountains of northeast China. Siberian chipmunks selectively cached acorns in soil of higher SWC and recovered more observer-made artificial caches where SWC was higher. We argue the selective scatter hoarding in soil of higher SWC represents a form of directed dispersal that may be relatively common in other systems, especially where SWC is unevenly distributed, and further suggest that this may represent an important rodenteseed interaction that varies with climate.

AB Coping styles represent alternative response patterns in reaction to a stressor. The coping style model provides a set of predictions about correlations between behavioural and neurophysiological reactions to a stressful situation. According to this model, high levels of activity should be correlated with high levels of aggressiveness at the behavioural level, and to high sympathetic reactivity, low parasympathetic reactivity (higher heart rate levels) and low hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis reactivity (low production of glucocorticoids in response to a stressor). More recent versions of the model, however, are challenging this view and consider the possibility of independent axes of coping style and stress reactivity. The coping style model has mainly been tested on artificially selected or inbred lines in laboratory settings. Such a situation restricts its generalization to a larger number of species and there is a need for studies testing it in the wild under more natural situations. Here, we test the predictions of the coping style model in a wild alpine marmot, Marmota marmota, population. We show that several behavioural (i.e. exploration in an open field, impulsivity and docility) and neurophysiological traits (i.e. heart rate, breathing rate and cortisol production) assumed to represent individual differences in coping style were significantly repeatable over 2-3 years. Not all the correlations between traits predicted by the coping style model were found in marmots, which supports the more recent two-axes model. Furthermore, most correlations were observed at the between-individual level, and the within-individual correlations (i.e. phenotypic plasticity) were weaker. Overall, our results support the prediction of the coping style model, but highlight the fact that the association between traits found in artificial conditions may be weaker in a more natural setting.

AB The multifaceted courtship display of male satin bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, involves several elements that have been studied in detail. However, one of their most unique display elements, bower painting, has received relatively little attention despite males' large investment of time in this behaviour. Male bowerbirds chew plant material and apply the resulting mixture of masticated vegetation and male saliva or 'bower paint' to a chest-high band inside their bower walls. Searching females taste this paint, suggesting that paint may be a chemosensory signal. We used both behavioural observations and experimental approaches to examine predictions made by two hypotheses for the function of bower paint. We measured natural variation in paint quantity to investigate whether quantity of paint at bowers is related to other male display traits, male mating success and male physical condition. We also investigated whether males and females are affected by experimental removal of bower paint. Additionally, we assessed male response to paint transplants from other individuals. We found a significant correlation between the amount of paint and a composite estimate of several other measures known to indicate bower and decoration display quality. Also, males whose bowers underwent experimental removal of paint had fewer females return for second courtships and copulations than did control males. This result provides the first experimental evidence that females respond to bower paint. These findings establish that bower paint is a trait that affects mate-searching decisions by females and demonstrates that the quantity of bower paint is important in attracting females.

AB Animals exhibit intraspecific variation in foraging behaviour when alternative strategies are likely to fetch greater returns for one individual over another. The mechanisms underlying such variation are often behavioural, physiological or ecological in nature. We studied intraspecific variation in foraging strategies and its possible causes in a population of urban free-ranging dogs by accounting for variables of performance in novel food extraction tasks and responses to perceived threats. When presented with specially made food packets, dogs extracted food using two distinct techniques: 'gap widening' and 'rip opening'. The two techniques were distinguishable also in terms of their qualitative and quantitative attributes, that is, the sophistication of the process and latency in food extraction. Typically, males employed the sophisticated gap-widening technique, which was associated with faster food extraction and lower risk aversion; in contrast, females used the relatively underdeveloped rip-opening technique, which was relatively ineffective and mostly accompanied by active food guarding. Females during pregnancy/lactation behaved similarly to males. Upon exposure to an artificial threat, the performance of the dogs in foraging activities declined as a result of the more frequent usage of the less effective technique. Furthermore, foraging performance was positively related to both fearlessness and sensitivity to perceived threats. We explain these findings through both functional and mechanistic arguments.

AB In social contexts, the ability to recognize and discriminate among individuals is advantageous, because it allows individuals to adjust their behaviour so as to enhance both individual and group fitness. Eusocial insects have finely developed mechanisms of discrimination that promote many kinds of social interactions, but discrimination may also be adaptive in noneusocial species, including solitary ones. Physical traits such as reproductive status influence rates of aggression and discrimination, permitting individuals to share common resources and nesting sites and to cooperatively care for offspring, while excluding potential aggressors or social parasites. In this study, we examined reproductive aggression and nestmate recognition in a subsocial species of small carpenter bee, Ceratina calcarata, using circle tube behavioural assays. Not only does this subsocial bee show nestmate recognition, but there is seasonal variation in aggression that correlates with seasonal variation in reproductive status, illustrating that both aggressive behaviour and the consequences of nestmate recognition are context dependent. Females that were actively reproductive (ovaries fully developed) were more aggressive than prereproductive (ovaries undeveloped) or post-reproductive females (ovaries resorbed). Females altered their behaviour when interacting with nestmates versus non-nestmates. As in most social Hymenoptera, agonistic behaviour was observed to be greatest between unfamiliar, reproductively active individuals. However, post-reproductive females were tolerant towards unfamiliar females. During the natural adult cohabitation phase of the nesting cycle (the mature brood phase), mothers were aggressive towards daughters, whereas same generation pairs of nestmates or non-nestmates showed no signs of aggression. These results indicate that this subsocial bee species does possess the ability to recognize nestmates but the consequences of recognition vary seasonally, sometimes resulting in greater aggression towards nestmates than towards non-nestmates.

AB Sexual conflict can lead to individuals evolving behaviours to circumvent preferences of the opposite sex. For example, females have been shown to adjust their behaviours depending on the risk of sexual harassment. In the present study we investigated the effects of sexual harassment in sailfin mollies, Poecilia latipinna, on both females and males depending on the level of male presence to which they were exposed. We exposed females to four levels of male presence (which we assumed to be correlated with intensity of sexual harassment): (1) no harassment (four females); (2) low male presence (one male with three females); (3) moderate male presence (two males with two females); and (4) high male presence (three males with one female). We measured sexual harassment as male sexual behaviours received by the females. The cost of sexual harassment on both males and females was measured as the overall change in body condition after being exposed to a particular treatment. There were three major results. (1) Sexual harassment caused a decrease in male body condition; this is one of the first studies to examine the cost of sexual harassment for males. (2) There are direct negative effects of sexual harassment on female fitness. (3) Male sexual behaviours are not additive, suggesting that there is some nonlinear relationship between the number of males in a population and the degree of harassment females are subjected to. We demonstrate that the social environment can have a direct effect on the body condition of the individuals within that particular environment.

AB A cannibal has to weigh the benefits of the consumption and removal of competing conspecifics against the potential loss of fitness through filial cannibalism. We examined the role of the presence of conspecific females in informing adaptive cannibalism decisions. Females of the hemipteran bug Geocoris pallens express low egg cannibalism when alone but become much more cannibalistic in the presence of conspecific females and do not discriminate between their own eggs and those of other females. Experimentation showed that females that could not commit filial cannibalism exhibited strong egg cannibalism that was not reduced by the presence of conspecific females, whereas females that could commit filial cannibalism were very cannibalistic only in the presence of conspecifics. An experiment also showed that the presence of conspecific females triggered a stronger egg cannibalism response in G. pallens than did a heterospecific egg predator. These results suggest that G. pallens females become cannibalistic in the presence of conspecifics because they interpret conspecific presence primarily as an indication of decreased likelihood of committing filial cannibalism, and less so as an indication of lower expected survival of eggs or future resource competition. Our study highlights the importance of informational cues, in this case the presence of conspecifics, in modulating the expression of cannibalism.

AB Social learning, whereby animals learn from others, mediates the spread of information through social networks. To make this process adaptive, animals should be selective with respect to when and whom to copy. The cost of decision making can be curbed by cognitive biases favouring particular categories of individuals. Such model biases are well documented, but few, if any, experimental studies have addressed potential developmental causes of this variation. We therefore tested whether and how the postnatal environment affected social-learning preferences in a known social learner the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. Birds from experimentally manipulated brood sizes, a treatment known to affect adult phenotypic quality in this species, were tested in an established observer-demonstrator paradigm. Naive observers could watch unfamiliar same-sex conspecifics feed from differently coloured novel feeders. When subsequently allowed to choose between identical feeders, postnatal conditions (=rearing brood size) had strong effects on who copied whom in adulthood: males preferred the feeders of demonstrators from large brood sizes, females those of demonstrators from brood sizes matching their own, suggesting stratified information transfer within foraging groups. Our results demonstrate how individuals' developmental history can explain substantial interindividual variation in model biases and ensuing structured information transfer within groups.

AB Researchers have struggled to obtain a clear account of the evolution of prosocial behaviour despite a great deal of recent effort. The aim of this review is to take a brief step back from addressing the question of evolutionary origins of prosocial behaviour in order to identify contextual factors that are contributing to variation in the expression of prosocial behaviour and hindering progress towards identifying phylogenetic patterns. Most available data come from the Primate Order, and the choice of contextual factors to consider was informed by theory and practice, including the nature of the relationship between the potential donor and recipient, the communicative behaviour of the recipients, and features of the prosocial task including whether rewards are visible and whether the prosocial choice creates an inequity between actors. Conclusions are drawn about the facilitating or inhibiting impact of each of these factors on the expression of prosocial behaviour, and areas for future research are highlighted. Acknowledging the impact of these contextual features on the expression of prosocial behaviours should stimulate new research into the proximate mechanisms that drive these effects, yield experimental designs that better control for potential influences on prosocial expression, and ultimately allow progress towards reconstructing the evolutionary origins of prosocial behaviour.

AB Robbing and dodging is a well-documented food protective behaviour in rats. Recently, we demonstrated that a simple cybernetic rule, gaining and maintaining a preferred interanimal distance, can account for much of the variability in dodging by rats. In this paper, the field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, was used to test whether or not the same or similar cybernetic rules are used by animals of different lineages and body plans. Pairs of female crickets were tested in a circular arena with a clear glass surface. A small food pellet was given to one of the crickets and the attempts to rob the food by the other were videotaped from beneath. The results show that, although crickets, unlike rats, use a variety of defensive strategies, all of the cases in which they use evasion to protect a portable food item conform to the same cybernetic rules used by rats.

AB The ability to differentiate between kin and nonkin is of importance in nepotistic as well as in mate choice contexts. Phenotype matching is a significant kin recognition mechanism, which is widespread in animals. However, the underlying proximate mechanisms are still poorly understood. Phenotype matching can be based on either self-reference or familial imprinting. We investigated phenotype matching in juvenile Pelvicachromis taeniatus based on chemical cues. Pelvicachromis taeniatus is a socially monogamous cichlid fish with biparental brood care. Previous studies indicate that the adults use phenotype matching to recognize kin. Juvenile fish were reared under three different conditions to manipulate recognition templates: (1) reared with kin, (2) reared in isolation or (3) reared with foster siblings. Pelvicachromis pulcher families served as foster families. In the experiments, test fish had to choose between olfactory cues obtained from two stimulus shoals differing in relatedness to the test fish. Test fish reared with kin discriminated unfamiliar kin from unfamiliar nonkin indicating that juvenile P. taeniatus also use phenotype matching to recognize kin. Focal fish reared in isolation or with foster siblings did not significantly discriminate unfamiliar kin from unfamiliar nonkin suggesting that juveniles did not imprint on their own phenotypic traits. However, individuals reared with foster siblings preferred unfamiliar olfactory stimuli of the foster species over those of their own indicating they used rearing partners as reference. Thus, phenotype matching is probably based on familial imprinting rather than self-reference in juvenile P. taeniatus. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sexual signals are often diagnostic of closely related species, and their taxonomic value at higher phylogenetic levels is often discussed. Complex signals such as birdsong are potentially rich in information regarding evolutionary history. However, natural or sexual selection, if pervasive enough, might distort that information. This has seldom been evaluated. We tested how ecological effects impact on the phylogenetic information of birdsong using a real case of flawed taxonomy: the reciprocal polyphyly of the genera Serinus and Carduelis. Major axes (principal components) of between-species song variation were not related to body size or habitat type. The main axis of song variation, reflecting syllable complexity and song length, was related to ecological indexes of sexual selection (latitude and ecological breadth), resulting in a positive latitudinal gradient in song elaboration. Song significantly supported monophyly over polyphyly for these genera, despite some song data having high phylogenetic signal (relative to the correct, polyphyletic phylogeny). Thus, the presence of high phylogenetic signal did not guarantee reliable taxonomic information at the genus level. The misleading phylogenetic information appears related to the latitudinal gradient in song elaboration plus the traditional Serinus and Carduelis spp. differing in latitude. We conclude that selection, in this case sexual selection, can pervasively distort the phylogenetic information even of complex and potentially information-rich signals.

AB Juvenile cuttlefish spontaneously prefer shrimp to crabs. This preference can be changed by early visual learning during embryonic and postembryonic life and has been related to a form of food imprinting. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether generalization occurs in conjunction with this early learning process. We found that inexperienced hatchling cuttlefish preferred 'black' to 'white crab' for their first meal, the black ink envelope of cuttlefish eggs did not prevent embryos discriminating between black and white crabs and embryonic or postembryonic visual familiarization to 'white crabs' induced a subsequent visual preference for 'white crabs' over 'black crabs' in the hatchling's first meal. Finally, juvenile cuttlefish previously pre- or postnatally exposed to 'white crabs' preferred 'black crabs' to shrimp, indicating for the first time that prey generalization occurs as early as the embryonic stages in cuttlefish. Such cognitive abilities could confer important adaptive advantages in processing information about prey likely to be available in the egg-laying environment at hatching and in the course of juvenile dispersal.

AB The magnitude of behavioural adjustments by prey in response to predation risk is constrained by the necessity to maintain resource acquisition. In systems with high predation risk, prey display adjustments that can challenge resource acquisition. In such cases, prey may be limited in their ability to adjust their behaviour further in response to additional risk, such as that posed by human hunters (hunting risk). We investigated whether large African herbivores adjust their behaviour in response to hunting risk. In Hwange National Park (HNP), Zimbabwe, and in the peripheral hunting areas (HA), we monitored behaviour of impala, Aepyceros melampus, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, and sable antelope, Hippotragus niger, at waterholes. Once groups entered waterhole areas, their probability of returning to vegetation cover without drinking was higher in HA than in HNP. Individuals were more vigilant in HA than in HNP when they were approaching and leaving waterholes, but not during drinking. This suggests that drinking was prioritized over vigilance once individuals reached waterholes. The time that groups spent in waterhole areas did not differ significantly between HA and HNP, but individuals in HA were more vigilant, suggesting that groups limited their exposure to hunters. Greater kudus were the most vigilant, probably because they are the most vulnerable to predators. Sable antelopes were the least prone to compromise the acquisition of surface water. Both species consequently displayed adjustments of lower magnitude than impala in response to hunting risk. Our multispecies study illustrates how vulnerability to natural predators and environmental constraints limit behavioural responses of large herbivores to hunting risk.

AB When a prey animal displays to a predator, the prey benefits because it is less likely to be attacked, and the predator benefits because it can break off an attack that is unlikely to succeed because the prey has been alerted. We argue that an 'I see you' signal has coevolved between the Asian hive bee, Apis cerana, and its hornet predator, Vespa velutina. When a hornet approaches a bee colony, guards perform a shaking movement that repels the hornet. To test whether this is an 'I see you' display, we exposed colonies to free-flying and tethered hornets and tethered butterflies. The intensity of the shaking was correlated with the hornet's proximity, whereas guard bees barely responded to a nonthreatening butterfly. The signal is likely to be honest, because the bees can kill the hornet by collective mobbing if it lands on the entrance. The Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, which has not evolved in the presence of Asian hornets, does not produce the signal and is ineffective at killing hornets by collective mobbing. We also found that hornets were more successful at catching A. mellifera than A. cerana bees at the hive entrance. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB For the majority of social species, group composition is dynamic, and individuals are interconnected in a heterogeneous social network. Social network structure has far-reaching implications for the ecology of individuals and populations. However, we have little understanding of how ecological variables shape this structure. We used a long-term data set (1984-2007) to examine the relationship between food availability and social network structure in the endangered southern resident killer whales. During the summer months individuals in this population feed primarily on chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, which show annual variation in abundance. We tested the hypothesis that temporal variation in chinook salmon will correlate with variation in social network structure. Using a null model that controlled for population demography, group size and sampling effort, we found a significant relationship between the connectivity of the social network and salmon abundance, with a more interconnected social network in years of high salmon abundance. Our results demonstrate that resource availability may be an important determinant of social network structure. Given the central importance of the social network for population processes such as the maintenance of cooperation and the transmission of information and disease, a change in social network structure caused by a change in food availability may have significant ecological and evolutionary consequences.

TI Learning in the context of sexual behaviour and danger in female and

AB Learning in the context of mate choice is important because it can influence sexual selection and incipient speciation. While fruit flies (Drosophila spp.) have been a key model system for research on sexual selection, speciation and learning, much of the research on fruit fly learning in the context of sexual behaviour has focused on males even though females typically control mating decisions. In a series of experiments, we found no evidence that early experience with either only conspecific males or both conspecific and heterospecific males affected the frequency of heterospecific matings by female Drosophila pseudoobscura. We conducted further experiments to place our results in perspective. First, we tested whether heterospecific matings do not induce female unreceptivity and thus have little cost, in which case learning would be of little benefit. Contrary to our prediction, we found that females that had initially mated heterospecifically remated conspecifically at a lower frequency than females that had first mated conspecifically. Second, we replicated earlier data indicating that male D. pseudoobscura that are rejected by heterospecific females later selectively reduce courtship of heterospecific females. Finally, we tested whether females can learn as well as males in a nonsexual context involving learning to avoid odours associated with danger and found similar learning scores in females and males. Our results indicate that, in spite of the potential benefits from learning in the context of mate choice and possessing a good learning ability in another domain, female D. pseudoobscura either do not learn about potential mates or such learning is not as robust as it is in the males.

AB Although discrete morphological castes are a rarity in animal societies, trait differences among group constituents are pervasive and can have similar effects on group function. Spider societies lack discrete morphological castes, but colony constituents can differ along any number of trait axes (e. g. body size). Here we tested for consistent individual differences in social tendency in five tropical spider species (genus Anelosimus). We further determined the extent to which social tendency is correlated with other aspects of an individual's behaviour that might reflect division of labour within colonies. We found that all five species showed repeatable within-species variation in social tendency, and increased social tendency was correlated with reduced aggressiveness towards prey and diminished boldness towards an aversive stimulus (i.e. test species shared a similar 'behavioural syndrome' of aggressiveness/sociality). Furthermore, colonies of some species (e.g. Anelosimus eximius, Anelosimus oritoyacu) appeared to be composed of varying proportions of two 'behavioural types', whereas other species (Anelosimus domingo, Anelosimus guacamayos) showed a more continuous distribution of trait values. Interestingly, irrespective of species, we detected a negative relationship between the frequency of aggressive colony constituents and group size, where larger colonies tended to have fewer aggressive females. Our results indicate that (1) the majority of social Anelosimus show similar within-species behavioural variation and syndromes, and (2) colony size either mediates the expression/development of individuals' behavioural types, or is regulated by the frequency of behavioural types.

AB Auditory memory is crucial for mate recognition in birds and for long-term maintenance of pair bonds in monogamous species. Parrots, unlike the majority of birds, can imitate sounds into adulthood. During pair bond formation, male budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, which are monogamous parrots, imitate the calls of females. This imitation results in convergence of the two calls. We examined whether and how long the auditory memory of a mate's call affects female behaviour in relation to pair bond maintenance in this vocally plastic species. Females were paired with a male and then separated, without auditory/visual stimulation from the mate. Females responded to the calls of their separated mates, which had been recorded prior to pair formation, significantly more than to a call from an unfamiliar male. These females continued to show a preference for their respective mates' calls at 1 and 2 months after separation, demonstrating that the auditory memory of the mate's call was retained for at least 1 month in the absence of stimulation from the mate. These results show that long-term auditory memory mediates the preferential response to a mate's call in female budgerigars. However, females ceased to prefer their mates' calls after 6 months of separation, indicating that the preference response of females is eventually extinguished. We discuss the possibility that the extinction of the preferential response may be explained by an underlying mechanism other than the decay of auditory memory.

AB Lateralized behaviour refers to a preference for using a specific limb or direction of movement that is consistent across events. We investigated apparent lateralized behaviour in North Atlantic humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, in the southern Gulf of Maine using digital acoustic tag ('DTAG') technology to analyse feeding behaviours during 2004-2009. An ideal tool to examine lateralized behaviours, DTAGs allowed continuous measurements of whale depth, heading, pitch and roll throughout the attachment period (less than 24 h). Side preference (right or left) in rolling behaviours (e. g. bottom rolling and side lunging) and directional preference (clockwise or anticlockwise) in feeding behaviours such as looping and spiraling were determined from visual examination of DTAG data. A 'handedness index' (HI) was used to quantify side bias and strength of preference. We found a population-level right-side bias similar to the 90/10 right-hand bias in humans. Furthermore, photos of jaw scuffing and direct tag data on rolling behaviour were used to assign a bottom-rolling side preference for 11 individuals for whom both of these data were available, 10 (90.9%) of which demonstrated a right-side bias. Consistent laterality was observed between individuals that performed bottom rolling and directional feeding behaviours, which was biased in the right/clockwise direction. Younger individuals tended to show weaker lateralization scores than older individuals, even among adults (P - 0.048), suggesting that lateralization develops, and continues to do so, beyond sexual maturity.

AB Life history theory views parental effort as a dynamic response to current productivity benefits and personal survival costs. Classical provisioning models specific to avian cooperative breeding systems predict that nestling starvation caused by local food limitation will induce helped parents to maintain their effort to ensure fledging success. Yet, food shortages may impose such a high provisioning cost that selection favours parents that lighten their workload at the expense of offspring productivity. We tested this alternative prediction with the ground tit, Parus humilis, which is an insectivorous, facultative cooperative breeder; helpers are mostly philopatric male offspring. Our study was based on data from three breeding seasons over which rainfall, and hence food resources, varied greatly. Total amount of food delivered to the young was highest for group-fed broods in food-rich environments, although helped male and female parents invested less than their counterparts with no helpers, and provisioning rate of the latter in both types of environmental conditions was similar to that of group-fed broods in food-poor environments. The variation in care level was mirrored by the observed pattern of partial brood loss, the single largest cause limiting productivity. The lowered effort in association with increased brood reduction under poor foraging conditions suggests ground tit parents with helpers trade future fitness against current reproduction to cope with harsh, unpredictable environments. This finding broadens our understanding of interspecific variability of parental response to the presence of helpers across ecological gradients.

AB Animal colour patterns are among the most striking examples of biological diversity. Elaborate coloration is thought to play a role in mate choice within populations and to pose a barrier to interbreeding between species, with individuals preferring the coloration of conspecifics. Ideally, the importance of coloration as a reproductive barrier would be tested by holding all traits constant and manipulating only colour to test its effect. In butterflies, researchers use paper models to manipulate female colour patterns and show strong male preference for conspecific female coloration. In African cichlids and poison frogs, researchers manipulate the light environment to test the importance of male colour in female preference for conspecifics. Here we use motorized models to test whether females in a pair of sexually dimorphic fish species (genus: Etheostoma) prefer conspecific over heterospecific male coloration. By isolating and manipulating specific components of male coloration, we show that females of both species significantly prefer conspecific male colour (red versus green) and pattern (stripe versus bars). These results provide strong evidence that female preference for conspecific male nuptial coloration may play a critical role in behavioural isolation.

AB Conspecifics that individuals encounter while foraging can provide a rich source of information about resource quality and levels of competition in the environment. Social learning theory predicts that animals should respond to cues from those individuals that provide the most reliable information. In this study, we explored the effect of the reproductive state and behaviour of individual sources of information on the behavioural and physiological reproductive decisions of the walnut-infesting fruit fly, Rhagoletis suavis. We demonstrate that female flies held in the presence of reliable sources of information about resource quality and/or level of local competition (reproductively active females) mature and lay eggs more readily than those in the presence of unreliable information sources (reproductively inactive females). The occurrence of such sophisticated use of social information in a nonsocial insect indicates its potential ubiquity and importance in the ecology and evolution of populations.

AB Recent evidence strongly suggests that natural selection can favour the evolution of consistent individual differences in behaviour ('personalities'). Indeed, personality shows heritable variation and has been linked to fitness in many species. However, the fitness effects of personality are highly variable within and between species. Furthermore, the nature of the causal influence of personality on an organism's fitness remains unclear so far. Competition has been proposed as a factor modulating this relationship. Thus, personality has been found to affect individual success in competition by interference in a few species, but its influence in scramble competition remains unexplored. We assessed exploratory tendencies (thought to be a key component of personality) in a model species, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. In a first session, we formed foraging flocks composed of four individuals with different exploration scores, and allowed them to play producer-scrounger games repeatedly. During a second session, individuals were reassigned to different flocks to check for consistency in the influence of exploratory tendency across different social contexts. Exploratory tendency influenced individual feeding success during the first session but not during the second one. High-exploratory birds were less successful at finding food (i.e. playing the producer tactic) and consequently had a lower feeding success, but were presumably able to adjust their behaviour between sessions. We discuss our results in relation to the interactive effects of both personality and experience, and highlight the role of competition processes on the evolution of personality.

AB Play has long been identified as a potential welfare indicator because it often disappears when animals are under fitness challenge and because it is thought to be accompanied by a pleasurable emotional experience. But animal play is a vexing behavioural phenomenon, characteristically flexible and variable within and between species, with its proximate mechanisms and ultimate functions still not fully understood. Its relationship to animal welfare is therefore complex and merits a focused theoretical investigation. We review evidence on four aspects of the play-welfare relationship: first, that play indicates the absence of fitness threats; second, that play acts as a reward and flags up the presence of opioid-mediated pleasurable emotional experiences; third, that play brings immediate psychological benefits and long-term fitness and health benefits, and thus improves current and future welfare; and finally, that play is socially contagious and therefore capable of spreading good welfare in groups. On this basis, we argue that play does indeed hold promise as a welfare indicator and also as a tool to improve it; but we also point to difficulties in its study and interpretation, and identify some unresolved questions. As a welfare indicator, play may signal both the absence of bad welfare and the presence of good welfare, thus covering a wide range of the welfare spectrum. However, play can also increase in stressful situations, in response to reduced parental care, or as a rebound after a period of deprivation and therefore does not consistently reflect favourable environmental conditions. A better fundamental understanding is needed of the varied ultimate functions and proximate mechanisms of play, and the species-specific play patterns of captive animals, in order to be able to explain exactly what an animal's play behaviour tells us about its welfare state, and whether and how play might be applied as a tool to improve welfare.

AB We identify some of the possibilities and limitations of human swarm intelligence (SI) using the response of the public to two types of cognitive problems. Furthermore, we propose a simple measure for the quantification of collective information that could form the basis for SI in study populations for specific tasks. Our three main results are (1) that the potential benefits of SI depend on the type of problem, (2) that individual performance and collective performance can be uncorrelated and that a group of individually high performers can be outcompeted by a same-size group of individually low performers, and (3) that adding diversity to a group can be more beneficial than adding expertise. Our results question the emphasis that societies and organizations can put on individual performance to the detriment of diversity as far as teams are concerned. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that while diversity is a necessary condition for effective SI, diversity alone is clearly not sufficient. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of our findings for the evolution of group composition and the maintenance of personality diversity in animals.

AB Recently, there has been much interest in the role of endogenous and maternal hormones as regulators of offspring begging and mediators of parent-offspring conflict. Here, we review recent work in this field, and identify inconsistencies in the literature. We find good evidence that hormones play a role as regulators of begging: 13 studies report a positive effect on begging and six a negative effect. There is also good evidence that hormones influence offspring fitness, but the direction of reported effects is inconsistent: eight studies report a positive effect on offspring fitness and 10 a negative effect. We explore potential pathways linking hormonal effects on begging and growth. We find that our current understanding of these pathways is incomplete, and suggest a simple model linking hormonal effects on begging and growth. We next discuss the role of hormones as mediators of parent-offspring conflict. We find little evidence that maternal hormones provide a mechanism for parental favouritism. We use graphical models to explore the hypothesis that maternal hormones act as honest signals, and find that costs of hormone production can ensure the honesty of maternal hormones but only under very restricted conditions. We discuss evidence from recent cross-fostering experiments suggesting that maternal hormones act in the context of overlapping interests between parents and offspring. Finally, we highlight the need for more studies on nonavian taxa to establish whether hormonal regulation of begging is specific to birds or general across taxa where offspring beg for food from their parents.

AB Predation is a major selective force for the evolution of behavioural characteristics of prey. Predation among consumers competing for food is termed intraguild predation (IGP). From the perspective of individual prey, IGP differs from classical predation in the likelihood of occurrence because IG prey is usually more rarely encountered and less profitable because it is more difficult to handle than classical prey. It is not known whether IGP is a sufficiently strong force to evolve interspecific threat sensitivity in antipredation behaviours, as is known from classical predation, and if so whether such behaviours are innate or learned. We examined interspecific threat sensitivity in antipredation in a guild of predatory mite species differing in adaptation to the shared spider mite prey (i.e. Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseiulus californicus and Amblyseius andersoni). We first ranked the players in this guild according to the IGP risk posed to each other: A. andersoni was the strongest IG predator; P. persimilis was the weakest. Then, we assessed the influence of relative IGP risk and experience on maternal strategies to reduce offspring IGP risk: A. andersoni was insensitive to IGP risk. Threat sensitivity in oviposition site selection was induced by experience in P. persimilis but occurred independently of experience in N. californicus. Irrespective of experience, P. persimilis laid fewer eggs in choice situations with the high- rather than low-risk IG predator. Our study suggests that, similar to classical predation, IGP may select for sophisticated innate and learned interspecific threat-sensitive antipredation responses. We argue that such responses may promote the coexistence of IG predators and prey. (c) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are the most sophisticated tool-users among all nonhuman primates. From an evolutionary perspective, it is therefore puzzling that the tool use behaviour of their closest living primate relative, the bonobo, Pan paniscus, has been described as particularly poor. However, only a small number of bonobo groups have been studied in the wild and only over comparably short periods. Here, we show that captive bonobos and chimpanzees are equally diverse tool-users inmost contexts. Our observations illustrate that tool use in bonobos can be highly complex and no different from what has been described for chimpanzees. The only major difference in the chimpanzee and bonobo data was that bonobos of all age-sex classes used tools in a play context, a possible manifestation of their neotenous nature. We also found that female bonobos displayed a larger range of tool use behaviours than males, a pattern previously described for chimpanzees but not for other great apes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the female-biased tool use evolved prior to the split between bonobos and chimpanzees. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Guereza colobus monkeys, Colobus guereza, produce acoustically conspicuous vocalizations, the roars, in response to their main predators, leopards, Panthera pardus, and crowned eagles, Stephanoaetus coronatus. Roaring alarm utterances generally consist of the same basic call types but differ in overall structural composition. Leopards trigger roaring alarms containing many roaring sequences of only a few calls each, while eagles trigger few sequences with many calls each. To investigate whether conspecifics extract meaning from these structural differences, we played back leopard and eagle alarm call sequences and compared the monkeys' responses in terms of their locomotor, gaze and vocal behaviour with their responses to the corresponding predator vocalizations. Locomotor responses did not differ between playback conditions; movement was always towards the simulated caller with no clear patterns in the vertical plane. Gaze direction, however, was highly predator specific. When hearing leopard-related stimuli, monkeys were significantly more likely to scan the area beneath them than when hearing eagle-related stimuli, which caused more scanning above. Vocal response rates to conspecific alarms were generally low but comparable with rates to the corresponding predators. If monkeys called, however, they produced the matching call sequences. Overall, our results showed that Guerezas discriminated between predator alarm call sequences produced by unfamiliar conspecifics and responded to them in predator-specific ways. Since the sequences were composed of the same basic call types, we concluded that the monkeys attended to the compositional aspects of these utterances.

AB The study of interactions between phytophagous insects and their host plants extends beyond understanding how insects deal with plant chemical defences. Sexual behaviour of these herbivores is integrated in several ways with host plants, as the latter influence timing and location of reproduction, and can provide clues for finding mates. Nevertheless, while numerous studies link butterfly evolution to host plant adaptations, the influence of plants on butterfly sexual behaviour has been little studied. We conducted experiments to determine the role of host plant cues in mate-searching behaviour of Heliconius charithonia butterflies. This species exhibits precopulatory mate guarding behaviour, wherein males find and perch on pupae, then copulate with eclosing females ('pupal mating'). We found that males (1) visited plants damaged by feeding larvae more often than they visited undamaged plants and (2) displayed searching behaviour around the plant and in front of larvae, suggesting that odours signal the location of potential partners (pupae). Although males were attracted to common plant odours released after tissue damage, plants damaged by heterospecific butterfly larvae were less attractive, indicating that species recognition can occur at early life stages. Overall, our results suggest that host plants influence mate-searching behaviour of Heliconius. This might also be true for other species of butterflies with more conventional mating strategies, potentially contributing to the diversification of this group of phytophagous insects.

AB Wild bearded capuchin monkeys, Cebus libidinosus, use stone tools to crack palm nuts to obtain the kernel. In five experiments, we gave 10 monkeys from one wild group of bearded capuchins a choice of two nuts differing in resistance and size and/or two manufactured stones of the same shape, volume and composition but different mass. Monkeys consistently selected the nut that was easier to crack and the heavier stone. When choosing between two stones differing in mass by a ratio of 1.3:1, monkeys frequently touched the stones or tapped them with their fingers or with a nut. They showed these behaviours more frequently before making their first selection of a stone than afterward. These results suggest that capuchins discriminate between nuts and between stones, selecting materials that allow them to crack nuts with fewer strikes, and generate exploratory behaviours to discriminate stones of varying mass. In the final experiment, humans effectively discriminated the mass of stones using the same tapping and handling behaviours as capuchins. Capuchins explore objects in ways that allow them to perceive invariant properties (e.g. mass) of objects, enabling selection of objects for specific uses. We predict that species that use tools will generate behaviours that reveal invariant properties of objects such as mass; species that do not use tools are less likely to explore objects in this way. The precision with which individuals can judge invariant properties may differ considerably, and this also should predict prevalence of tool use across species.

AB Behavioural decisions involving foraging, mate choice and habitat selection are complex and difficult to evaluate experimentally. Web abandonment by orb spiders is a complex decision that is experimentally tractable. For females of the golden orb spider, Nephila clavipes, the web is a microhabitat that serves as a prey capture device, a mating site and a habitat for parasites. Thus, the web embodies the complexity of a bird territory or mammal home range, but is spatially compact and amenable to experimental manipulation. We used both field census data and field experimental manipulations to address the importance of prey capture rate, kleptoparasite load and male presence for web tenure (the time spent at a web site) in both mature and immature female N. clavipes. No factor explained variation in web tenure for immature females, although census data suggested that increased kleptoparasite load decreased web tenure. For mature females, increased male presence decreased web tenure, while increased prey capture rate, condition and body size all increased web tenure. Web tenure also decreased over the course of the season. Females integrate multiple cues to make web movement decisions. One of these cues is male presence, which detracts from the quality of a web site, suggesting that mate harassment might affect females' web movement decisions. Insight into this seemingly simple behaviour contributes to a growing understanding of how and when animals integrate multiple cues into behavioural decisions.

AB A number of species are considered to use functionally referential signals such as alarm calls or food-related vocalizations. However, this particular function of communicative interaction has not previously been found in canids. We provide the first experimental indication that domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, rely on context-dependent signals during interspecific agonistic encounters. We recorded several sequences of growls from dogs in three different contexts: during play, guarding a bone from another dog, and reacting to a threatening stranger. We analysed the acoustic structure of the growls and additionally performed playback tests in a seminatural food-guarding situation. We found that play growls differed acoustically from the other two (agonistic) types of growls, mainly in their fundamental frequencies and formant dispersions. Results of the playback experiment showed that food-guarding growls deterred other dogs from taking away a seemingly unattended bone more effectively than growls recorded in the threatening stranger situation. We ruled out an effect of the signaller's body weight on the subjects' responses. These results provide the first evidence of context specificity of agonistic vocalizations in the dog. We discuss the possible aspects of honesty and deception through acoustic modulation of growls. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Females of many animal species select dominant males as mates but their ability to detect the male's hierarchical status remains poorly understood. Previously, we found that females of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii eavesdrop on two fighting males before choosing the winner. Here, we asked whether eavesdropping females use vision together with smell to do so and whether their preference for the winner relies on a form of individual, rather than on status, recognition. When tested in a two-way choice paradigm, a bystander female visited the dominant first rather than the subordinate male, remained in his proximity for longer, and interacted with him more frequently. However, this happened only when she was offered the same individuals she had previously watched and smelled. This suggests that females recognize the winners as individuals and not as generic dominants, thus revealing unusual discrimination abilities in an invertebrate.

AB Living in large societies involves costs associated with high density of individuals, but being near others includes the benefit of access to conspecifics' information. High densities of workers in ant colonies impose traffic congestion costs on foraging trails. It has been postulated that crowding also increases foraging efficiency by facilitating information transfer between workers in head-on encounters. However, this hypothesis remains untested. Here we assessed, in 24 field nests of the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes, whether head-on encounters between workers facilitate information transfer about trail condition, orientation and food. Several experimental manipulations failed to fit predictions of certain types of communication. (1) Trail disturbance (and thus potential need for information transfer) did not affect the rate of head-on encounters, (2) head-on encounters did not decrease the time required for laden ants to properly orient when entering a trail, and (3) ants that had been experimentally disoriented did not increase the number of head-on encounters when they returned to the trail. Nevertheless, one experiment strongly suggested information acquisition: (4) outbound ants were more likely to find and collect food after a head-on encounter with an ant carrying the same kind of food. These results do not support the hypotheses that workers exchange information about trail condition and orientation in head-on encounters, but suggest that workers acquire food information. The information transferred in head-on encounters could thus increase foraging efficiency under crowded conditions. The cost of the reduced speed due to worker collisions might be outweighed by the benefits of information acquisition, and could explain why leaf-cutting ants do not form distinct lanes of outbound and returning workers. Our results reinforce the key role of information use in the adaptive behaviour of animals and in the maintenance of group living. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The captive zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, has become one of the key vertebrate model systems for studying a range of behavioural, physiological and neurological phenomena. In particular, this species has played a key role in developing our understanding of sexual selection and sperm competition. In contrast with the large number of studies using domesticated zebra finches, relatively few studies have focused on free-living populations of wild zebra finches. Investigating the incidence of extrapair paternity in zebra finches in the Australian desert, we found a very low level; 1.7% of 316 offspring from four of 80 broods fathered outside the pair bond. These numbers contrast with the high levels of extrapair paternity observed in domesticated aviary populations, and suggest a low level of sperm competition and sexual selection in natural populations. Our finding of such a low rate of extrapair paternity in the wild zebra finch suggests that it is one of the most genetically monogamous of all passerine species and that has important implications for future studies of this model organism in studies of sexual selection and reproductive biology. In addition, we found that 5.4% of 316 offspring were not related to either putative parent and hatched from eggs that had been dumped by intraspecific brood parasites.

AB In group-living animals where dominance hierarchies occur, aggression can be reduced if individuals are able to recognize each other. To do this, and to adapt their behaviour suitably when faced with a rival, individuals may rely on two nonmutually exclusive recognition means: they could recognize group members individually and/or their social status. Within insect societies, although conflicts over reproduction resulting in hierarchy establishment are widespread, relatively little is known about the cognitive abilities involved in the regulation of agonistic interactions. We tested whether low-ranking workers of Pachycondyla apicalis ants are able to discriminate each other individually and/or if they can discriminate the status of their nestmates. We found no evidence of individual discrimination among subordinates whereas they were able to discriminate their nestmates on the basis of their social and reproductive status. Such a skill may allow them to regulate worker reproduction in queenright colonies efficiently. By considering the structure of the hierarchy and the nature of the dominance relationships in P. apicalis societies, we discuss the existence of a more accurate recognition system among the high-ranking workers.

AB The size of an individual's home range is an important feature, influencing reproduction and survival, but it can vary considerably among both populations and individuals. The factors accounting for such variation are still poorly understood, and comprehensive long-term field studies considering various environmental factors that influence home range size are rare. We investigated the effects of seasonality, availability of food, cover, number of direct neighbours and the relative individual body mass on home range sizes in 125 adult female striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in South Africa from 2004 to 2008. We used radiotelemetry to estimate home range sizes, trapping to determine the number of direct neighbours, and plant surveys in every home range to determine availability of food and cover. Home ranges were smaller when food quantity was high, many territorial neighbours were present, females had a relatively small body mass and during the nonbreeding season. We conclude that the availability of food resources and intraspecific competition are the main factors influencing home range size in female striped mice. Females enlarged their home ranges when territorial neighbours were few, and there was a significant positive correlation between home range size and quantity of food plants. This indicates that home range size might not reflect the minimal trade-off between access to resources that allow for a female's survival and lowest cost for defending and foraging in that area. Instead, we propose a hypothesis for future research that female striped mice occupy areas several times larger than needed to improve their fitness by providing resources for future offspring.

AB In social groups, the replacement of the breeder may generate conflicts. In eusocial hymenoptera these can occur between queens, between queens and workers, or between workers. We investigated queen replacement in the Mediterranean ant Aphaenogaster senilis, a monogynous (one queen per colony) species that reproduces exclusively by colony fission. We first investigated the potential for worker nepotism by analysing the sociogenetic structure in 31 colonies using microsatellite markers. No polyandry was detected, which eliminates the possibility of worker nepotism. Second, 30 colonies were experimentally orphaned to analyse the production of gynes (unmated, hopeful queens). Workers reared on average two gynes from the previous queen's diploid brood, with the firstborn gyne emerging on average 17 days before the other, supernumerary, gyne(s). The production of only a few gynes severely limits the potential for gyne selection based on quality criteria. Furthermore, such selection would be biased by the asynchrony of gyne emergence which precludes comparing gynes of the same age and maturity. Behavioural observations showed that gynes interacted aggressively and that the firstborn gyne was always dominant. She usually survived while supernumerary gynes seldom did, even though they did not differ in weight. Workers also attacked gynes, and preferentially targeted supernumerary gynes. We propose that supernumerary gynes are produced as insurance in the eventuality of the death of the firstborn gyne, and that the delay between the emergence of gynes minimizes the risk that aggressive interactions between gynes will lead to all gynes being killed.

AB When two or more females rear their young in a common nest or burrow (communal nesting), mothers may be challenged to direct care to their own offspring. In a laboratory study on degus, Octodon degus, a communally nesting South American caviomorph rodent, we used a radionuclide (phorphorus-32) to track milk transfer from mothers to their young in nests occupied by two mothers and their litters. Co-nesting pairs consisted of either two unrelated mothers or two sisters. We analysed faecal samples from 2-week-old and 4-week-old young to learn whether mothers would nurse discriminately, favouring their own offspring over their co-nesting partner's offspring. Mothers housed in unrelated pairs nursed their own 2-week-old offspring preferentially (although not exclusively) compared with their co-nesting partner's offspring, whereas mothers housed with a sister nursed indiscriminately, delivering roughly equal amounts of milk to their own offspring and their nieces and nephews. Faecal analyses from 4-week-old young revealed that mothers may nurse co-nesting young indiscriminately, transferring similar amounts of milk to both types of young, regardless of the relatedness of their co-nesting partner. We propose that discriminative nursing as a function of relatedness between co-nesting female degus may be an adaptation to communal nesting when mothers share a burrow that contains many young of different degrees of relatedness.

AB Although there have been numerous studies on the effects of mating history on mating behaviour, few studies have reported the relationship between mating history and other contextual behaviours such as foraging and predator avoidance. We examined the effect of mating history on death-feigning behaviour (an antipredator behaviour) in the sweetpotato weevil. Because mating behaviour can be divided into phases, we examined the effects of encounters with the opposite sex, copulation and insemination success on death-feigning behaviour. For females after copulation and males after multiple copulations the duration of death-feigning behaviour was reduced, whereas encounters with the opposite sex had no effect. Insemination success did not affect the duration of death feigning in males, but inseminated females reduced the duration of death feigning. We discuss the implications of these results for the effect of mating history on this antipredator behaviour. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Kinship often influences social interactions, such that animals behave more amicably towards close kin than towards distant kin or unrelated individuals. However, competition also may affect interactions among kin and the degree of sociality in a population. I used microsatellite DNA markers and behavioural observations to examine effects of kinship on social interactions among woodchucks, Marmota monax, which generally are considered asocial or aggressive. Rates of agonistic interactions did not change with relatedness, but rates of amicable interactions increased with increasing relatedness. I observed more amicable interactions than expected between mother-offspring and littermate sibling dyads, but I observed fewer amicable interactions between nonlittermate siblings and more distant kin. Instances of physical aggression were less frequent than expected in mother-offspring, nonlittermate siblings and distant kin dyads, but more frequent than expected among littermate siblings. Interactions between mother-offspring dyads also changed with offspring age, with mothers behaving more amicably towards younger offspring and more agonistically towards older offspring, especially females. Among littermate siblings, rates of amicable interactions were highest between juveniles and yearlings, but then decreased between adult siblings. Social interactions reflected a balance between cooperation and competition. Although woodchucks in this population lived near kin and biased interactions based on kinship, many interactions were agonistic, and animals did not show greater degrees of sociality. Ecological factors, such as predation risk, resource distribution and climate, may favour solitary living in this population. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many studies show that prey should not flee immediately from approaching predators, but should adjust their fleeing distance to minimize flight costs. We explored a new scenario where an ambush predator appears close to a relatively cryptic prey, that the predator has not yet detected. Then, instead of approaching further, the predator stops and starts looking for prey from a vantage point, while maintaining a constant distance with the still undetected prey. Probability of detection of prey will increase with time of searching. We predicted that prey should wait before escaping until the time ('fleeing time') when the risk of being detected, which depends on prey conspicuousness, equals fleeing costs. We tested this prediction in the field by simulating an ambush predator and examining escape decisions of rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, considering two risk levels (i.e. the predator has or does not have information on the prey location) and relative conspicuousness of lizards (i.e. differences in coloration and body size). Lizards fled after some time, even if the distance between predator and prey remained constant and an attack had not been launched, probably because risk of being detected increases with time. However, to minimize fleeing costs, lizards modulated their fleeing times depending on probability of being detected (related to colour conspicuousness differences) and on size-dependent escape performance. Nevertheless, conspicuousness seemed unimportant after the predator had acquired information on the location of a prey, and/or the predator was considered as more dangerous because it had previously attacked the prey.

AB Like most animals, honeybees, Apis mellifera, possess a suite of antipredatory adaptations used to defend their colony against intruders and to avoid flowers associated with predation risk. Honeybees also possess a remarkable ability to communicate the direction, distance and relative profitability of flower patches to hivemates using the well-studied waggle dance. Here we show that honeybees returning from foraging on dangerous flowers are less likely to perform the waggle dance and engage in fewer waggle runs than foragers returning from equally rewarding, safe flowers. Our results indicate that experienced foragers effectively steer naive recruits away from dangerous flowers and raise interesting questions as to how information about the reward and risk properties of patches are integrated into the waggle dance.

AB In biparental species, the response of parents when their mates are disadvantaged is highly variable. Moreover, experimental studies on parental effort have mainly focused on short-lived birds whose breeding constraints largely differ from those of long-lived species such as seabirds. We investigated the short-and long-term consequences of handicapping one parent within Adelie penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae, pairs. We also examined whether handicapped mates and offspring could convey cues informing the other parent of the need to increase breeding effort and whether this parent adjusted its behaviour accordingly. While handicapped penguins foraged for longer and lost more mass than controls, partners, fasting for longer at the nest, did not change their behaviour or lose more mass suggesting that they compensated at least for themselves. Information exchange was increased between mates after the return of handicapped females from foraging. However, partner males did not respond to this. Handicapped-pair chicks, which were smaller than control chicks, did not increase their solicitation rate for food. In the subsequent breeding season, compared to controls, 40% of previously handicapped females laid fewer eggs, the resight rate of previously handicapped males was lower and pair instability was higher. No additional cues seemed to be detected by Adelie penguins when their mates were handicapped and, for handicapped-pair offspring, the cost associated wih a higher solicitation rate was probably too high for these small chicks to support. Consequently, we found no compensatory behaviour from partners in this long-lived species: handicapped individuals and offspring both supported the whole additional cost in both the short term and the long term.

AB Geese are often seen as one of nature's best examples of monogamous relationships, and many social pairs stay together for life. However, when parents and young are screened genetically, some chicks do not match their social parents. Although this has often been explained as adoption of foreign young after hatching, conspecific nest parasitism is another possibility. We used nondestructive egg albumen sampling and protein fingerprinting to estimate the frequency and success of nest parasitism in a Baltic Sea population of barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis. Among the 86 nests for which we had the most complete information, 36% were parasitized, and 12% of the eggs were parasitic. Almost 80% of the parasitic eggs were laid after the host began incubation. Hatching of these eggs was limited to the few cases where the host female incubated longer than normally because her own eggs failed to hatch. Conspecific nest parasitism in this population therefore seems mainly to be an alternative reproductive tactic of lower fitness than normal nesting. Comparison with DNA pro. ling of chicks (with 10-14 microsatellites) and other evidence confirmed the suitability of protein fingerprinting for analysis of nest parasitism. It can often provide more data than microsatellites, if eggs are albumen-sampled soon after being laid, before most losses occur. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The evolution of premating isolation via divergence in mating behaviour has been strongly implicated in the process of speciation. Timema walking-sticks show weak to moderate reproductive isolation between populations of the same species on different host plants, and high levels of isolation between species. In this paper we conducted experimental studies of within-species and between-species mating behaviour in Timema to address two central issues pertaining to the influence of behaviour on speciation: ( 1) how divergence in courtship influences reproductive isolation within and between species, and ( 2) whether the same or different traits mediate premating isolation within and between species. Mating behaviour involves three phases: pairing ( whereby the male climbs onto the female's dorsal surface), courtship ( which involves leg and antenna waving), and copulation. We found that courtship was qualitatively similar across the genus, but there were statistically significant quantitative differences in leg and antenna waving frequencies between Timema species. However, no-choice trials within and between species showed that discrimination within species is a function of whether males will court females after pairing, while discrimination between species is a function of whether males and females will pair. Because in both cases mate discrimination occurs before courtship is performed, we infer that courtship does not directly influence reproductive isolation in Timema. Moreover, because within-species and between-species discrimination take place at different stages in the mating sequence, intraspecific mate discrimination and species recognition appear to represent distinct processes. These findings suggest that, at least in Timema, speciation may involve the accumulation or replacement of mate discrimination mechanisms used within species.

AB In resource defence mating systems, males monopolize a resource that is of primary importance for breeding females. For secondary cavity nesters, the availability of suitable nesting sites is important in determining the strength of intrasexual competition, whereby phenotypic and behavioural traits will be favoured that enable individuals to gain access to these sites. The traits that are important in male competition may additionally affect mate choice decisions and a female's investment in the current brood. In a field study on blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, we increased intrasexual competition by experimentally limiting nest sites in experimental plots and compared these plots to control plots. Birds breeding in experimental plots did not differ phenotypically from birds in control plots. However, females that bred in the nest site-limited plots fed their offspring at a higher rate than control females. This result indicates that increased competition for limited resources led to more investment in current reproduction, either because successful females were of higher intrinsic quality or because they adjusted their investment in relation to superior territory or male characteristics.

AB Natal dispersal is often attributed to inbreeding avoidance, competition for resources or competition for mates, but the patterns and frequency of dispersal vary considerably among and even within species. We examined the possible reasons for dispersal and philopatry of natal nulliparous female mountain gorillas, Gorilla gorilla beringei, in the Virunga volcano region, including comparisons with non-natal and/or parous females. Competition among females is generally weak and ineffective in this population, and inbreeding avoidance has been considered the ultimate cause of natal dispersal. Yet fewer than half of nulliparous females left their natal group when the dominant male was old enough to be their father, so they did not rely entirely upon dispersal to avoid such risk of inbreeding. Almost all natal nulliparous females were with at least one sexually active male who was not old enough to be their father, so the presence or absence of such mating alternatives also did not determine whether they left. Natal nulliparous females were more likely to leave groups with only one adult male, where infanticide losses have been higher than in multimale groups. Thus natal dispersal seemed to be influenced by infanticide avoidance, which has been considered the ultimate cause of secondary dispersal. Natal nulliparous females have more time to encounter suitable destinations than other females, which may be a proximate reason why they were more likely to transfer despite having the same ultimate cause of dispersal.

AB In laboratory studies, hamsters (Mesocricetus spp.) show intense male-male aggression, thus making them an excellent model system for studies of the functional and mechanistic bases of aggression. In a field study of golden hamsters, M. auratus, in the wild, however, the few documented male - male interactions were not highly aggressive. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that familiarity modulates aggression in hamsters. Previous investigations of the effects of familiarity on aggression have mostly involved familiarization of unfamiliar individuals through agonistic interactions. Here we allowed male Turkish hamsters, M. brandti, to become familiar with each other by housing them together but separated by a wire-mesh partition (thus 'nonagonistic' familiarity). We found that although nonagonistic familiarity did not decrease investigation of the familiar male, it did decrease the occurrence of fights, the number of fights and the percentage of time fighting; it also increased the latency to fight. These results are consistent with the 'dear enemy' hypothesis, which proposes that males are less aggressive towards familiar neighbours than they are towards unfamiliar conspecifics because previous interactions provide enough information about the other individual to render severe aggression unnecessary. Most importantly, our results suggest that information gained about other individuals through nonagonistic interactions decreases the frequency and intensity of fights with those individuals. We conclude that results from laboratory studies on aggression that do not consider the kind of social interactions that individuals have in nature should be interpreted with caution.

AB Behavioural field observations are increasingly being used in ecotoxicological research to identify potential adverse effects of exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs). We investigated thermal conditions inside the nest and parental behaviour of glaucous gulls, Larus hyperboreus, breeding in the Norwegian Arctic in relation to the concentrations of major classes of POPs (organochlorines, brominated flame retardants and metabolically derived products) accumulated in their blood. Most notably, nest temperature was negatively correlated with the concentrations of the sum of (Sigma) DDT, Sigma PCB and several quantitatively minor POP classes within the incubating parent. To investigate the relationship between incubation ability and parental POP exposure further, we experimentally increased the costs of incubation by artificially increasing the clutch size from two to four eggs. Clutch enlargement was followed by a decrease in nest temperature, but this drop in temperature was not associated with POP concentrations within the incubating parent. However, males, which had higher POP concentrations and lower white blood cell counts than females, seemed less able to maintain nest temperature. There was virtually no evidence to suggest that Sigma PCB or Sigma DDT were associated with changes in the time a bird spent incubating. However, there was some indication that nest site attendance by nonincubating males was negatively related to Sigma DDT, suggesting that nest protection may have been compromised. The results suggest that adverse effects of parental POP exposure may occur through suboptimal thermal conditions for embryo development and possibly increased egg predation risk.

AB Methods for quantifying mating systems have been debated for over 30 years. Existing quanti. cation methods rely on inequality indexes, producing a single number from a vector of data for all females or males in a population. Such methods do not account for interactions between members of the two sexes because they do not use the natural matrix (dyadic) structure of the data, where each matrix entry reflects how often a given pair of individuals mated or how many offspring they produced. These inequality indexes also suffer from being a function of population size. Here, we propose mutual entropy as a way to account for the matrix structure, along with a normalization that makes this index independent of population size, thereby robustly quantifying the continuum between monogamy and polygyny/polyandry. Normalized mutual entropy: (1) is a measure of diversity, so it can serve as an upper bound for sexual selection and (2) can accommodate hermaphrodites and self-fertilizing individuals. Normalized mutual entropy thereby provides a measure of mating systems, promiscuity, inbreeding and social cohesion. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Why some bird species have evolved elaborate song repertoires has puzzled biologists for a long time. According to the antiexhaustion hypothesis avian song type repertoires have evolved because switching between different songs, involving different patterns of muscle contractions, causes less exhaustion in the singer and thus allows a higher song rate to be maintained. Although it is a classic explanation referred to in many textbooks, this hypothesis is still the subject of debate. We investigated the antiexhaustion idea in the chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs, a species in which males may have only one song type or a repertoire of up to six types. We analysed the song delivery rates of 101 male chaffinches, taking into account various seasonal, ecological and social variables. We found that males with a repertoire of several song types did not sing at a higher rate than males with only one song type, even though single song type males produced longer songs on average. Also, repertoire birds singing at high rates did not switch song types more often. These findings indicate that song type switching is not necessary for the maintenance of high song rates in this species. We conclude that preventing motor fatigue was not important in the evolution of chaffinch song type repertoires. Thus other factors, such as direct sexual selection of repertoire size or the use of song type repertoires for vocal interactions, are much more likely to explain why many bird species have evolved a repertoire of several song types.

AB Frequent copulation is assumed to be an important male reproductive strategy for paternity assurance in species with female sexual promiscuity. However, the empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis is limited. We examined copulation behaviour in relation to within-pair paternity in the socially monogamous tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor, a passerine bird species with frequent copulation, a lack of mate guarding and high levels of extrapair paternity. We found that the frequency of within-pair copulation attempts increased and peaked just before the appearance of the first egg. A marked drop in the frequency of copulation attempts was observed once the first egg was laid. Furthermore, the frequency of successful within-pair copulations was highly repeatable for particular pairs within the 3 days prior to appearance of the first egg. Finally, males that obtained a higher number of successful within-pair copulations during this time also sired a larger proportion of the offspring in their own brood. Our findings suggest that frequent copulations just before the start of egg laying is an adaptation to decrease the risk of being cuckolded in the presence of sperm competition, and thus provide empirical support for the paternity assurance hypothesis.

AB Cerebral lateralization, the preferential use of one hemisphere of the brain to perform certain cognitive functions, is a widespread and evolutionarily ancient adaptation. Lateralization appears to enhance cognitive capacity, yet substantial individual variation in the strength cerebral lateralization is apparent in all species studied so far. It is puzzling that cerebral lateralization, a seemingly advantageous trait, has not been driven to fixation. It has been suggested that variation in lateralization may be linked to individual variation in behaviour, which itself may be subject to disruptive selection. We examined the relation between cerebral lateralization and individual variation in boldness in the convict cichlid, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus. We show that convict cichlids that are more strongly lateralized when exploring a familiar environment, but not a novel one, are quicker to emerge from a shelter in a test for boldness. The possibility that cerebral lateralization is linked to life history strategy is discussed. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To maximize transmission in noisy environments, vocalizing animals have evolved capacities to avoid the masking effects of biotic and abiotic sound sources, such as changing the structure and timing of acoustic signals. Here we explore this problem from a new angle, asking whether animals can extract predictive acoustic cues from an intermittently noisy environment and use this information to guide the timing of their vocalizations. In a series of experiments, we presented cottontop tamarins, Saguinus oedipus, with loud noise interrupted by speech syllables and silence. The silences were either long enough to accommodate the full length of their species-specific contact calls or too short. The task, in brief, was for tamarins to pick out the acoustic cues predicting long versus short gaps of silence, and to time their vocalizations to follow cues associated with long gaps. Consistently, and across all subjects tested, tamarins were able to extract the acoustic cues predicting the long gaps, using them to call in the long gaps and consequently, avoiding both the energetic and masking costs of calling in noise. We discuss these findings and the potential applications of this technique to broader questions of pattern recognition and the flexible use of vocal signals in a noisy environment.

AB Male rats, Rattus norvegicus, typically outperform females in tests of spatial cognition. However, as stress affects cognition differently in the two sexes, performance differences may be an artefact of stress. Rats face at least two sources of stress during an experiment: the test situation (acute) and housing conditions (chronic, e. g. isolation). We used a task (the Morris water maze, MWM) that allowed testing of both spatial working and reference memory to investigate whether chronic stress (isolation housing) and/or acute stress (the task) has a differential impact on spatial cognition in male and female albino rats. Irrespective of age at the onset of isolation housing, isolated rats were not spatially impaired relative to pair-housed rats. However, the acute stress of the task led to adult males apparently outperforming adult females: adult females took longer to reach the platform than did males because they spent more time in thigmotaxis (swimming close to the wall) during testing. In juvenile rats, the stress caused by swimming in the MWM resulted in both males and females being highly thigmotactic and no sex difference in performance. We conclude that stress can lead to apparent differences between the sexes in performance on a spatial cognition task. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although shedding a leg may save an individual's life, it may lower its subsequent fitness by decreasing its ability to obtain food, increasing its vulnerability to predators, or lowering its success in reproduction. We studied the effects of leg loss on common locomotory tasks and activity levels in adult male crab spiders Misumena vatia. Over three field seasons approximately 30% of adult males lost one or more legs, usually among their four large anterior legs. Although M. vatia do not build webs, they use their front legs extensively to traverse lines, their most important means of movement. Field-captured males missing one or more legs moved 38% more slowly across lines and 28% more slowly on surfaces than intact males. Since males must hunt to find unmated females, this reduced mobility suggests a significant fitness cost for males that have lost legs. However, a set of males with experimentally autotomized legs moved as rapidly on lines as intact males. Since individuals that lost a limb in the field weighed significantly less than intact individuals of the same size (carapace width), adjusting for leg mass, the slow rates of movement on lines by the field-caught individuals missing a leg probably resulted from poor body condition, rather than a loss of dexterity. Most studies have explained potential loss in fitness from losing a leg as a direct consequence of leg loss, seldom invoking indirect effects. The potential for leg loss to reduce fitness via impacts on body condition warrants further attention, for it could play an important role in cost of autonomy.

AB Optimality models exist for diving endotherms, but are rarely tested with behavioural data or used to estimate oxygen reserves. We used a model for avian divers to study the extreme diving performances of blue-eyed shags. Time-depth recorders were deployed on 15 breeding Kerguelen shags, Phalacrocorax verrucosus. The shags regularly dived deeper than 100 m and longer than their behavioural aerobic dive limit (4 min). The dive duration to postdive interval ratio peaked for dives lasting 1 min, the dive time theoretically necessary to deplete oxygen reserves from the respiratory tract. Most dive parameters of the Kerguelen shag converged with those known for the Crozet shag, Phalacrocorax melanogenis. Yet, whereas the distribution of dive durations matched optimal breathing for the Crozet shag (shallow diving), this was not true for the Kerguelen shag which made mostly deep dives. Thus, regardless of how similar the physiologies of blue-eyed shag species may be, they can adapt their diving behaviour to different environmental conditions, in this case resource distribution. From the model, the volume of body oxygen reserves for blue-eyed shags was calculated as 264 ml/kg, which is significantly higher than values found in the literature for avian divers. The volume of the respiratory tract obtained with the model (830 ml), however, was realistic. We suggest the model overestimated body oxygen stores because blue-eyed shags have numerous means for reducing their deep-diving metabolism, such as bradycardia, hypothermia or anaerobic metabolism.

AB Each autumn, large numbers of red admirals migrate throughout northern Europe,flying south, to reach areas with conditions suitable for surviving the winter. We observed the visible butterfly migration at Falsterbo peninsula, the southwesternmost point in Sweden, where red admirals are seen most autumns. ying towards the Danish coast on their way to more southern parts of Europe. Weather parameters from a local weather station were used to analyse what factors are important for red admiral migration across the sea. Wind direction was among the important weather variables affecting the initiation of the migratory departure; most other studies of butterfly migration reported no large effect of wind direction. This difference is probably because the butterflies in our study were about to cross open sea for more than 20 km, whereas most previous studies were from inland locations where butterflies could avoid wind effects by. ying close to the ground or on the lee side of topographical features. Other important weather variables affecting red admiral migration at Falsterbo were low wind speed and clear skies. The flight direction at Falsterbo was towards the west, which is in contrast to the southward direction generally reported during autumn migration in this species. This is probably because the red admirals followed both the local topography and the closest route to land on the other side and therefore deviated from the normally preferred direction to minimize flight over open water.

AB Although theory exists concerning the types of strategies that should be used in contests over resources, empirical work explicitly testing its predictions is relatively rare. We investigated male fighting strategies in two nonpollinating. g wasp species associated with Ficus rubiginosa figs. In Sycoscapter sp. A, males did not assess each other before or during fights over mating opportunities. Instead,fights continued until the loser reached an energetic cost threshold that was positively correlated with its body size (fighting ability) and retreated. In Philotrypesis sp. B, pre fight assessment was indicated, with males attacking competitively inferior rivals to remove them from the competitor pool ( they then continued to do so until they reached a cost threshold that was again positively correlated with body size). Using data on species ecology, we discuss our findings with respect to theory on when different fighting strategies should evolve. We argue that the type of strategy used by a. g wasp species is determined by its relative benefits in terms of inclusive fitness. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Affiliative relationship formation in nonhuman primates is influenced by kinship, rank and sex, but these factors do not fully explain observed variation in primate social relations. Individual differences in temperament have a number of important behavioural and physiological correlates that might influence relationship formation. We observed 57 yearling rhesus macaques at the California National Primate Research Center for 10 weeks to determine whether individual differences in temperament relate to the number and quality of affiliative relationships formed with peers. Subjects' temperament characteristics had previously been quantified during a colony-wide biobehavioural assessment when subjects were 90-120 days of age. Yearlings that had scored high on equability ( showed calmness and low levels of physical activity) as infants had fewer peer relationships than yearlings that had scored low on this dimension. In addition, yearlings preferentially affiliated with peers that had similar equability and adaptability scores ( reflecting the degree of behavioural flexibility that subjects displayed during the biobehavioural assessment). Although kinship, rank and sex influenced relationship formation as expected, temperament remained a significant predictor of affiliative preferences even after controlling for these variables. Our findings suggest that temperament is a proximate determinant of variation in affiliative relationship formation in group-living primates.

AB Mutually reinforcing hormone-behaviour relationships may drive temporal changes in steroid hormone levels and vocal effort in anuran amphibians. Recent models propose that chorus activity stimulates the production of androgens in signallers and receivers, thereby mediating an increase in vocal effort. The energetic demands associated with high vocal effort should, in turn, elevate circulating corticosterone levels to promote the mobilization of energy reserves. High threshold corticosterone levels, however, are expected to negatively affect androgen levels and, hence, vocal effort. Steroid hormone levels and vocal effort are thus expected to be low at the onset of chorus activity, increase over sequential nights of calling until peak levels are reached, and subsequently decline; energy reserves should show inverse temporal trends. To test these predictions, we examined temporal changes in androgen (dihydrotestosterone and testosterone) levels, corticosterone levels, vocal effort and body condition in Woodhouse's toads, Bufo woodhousii. Contrary to model predictions, androgen levels, vocal effort and body condition remained relatively unchanged and circulating corticosterone levels tended to decrease within and across nights of chorus activity. Furthermore, although vocal effort was not correlated with circulating androgen levels, it was positively correlated with circulating corticosterone levels, supporting the prediction that high vocal effort promotes the production of corticosterone. Yet despite this correlation, poor body condition was not associated with high corticosterone levels, suggesting that factors other than energetic state influence corticosterone levels in B. woodhousii. We discuss alternative hypotheses regarding relationships among the measured parameters in this explosive-breeding species. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Whether animal signals convey honest information is a central evolutionary question, since selection pressures could, in some circumstances, favour dishonesty. A prior study of signalling in hermit crabs proposed that the cheliped extension display of Pagurus bernhardus might represent such an instance of dishonesty. A limitation of this conclusion, however, was that honesty was defined in the context of size assessment, neglecting the potential information that displays might transmit about signallers' variable internal states. Recent analyses of signalling in this same species have shown that its displays provide reliable information about the amount of risk crabs are prepared to tolerate, which therefore might enable signallers to use these displays to honestly convey their motivation to take such risks. Here we test this 'honest advertisement of motivation' hypothesis by varying crabs' need for food and analysing their signalling during simulated feeding conflicts against a model. When crabs were starved for 1-5 days, they dropped significantly in weight. Despite this decrement in resource-holding potential and energy reserves, crabs were more likely to perform cheliped extension displays the longer they were food deprived. Longer-starved crabs, whose subjective resource value was greater, also displayed at a higher rate and were more likely to risk seizing the food from the model. We conclude that cheliped extension is a reliable indicator of crabs' internal state and suggest how this honest signal might operate in conflicts over a variety of other resources in addition to food. We propose that future studies detecting apparent dishonesty should analyse many possible signal-state correlations before concluding a signal is actually dishonest.

AB Female copulation calls have been viewed as being addressed to the mating partner, to ensure male protection and mate guarding or, alternatively, to other males, to incite male competition. In a previous study, we found that copulation calls of female Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus; given during ejaculatory matings differed from those given during nonejaculatory matings and hence provided potential information about mating outcome to listeners. In this playback study, we tested whether this variation is salient to male listeners. In addition, we assessed the influence of cues from other modalities that are related to female receptivity on male responses to copulation calls. The study was conducted on Barbary macaques living in the enclosure 'La Foret des Singes', at Rocamadour, France. Males responded more rapidly and more strongly, and spent more time walking and in the vicinity of females, after playbacks of calls given during ejaculatory copulations than after those given during nonejaculatory copulations. Responses, however, were not influenced by the cycle stage of the female whose calls were played back. The results suggest that male Barbary macaques appear to discount contextual information in favour of information related to mating outcome when allocating their mating effort.

AB In mating systems research it is often ignored that the spatial relationship between individuals adopting alternative mating tactics may influence the intensity of their interactions and therefore also their tactical payoffs. I here take a novel approach to investigating the coexistence of lek territoriality and resource territoriality in male topi antelopes by including territorial distance from a lek centre as a continuous variable. Using the body size of territory holders as a proxy for territorial payoffs, I show that the attractive force of lek centres impact negatively on payoffs from surrounding territories only within an 1800 m radius. Thus, lek males are significantly larger than resource defenders inside, but not outside, this impact zone. The impact zones encompass the ranges during oestrus of 91% of the females mating on leks, and because female topi are highly promiscuous, the impact zone corresponds roughly to the area within which resource territorial males experience sperm competition with lek males. These results can be explained by a preference of oestrous females for mating with central males inside, but not outside, the 1800 m zone. The study illustrates how taking spatiality into account can reveal significant differences in tactical payoffs within behavioural categories that are traditionally regarded as uniform.

Whereas the foraging behaviour of lactating females is well studied, very little is known about males. We tracked 14 adult males during a period when they are observed around South Georgia to compare their behaviour with that of 41 lactating females tracked from the same island. There was significant spatial segregation between the sexes in both the horizontal and the vertical dimensions. Female fur seals foraged near the surface, mostly at night, concentrating their efforts at the shelf break and in deeper off-shelf waters. Males foraged closer to the breeding beaches and their time at sea was concentrated in waters over the continental shelf. Males dived significantly deeper and longer and spent longer in the bottom phase of a dive than females. Females dived mostly at night, whereas males dived much more during the day and overall had greater variability in their behaviour within a trip. Sex was a better predictor of dive durations than mass when depth was considered. Categorizing dives into three types showed that males often foraged on or near the bottom, a behaviour not observed in females. We suggest that body size dimorphism causes sexual differences in foraging behaviour (e.g. dive depth, duration, etc.) but how this is manifested (i.e. trip distance, foraging location) is dependent on the local environment and the related prey resources.

AB The evolution and maintenance of multiple mating in females (polyandry) is an adaptive puzzle since females typically obtain all the resources they need from males in only one or a few matings. Females should therefore limit superfluous copulations to avoid the well-documented costs of mating. Previous studies have tended to focus on the maintenance of polyandry, and have examined the wide range of costs and benefits to females of multiple mating in species with varying levels of polyandry. There is much less empirical work charting the evolution of female mating behaviour and the origins of the polyandry trait itself. We investigated a potential increase of female remating rate in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. We screened the mating and remating rates of females from 20 strains, 18 of which were collected from the same locality across 3 years and varied in the number of generations that they had spent in the laboratory. Females from strains that had spent longer in the laboratory were increasingly likely to be polyandrous, confirming a previous study based on one laboratory strain. Experimental crosses between strains at opposite ends of the spectrum for time spent in the laboratory showed that heritable changes in the females were predominantly responsible for the change in mating behaviour, as males did not appear to influence the likelihood of a female remating.

AB Most seabirds form groups on land and at sea, but there is little information whether seabird groups are formed deliberately or randomly. We investigated whether little penguins formed groups composed of the same individuals when they crossed the beach each day over four breeding seasons (2001-2004) using an automated penguin monitoring system (APMS). We used an association matrix to determine the number of times any two birds crossed the APMS in the same group. The number of these group associations or 'synchronized parade' behaviour was determined for every possible pair of individuals, giving a total association value for each pair of birds during the postguard stage of the reproductive cycle. We concluded that a penguin group was composed of 5-10 individuals within 40-s intervals. Penguin groups were formed nonrandomly in years of high breeding success (2002 and 2003), but not in years of low breeding success (2001 and 2004). Age of birds was a significant factor in composition of groups. Little penguins with higher association values shared similar characteristics or 'quality', which in turn may increase the functional efficiency of their groups, especially if they are also foraging together. However, low association indices indicated that seeking the same associates was not a priority. It is costly for any animal to synchronize their attendance with the same individuals, so it could be beneficial to display synchronized parade behaviour in good breeding years but it could result in intraspecific competition for food during poor breeding years.

AB Delayed plumage maturation (DPM) of young mates in sexually dichromatic birds has been explained under the female mimicry hypothesis (FMH) or the subordination signalling hypothesis (SbSH), among other adaptive ideas proposed. In this study, we tested in the Eurasian kestrel, Falco tinnunculus, the predicted sexual deception and aggressiveness under the FMH and SbSH to explain DPM in birds. We analysed aggressive and courtship behaviour of breeding males and females in the presence of adult male, adult female and 1-year-old male natural decoys. We designed two different treatments: one presenting un-moulted 1-year-old males and a second presenting partly moulted 1-year-old males, as observed in nature. Males attacked adult male decoys more frequently than 1-year-old male and female decoys in both moulted and un-moulted treatments and no sexual displays were observed. Females were more aggressive towards female and I-year-old male decoys as compared to male decoys in the un-moulted treatment. In the moulted treatment, females were more aggressive towards female decoys as compared to both male decoys. In addition, females solicited copulas from moulted, but not from un-moulted, 1-year-old male decoys. Our results suggest that FMH can be a mechanism which explains DPM in un-moulted 1-year-old males. However, when they show moulted plumage (more than 80% in the studied population during the spring), the SbSH seems to be the mechanism that better explains sexual and agonistic behaviour from adults towards 1-year-old males.

AB To identify the mechanisms of control of temporal schedule of nocturnal migratory fights in small songbirds in nature, we studied the time of departure in a medium-distance nocturnal migrant, the European robin, on the Courish Spit ( southeastern Baltic coast) using radiotelemetry. Exact measurements of departure time in 100 birds ( 58 in autumn and 42 in spring) showed no fixed time window of nocturnal departures during Evening Nautical Twilight. Take-offs occurred throughout the night and even during Morning Astronomical and Nautical Twilight Periods. Departure time showed no significant difference between clear skies and overcast conditions, and significantly differed between the seasons. The median departure time shifted significantly towards sunset during shorter nights in spring as compared to autumn. In both seasons (1) European robins initiating fight after short (1-2 days) stopovers showed no significant differences in departure time between individuals with small and large fuel stores at arrival; and ( 2) departure time was significantly related to stopover duration: the longer the birds stayed, the earlier they departed in relation to sunset. Only in spring and after longest stopovers, all departures occurred within a short time window soon after sunset.

AB Little is known about the role of specific acoustic cues in mammal vocal communication systems. In the current study, we used resynthesized male red deer roars in a habituation-discrimination paradigm to determine whether female red deer are sensitive to shifts in formant frequencies corresponding to the natural variation between the vocal tract lengths of a small and large adult red deer male. Hinds habituated to a given size variant showed a significant dishabituation when they were presented with roars in which the formants had been modified to simulate the other size variant. The signficant reduction in behavioural response to final rehabituation playback showed this was not a chance rebound in response levels. Our results suggest that formants are salient for red deer hinds and that hinds can detect a shift in formant frequencies that may have biological significance. We discuss the possible functions of formant perception in female red deer and more generally in nonhuman mammals.

AB In cooperatively breeding vertebrates, helpers commonly vary in how much care they provide. We investigated whether meerkat, Suricata suricatta, pups responded to variation in helper feeding rates by associating with the most productive helpers preferentially throughout the period of pup care. Helpers varied widely in how much food they provided, and pup food intake increased with the time spent in exclusive association with productive helpers. Pups spent more time following productive helpers than poor helpers, and we confirmed the causality of this finding by conducting long-term feeding experiments which increased helper productivity and showed that pups spent significantly more time with helpers whose feeding rate had been experimentally raised. Pups aggressively defended helpers from approaches by litter-mates, but there was no evidence that pups defended productive helpers more strongly, or that larger pups were more likely to gain exclusive access to the most productive helpers. Our results provide evidence that, by associating with particular helpers, meerkat pups can influence how much care they receive during development. These findings highlight the importance of considering the behaviour of offspring, when investigating the way care is distributed in cooperative societies.

AB We studied the individual variation in bat pups' isolation calls in the noctule bat, one of the few bat species in which twin births are common. Based on discriminant function analyses we showed that pups' isolation calls were individually distinct and therefore likely to bear vocal signatures suitable for acoustically mediated mothere-offspring recognition. The comparison of individual variation of isolation calls in intratwin and intertwin pairs revealed that isolation calls of twin siblings were more similar to the calls of each other than to the isolation calls of unrelated pups of the same age. Therefore, isolation calls may not only encode individual identity but also affiliation to a certain social group ( e. g. twin pairs). The distinctiveness of isolation calls increased with the age of the pups and calls of twin siblings remained similar to each other as the pups got older, whereas the calls of unrelated pups diverged, suggesting that vocal signatures become more distinct during ontogeny and that the similarity of twin siblings' isolation calls is persistent over time.

AB Female preference variation over space and time could be an alternative to frequency-dependent selection as a mechanism maintaining alternative male reproductive strategies. In the swordtail fish, Xiphophorus nigrensis, males have alternative strategies where large courting males (courters) and smaller males (sneakers) have equal fitnesses due to a mating advantage for the courters and a higher probability of reaching sexual maturity for the sneakers. Variation in one of these advantages over space or time may be the mechanism that maintains these two strategies. We examined female preference variation for the courting strategy in Xiphophorus multilineatus, a species with the same strategies. Females had an overall significant preference for courters. The strength of this preference was positively related to female size, with smaller females having a weak preference for courters. If the relationship between female size and strength of preference is consistent over space and time, more smaller females would result in an weaker preference for courters, which would increase the relative mating advantage of sneakers. We assessed female size distribution and the frequency of each strategy across space and time and detected significant differences in mean female size across subpopulations and across time, as well as a relationship between mean female size and the relative frequencies of the two male strategies: courters were significantly more common in those samples with the largest females. These results suggest that variation across subpopulations of X. multilineatus in female preferences over space and/or time could shift the balance in fitness between the two strategies.

AB Refinement, replacement and reduction of animals in research has become a guiding principle for legislation governing animal research, and for the implementation of that legislation. However, one of these '3Rs', replacement, would seem incompatible with the science of animal behaviour, where the animal is not a model for the human condition, but the object of interest itself. This, the power of biomedical research and the pharmaceutical industry as lobbying groups, and the fact that the public could come to equate 'animal research' with vivisection, should cause concern in the animal behaviour community. The dominance of the 3Rs, and the evaluation of the utility of animal research in terms of medical benefits, could come to dominate ethical decisions about animal research. I argue that the 3Rs are not as incompatible with the aims of animal behaviour as it first appears, and that their principles can be readily incorporated into our research, but this must be twinned with a greater commitment to dialogue with legislative bodies and biomedical lobbying groups, to ensure that the utility of animal research is not evaluated solely in terms of medical and other immediate human gains.

AB When threatened with predation, foraging prey can cease feeding and seek refuge or shift to feeding sites (microhabitats) offering increased safety. Predator-induced microhabitat shifts by large herbivores are of interest to ecologists because spatial patterns of foraging by these animals shape plant communities. The influence of predation risk on microhabitat use by large herbivores in marine systems remains poorly understood. We explored the relationship between microhabitat use by dugongs, Dugong dugon, and tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier, predation risk in an Australian embayment over 3 years. Use by foraging dugongs of two seagrass microhabitats, edge (lower-quality seagrass, swift escape from sharks) and interior (higher-quality seagrass, fewer escape options), was monitored in seven survey zones. We indexed predation danger using catch rates of tiger sharks that were greater than 3.0 m in total length. The degree of dissimilarity between forager densities in edge and interior microhabitats was a function of tiger shark abundance: foragers under-used edge (safe) microhabitat when sharks were scarce, overused it when sharks were common, and responded to daily changes in shark abundance in a threat-sensitive fashion, showing the greatest preference for edges when shark abundance was highest. We conclude that dugongs manage their probability of death by allocating more time to safe but lower-quality feeding microhabitats when the likelihood of encountering sharks is elevated. Dugong grazing can influence seagrass biomass and patch composition, so tiger sharks probably affect the microhabitat structure of seagrass meadows, and ultimately their benthic communities, indirectly by altering the way that dugongs use feeding patches.

AB We quantified cache spacing patterns, cache retrieval rates and rates of cache theft in New Zealand robins, Petroica australis. In a field experiment we presented wild birds with a superabundant supply of mealworms. Trials were conducted on competitively dominant males and subordinate females, both when birds were alone and when they were accompanied by their mate. We hypothesized that ( 1) dominant males would aggregate caches to facilitate their defence, whereas subordinate females would scatter their caches more widely to avoid their discovery by males, ( 2) sexual differences in cache spacing would be context dependent, or occur only when birds were in pairs, and ( 3) patterns in cache spacing would facilitate cache retrieval and reduce cache theft. Females cached food further from food sources than males when they occurred in pairs. However, both sexes cached at similar distances when they were alone. Regardless of social context, females created more cache sites than males, and both sexes created more cache sites when they were together. Cache theft was frequently observed. Female-made caches were retrieved at similar rates by both males and females whereas male-made caches were more likely to be stolen by females than retrieved by the males that made them. Therefore, the results showed no support for the hypothesis that cache spacing patterns reduce cache theft. We suggest that the apparently conflicting relations between cache spacing, recovery and theft are determined by a trade-off between winter survival tactics and mate provisioning.

AB Animals use behavioural plasticity to cope with conflicting selective pressures. We investigated how prey availability affects the spinning of cobwebs, whose architecture influences both prey capture and defence. Fed western black widows spun cobwebs containing more silk than did fasted spiders. However, fed spiders invested relatively less silk in the sheets and sticky gumfooted threads of webs and relatively more silk in supporting threads than did fasted spiders. The material properties of silk spun by fed and fasted spiders were relatively similar, but silk threads spun by fed spiders were twice as thick as those of fasted spiders, increasing web strength by 225%. Finally, spiders fed late in the experiment did not reproduce, even though they received the same amount of food as spiders fed earlier, 43% of which reproduced. The reallocation of silk in cobwebs away from sheets and sticky gumfooted threads, which function in prey capture, to supporting threads, which surround spiders with defensive clouds of silk, is consistent with reduced foraging effort and increased predation risk avoidance by fed spiders. Furthermore, this behavioural shift occurs as spiders are reproducing, when spiders can most afford the costs of reduced prey capture and would most benefit from enhanced protection. Our results contrast with those of previous studies on orb-weaving spiders, which found reductions in the sizes of webs as spiders caught more food. Thus, the architectures of spider webs reflect many selective pressures, the effects of which may vary with physiological state. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Croaking gouramis, Trichopsis vittata (family Osphronemidae), possess enhanced pectoral fin muscles and tendons, enabling the fish to generate series of short or long broadband bursts while beating the fins. Agonistic disputes over territories result in lateral displays during which both sexes produce croaking sounds. During mating, a female approaches a male's nest at the water surface and emits purring sounds in a vertical, head-up position. This behaviour is followed by spawning bouts. I investigated whether aggressive and prespawning sounds differ in acoustic characteristics and whether they might convey different information. Agonistic sounds of both sexes lasted longer than the females' prespawning sounds, consisting of four or five bursts/sound compared to 2.4 bursts in purring sounds, and included a smaller percentage of short bursts. Sound pressure levels were higher in agonistic than in prespawning sounds. The dominant frequency of male agonistic signals was lower than that of female prespawning sounds. Both sexes produced long, high-intensity croaking sounds during agonistic disputes; these probably help them assess the fighting ability of opponents. On the other hand, only females emitted short, low-intensity purring sounds, which probably initiate and coordinate spawning behaviour. The low sound level and short duration of prespawning sounds indicate that they function as mating displays at very short distances; this probably reduces the chance of attracting competitors or predators. The croaking gourami is the only fish species in which females are known to initiate spawning acoustically. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals used in research are often housed in small, barren cages. Providing environmental enrichment should improve their welfare, and a consequence of this might be a reduction in the animal's motivation to leave an enriched cage. I examined this possibility by housing laboratory mice, Mus musculus, in a cage that provided cagemates, food, water, large floor area, nesting material, a running wheel, shelter, cardboard tube, food stick and chew sticks. The strength of motivation to leave this cage was assessed in an operant consumer demand test. By pressing repeatedly on a switch, one trained mouse within each of six groups could exit the enriched cage to enter a small, empty cage. As the number of required switch presses was increased, the number of visits to the empty cage decreased, although this was unlikely to be caused by habituation. The mice continued to exit the enriched cage and enter the empty one at all the costs imposed. The slope of the demand function for the empty cage indicated that the mice did not perceive this to be a particularly important resource. I argue that the motivation to exit the enriched cage and enter the empty cage was due to monitoring, patrolling or information gathering, independent of any attraction or aversion to either of the cages. Alternatively, the motivation to leave a presumably attractive environment to enter a presumably less attractive one could be the result of factors beyond our anthropocentric-based understanding of how the mice perceived their environments. The implications for consumer demand studies and their application are discussed. 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Studies of aquatic mating tactics in long-lived mammals are rare because of the difficulties involved in gaining repeated information on individuals over multiple years. We used acoustic array recordings as a tool for studying the mating tactics of bearded seals over 16 years off Point Barrow, Alaska. Males produce underwater vocalizations during the mating season that show clear individual differences. The most commonly used trill types, AL4 and AL1i, were analysed over 6 years (1985-1986, 1992-1993, 2000-2001). For each vocalization, we measured 17 parameters and determined an X, Y location through cross-correlation analysis. Classification trees showed that 100 individuals were present over the study period (22-40 males per year). Individuals showed clear site fidelity with 13-25 males returning over consecutive years. Six males were present over the entire 16-year period. Kernel home ranges were 0.32-3.2 km(2) for 34 territorial males and 5.3-16.3 km(2) for 66 roaming males. Throughout this study all but two males used the same mating tactic. When these males switched tactic (from territorial to roaming), the duration of their calls also changed, while all other acoustic variables remained constant. The vocal parameters for all the other males remained stable throughout their tenure. It appears therefore that although males can alter their mating tactics as circumstances change, only a few do so. Instead mating tactics tend to show long-term stability in vocal characteristics, strong site fidelity and periods of tenure that cover a significant proportion of the male's adult life span.

AB Male bowerbirds collect and decorate their bowers with coloured objects that influence female choice. A recent version of the sensory drive hypothesis claims that female food colour preferences have driven the evolution of female preferences for the colour of male display traits. This hypothesis predicts a positive correlation between male display and food colour preferences. A positive correlation between food and decoration preferences could also arise because of sensory biases built into bowerbirds or the environment. Here we test hypotheses that (1) male and female satin bowerbirds show well-defined food colour preferences, (2) these preferences correlate with independently assessed preferences for bower decorations, and, in a cross-species comparison, (3) food items were used as the first bower decorations. We found that male and female satin bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, preferentially use long wavelength and were colours as food items. Male decoration preferences were biased towards colours of short wavelength and were negatively correlated with food colour preferences. Our reconstruction of ancestral character states is most consistent with the hypothesis that the original bower decorations were inedible objects and were thus unlikely to have been dual-use traits that also functioned as food items. Our results do not support the hypothesis that food colour preferences have driven the evolution of bower decoration colour preferences nor that sensory drive has caused similar food and decoration preferences, but instead suggest that different factors have shaped female preferences for male display and food colour preferences in bowerbirds.

AB While homing pigeons are known to use familiar visual landmarks to recognize release sites, it is less clear whether they continue to attend to visual cues along the homeward flight. To address this question, we used precision GPS technology to track pigeons along their homeward route and later released them from sites that they were known to have flown over. The group of birds that were aerially familiar with the chosen sites homed significantly more efficiently than did their yoked (naive) counterparts. We found no evidence that birds were able to recognize sites that they had previously flown over from the substantially different viewpoint perceived at ground level. The results imply that the birds were able to recognize some aspect of the chosen sites after release and used this information to home more efficiently, although the nature of these cues is not clear.

AB Burying beetles (Nicrophorus spp.) compete for access to small vertebrate carrion, a highly valued resource. Intruders that take over a carcass will kill young of residents and use the carcass for a replacement brood. To examine whether sexual selection alters interactions with intruders, I staged encounters in which resource competition was the only important motivator for infanticide and then compared outcomes to those in which both sexual selection and resource competition might operate. On carcasses with first-instar larvae, a single resident male or female N. orbicollis was confronted with either a heterospecific or conspecific intruder of either sex (at this stage, a carcass retains 44-75% of its original value if used for a replacement brood). Single males defended their brood significantly better than did single females. Males appear to be efficient task specialists, having both a greater tendency and greater ability to guard the brood. When intruders were heterospecifics, there was no interaction between the two independent experimental variables of sex of defender and sex of intruder. When intruders were conspecifics, however, there was a significant interaction such that infanticide was more common when a defender confronted an intruder of the opposite sex. That is, when a defender had the opportunity to recoup some of its losses from infanticide by participating in a replacement brood with the intruder (opportunity for sexual selection), the probability of infanticide increased. A follow-up experiment staged at the second and early third instar indicated that infanticidal take-overs are quite common when single females defend second instars, but are infrequent when single females defend third instars, or when pairs defend second or third instars. Other measures of reproductive success (number and mass of broods in trials not including take-overs) were similar for single females and pairs. I hypothesize that the threat of infanticide and the inability of a parent to fully compensate for the absence of a partner that is a task specialist promote extended biparental care in burying beetles.

AB Social cognition, in particular the derivation of social information from observation of interactions between members of a social group, has been widely investigated in primates, but it has received little attention in other social mammals, although it has been anecdotally reported in the domestic dog, Canis familiaris. We recorded the behaviour of dogs ('spectators') that had observed controlled interactions between a human and a dog (the 'demonstrator') competing for an object, and that were subsequently allowed to interact freely with both participants. When the competitions were playful, as indicated by signals performed by the human, the spectator was more likely to approach the winner first and/or more rapidly, suggesting that winners of games are perceived as desirable social partners. When the human did not perform play signals, changing the social context from play to contest over a resource, spectators were slower to approach either of the participants, suggesting that participants in contests were less desirable as social partners than participants in games. If the dog was prevented from seeing the game, it still reacted differently to the winner and the loser, but its behaviour was not the same as after games that it had seen. We conclude that spectator dogs gain information from the players' subsequent behaviour as well as from direct observation of the game.

AB We investigated the effect of social variables on the regulation of the moult from juvenile to adult plumage in male zebra finches. Males reared in social isolation after day 31 after hatching retained their juvenile plumage until day 90; if then placed in a colony setting, they developed the typical male plumage in 2-3 weeks. The isolation-induced delay in male plumage resulted from a delay in the juvenile moult. Social isolates that could trigger song playbacks by pecking at a key developed male plumage at the same time as controls. We suggest that a nongonadal mechanism sensitive to social variables normally ensures that adult male plumage is acquired in zebra finches during the weeks leading up to sexual maturity. This is the first report of a social effect on moult. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID COOPERATION; SELECTION; EVOLUTION
AB A protective role for the lion's mane has long been assumed but this assumption has never been tested. We compared patterns of injury, mane development and adult mane morphology in a population of African lions and found no compelling evidence that the mane conferred effective protection against wounding. The mane area was not a specific target of attacks, and injuries to the mane area were not associated with higher mortality than other injuries. Regions of the mane that were most frequently attacked did not show earlier onset of mane growth in subadult males or longer/darker mane hair in adult males. Adult males appeared to be wounded less frequently on the mane area than predicted by surface area, but it is unclear whether this trend was only caused by observer bias from decreased visibility. We conclude that, although the mane may have conferred protection during the early evolution of the trait, protection appears to be secondary to the strong sexually selected advantages of the mane as a condition-dependent ornament.

   GRUNTS; CALLS; GAZE
AB We describe a playback experiment designed to test whether free-ranging baboons, Papio hamadryas ursinus, recognize when a call is directed at themselves rather than at other individuals. Female subjects were played the threat-grunt of a more dominant female under one of two conditions: after they had been threatened by that female and after they had groomed with that female. Subjects showed a shorter latency both to look towards the speaker and to move away from the area after aggression than after grooming. In the 15 min following playback, subjects who had recently been threatened were less likely to approach their former opponents and less likely to tolerate those females' approaches than during matched control periods. In contrast, subjects were equally likely to tolerate approaches by the dominant signaller following postgroom trials and during matched control periods. Combined with results from previous experiments testing baboons' responses to 'reconciliatory' grunts, these results suggest that baboons make inferences about the directedness of vocalizations even in the absence of visual cues, and that the nature of prior interactions affects subsequent behaviour. When attending to vocal signals, baboons appear to take into account not only the signaller's identity and her probable subsequent behaviour, but also the target of her attention. The ability to integrate these cues may represent a first crucial step towards the recognition of other individuals' intentions and motives.

AB The challenge hypothesis (Wingfield et al. 1990, American Naturalist, 136, 829-846) predicts varying androgen responses to mating, breeding or territorial behaviour in avian males. At the interspecific level, the highest androgen responsiveness has been observed in males from monogamous species with paternal incubation, and the lowest in males from promiscuous, nonpaternal species. Studies of a number of vertebrate species have discussed the extension of the challenge hypothesis predictions to nonavian vertebrates, but a general 'vertebrate consensus' has not been achieved. For this quantitative review we included data from all vertebrate species available in the literature into several meta-analyses. We distinguished between the effects of androgens on sexual, aggressive and paternal behaviour and the effects of behaviour on androgen levels and compared these effects between taxa, mating systems and types of parental care. We observed large variations between taxa in all data sets. Nevertheless, at the vertebrate level the challenge hypothesis predictions originating from the avian literature were confirmed for the modulation of androgen responsiveness (1) to sexual behaviour by paternal care but not by mating system, and (2) to paternal behaviour by mating system but not the degree of paternal care. In contrast, our results provide (3) no support for the predicted modulation of androgen levels in response to agonistic interactions by mating and parental care system at the vertebrate level. Furthermore, our meta-analyses suggest that the effects of exogenous testosterone on sexual and agonistic behaviour, as a rule of thumb, may be expected to be larger in nonpaternal than in paternal systems.

AB Decisions about joining social groups are often contingent on one's own phenotypic characteristics and those of existing group members. Zebrafish and their allies (genus Danio) vary substantially in the expression of conspicuous lateral stripes. We presented wild-type zebrafish (D. rerio), two artificially selected D. rerio strains with reduced stripe expression, as well as the stripeless D. albolineatus and the striped D. nigrofasciatus, with simultaneous choices between synthetic, computer-animated shoals of stripeless and striped Danio. Each species and strain of Danio preferred the phenotype that most resembled its own, with a strong preference for striped stimuli by fish with dark-stripe phenotypes, and a strong preference for no stripes by fish lacking stripes. Stripes are therefore a key shoaling cue in Danio. Individuals appear to acquire a general preference for stripes, or no stripes, as a consequence of experience with a specific stripe phenotype.

AB Fireflies are the classic example of organisms that use light signalling for sexual communication. However, many genera have diurnally active adults for which the use of light signals for courtship seems unlikely. It is generally accepted that diurnal fireflies use pheromones instead of light signalling for sexual communication, even though robust observational data or convincing experimental evidence is lacking. In several field experiments, we investigated whether sexual communication in the diurnal P. hemipterus is based upon pheromones rather than on light emission. During the daytime, males were attracted to females without the aid of visual cues. Males coming from the downwind side of females arrived first. Arrival directions of males to females were strongly nonrandom and were correlated with downwind direction, i.e. possibly into the direction from which a pheromone plume is dispersed. Males arrived more rapidly when the wind came from a fixed direction and wind speed was high. Although the presumed pheromone signal still attracted males at a distance of 20 in, its maximal sampling range was at a relatively close range (ca. 43 in after 3 h). More males were attracted when females showed signalling behaviour. These results strongly suggest that sexual communication in P. hemipterus is based entirely on pheromones.

AB By the age of 5.5 years, all of the young chimpanzees of Gombe National Park have acquired a skill known as 'termite fishing'. Termite fishing involves inserting a flexible tool made from vegetation into a termite mound and extracting the termites that attack and cling to the tool. Although tool use is a well-known phenomenon in chimpanzees, little is known about how such skills develop in the wild. Prior studies have found adult sex differences in frequency, duration and efficiency of tool-using tasks, with females scoring higher on all measures. To investigate whether these sex differences occurred in youngsters, I performed a 4-year longitudinal field study during which I observed and videotaped young chimpanzees' development of the termite-fishing behaviour. Critical elements of the skill included identifying a hole, making a tool, inserting a tool into a hole and extracting termites. These elements appeared in the same order during the development of all subjects, but females typically peaked at least a year earlier than males in their performance of the skills that precede termite fishing. In addition, young females successfully termite-fished an average of 27 months earlier than young males and were more proficient at the skill after acquisition had occurred. Furthermore, the techniques of female offspring closely resembled those of their mothers whereas the techniques of male offspring did not, suggesting that the process by which termite fishing is learned differs for male and female chimpanzees.

AB The most common vocalization of the African elephant, Loxodonta africana, is the rumble, but there is no consensus as to how many rumble subtypes exist. From the standpoint of social function, many types of rumble have been proposed. From a structural standpoint, however, few studies have examined detailed acoustic measurements of a large number of calls. We analysed 270 rumbles from six adult female African elephants housed at Disney's Animal Kingdom (Lake Buena Vista, Florida, U.S.A.). Subjects wore collars outfitted with microphones and radiotransmitters that allowed recording of vocalizations from identified individuals. Rumble vocalizations were digitized and both source and filter features were measured for each call. Behavioural and endocrine data were collected so that acoustical data could be placed into the context of ongoing social behaviour and reproductive state. Multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that, from a structural standpoint, rumbles from this captive setting could not be divided into distinct subtypes, but there was extensive acoustic variation across rumbles. Discriminant function analysis and MANOVA were employed to further explore this variation. First, acoustic characteristics varied according to the individual identity of the caller. Second, rumbles varied as a function of negative emotional arousal. When associating with dominant animals, subordinate females produced rumbles with lower cepstral coefficients, suggesting low tonality and unstable pitch in the voice, compared to rumbles produced outside of the presence of dominant animals. Rumbles as a whole did not cluster into distinct acoustic types, but structural variation in rumbles reflected the individual identity and emotional state of callers.

AB Individual pigs, Sus scrofa, differ considerably in how aggressive they are during encounters with unfamiliar conspecifics. We examined whether individual coping characteristics of pigs were predictive of aggression during social encounters and the resulting social status. Piglets were subjected to the Backtest during the suckling period, as their behavioural response in this test seems to be predictive of their coping style. Each piglet was restrained in a supine position for 1 min and the resistance (i.e. number of escape attempts) was scored. After weaning, 30 'high-resisting' (HR) and 30 'low-resisting' (LR) pigs were regrouped with unfamiliar pigs of similar weight and we recorded their aggressive behaviour for 180 min. In addition, we assessed the social rank of each pig. HR pigs showed more aggressive behaviour than LR pigs: they initiated more fights, started fighting earlier and spent more time fighting during the observation period. HR and LR pigs did not differ, however, in achieved social rank. Level of self-initiated fighting was positively correlated with social rank in LR pigs, but this relation was not found in HR pigs. In conclusion, the coping style of pigs is related to their aggressive behaviour and the establishment of dominance relationships after mixing. Our results indicate that LR pigs are flexible in using aggression, whereas the high level of aggression of HR pigs regardless of their success in encounters suggests that these animals are more rigid in their aggressive behaviour.

AB Cricket songs are species-specific signals that are important for species recognition. To prove the effectiveness of calling songs in premating isolation, studies need to take into account closely related species distributed sympatrically in nature. I compared the calling songs of three closely related cricket species that inhabit the Japanese archipelago: Teleogryllus yezoemma, T emma and T. taiwanemma. Teleogryllus emma is widely distributed in the archipelago and overlaps the ranges of T taiwanemma in the south and T yezoemma in the north; T yezoemma and T taiwanemma are allopatric. I compared three temporal parameters (the long-chirp duration, the interphrase duration and the pulse cycle), a frequency parameter (the dominant frequency) and two structural parameters (the number of pulses in one long chirp and the number of short chirps following one long chirp). In addition, I conducted a two-speaker playback experiment using female T taiwanemma to test whether they can accurately distinguish conspecific males based on their calling song. The species with partially overlapping ranges had divergent songs that females could distinguish accurately, whereas the allopatric species had similar songs that females could not accurately discriminate. These results suggest that the calling song has an important role as a premating isolation mechanism. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We examined the behavioural ecology of mothers and calves during the first year of life to identify variables predicting calf mortality among bottlenose dolphins. Specifically, we investigated whether the primary cause of calf mortality was poor calf condition or shark predation. Seventy-five per cent of calves that died (N = 12) showed visible signs of poor health compared with 4.7% of the survivors (N = 21). Calves that spent more time swimming in infant position (in contact under the mother) in the first year of life were more likely to die by 3 years of age than calves that spent less time swimming in infant position. No other behavioural or ecological measures tested were associated with calf mortality. We suggest that the mother and/or calf may compensate for poor calf health by increasing the time spent in contact with the mother. In contrast, frequent mother-calf separation and high rates of calf socializing and foraging are proposed to be indicators of vigour. Although most of our results do not support the predation hypothesis, mothers altered one behaviour in relation to predation risk. Mothers rested less in deep water during the warm months, where and when predation risk was high, than during the cool months, when predation risk was low, suggesting that predation risk influenced maternal vigilance. However, calf mortality was not higher in warm months than in cool months. Our results suggest that poor calf condition, not predation, is the primary cause of calf mortality.

AB We hypothesized that a decrease in the attractiveness of odours from infected male mice, Mus musculus could be caused by either parasite-induced changes in host metabolism (parasite-dependent pathway) or activation of the immune defence system (immune-dependent pathway). Activation of the immune defence system by nonreplicated antigens (sheep red blood cells, SRBC) is sufficient for a decrease in both scent attractiveness and the concentration of plasma testosterone in male mice. Since the scent attractiveness of male mice depends on androgen levels, we studied the olfactory effect of SRBC in sham-operated, gonadectomized and testosterone-treated male mice of the outbred strain ICR. SRBC administration resulted in a decline in both sexual odour attractiveness and concentration of urinary proteins in sham-operated control males. The effect of SRBC on concentration of urinary proteins was abolished by stabilizing the testosterone level in gonadectomized and androgen-treated males. At the same time, only the high dose of testosterone was sufficient to maintain the scent attractiveness in SRBC-treated males at the pretreatment level.

AB Flexibility in female mate choice occurs over a range of timescales. We examined this plasticity over the course of a single breeding cycle using phonotaxis tests that assay acoustic-based mating preferences of female tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus. Tests were performed throughout three reproductive stages: unamplexed, amplexed and postmated. We tested whether the approach of the time at which a female needs to release her eggs (i.e. amplexed stage) influences her mate decisions. We examined three aspects of female mate choice behaviour: receptivity, permissiveness and discrimination. We considered a female receptive if she accepted a conspecific male's call, permissive if she accepted a call that was less attractive than a conspecific call and discriminating if she maintained her preference for a 'whine-chuck' over a 'whine'. Our results show that the proportion of females responding receptively and permissively peaks during the amplexed stage. Individual females also increase receptive and permissive responses in the amplexed stage. Furthermore, time to respond to mate signals is lowest in the amplexed stage. The increase in permissive mate decisions was not associated with a decrease in the probability of expressing discriminatory behaviour. We suggest that the increase in permissive mate choice is due to a decrease in female choosiness, that is, a lowering of her threshold for accepting unattractive calls, as her receptivity increases. This study provides empirical support for theoretical models predicting that females will reduce their threshold criteria for choosing mates as critical time points approach.

DT Article
ID PAIR PATERNITY; BEHAVIOR; SIZE; SELECTION; CRICKETS; BENEFITS; BIRDS
AB In several animal species, males offer material gifts to females during a courtship or precopulatory display. The provision of nutrients is a male investment that can increase female reproductive success; therefore males can use such gifts to influence female choice. Clear examples of courtship feeding before extrapair copulations are scarce, however. We investigated courtship feeding in the great grey shrike. Males offered food both to their mate and to extrapair females. Food offered to extrapair females had a significantly higher energy value than that offered to the social mates. The size of prey offered may enable females to judge a male's quality. A larger gift resulted in a higher chance of copulation for males in both within- and extrapair events. We conclude that the energy value of nuptial gifts can explain why females of some species engage in extrapair copulations. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examined the effect of adding flavours to foods of varying nutritional content on the foraging behaviour of the generalist grasshopper Taeniopoda eques. Each grasshopper received three dishes of food containing either (1) the same nutritionally balanced diet to which distinct flavours had or had not been added; or (2) three nutritionally unbalanced diets (lacking protein, sterol or starch) to which distinct flavours had or had not been added. We found that on the balanced foods, individuals ate similar quantities of food from each dish, but on the unbalanced foods, individuals ate most food from the dish lacking sterol and least of the food lacking protein. The proportions eaten reached a stable level and maximized intake of protein and carbohydrate. Although added flavours had no impact on proportions eaten from the dishes containing balanced food, on the unbalanced foods, individuals attained the stable proportions from the different dishes earlier. Furthermore, addition of flavours in either (1) or (2) resulted in greater food intake overall. On incomplete foods, the addition of flavours resulted in the development of additional oocytes. Thus, addition of diverse flavours enabled the grasshoppers to forage more efficiently, resulting in improvements in performance. These results demonstrate the importance of learning in the foraging efficiency of T eques. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Behavioural lateralization has been demonstrated in many species of vertebrates, but there has been scarce evidence for it in invertebrates. We have previously documented lateral asymmetry of eye use in individual octopuses. In the present study we investigated lateralization at the population level. Octopus eyes are on the sides of the head, and these animals prefer monocular to binocular vision. We determined preferential eye use by recording the time that the octopuses watched a stimulus outside the tank while holding on to the front glass of the tank. Thirteen of 25 subjects were highly significantly left-eyed, 10 highly significantly right-eyed, and two showed no preference. Individual octopuses had lateralized eye use but, unlike handedness in humans, eye preference in octopuses at the population level had no systematic bias towards left or right. This behavioural asymmetry follows an antisymmetrical distribution and could therefore be genetically or epigenetically determined. This study extends assessment of lateralization to the population level to include invertebrates in the discussion of the evolution of lateralization.

AB The comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, exhibits seasonal polyphenism with a darkish winter morph and a lighter summer one. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the winter morph represents the ancestral condition. We suggest two hypotheses for the evolution of the summer morph and the maintenance of seasonal polyphenism in the comma: (1) that the summer morph is better protected against predation on summer roost sites, whereas the winter morph is better protected on hibernation sites, and (2) that the summer morph is energetically less expensive and results from deallocation of resources from soma (e.g. dark wing pigmentation) to reproduction. We tested the antipredation hypothesis in experiments using great tits, Pants major, as predators on winter and summer morph commas presented simultaneously on tree trunks or on nettles. However, this hypothesis was not supported as the winter morph was better protected than the summer morph on both backgrounds. Predation when both morphs were present was lower on nettles, and summer morphs placed in exposed positions on tree trunks outdoors disappeared sooner than winter morphs placed on the same background. In addition, in a final experiment, 18 summer morphs released in their natural habitat in the evening exclusively chose leaves for roost sites, whereas 12 of 19 winter morphs chose a tree trunk, branch or twig. We conclude that evolution of the summer morph is consistent with the life history hypothesis and that its choice of summer roost sites is associated with a low predation pressure.

AB We investigated how the type of food (sucrose or protein) and the presence of brood influence foraging decisions of Lasius niger L. scouts. In particular, we studied whether and how these parameters alter the drinking behaviour of scouts land the allocation of workers to food retrieving and recruiting tasks. We analysed drinking and recruiting behaviour of single scouts from nests with or without brood that encountered a proteinaceous or sucrose droplet. A substantial fraction of scouts encountering a proteinaceous droplet did not ingest it and did not then return to the nest whereas nearly all drank at sugar droplets; brood presence did not influence this decision. Once an ant started drinking, it needed to drink a critical volume before returning to the nest; this critical volume did not depend on the type of food and the presence of brood. Scouts laid a trail only if they returned to the colony. Food type and brood presence altered the proportion of individuals that laid a trail but not the individual trail-laying intensity. We discuss the consequences of this decision system through simple individual assessments and decision rules, with regard to the self-organized foraging patterns of this species and the efficient collective exploitation of natural resources.

AB We studied social transmission of the handling of hemp seed between experienced adult and naive juvenile canaries, Serinus canaria. Adult demonstrators were either familiar or unfamiliar to the juveniles and demonstration took place either during free interactions between birds or under conditions where the juvenile could only observe the adult. Some effects of social transmission were observed under all these conditions. When juveniles were isolated after exposure to the adult demonstrator, they picked up and husked seeds earlier than control juveniles that had not seen a demonstrator. Although the demonstrating activity of adults was weaker during free interactions with an unfamiliar juvenile than with a familiar one, there was no effect of familiarity or of opportunity for interaction on the latency of juveniles to pick up the first seed when later isolated. However, the handling time required to husk the first seed was lower when the juvenile had previously interacted freely with a familiar adult than in the other three conditions. Whereas observation alone promoted picking up of seed by familiarizing juveniles with the new food, they learned to husk and consume the seed more quickly after their activity had been directed towards it during free interactions with a familiar adult. These results indicate that the specific dynamics of interaction between adult and juvenile have a strong influence on the social transmission of feeding behaviour.

TI Raven scavenging favours group foraging in wolves

AB Wolves, Canis lupus, routinely live in large packs that include unrelated individuals and mature offspring. Studies. show that individual wolves that live in large packs suffer reduced foraging returns. Therefore, group hunting and group living (sociality) in wolves is generally thought to be favoured by indirect fitness gains accrued through kin-directed altruism. However, we show that kin-directed altruism cannot account for groups that include mature offspring or unrelated individuals. We also present an analysis that incorporates a previously ignored feature of wolf foraging ecology, namely the loss of food to scavenging ravens, Corvus corax. By accounting for this process, we show that individuals in large packs do indeed accrue foraging advantages. In the hypothetical absence of this scavenging pressure, an individual would maximize its rate of prey acquisition, and minimize its risk of energetic shortfall, by foraging with just one other individual. However, incorporating the effect of scavenging by ravens leads to a dramatic increase in the predicted group size. Our analysis indicates that per capita gains are highest in the largest observed packs. The greater food-sharing costs in a larger pack are more than offset by smaller losses to scavengers and increased rates of prey acquisition. Thus, in contrast with previous interpretations, the selfish benefits of social foraging appear to contribute to the maintenance of sociality in wolves after all. We explore whether such benefits favour group living in various social carnivores that hunt large prey and are thus vulnerable to scavenging.

AB The coevolutionary process between avian brood parasites and their hosts predicts that low intraclutch variation in egg colour appearance favours egg discrimination of parasite eggs by hosts. Low intraclutch variation would also result in high interclutch variation, which would increase the difficulty of evolution of mimicry by the cuckoo, because many host colour patterns might coexist in the same host population. We explored this possibility using an experimental approach in the common magpie, Pica pica, and great spotted cuckoo, Clamator glandarius, system. We artificially parasitized magpie nests with great spotted cuckoo model eggs to assess host response in two populations in Spain (Guadix and Donana) in relation to intraclutch variation in egg appearance, measured by ultraviolet-visible reflectance spectrophotometry. Individuals that rejected model cuckoo eggs had higher intraclutch variation than accepters, suggesting that an increase, rather than a decrease, in intraclutch variation in magpie egg appearance was advantageous for cuckoo egg discrimination.

AB From a life history perspective, parents have an incentive to protect their reproductive investment, and so may provide care even after their offspring are independent. Such prolonged parental care could lead to postponed dispersal of the offspring and thereby facilitate the formation of kin groups. We tested whether alpha birds in Siberian jays protected their independent, retained offspring by giving alarm calls during simulated predator attacks. We compared the responses to predator attacks simulated by flying a hawk model over a dyad of birds on a feeder for dyads composed of an alpha bird and either a relative or a nonrelative. Alpha females were nepotistic in their alarm-calling behaviour, in that they called more frequently when accompanied by their retained offspring than by unrelated immigrants, but alpha males called indiscriminately. This difference in alarm calling could reflect dominance relationships in Siberian jay groups, because the presence of immigrants may be less costly to alpha males, but alpha females are more vulnerable to competition from immigrants. Alarm calls were usually given during escape, when both individuals in the dyad had left the feeding site. However, results of a playback experiment suggest that alarm calls conveyed information about danger and incited an immediate escape reaction. Our results indicate that alarm calling can be nepotistic, and that factors other than kinship influence alarm-calling behaviour. Nepotistic antipredator behaviours are benefits that offspring can gain only in their natal territory. Hence, in the absence of preferential treatment by their parents, offspring may be more likely to disperse and kin groups are prevented from forming.

AB We investigated the initiation of group movements in white-faced capuchin monkeys, Cebus capucinus, with the aim of determining whether a single individual with high dominance status consistently leads movements or whether leadership is distributed between group members. The group studied was reared in semifree-ranging conditions. A multivariate analysis followed by univariate analyses demonstrated that leadership was not concentrated on a single individual in this species. All individuals could initiate a collective movement. Nearly half of group members regularly succeeded in recruiting at least three followers. Although both sexes had similar rates of start attempts, females succeeded more frequently than males. We found no significant effect of the dominance status on the percentage of successful attempts. The use of a slow speed, looking back towards the other group members, or trills by the initiator heightened the likelihood of success in group movement initiation. An initiator starting from a core position in a clumped group was more successful than one starting from an edge position in a clumped group or from a dispersed group. Furthermore, the probability of successful start attempts was higher when the group remained stationary for a long period. Leadership in white-faced capuchins appears to be distributed between group members rather than exclusively concentrated on high-ranking individuals.

AB Group territorial displays are a prominent feature of many avian cooperative-breeding systems. I used natural observations and playback experiments to investigate the territorial vocal rallying display of the green woodhoopoe, Phoeniculus purpureus. Rallies, which consisted of all adult group members cackling loudly while bowing up and down, were given both when unprovoked and in response to other groups. Unprovoked rally length correlated positively with group size, making it a potential indicator of group resource-holding potential. However, group members vocalized for longer in response to actual and simulated intrusions by larger groups than by smaller ones. The duration of the initial response rally was therefore strongly influenced by the rally length given by the intruding group, and consequently did not accurately reflect group size. I discuss the implications of this potential deception. Individuals differed in their contributions to response rallies depending on their sex and dominance status, and on the composition of the intruding group. Although males and females contributed equally overall, each sex expended more effort responding to intruders of its own sex, which might have been viewed as a greater threat. Individuals also approached playbacks of the opposite sex more closely than those of their own sex. Subordinates tended to cackle for longer than dominants, perhaps because they had more to lose from the increased foraging competition following the inclusion of additional group members.

AB Individual variation in behavioural expression and in behavioural plasticity exist in all species, and early experiences are critical determinants of both. The leopard gecko is a lizard with temperature-dependent sex determination, and in this species, embryonic incubation temperature (IncT) affects the display of social behaviours. For example, adult males hatched from eggs incubated at an IncT that produces predominantly males (male-biased IncT, 32.5degreesC) are more aggressive and less sexually active than males hatched from eggs at an IncT that produces predominantly females (female-biased IncT, 30degreesC). It is not known, however, whether IncT influences behavioural plasticity in adulthood. We assessed whether adult males hatched from eggs incubated at female- and male-biased IncTs showed different changes in territorial behaviour (scent marking in an empty test arena), anticipatory behaviours (activity, scent marking and tail vibrations in response to cues that predict the introduction of a female) and courtship behaviour following social interactions with females. We found that heterosexual social experiences increased territorial behaviour and the display of anticipatory behaviours in males from the female-biased IncT but not in males from the male-biased IncT. This difference was not due to differences in the amount of social experiences acquired, and the greater change in anticipatory behaviour in males from the female-biased IncT suggest that they acquired sexual conditioning more readily. Differences in sex steroid concentrations or neural metabolism caused by IncT could underlie this difference. These results highlight the profound implications of maternal nest site selection for offspring phenotype and plasticity in this species. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We describe two field experiments with wild guppies, Poecilia reticulata, in Trinidad that demonstrated that guppies can acquire foraging and predator escape-response information from conspecifics. In the foraging experiment, subjects were presented with two distinctly marked feeders in their home rivers. One feeder contained a conspecific shoal in a transparent container. Guppies preferred to enter the feeder containing this artificial shoal over the other feeder. In a test phase, the artificial shoal was removed and the feeders replaced at the testing site after a 5-min delay. More guppies entered the feeder that had contained the artificial shoal over the other feeder, a difference that can be explained only by the fish learning the characteristics or location of the feeder during the training phase. We suggest that subjects acquired a foraging patch preference through a propensity to approach feeding conspecifics, a local enhancement process. In the predator escape-response experiment, naive 'observer' guppies could avoid an approaching trawl net by escaping through either a hole to which 'demonstrator' guppies had been trained or through an alternative hole. When the demonstrators were present, the naive observers escaped more often and more rapidly by the demonstrated route than the alternative route. When the demonstrators were removed, observers maintained a route preference according to the training of their demonstrators, which suggests that the observers had learned an escape route through following or observing their more knowledgeable conspecifics. Thus, both experiments reveal that guppies can socially learn in the wild. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In commercial free-range broiler (meat chicken) systems, many birds never leave the houses, making them 'free-range' in name only and suggesting that the environment provided is not preferred habitat. We investigated the factors that affect the numbers of birds ranging in 40 flocks, each of 20 000 growing broiler chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, in 14 houses on seven commercial farms and at three seasons of the year. The number of birds found to be ranging outside was positively correlated with the amount of tree cover the range area contained, the time of day and the season of the year. Few birds were seen ranging in the winter but even in summer, the maximum number observed outside during daylight hours at any one time was less than 15% of the total flock. We measured habitat preference of the chickens, using a statistical method previously used for wild birds, and argue that this 'in situ' measurement of habitat preference could be widely used in a variety of situations and that it thus constitutes an important noninvasive and nonintrusive method for assessing animal welfare on commercial farms.

AB Theoretical and experimental evidence indicates that females copy the mate choice of other females under certain conditions. In all mate choice copying experiments with fish to date, females were allowed to copy the choice of a model female immediately after the focal female had observed a model female interacting with a male. It is not known whether females continue to copy the choice of the model female after a longer interval. We investigated whether sailfin molly females also copy the choice of other females when they are prevented from copying immediately after observing a model female next to a previously nonpreferred male. We performed three copying experiments in which females could copy the choice of the model female immediately after, 1 h after or 1 day after observing the model female next to the previously nonpreferred male. In control experiments, we tested whether females chose consistently when they had no opportunity to copy, and whether females showed shoaling behaviour under these conditions. Females copied the choice of the model female immediately after, 1 h after and even 1 day after the observation of the model female interacting with the previously nonpreferred male. Females chose consistently between males when they had no opportunity to copy, and females did not shoal under these conditions. We conclude that females remember individual males with whom a model female had interacted, even after 1 day.

AB Various authors have proposed that courtship feeding evolved under natural selection, sexual selection or both. Using observations of 250 breeding pairs over 3 consecutive years for a total of 77 000 nest-hours, we examined the functional significance of courtship feeding in a seabird, the black-legged kittiwake, Rissa triclactyla. We predicted courtship feeding would benefit males and females in different ways: males may invest in future progeny and females may allow copulations in exchange for food or use courtship feeding to assess males' parental quality. Courtship feeding was correlated with clutch size in I of 3 years, suggesting that males may increase their reproductive success by provisioning their mates. Courtship feeding, which was individually repeatable between years, was also related to male arrival date. These results suggest that courtship feeding is a reliable index of male quality that females may use for mate appraisal. Because courtship feeding commences after the pair bond is established, it cannot be used as a criterion for mate choice in the pair's first year. However, courtship feeding rate was related to male re-pairing success in the following breeding season. We thus suggest that courtship feeding in kittiwakes could have first evolved under natural selection (the nutrition hypothesis) and subsequently may have become a signal of mate quality that females could use to evaluate their mates for future seasons (future mate appraisal hypothesis).

AB Geographical variation in song is a common feature of populations of territorial songbirds. However, the factors responsible for the levels and patterns of variation have not been examined in detail. We measured geographical variation of songs in chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, in samples from five locations in Scotland, U.K. We found substantial variation in the level of song sharing between locations. It was highest in isolated island areas and in a recently populated area. By comparing our data with a spatial simulation model designed to mimic the different areas, we calculated estimates of cultural mutation that ranged between 0.001 and 0.03, with a maximum possible value of 0.05, and found that chaffinches had a significant preference for learning songs not from immediate neighbours, but from males about 500 m away. We discuss the implications of these findings for the process and function of cultural transmission of song in the chaffinch.

AB Subantarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus tropicalis, come ashore to breed in dense colonies and lactating females have to alternate foraging trips at sea with periods ashore during which they suckle their pups. The effectiveness of vocal recognition between mothers and pups, has been shown experimentally. To see whether the recognition abilities of females differ from those of their offspring, we investigated how pups recognize their mother's calls. We used artificially modified signals in playback experiments to determine which acoustic parameters support the recognition process. Pups used both the energy spectrum and the ascending frequency modulation occurring at the beginning of each call. However, they seemed to rely mainly on spectral analyses. The vocal identification process at a perceptual level is therefore asymmetrical, as mothers mainly use temporal structures to recognize their pup's calls.

AB We combined observations, of individual male bearded seal, Erignathus barbabus, behaviour at sea with acoustic localization techniques to investigate their reproductive strategies. Data on trill vocalizations and dive behaviour were collected over consecutive years during the seals' mating season in Svalbard, Norway. Males showed stereotypical dive and vocal displays, with clear individual variation. Acoustic localization provided at-sea locations for 17 males based on variation in trill parameters. Kernel home range analyses showed that 12 individuals displayed at set locations (95% kernels=0.27-1.93 km(2)) and five other males displayed within considerably larger geographical areas (95% kernels=5.31-12.5 km(2)). Males that used the set locations maintained single discrete core areas (50% kernels), while males with large areas moved between multiple core areas. Movement patterns of males suggest that those with small areas patrolled aquatic territories, while those that used larger areas appeared to 'roam'. Territorial males showed little spatial overlap, while roaming males overlapped substantially with both territorial and other males' areas. Territorial males had significantly longer trills than roamers. We suggest that trill duration may be a useful indicator of male 'quality'. Territorial male bearded seals may be 'successful' individuals while roaming males may be younger animals or males in poorer condition that are unable to maintain an aquatic territory. Our data on underwater vocalizations and movements of male bearded seals thus provide evidence for the use of alternative mating tactics in this species.

AB We performed a quantitative genetic study of oviposition behaviours and oviposition traits in the sand cricket Gryllus firmus. Egg survival in crickets depends on the depth at which they are inserted into the soil with the ovipositor. We examined whether egg depth depends on ovipositor length alone, or on both morphological and behavioural traits associated with oviposition. Heritability estimates were high (h(z) >0.5) for ovipositor length and small (h(2)=0.2) for oviposition behaviours. Negative genetic correlations between ovipositor length and some behavioural traits (digging depth and the behavioural component of egg depth) indicated compensation between oviposition traits on egg depth. Because of behavioural compensation, females with different ovipositor lengths subject to stabilizing selection on egg depth could have equal fitnesses. Females laid their eggs deeper, and their eggs were marginally more evenly distributed in dry than in wet sand. This suggests adaptive phenotypic plasticity in laying behaviour, but may also result from physical constraints of the substrate on the insertion of the ovipositor. The absence of significant between-family variation in oviposition traits in response to sand moisture indicates low evolutionary potential for phenotypic plasticity in oviposition traits according to soil moisture. In highly unpredictable environments, females could spread the risk of desiccation by laying eggs at different depths independently of environmental conditions (bet hedging). Our results show significant additive genetic influences on the ability of a female to spread risks as measured by genetic variation in egg distribution, suggesting that a bet-hedging strategy of egg laying has the potential to evolve in this population.

AB Territorial animals commonly display lower levels of aggression towards familiar neighbours in familiar locations than towards neighbours in unfamiliar locations and towards unfamiliar individuals. A combination of acoustic signals and spatial cues mediates this form of social recognition in a variety of animals, including the North American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. In this study, we conducted two field playback experiments to investigate the perceptual basis of neighbour-stranger discrimination in bullfrogs. In a discrimination test following habituation training, a change of 10% in the fundamental frequency or 180degrees in the broadcast location of a synthetic bullfrog advertisement call elicited significant recovery of habituated aggressive responses. Hence, male bullfrogs can learn about an individually distinct property of acoustic signals and the signal's location of origin by repeatedly hearing the signal from a particular location. This study represents the first direct test of the hypothesis that territorial residents can learn about a specific property of a neighbour's acoustic signals and the location from which these are normally produced as a result of repeated exposures to the signal. We suggest that reduced aggression between territorial neighbours could be partially mediated by habituation to a neighbour's signals and location in bullfrogs.

ID BEHAVIOR; ORGANIZATION; COMPETITION; MONKEYS; MULATTA; RANK
AB Stumptailed macaques use a number of acts to interrupt and disrupt affiliative interactions involving other group members. In this paper I describe such interference and raise the hypothesis that it functions to sabotage the formation and/or maintenance of affiliative interactions involving others. My results show that disrupting was due to the saboteur's behaviour, and that the likelihood of receiving some behaviours used to interfere (e.g. aggression, threats, etc.) was significantly higher when animals were involved in an affiliation, than when alone. In addition, the sort of affinitive act was unrelated to the type of interference; the behaviour used to interrupt depended on which of the actors (giver, recipient, or both) was to be driven away; and interrupting an affinitive episode inhibited renewing the session. Yet, to fully account for the function of interference, additional studies are necessary to reveal decisions concerning whom to interrupt, and what are the long-term consequences of interference.

AB In long-lived, socially monogamous species with biparental care, careful selection of a suitable breeding partner can be expected to enhance reproductive success. Both sexes are therefore expected to be choosy and to sample a number of potential mates before making a final choice. We investigated mate-sampling behaviour in 1-year-old barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, upon their first return to the natal colony. Barnacle geese sampled mates by forming trial liaisons with a number of potential partners before final pair formation, at 2-3 years of age. Heavy 1-year-old females were more likely to engage in trial liaisons than other females, One-year-old males that engaged in trial liaisons, on the other hand, had more adult-like plumage, but did not differ in any other respect from 1-year-old males that were often alone. In addition, male trial partners of 1-year-old females were often older than 1 year. Differences in plumage characteristics between 1-year-old males reflected differences in social status. The observed patterns are suggestive of preferences for certain types of trial partners, where males and females differ in the characters they value most in a potential mate. However, intrasexual competition could also play a role. Birds benefited directly from engaging in trial liaisons at an early age because of reduced aggression from older birds when they were in the company of a trial partner. There were also long-term benefits of engaging in trial liaisons. Females that were often in the company of older trial partners enjoyed higher reproductive success later in life. This was not because they were larger and heavier than females that were mostly alone or with 1-year-old trial partners. Finally, both males and females that found their final partner early in life had a lower age at first reproduction. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In social insects the division of tabour will reflect the trade-off between behavioural flexibility and physical specialization of workers. We investigated this trade-off in two social aphids: Pseudoregma sundanica (Van der Goot) and P. nicolaiae (Takahashi) (Hormaphididae: Cerataphidini). They are sibling species that produce dimorphic first-instar larvae of soldiers and nonsoldiers. Defence is ostensibly the task of soldiers, but P. sundanica is also defended by tending ants. We determined the extent to which physical castes are developed in both species by measuring the lengths of various body parts of soldier and nonsoldier first instars. We also measured the defensive behaviour of soldiers and nonsoldiers by confronting them with aggressive stimuli. The soldiers and nonsoldiers of P. nicolaiae were morphologically and behaviourally more similar than those of P. sundanica, and the nonsoldiers showed greater behavioural plasticity. This suggests a more flexible division of tabour in P. nicolaiae, with nonsoldiers being recruited to defensive tasks. Across both castes first-instar larvae were also more aggressive in P. nicolaiae than in P. sundanica. We relate these findings to the differences in ant tending in the two species. The data suggest that the caste structure of the social aphids is more complex than expected, and is perhaps more similar to that of the social Hymenoptera.

AB Previous research suggests a link between innovation rate, neophobia and behavioural flexibility in the field and in captivity. In this paper we examine three correlates of flexibility in five opportunistic avian species that feed together in Barbados: three Passeriformes (the Carib grackle, Quiscalus lugubris, the Lesser Antillean bullfinch, Loxigilla noctis, and the shiny cowbird, Molothrus bonariensis) and two Columbiformes (the zenaida dove, Zenaida aurita and the common ground dove, Columbina passerina). The flexibility measures are habituation to a new food patch, willingness to feed near a novel object (neophobia) and ability to obtain food from a new apparatus (problem solving). Passeriformes (in particular grackles and bullfinches), as predicted from their high innovation rate in anecdotal data, outperformed Columbiformes on all three measures. The three tests yielded similar results in the field and in captivity. Grackles, which are members of the most innovative passeriform genus in North America after Corvus, were by far the most successful species on the problem solving test. Individual variation in attempts to obtain food from the new apparatus was predicted by latency to approach it, which was in turn predicted by latency to feed near novel objects. This study provides experimental evidence, both in the field and in captivity, for the taxonomic differences in innovative flexibility seen in anecdotal data and suggests that neophobia is an important intervening variable in response to new feeding problems.

AB To examine whether male-male interactions constrain female choice in the sand goby, we compared female preferences expressed under three conditions that varied in the degree of male-male interaction with matings that resulted from free interactions. The experiment consisted of two phases. In the initial phase a transparent divider separated the female from two males. During this stage the males were either isolated by an opaque divider, had visual contact through a transparent divider, or were allowed full interaction by having access to each other's compartments. The second phase of the experiment was initiated by the removal of all dividers and terminated when the female spawned with one of the males. When there was no initial contact between the males, females spawned with the male they showed a preference for in the first phase of the experiment. In the other two male treatments, females were inconsistent in their spawning choice. Females did not seem to choose dominant males and neither did male aggressive interactions seem to limit a female's possibilities to spawn with a particular male. The results suggest that male-male interaction may affect the ability of females to evaluate males, in part because of courtship interference between males. Male-male interaction therefore seems to impede female choice and consequently may hinder sexual selection due to mate choice. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many studies indicate prey organisms select microhabitats with high structural complexity as a way of reducing risk of predation. We used laboratory experiments to show that damselfly larvae, Ischnura verticalis, suffer higher predation rates from pumpkinseed sunfish in low-density vegetation. However, larvae do not preferentially occupy microhabitats with high vegetation density in either the presence or absence of sunfish; when given a choice, the number of larvae per stem of vegetation was equal across all densities of vegetation. That larvae do not congregate in dense vegetation may reflect costs of aggressive interactions. Results from laboratory experiments indicated larval interactions increase conspicuous behaviours (most notably swimming) and consequently increase fish predation. A subsequent experiment indicated that frequency of larval interactions increases with increased vegetation density when number of larvae/stem is constant. Thus, larval microhabitat selection may reflect a trade-off between reduced risk of predation in areas of high vegetation density, caused by reduced fish foraging ability, and increased aggressive larval interactions, due to decreased proximity of larvae.

AB Burying beetles, Nicrophorus spp., inter the carcasses of small vertebrates as a food source for their offspring. Females can bury a carcass and rear a brood on it alone, but are frequently assisted by a male whose presence reduces the risk of the carcass being taken over by other beetles. However, the male often stays for longer than the carcass is vulnerable to take-over, and he cares for the brood without conferring any further benefits on it. In a laboratory experiment using N. vespilloides, we found that, in the absence of competitors, male assistance conferred no advantages on the brood for which he was caring, but significantly increased the subsequent reproductive success of his mate, in terms of the mass and rate of development of a second brood, reared alone. We suggest that this is due to a reduced parental effort of assisted females, who spent less time feeding offspring and more time resting than unassisted females whilst rearing their first broods. In the field, a female is unlikely to pair with the same male for consecutive broods, so we discuss the possible benefits a male may accrue from increasing his mate's reproductive success. We also discuss the relevance of these results to our understanding of the evolution of biparental care in birds. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB In this study I examined how the paper wasp, Polistes fuscatus, defends a colony when faced with a vertebrate attack. I looked for a division of labour in defensive behaviour within a colony and examined whether this behaviour changes over the colony cycle. The colonies were presented with a model of an adult red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus, and a speaker that vibrated the comb. There was a pronounced division of labour in the defence against vertebrate predators within a colony. The queen was consistently the most aggressive individual in the colony. The subordinate foundresses and workers both became more aggressive towards a vertebrate predator as they aged. Gynes and males did not participate in colony defence. The level of aggression in colony members of P. fuscatus appears to be related to the reproductive investment of the colony. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Colonial orb-weaving spiders provide insight into the proximate mechanisms by which social animals space themselves within a group. We examined mechanisms for the temporal patterns of web building that determine individual positions in Metepeira incrassata (Araneidae) colonies. The spiders display a characteristic age-related sequence of daily web building, with larger spiders completing their webs significantly earlier than smaller ones. We used data on behavioural interactions, web building, prey capture and predator attacks to evaluate four hypotheses. (1) Larger spiders are better competitors and pre-empt optimal spatial positions. (2) Smaller spiders reduce competition with larger individuals by building webs later. (3) Prey captured by different size classes is available at different times. (4) Differential predation risk determines web-building times. Large individuals dominated behavioural interactions. Disturbances by larger spiders during web construction significantly delayed the completion of smaller individuals' webs and precipitated movements to new web sites. One prediction of the first hypothesis, that spatial needs translate into earlier building, was confirmed by significantly earlier web building by mature females with egg sacs (which are unable to move their egg sacs:) compared with same-sized females without eggs (which can change locations freely). Experiments to determine whether the presence of large spiders inhibited the web building of smaller individuals were equivocal. Prey availability and risk of predation are not factors affecting web-building patterns. Sequential web building appears to be a result of both larger spiders competing to pre-empt space from one another and smaller individuals attempting to reduce conflict during web construction. Sequential web building is a proximate mechanism that influences spacing among colonial orb-weaving spiders and helps shape the typical hierarchical size distribution of spiders within the colony. Similar spacing mechanisms may be seen in colonial birds and marine invertebrates. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We know little about how signals are used during territory establishment, particularly when potential competitors are separated by distances that are typical of those between neighbours. I studied the effects of residence time on the display behaviour of male Anolis sagrei lizards in long- and short-distance contexts. In the long-distance context, the habitat patches of two male lizards were 5 m apart, separating the males by a distance typical of that in territorial neighbourhoods. For the short-distance context, I placed two males in one habitat patch. In both contexts, either 1-day residents were paired with new arrivals, or both individuals were new arrivals. In the long-distance contexts only, I also created situations in which both individuals were 1-day residents. Residence time affected the relative frequencies of headbob displays ('bobbing displays' and 'nodding displays'). However, the direction of the effect depended on opponent proximity. In long-distance contexts, 1-day residents performed fewer bobbing displays relative to nodding displays than did new arrivals; in short-distance contexts 1-day residents performed more bobbing displays relative to nodding displays than did new arrivals. The results suggest that signalling during territory establishment is governed by a qualitatively different set of rules when potential competitors are at short versus long distances.

AB We measured the behavioural and hormonal responses to capture stress in male red-sided garter snakes. Four hours of capture stress resulted in no suppression of mating behaviour relative to control individuals. In contrast, the same stress resulted in a significant increase in plasma levels of corticosterone and a significant decrease in plasma levels of testosterone. There was a significant negative correlation between plasma levels of corticosterone and testosterone in both control and capture-stress groups, suggesting that the increase in corticosterone directly drives the decrease in testosterone. While there was no relation between body size and initial plasma levels of the two steroids, longer individuals had a significantly greater increase in corticosterone following capture stress than did shorter individuals. Snakes display indeterminate growth, suggesting that older individuals have decreased sensitivity to negative feedback in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and thus hypersecrete glucocorticoids. These results suggest that male red-sided garter snakes have uncoupled their behavioural stress response from their hormonal stress response to maximize reproductive opportunities.

AB Hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, sometimes exchange shells after a period of shell rapping, when the initiating or attacking crab brings its shell rapidly and repeatedly into contact with the shell of the noninitiator or defender in a series of bouts. Bouts are separated by pauses, and raps within bouts are separated by very short periods called 'gaps'. Since within-contest variation is missed when signals are studied by averaging performance rates over entire contests, we analysed the fine within-bout structure of this repeated, aggressive signal. We found that the pattern is consistent with high levels of fatigue in initiators. The duration of the gaps between individual raps increased both within bouts and from bout to bout, and we conclude that this activity is costly to perform. Furthermore, long pauses between bouts is correlated with increased vigour of rapping in the subsequent bout, which suggests that the pause allows for recovery from fatigue induced by rapping. These between-bout pauses may be assessed by noninitiators and provide a signal of stamina. (C) 2000 The Association Tor the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examined the effects of social environment on food-asociated calling of cotton-top tamarins, Saguinus oedipus, in two experiments. In experiment 1, we compared the food-associated calling behaviour of six juvenile tamarins living in their natal groups with their calling behaviour 9 months after being removed from family groups and paired. In experiment 2, we studied food-associated calling behaviour of nine cotton-top tamarins immediately before and after removal from their natal groups and pairing. The tamarins underwent three separate developmental processes in their calling behaviour. Animals removed from their natal groups showed an immediate reduction in vocalizations other than food-associated calls (C and D chirps). The development of precise adult forms of C and D chirps was more gradual and was a function of time since removal from their natal group rather than time since pairing. Finally, the postremoval tamarins persisted in applying C chirps to nonfood objects and showed no correlation between C-chirp rate and food preference, which is typical of immature tamarins. We conclude that social status plays an important role in the development of adult forms and usage of food-associated calls. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated which of three hypotheses (better option, incompatibility or asynchronous arrival) best explains divorce in the common tern. One partner did not return the next year in 18.5% of 150 pairs. Among the 106 pairs in which both mates returned, the divorce rate was 18.9%. We found no significant differences in: breeding performance or condition in relation to the probability of divorce; quality of previous mates and new mates,mean age in relation to pair bond status; breeding success before and after divorce nor did this differ from breeding success of reunited pairs. Hence the better option and incompatibility hypotheses were not supported. However, divorce was more likely in pairs in which mates arrived asynchronously on the breeding grounds, supporting the asynchronous arrival hypothesis. Median arrival asynchrony for divorced pairs was 7.5 days and for reunited pairs 2 days; mates arriving more than 16 days apart always split up. About 20% of divorced birds lost breeding status in the year of divorce, probably as a consequence of their late arrival. Our results suggest that terns search for a new mate as soon as they arrive on the breeding grounds and that mates remain faithful to each other to avoid the costs of searching for a new partner. Thus, synchrony in arrival facilitates pair bond maintenance rather than asynchrony promoting divorce, since divorce appears to be a side-effect of asynchrony and not an active decision.

AB Extrapair paternity varies from 0 to over 70% of young among various populations of birds. Comparative studies have suggested that this variation is related to nesting density, breeding synchrony and the proportion of extrapair copulations. We used minisatellite DNA fingerprinting to examine levels of extrapair paternity in Ross's geese, Chen rossi, and lesser snow geese, C. caerulescens c. (hereafter snow geese) nesting in the largest known goose colony in the world. These geese have one of the highest known percentages of extrapair copulation (46-56% of all attempted copulations), and all of these appeared to be forced. Among all successful copulations, 33 and 38% were extrapair in Ross's and snow geese, respectively. Despite the high percentage of extrapair copulations, extrapair paternity was low in both Ross's and snow geese (2-5% of young). Extrapair paternity was not related to nest density in either species. However, in snow geese, extrapair paternity was more likely to occur in nests of females that nested asynchronously, either early or late in the season. This is one of a few reported examples of a negative relationship between extrapair paternity and breeding synchrony. Extrapair young also tended to come from eggs laid later in the clutch. Although forced extrapair copulations appear to be a relatively inefficient reproductive tactic for males, they may provide a reproductive advantage for some males.

AB The focus in the study of pathways between the brain and the immune system has, until recently,been on brain-to-immune communication. In the present review we focus instead on immune-to-brain pathways by which events in the immune system can alter neural-activity and thus behaviour. We argue that aspects of the immune system function as a diffuse sense organ, informing the brain about events in the body regarding infection and injury; that the proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-l play key communicative roles in this regard, signalling the brain via both blood-borne and neural routes; and that the brain plays a major role in coordinating host defence. Behaviour is part of host defence, and is shown to be integrated into the pattern of immune processes. We argue that the circuitry that has evolved to mediate these effects has taken on a wider role in regulating behaviour, and we discuss implications for understanding 'stress'. We conclude that immune processes may be a major source of behavioural regulation. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Studies of parental investment in mammals have frequently used suckling behaviour to estimate energy transfer from mother to offspring, and consequently to measure maternal input. Such studies assume that the more an offspring sucks, the more milk it will receive. This assumption has been questioned, and a review of the literature found little support for it. To test if suckling behaviour provided an accurate index of milk or energy intake we used a radioactive isotope technique to label the milk of thoroughbred mares and to measure milk transfer to foals. We found no significant linear relationship between usual measures of suckling behaviour and milk or energy intake. No behaviours associated with suckling nor with characteristics of mares and foals improved the relationship; only the number of butts associated with each suck episode even approached significance. If we had used suckling behaviour to test theories on differential maternal investment our conclusions would have been in error. For example, female foals tended to suck for longer than males did but there was no difference in the amount of milk transferred. Consequently, we show that measures of sucking behaviour do not adequately predict milk intake in the domestic horse and we suggest that conclusions about differential maternal investment in mammals based on suckling behaviour are likely to be in error.

TI Alliances and reproductive success in Camargue stallions
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID FERAL HORSES; COOPERATION; HERD; BEHAVIOR
AB A study of a herd of Camargue horses, Equus caballus, showed that while the majority of high-ranking stallions held single-male harems, some sons of low-ranking mares, being low ranking themselves, formed alliances that could last a lifetime. The two stallions were each other's closest associate and preferential grooming partner. Alliances were based on coalitions in which either both partners confronted an intruder synchronously or the dominant of the pair tended the female(s) while the subordinate simultaneously displayed towards the rival. Alliance partners were of similar age but were not more closely related to each other than to other stallions in the herd. Long-term paternity data revealed that subordinates sired close to a quarter of the foals born into the alliance group, and significantly more foals than low-ranking stallions in the herd adopting a 'sneak'-mating strategy. The dominant appeared to benefit from the presence of his subordinate partner. Fights occurred all year round, and the subordinate stallion of each alliance pair fought outside competitors more than twice as often as the dominant. Forming short-term alliances before defending mares on their own may enhance long-term reproductive success for both partners. Other benefits to both partners include higher survivorship of their foals and increased access to proven reproductive mares. These results suggest that the relationship between alliance partners is based on mutualism, but several conditions for reciprocity seem to be fulfilled: the benefit to the dominant (assistance in fights), and the benefit to the subordinate (access to reproduction), are both costly to the other partner and delayed in time.

AB We monitored raccoons, Procyon lotor, in southern Texas during the 1990-1992 mating seasons to describe mating behaviour and identify factors affecting consortship success. During most of this study, raccoons were spatially aggregated, with female home ranges congregated around permanent water sources and larger home ranges of male groups encompassing each female group. Consortship success varied among males and ranged from zero to six females per male within a mating season. Individual females consorted with one to four different males during an oestrous period; however, most (62%) females consorted with only one male during their oestrus. Dominance through overt conflict appeared to influence male consortship success. During two mating seasons, one male from each group consorted with females on more days than all other males combined. Body weight of males was positively correlated with number of consortship days. As synchrony of oestrus increased, variance in number of consortship days among males decreased, and access to oestrous females increased for subordinate males. Wounding among males increased during the mating season, and was more frequent for males than for females. The mating system, as determined by consortship behaviour, appeared to shift between polygyny and promiscuity and possibly varied annually as a result of the timing of oestrous cycles.

AB When novel behaviour patterns spread through animal populations, typically one animal will initiate the diffusion. It is not known whether such 'innovators' are particularly creative individuals, individuals exposed to the appropriate environmental contingencies, or individuals in a particular motivational state. We describe three experiments that investigated the factors influencing foraging;innovation in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We exposed small laboratory populations of fish to novel foraging tasks, which involved exploration and problem solving to locate a novel food source. Experiments 1 and 2 found that (1) females were more likely to innovate than males, (2) food-deprived fish were more likely to innovate than nonfood-deprived subjects, and (3) smaller fish were more likely to innovate than larger fish. We suggest that the sex difference may reflect parental investment asymmetries in males and females. Experiment 3 found that past innovators were more likely to innovate than past noninnovators. Collectively, the results suggest that differences in foraging innovation in guppies are best accounted for by differences in motivational state, but, in addition, guppies may vary in their predisposition to innovate.

AB Female Drosophila melanogaster were artificially selected for fast and slow time to remate (denoted 'high' and 'low' selection regimes, respectively). Both selection regimes and a control were replicated three times. Correlated responses to selection in;females and in males were measured. A significant direct response to selection for time to remating was found in females from both selection regimes. Remating frequency of females showed a correlated response only in the females from the lines selected for faster time to remating. Time-to first mating of virgin females showed nd correlated response in either selection regime. No correlated response was found in males for time to remate, remating frequency or time to first mating of virgins, indicating that genetic correlations between the sexes do not influence the evolution of these traits in this population of D. melanogaster. There was no direct response to artificial selection for the ability of first males to deter females from remating. However, we found that the genotype of the first male to mate with a female could influence her time to remate; base stock males were better at deterring females from remating than were males from any of the selection lines.

AB In central Oklahoma, collared lizard males display age-dependent differences in social behaviour, whereby sexually mature first-year (yearling) males adopt subordinate tactics, and males 2 years and older establish and defend all-purpose territories. We tested the hypothesis that the social activities of adult males inhibit the expression of territorial tactics in yearling males by recording the behaviour of yearlings in the presence of adult males, when all adult males were removed from study plots for 4 days, and then again when adult males were returned to their territories. The rates of yearling male patrol, display and intrasexual encounters increased during removals, especially during the last 2 days, following which the rates of these behaviour patterns declined when adult males were replaced. Yearling males also increased the frequency with which they interacted with females when adult males were removed. Moreover, the duration of intersexual encounters during the last 2 days of removal was over twice that during the first 2 days of removal, suggesting that females became more receptive to yearling males the longer adult males were absent. Our results suggest that the stable age-related behavioural differences in male collared lizards is governed by social feedback, where sexually mature yearling males are capable of displaying territorial behaviour patterns but are inhibited from doing so by the activities of adult males.

ID WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS; OVERPRODUCTION; DIALECTS; PERIOD; FIELD
AB In the past decade there has been widespread acceptance of the idea that the use of live, socially interactive tutors in song learning experiments produces results that differ dramatically from, and are more valid than, results obtained with tape, tutors. The influential series of experiments by Baptista & Petrinovich (1984, Animal Behaviour, 32, 172-181, 1986, Animal Behaviour, 34, 1359-1371; Petrinovich Sr Baptista 1987, Animal Behaviour 35, 961-974) have promoted this view, and their results have been widely accepted. Baptista & Petrinovich's results have led them and others to question whether there are age-limited sensitive phases for song learning, as Marler's (1970, Journal of Comparative Physiology and Psychology Monographs, 71, 1-25) early studies an the white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys; suggested, and led them to argue that interactive tutoring produces essentially open-ended learning. I argue here that this view is mistaken, and that the sensitive phase for song learning in the white-crowned sparrow is identical for live and tape tutors and is restricted to the first few months of life,:Baptista Sr Petrinovich presented live and tape tutors for different periods to their subjects. Type of tutor (live versus tape);is confounded with duration of exposure to tutors. As a consequence, their experiments confound: two different forms of song learning that occur at different ages, and give the mistaken appearance of an extended sensitive phase when Live tutors are used.

TI Mate guarding and risk assessment by male mountain baboons during

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; PATTERNS; MONKEYS
AB Aggressive herding of females is a frequent but not invariant response by male savannah baboons, Papio cynocephalus, to encounters with other troops. While males in some troops are consistently more likely to herd than those in others, not all inter-troop encounters result in herding, even within particular troops. This suggests that males assess the risk of male invasion posed by each encounter and respond accordingly. We used data from baboon troops in the Drakensberg mountains to determine the rules males follow in deciding whether to herd. Consistent differences between troops were explained only by the adult sex ratio. Males were more likely to herd if the sex ratio of their own troop was female biased, a finding that is concordant with the observation that males are more likely to immigrate into troops where the sex ratio is more female biased than the population average. Differences within troops were a consequence only of encounter distance, with herding being more likely at closer distances. We found a negative correlation between the angle of approach to the other troop and the subsequent angle of deflection. We interpret this to mean that herding functions to increase the distance between the interacting troops, thereby curtailing opportunities for strange males to inspect the troop and determine its sex ratio. In this way, possibly unlike those in other populations, the decision rules of these male baboons are geared to protecting longer-term reproductive prospects.

AB Using field experiments, we investigated the development of parent-offspring recognition in the thick-billed murre, Uria lomvia. Cross-fostering experiments (N = 73) showed that the likelihood of parents accepting a foreign chick decreased with chick age. Simultaneous-choice playback experiments demonstrated that chicks discriminate between the calls of their parents and both strange and familiar adult conspecifics from as early as 3 days old. In presentation experiments with chicks of fledging age (greater than or equal to 14 days), adults responded more strongly to the calls of their own chicks than to other familiar chicks from the same breeding ledge. Results are consistent with those of earlier studies of parent-offspring recognition in the congeneric and ecologically similar common murre, U. aalge, which were among the first to suggest that parent birds and their chicks can identify each other's calls.

AB I surveyed and described modulated, non-vocal, mechanical sounds of the lek-breeding Neotropical manakins (Pipridae). Variation among manakin species in mechanical sound production, repertoire size, acoustic structure, associated feather specialization, and mechanical sound production mechanisms were analysed comparatively in the context of a phylogenetic hypothesis for the family. Mechanical sound production has probably evolved five or six times independently and been lost once within the 42 species of manakins. Complex mechanical sound repertoires have also evolved independently several times. Acoustic structure of these sounds indicates that at least four different physical mechanisms of mechanical sound production have evolved: short, broad-frequency spectrum pulses; short, low-frequency pulses; aerodynamic vortices, and harmonic oscillations. All well-known mechanical sounds in manakins are associated with obvious wing movements and sexually dimorphic wing feather specializations. Both primary and secondary wing feather specializations have evolved convergently within the family for the production of short, broad-frequency mechanical sound pulses. Two less well-known manakin clades also have tail feather specializations that may function in mechanical sound production. A concentrated-changes test documented that the dynamic patterns of evolution in mechanical sound production in the polygynous manakins are highly unlikely by chance alone. Intersexual selection for acrobatic display may have created subsequent opportunities for the evolution of novel preferences for incidental non-vocal sounds produced by acrobatic movements. Novel female preferences for these mechanical sounds led to further elaboration of these sounds and to the evolution of complex mechanical sound repertoires in independent lineages of the family.

AB The purpose of this controlled-breeding study was to investigate the viability consequences of female choice and sequential polyandry for offspring in a way that would separate the influences of these two aspects of female sexual behaviour. Female sierra dome spiders, Neriene litigiosa (= Linyphia litigiosa) typically mate two to three times before production of their first batch of eggs, although some females (ca 16%) mate only once. Strong fighters are preferred as first mates and principal sires. Large males that give a vigorous performance during copulatory courtship are preferred as sires among a female's secondary mates. In this study, the number of matings by free-living females was experimentally controlled and the size and copulatory vigour of all the females' mates were recorded. At the end of the breeding season, the females were collected and their broods were obtained in captivity. Randomly chosen subsets of 28 female's offspring were reared under standard conditions during the following spring. The spiderlings were reared for 27 days in the company of siblings under conditions that would encourage the expression of genetic variation in viability, and growth and survivorship were monitored. After controlling for maternal effects (i.e. female size and oviposition date) and variance in feeding opportunities among rearing groups, both mate number and mate size were positively and independently related to offspring growth rates and the size of offspring attained after emergence from the natal cocoon. The results support the hypotheses that the preference for large males yields viability benefits to offspring and that polyandry can augment the benefits of selective mating.

AB This study explored some aspects of chimpanzee social behaviour using mitochondrial DNA sequence data as an index of matrilineal relatedness. The hypothesis tested was that matrilineal relatedness predicts social affiliative preference in wild chimpanzees. Several behavioural measures of individual social preference were examined for chimpanzees from Kanyawara community in Uganda's Kibale Forest. None of the four pairs of strongly affiliative males in this community could have been maternal brothers, since no pair shared the same mitochondrial DNA sequence. Fourteen chimpanzee communities outside Kibale, for which no direct behavioural data were available, were also studied by using communal nesting as a rough index of affiliative preference. Again, chimpanzees that nested together did not tend to be matrilineally related. The results suggest that kin selection is weaker than previously thought as a force promoting intra-community affiliation in chimpanzees. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Current theory predicts that fish should show size-assortative shoaling in order to avoid increased predation risk by being the odd one out (oddity effect), or in order to minimize competition for food. I investigated with three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, the importance of the oddity effect in promoting size-assortative shoaling. The greater an individual assesses its predation risk the less actively it is likely to forage. Hence, I examined with small and large fish whether an individual's foraging activity depends on its appearance (size) in relation to that of others in a shoal. The shoals were composed of three, six and 12 fish. Either one individual deviated in size from the rest of the shoal members or all the fish in a shoal were of similar size. When a stickleback was larger than others in the shoal its foraging activity was lower than that of large individuals in a shoal dominated by large fish or those in a size-assorted shoal. Small sticklebacks, however, did not change their foraging activity on the basis of their appearance in a shoal. These responses of individuals to their appearance did not depend on shoal size nor on the presence or absence of a predator. The results suggest that the oddity effect is likely to prevent larger sticklebacks from joining shoals of smaller individuals. They also suggest that factors other than the oddity effect, potentially food competition, may be more important in leading individuals to avoid the company of larger ones and prefer shoaling with matching conspecifics.

AB Artificial traits such as coloured leg bands may affect an individual's mating success, as shown for some birds. One explanation is that colour-matching with a sexual ornament affects the individual's sexual attractiveness. This study reports a colour-band experiment with free-living bluethroats, Luscinia s. svecica, a species where males have a distinct blue and chestnut throat and upper breast. There was no apparent difference in pairing success between males with ornament-matching colour bands (blue and orange) and males with non-ornamental colour bands. However, males with ornamental bands guarded their mates less intensely and spent more time singing, performing song flights and intruding into neighbours' territories than males with non-ornamental bands. We conclude that colour bands affect the trade-off between mate guarding and advertisement behaviour in a way that is consistent with the hypothesis that bands with ornamental colours improve a male's attractiveness. The results are in concordance with a previous study of the same population, showing that males with experimentally reduced attractiveness guarded their mates more closely and advertised less for additional mates, than non-manipulated males.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID NEOTROPICAL TREEFROG; AGGRESSIVE CALLS; COQUI
AB The vocal repertoire of male Eleutherodactylus and the communicative significance of two calls (trill and courtship call) were investigated under natural conditions on the British Virgin Islands. Interspersed with two-note advertisement calls, males uttered trill calls, which typically consisted of an introductory note followed by five to 13 rapidly repeated notes. The introductory note and the repeated notes were within the range of the dominant frequencies of the first and second note of the advertisement call, respectively, but their mean frequencies were 5-8% higher. The temporal and spectral characteristics of the trill and advertisement calls were similar on three islands (Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Guana), except that the number of repeated notes in the trill was higher on Guana. Body size and air temperature had no detectable effects on the call characteristics. In response to experimental playback of trill calls (either synthesized or constructed from actual calls), males produced more trills in the period following the stimulus than during the baseline. During the playback itself, five or 22 males produced an unusually high number of trills that alternated with the stimulus trills. These responses suggest that the trill is an aggressive call used in the defence of a calling territory. In response to the playback of courtship calls (multi-note calls that males uttered only in the presence of a female and that differed from the trill call mainly in the dominant frequency of the repeated notes), 11 of 28 males left their perch sites and nine approached the speaker. In contrast, males never left their perches during the baseline or the trill stimulus. These responses suggest that males may exploit the courtship calls of rivals to obtain mates through interference. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ecology and behaviour of non-territorial owls are little known. During a population peak of snowshoe hares, Lepus americanus, the main prey of great horned owls, Bubo virginianus, in the boreal forest, fledglings were equipped with radiotransmitters, and 30 successful dispersers were monitored in 1988-1991. Of those, nine became resident floaters in the study area. Transient floaters were not recorded, although floaters shifted the centre of their home ranges more than territorial owls. Floater home ranges were about five times larger than defended territories, but the space use did not differ significantly. Floaters intruded regularly into territories and their locations overlapped broadly with those of territory owners and other floaters, but were concentrated on the periphery of defended territories. This is consistent with other evidence that territorial behaviour limits the breeding density of great horned owls even at extreme peaks of prey availability. None of the monitored floaters bred as secondary females, and the intrusion rates and movement patterns of floaters did not change during the fertile period of females, as predicted if male floaters were seeking extra-pair copulations.

AB Copulation solicitation displays were used to investigate whether female song sparrows are especially stimulated by the songs their mates sing. Eight of nine (88.9%) recently captured oestradiol-treated female song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, gave more solicitation displays and displayed more intensely for song types recorded from repertoires of their mates than for songs from other males from the local population. This is the first study to show female sexual preferences for mate song in songbirds and to demonstrate that female song sparrows discriminate in their sexual responses based on song types. It is not known whether these song preferences influenced females' choice of mate in the field or arose after pair formation. Regardless of origin, especially stimulating songs are likely to be important to the reproductive behaviour of females and could influence the mating success of males.

AB This study investigated the factors affecting the site fidelity of the eastern amberwing dragonfly, Perithemis tenera (Odonata: Anisoptera), following the framework and testing the predictions of a theoretical model (Switzer 1993; Evol. Ecol, 7, 533-555). Male amberwings defended territories around oviposition sites during the day and left the pond vicinity in the evening. Individuals were highly site-faithful between days: 32.5% of the time,males returned to the same oviposition site, and 62.3% of the time males returned to within 3 m of their previous site. Mating success on the pond was temporally predictable and spatially variable. As the model predicted from these habitat characteristics, individuals were more likely to be site-faithful if they had obtained a mating at the site the day before, if their territory was of relatively high quality and when they were older. Males that voluntarily changed oviposition sites between days moved to higher-quality territories. In contrast to some other odonate and avian studies, territory evictions caused considerable site infidelity in amberwings both within and between days. Evictions caused most moves within a day, but the majority of moves between days were voluntary. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Chemical senses mediate several anuran behaviours, including predator avoidance by larval frogs. Predation by garter snakes is an important influence on the survival of post-metamorphic, juvenile toads (Bufo sp.). Studies have shown that visual, rather than chemical, cues are important for predator avoidance in post-metamorphic juvenile bufonids. This study investigated the ability of post-metamorphic, juvenile great plains toads, B. cognatus, and southwestern toads, B. microscaphus, to detect and avoid chemical cues from their respective predators, the eastern plains garter snake, Thamnophis radix, and the wandering garter snake, T. elegans. Juvenile B. cognatus collected in South Dakota were observed on unmarked paper towels significantly more than on similar towels treated with chemical cues from T. radix. Similarly, juvenile B. microscaphus from Arizona were observed on unmarked towels significantly more than on towels marked with chemical cues from T. elegans. Toad avoidance of snake odour was apparently not a generalized response to reptile chemical cues: juvenile B. microscaphus continued to avoid snake odours when these were simultaneously presented with odours from sympatric lizards, Sceloporus undulatus. Hence, juvenile B. cognatus and B. microscaphus apparently detect and avoid chemical cues from snake species that prey on them. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mate removal experiments were conducted to test the hypotheses that vocal duetting functions in pair bond maintenance and/or territory defence in the bay wren, Thryothorus nigricapillus, in the Republic of Panama. Males and females were observed while in established pairs, while alone after mate removal and following the arrival of a new mate. Duet repertoires and precision of duet performance were then compared in birds singing with old and new mates. Another experiment in which males were exchanged between two territories was similarly analysed. These experiments demonstrated that (1) individual repertoires and duet precision do not change following a change in mates, refuting the pair bond maintenance hypothesis, and (2) unpaired birds do not lose their territories, failing to support the hypothesis that duets are necessary for territory defence. Analysis of vocalization rates suggested that male and female songs serve different functions. Male vocal behaviour was sensitive to male mating status: when males were alone, their vocalization rates dramatically increased. However, males answered the songs of a new mate less frequently than they did those of their original mate. These results suggest that unpaired males sing to attract females and that males might use participation in duets to assess new mates. The function of duetting by males in established pairs remains unclear. Female song rates were unaffected by female mating status, suggesting that female songs may be directed to conspecific females. Results also indicated that territory residency may play a more important role in mate acquisition for males than it does for females. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB During incubation female great tits, Parus major, will leave the nest when their mate sings outside the nestbox. Playback was used to simulate such 'calling out' behaviour when the mate was absent in order to investigate whether females could distinguish between the song of their mate and songs from another male. The results were clear-cut, females were called out only by playback of the song of their mate, even when it was preceded by playback of another male. Demonstrations of female songbirds' ability to identify individuals such as mates are rare. This playback paradigm has the potential to be used in further investigations of the ability of females to identify songs. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The importance of male care and the nature of facultative adjustments in female care were assessed by experimentally removing males in pairs of orange-tufted sunbirds, Nectarinia osea, feeding broods of two or three chicks. The predation of all three-chick broods with female-only care suggested that male nest guarding is critical, especially because males also deter infanticidal floater males. Comparison of provisioning and nest guarding behaviour in male-removed and control nests was therefore limited to two-chick broods. As expected, lone females provisioned at a greater rate, but compensated incompletely for the lack of male provisioning effort. Surprisingly, even when provisioning at high rates, lone females still performed the usual levels of nest guarding and nest sanitation. Lower rates of chick mass gain in the nest, and subsequent premature disappearance of fledglings from male-removed broods, confirmed that reduced provisioning to broods of lone females had detrimental effects upon chick fitness. Sunbirds exhibit sex-specific roles in parental care. Female provisioning appears flexible, ensuring adequate care for young in the nest. Nest guarding is incompatible with high foraging effort, but it may be compatible with male non-parental activities such as territorial defence and extra-pair mating. These results concur with recent data concerning male responses to experimentally reduced female care in this species, and are discussed in terms of evolutionary strategies for stable biparental cooperation.

AB Previous studies suggest that the tendency for primates to reconcile after agonistic conflict is related to the quality of relationships between opponents: the 'relationship quality' hypothesis. In addition, reconciliation frequency seems to covary with other social variables such as the rate of allogrooming, the intensity of aggression and the outcome of approaches: the 'systematic variation' hypothesis. It is proposed that such systematic variation should be present not only between different species but also between different groups of the same species. To test these hypotheses, data were collected from two large corral-housed groups of pigtail macaques, Macaca nemestrina, over 7 months. The two groups lived in identical environments but one was well established, the other newly formed. In both groups, conflicts were more frequently reconciled between opponents with strong affiliative ties, as predicted by the relationship quality hypothesis. Members of the well-established group reconciled roughly twice as often as members of the newly formed group. Contrary to the predictions of the systematic variation hypothesis, other social variables did not vary between groups. Members of the well-established group, however, distributed their affiliative behaviour less evenly, focusing their efforts on a relatively small number of partners. The concentrated social networks in the well-established group apparently produced more intense ties, hence increasing the likelihood of reconciliation after conflict. These results show that detailed analyses of social networks provide a tool to investigate the systematic variation hypothesis when variation is subtle, such as between groups of the same species. The study confirms the relationship quality hypothesis at both the within- and between-group level, provides support for a more sophisticated concept of systematic variation, and illustrates the special usefulness of reconciliation measures as a gauge of social integration.

AB Behavioural differences that prevent between-population mating are evolutionarily important if they decrease gene flow and thus facilitate further differentiation. Sexual incompatibility and divergence of mate recognition systems were tested between three geographically isolated populations of the North American mountain dusky salamander, Desmognathus ochrophaeus (Amphibia: Plethodontidae). Significant sexual incompatibility was detected in all pair-wise comparisons between these populations; thus mating was assortative with respect to population. Ethological analyses of the contents of within-population courtship encounters revealed significant quantitative differences between populations in five of 10 behavioural scores. These results support the hypothesis that individuals from isolated populations of D. ochrophaeus do not recognize one another as potential mating partners. Quantitative differences in mate recognition systems may be responsible for this lack of compatibility, and may have evolved incidentally as responses to sexual selection acting differently in each population.

ID FOOD-INTAKE; FLOCKING; HUNGER; SIZE
AB This experiment was designed to quantify the motivation to show socially facilitated behaviour, by equating the increase in feeding behaviour shown by a subject chicken, Gallus gallus domesticus, in response to the sight and sound of another bird feeding, with the feeding behaviour shown by the same subject chicken following food deprivation periods of either 15, 30, 60 or 120 min. Feeding behaviour was recorded both as the amount of food consumed and the number of food pecks in a 30-min trial period. As expected, the amount of food consumed and the number of food pecks following food deprivation increased linearly with length of deprivation and the birds ate more during the social facilitation test than during the control when no stimulus bird was present. When this increase in the amount of food consumed during social facilitation was plotted on a regression line of the amount of food consumed it was found to be equivalent to 27 min of food deprivation. When the number of food pecks due to social facilitation was plotted on the regression line of the number of food pecks it was found to be equivalent to 92 min of food deprivation. A reason for the difference between the two estimates of the motivation to feed in the social facilitation test may be derived from the nature of the relationship between the two variables; food consumed and number of food pecks. A bird cannot eat without pecking at the food, but it can peck at the food without eating it. It is proposed that a satiated bird directs its attention to the food in response to the social facilitation effect of the stimulus bird feeding but eats relatively little. Thus social facilitation seems to act more on the appetitive phase of feeding behaviour than on the consummatory phase. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID FEMALE MATE CHOICE; COPULATORY-BEHAVIOR; MONKEYS; PATTERNS; PRIMATES
AB It has been hypothesized that series mounting (multiple intromissions preceding ejaculation) is functionally related to male-male competition and/or female mate choice. Free-ranging rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, engaged in uninterrupted mount series ranging in duration from less than 1 min to 56 min. Over 90% of mount series interruptions were carried out by males dominant to the male of the mounting pair. Females were more likely to experience mount series interruption during mount series with low-ranking males than with high-ranking males. During mount series, oestrous females approached males other than their copulatory partner at lower rates than they approached non-consort males while in consortship yet not engaged in a mount series. Males ranking in the top 20% of the dominance hierarchy engaged in longer uninterrupted mount series than other males. Males of the lowest 80% of the dominance hierarchy did not increase their mount series durations as a function of (1) the visibility of the copulating pair or (2) the current operational sex ratio. Among males of all ranks, mount series duration did not vary consistently as a function of operational sex ratio, responsibility for proximity maintenance within the mating pair, or female cycle state. Analogous survival analyses using each mount series, rather than each male, as a data point produced similar results. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

TI Evaluating the design of mate-choice experiments: The effect of amplexus
   on mate choice by female barking treefrogs, Hyla gratiosa
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The proper design of mate-choice experiments is critical to detecting and characterizing mating preferences. Female anuran amphibians tested in mate-choice experiments are almost always collected in amplexus (i.e. after they have chosen a mate); it has been assumed that these females are as discriminating as they are before they enter amplexus. This assumption was tested by testing females of the barking treefrog, Hyla gratiosa, twice within the same night, once before they entered amplexus ('before' test) and once after ('after' test). Two such experiments were conducted in which females were given a choice between two calls that differed either in repetition rate or fundamental frequency. In both experiments, the proportion of females choosing each alternative did not differ between the before and after tests. Some females switched their choice between the before and after tests; in both experiments, equal numbers of females switched in one direction as in the other. The response of females in the after tests was not affected by either the time that they had spent in amplexus or the time of night when they were tested. Females that had not been tested earlier in the season took significantly less time to make their choice in the after test than in the before test, but females that had been previously tested did not. The results support the assumption that female anuran amphibians captured in amplexus are as discriminating as they are when first selecting mates in natural choruses.

AB Insect parasitoids can be grouped by their pattern of brood production: 'gregarious' parasitoids can produce multiple offspring per host, but 'solitary' parasitoids can produce only a single offspring per host because their larval stages engage in lethal contest competition to monopolize the host resource. Theoretical and empirical studies have largely overlooked the possibility that solitary parasitoids may lay clutches of more than a single egg, leading to obligate siblicide. When this possibility has been recognized at all, it has been treated under the rubric of self-superparasitism (in which a parasitoid deposits eggs on the same host during two or more distinct host encounters). It is argued here, however, that multiple-egg clutches and self-superparasitism are fundamentally different behaviour patterns, entailing different potential costs and benefits. These differences are linked to variation in age structure within broods (self-superparasitism can produce mixed-age offspring within broods) and host quality assessment problems that are specific to self-superparasitism (during a second encounter, the parasitoid may not be able to assess its prior oviposition behaviour on the host). Clutch size was investigated in a solitary parasitoid wasp, Comperiella bifasciata (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), that commonly produces multiple-egg clutches. Clutch size varied in response to aspects of the environment that were likely to shape the costs and benefits of multiple-egg clutches: larger clutches were produced when the parasitoid (1) had no contact with high-quality hosts and (2) experienced a high density of conspecific female parasitoids. Two types of costs are associated with depositing multiple-egg clutches: the opportunity cost of the extra egg(s) and the direct cost of the time required to deposit them. Multiple-egg clutches may represent a conditional strategy that increases reproductive success. A review of the literature shows that multiple-egg clutches are a widespread feature of the reproductive behaviour of solitary parasitoids. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The stalking behaviour of four species of jumping spiders, Portia fimbriata, P. labiata, P. schultzi and P. africana, was examined to determine whether Portia opportunistically exploits situations in which the prey spider is distracted by environmental disturbances; Disturbances were created mainly by wind blowing on webs and a magnet shaking webs. All four Pol lia species moved significantly further during disturbance than during non-disturbance, a behaviour labelled 'opportunistic smokescreen behaviour'. Portia can discriminate between spiders and other prey such as live insects, wrapped-up insects in the web, and egg sacs, because Portia used opportunistic smokescreen behaviour only against spiders and not against these other types of prey. If the location of disturbances and the location of prey differ, Portia can accurately discriminate between them. Portia's smokescreen behaviour apparently is a true predatory tactic because Por fia attacked prey more often during disturbances than at other times. Smokescreen behaviour appears to work in part because the disturbances that Portia uses for smokescreens interfere with the prey's ability to sense Portia's stalking movements.

AB Apocephalus paraponerae (Diptera: Phoridae) parasitizes workers of the giant tropical ant, Paraponera clavata (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), in Central America. When female parasitoids locate fighting or injured workers of this species, they deposit one or more eggs in them and feed from wounds. Male parasitoids are also attracted to hosts for feeding and to locate females for mating. In a series of experiments it was demonstrated that males and females of this parasitoid were attracted to two products of the mandibular glands of P. clavata, 4-methyl-3-heptanone and 4-methyl-3-heptanol. These compounds are produced in the mandibular glands of numerous ant species and serve as alarm pheromones in some species. Phorid parasitoids of ants may routinely use host-produced pheromones to locate hosts, and behavioural interactions between ants and their parasitoids may have shaped the use of these pheromone systems by both interactants.

   INFECTION; SEXUAL SELECTION
AB The detection and avoidance of parasitized males may be a component of female mate choice. In rodents a reduction in pain sensitivity (analgesia) is induced by exposure to actual or potential danger and threatening stimuli, facilitating the expression of various active (e.g. fleeing) and passive (e.g immobilization) defence responses. Pain, or more appropriately, nociceptive sensitivity (latency of a foot-lifting response to a 50 degrees C thermal surface) was examined in female mice, Mus musculus domesticus, that were exposed to the urine and other odorous secretions of male mice sub-clinically infected for 20 days with the naturally occurring trichostrongylid nematode parasite, Heligmosomoides polygyrus. A 30-min exposure to the odours of the parasitized males induced an endogenous opioid peptide mediated analgesia in the female mice, whereas a 1-min exposure elicited a shorter duration and lower-amplitude analgesia of a non-opioid (serotonergic) nature. Similarly, in an odour preference test, female mice displayed a reduced preference for and aversion to the odours of parasitized males, spending more time in a Y-maze in the vicinity of the odours of an uninfected than an infected male. Together, these results indicate that female mice can discriminate between the odours of parasitized and non-parasitized male mice, and find the odours of parasitized males aversive. It is suggested that the odour-induced analgesic responses and their neuromodulatory correlates are part of an adaptive defence mechanism that facilitates the detection and avoidance of parasitized males by female mice and contributes to female mate choice.

AB Many species of bats emerge from maternity colonies in a non-random manner; however, quantifying the extent to which the emergence differs from random is complicated by the underlying variation in intensity of the emergence. In this paper an empirical method which overcomes these analytical difficulties is used to examine the functional nature of the pattern of bat emergence. The emergence behaviour from two large colonies of pipistrelle bats containing between 102 and 976 individual bats was monitored during the summers of 1992 and 1993. Both colonies had two primary exit holes with bats from one hole crossing the face of the second hole. Emergence events at the first hole triggered events at the second hole at both colonies demonstrating that the clumped emergence pattern was not a bottleneck artefact. The extent of clumping was greatest during the first half of the emergence, when light levels were high, suggesting an anti-predation function. This pattern was not a consequence of a higher emergence intensity early in the evening. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB This study was aimed to determine whether thermoregulation by juvenile garter snakes is affected by developmental temperature imposed by their mothers during pregnancy. Maternal temperature treatments were created by maintaining six groups of females at six different constant temperatures (24-32 degrees C) during pregnancy. A seventh group of females was allowed to thermoregulate during pregnancy. The body temperatures of juveniles (N=324) on thermal gradients were monitored in the morning and afternoon for 5 consecutive days, beginning 5 days after birth. The body temperatures of juveniles were consistent, apparently heritable and remarkably stereotyped. Juvenile body temperature was virtually unaffected by maternal temperature treatment.

AB The functional significance of communal nesting and nursing is poorly understood. Female house mice often communally nest, and within these communal nests females appear to indiscriminately nurse all pups, a rare trait for any mammal. In this study, the hypothesis that communal nesting provides protection from conspecific infanticide was tested and supported in semi-natural populations of house mice. Conspecific infanticide in single-mother nests (69%, N=412) was twice that in communal nests (33%, N=508). Because this major benefit of communal nesting does not require communal nursing, direct benefits to communal nursing itself were tested. Most proposed benefits should result in heavier weaning weights, but no differences were found between communal and single nests in the semi-natural populations. If communal nursing is to be avoided in communal nests, dams must recognize their own pups. Retrieval tests conducted in the laboratory produced equivocal results. Dams discriminated between pups that differed in age, but not between their own and other age-matched pups. The major survival advantage of communal nesting, coupled with the failure to find nutritional advantages for communally nursed pups, supports a recent suggestion that communal nursing is an unavoidable consequence of communal nesting. This hypothesis is further strengthened by data indicating that communal nesting partners tend to be kin, thereby providing inclusive fitness benefits to communal nursing. Although costs of communal nursing were proposed and tested, no such costs were found. We also show from 15 observations of infanticide that all classes of adults (territorial and non-territorial males, pregnant and non-pregnant females) are infanticidal. These observations are in conflict with previous laboratory studies. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Mating behaviour in a feral guppy, Poecilia reticulata, population from Durban, South Africa was examined. Males bear carotenoid (orange) and melanin (black) spots and low levels of iridescent and yellow pigment. Areas of colour, body size and lengths of the dorsal fin and intromittent organ (gonopodium) were studied as female mate-choice cues. Attractiveness was positively related to the degree of orange coloration in all tests, and with the length of the gonopodium in some tests. Asymmetry of colour spots was investigated and it was concluded that either orange and black spots are not condition-dependent ornaments or the expected negative relationship between expression of condition-dependent ornaments and fluctuating asymmetry does not occur in these guppies. Several hypotheses regarding the maintenance of multiple secondary sexual characters are discussed. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Data on mate retention and nest site tenacity of kittiwakes at North Shields (1954-1990) were analysed and the effect of a forced change of breeding site on mate retention (1991-1993) examined. Although kittiwakes in 1991 were prevented from returning to nest sites of the previous breeding season, 73% of females and 60% of males that bred elsewhere retained their mates of the previous breeding season. Of kittiwakes that moved to other colonies in 1992, 42% of breeding females and 30% of males retained their mates of the previous breeding season. Over the period 1954-1990, 92% of females and 80% of males that used the same nest sites in the following year retained their mates but 100 pairs that changed nest sites still re-formed the pair bond of the previous breeding season. A model predicted that the probability of retaining the same mate by chance within the warehouse colony should decrease progressively with distance moved from the previous nest site. Mate retention decreased sharply if a bird moved 0.3 m to a nest site immediately adjacent to the previous site but, in contrast to the model, did not show a further significant decrease with increasing distance. In the 1991-1993 study, some birds that changed nest sites and moved to a different colony still retained their mates. Therefore, the annual re-forming of the same pair did not result from nest site tenacity as birds were prevented from returning to former nest sites. This implies that birds recognize each other as individuals and possibly move as a pair. Such behaviour has important implications for lifetime reproductive success, as birds that retain their mates from the previous breeding season typically fledge more young than birds that change mates.

ID VERTICAL MIGRATION; DECISIONS; RATES; FISH
AB The influences of prey (the bivalve Donax vittatus (de Costa)) and a predator (juvenile cod, Gadus morhua L.) on long-term behaviour patterns of juvenile plaice were investigated by time-lapse video-recording of behaviour in the laboratory. Analysis of the frequencies and durations of behavioural elements revealed two basic types of behaviour. In the absence of food, behaviour was dominated by elements associated with migration to and from the intertidal zone: longer, less frequent swimming movements with occasional off-bottom excursions, especially around the predicted time of high water. Benthic activity was dominated by foraging behaviour when food was present and consisted of frequent short searching movements and occasional attacks on prey which continued throughout the tidal cycle, mixed with the migration component. Migration behaviour was strongly controlled by the endogenous tidally phased activity rhythm, whereas fish foraged only in the presence of food and independently of the phase of the tide. The presence of the predator depressed the expression of migration behaviour and reduced and delayed the onset of foraging, with greatly diminished feeding success. Expression of behaviour in the natural environment reflects the relative contributions of these exogenous and endogenous influences. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Male white-tailed ptarmigan accompany their mates 88-92% of sightings before the onset of incubation, and while accompanying their mates, spend 22-30% of their time displaying vigilant behaviour. Two hypotheses to explain the function of male vigilance before onset of incubation were examined in white-tailed ptarmigan. The protection of paternity hypothesis proposes that male vigilance minimizes the threat of cuckoldry, thereby ensuring paternity in a reproductive attempt. Thus, male vigilance should be greatest during periods when females are fertile, and it should increase when the sex ratio is male-biased. The predator detection hypothesis predicts that increasing male vigilance decreases predation risk to their mates and thus may allow females to increase foraging efficiency. The percentage of time males spent in vigilant behaviour during the pre-incubation period did not change significantly with period of female fertility or with the sex ratio of breeding birds. However, males spent significantly more time vigilant in the year when there were more sightings of predators. The proportion of time females spent foraging was positively correlated with the proportion of time their mates were vigilant. Vigilant behaviour before onset of incubation is likely to increase a male's confidence in paternity of that nesting attempt in white-tailed ptarmigan. However, patterns of variation in male vigilance across seasons and between years suggests that this behaviour also functions to allow females to reduce their vigilance for predators, thereby enabling them to forage more effectively before incubation.

AB Psychological studies have established that the central nervous system cannot sustain vigilance for an extended period of time. The consequent vigilance decrement implies a gradual reduction in the ability to process information effectively. This may result in a reduced ability to detect hidden predators, locate cryptic food items or make successful behavioural decisions. A model incorporating parameters of vigilance decrement during foraging and vigilance recovery during rest predicts first, the optimal allocation of time between foraging activity and rest, and second, the optimal length of each foraging episode. For a given rate of vigilance recovery, the model predicts that both the optimal proportion of time devoted for foraging activity and the optimal length of a foraging bout should be decreasing functions of the rate of vigilance decrement. Because the rate of vigilance decrement is larger for more difficult tasks, both the total time spent foraging and the duration of each foraging episode should be smaller for more demanding foraging activities. It is suggested that vigilance decrement is a dominant factor determining temporal patterns of animal behaviour.

AB Aquatic turtles live in a variety of habitats with fluctuating water regimes. Because turtles are long-lived, individuals may repeatedly face the problem of surviving forced emigrations that result from droughts. The hypothesis that adult yellow-bellied pond slider turtles, Trachemys scripta, have a water-finding ability that allows orientation to aquatic habitats in unfamiliar areas was tested. In 1992, 110 pond sliders were trapped and moved beyond their home range to an unfamiliar terrestrial habitat which had a single source of standing water nearby. After an acclimatization period, turtles were released approximately 300 m from the water's edge and out of sight of the water. After 1 h, a heading for each turtle was calculated. Under overcast conditions orientation was random. Under clear conditions, released turtles oriented non-randomly and in the direction of the nearest water, suggesting that adult pond sliders have a water-finding ability. Turtles with the ability to move to another aquatic habitat in a direct, efficient manner should have a selective advantage because reduced exposure to predators, reduced water stress and reduced time away from feeding would lower the cost of overland travel.

DT Article
ID SEX-PHEROMONE
AB Previous study of the desert, funnel-web spider, Agelenopsis aperta, indicates that this species has a monogamous mating system in that males and females only rarely mate multiply. In such cases, males are expected to exhibit mate choice. This work tests for male mate choice with respect to female body weight and reproductive status in a three-choice arena system and compares these findings to field data on male visits at female sites in a marked population. Unlike females, males do not choose to court heavier (larger) females nor do they mate assortatively with respect to body weight. However, males do differentially court older virgin females over newly matured females and already mated females. Y-maze test results suggest that virgin females emit a pheromone that cues male courtship. The level of pheromone emission appears to increase with post-maturation age of unmated female A. aperta, but drops off or ceases following mating.

AB This study tests the idea that male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, can control the numbers of spermatozoa in their ejaculates. The first experiment compared the numbers of spermatozoa transferred by males in extra-pair copulations during and after their own pair copulation period, but taking the time since the last copulation into account. If males can control ejaculate size then, after controlling for sperm depletion effects, extra-pair ejaculates occurring after the male's own pair copulation period should be larger, but this was not the case. In the second experiment males were presented simultaneously with two model females: if males could adjust their ejaculate size the number of spermatozoa transferred to each female in turn should differ from that when the two females were presented separately. However, the numbers of spermatozoa were similar to those occurring during depletion with model females presented sequentially These experiments provide no evidence that male zebra finches can adjust the size of their ejaculate, and support the hypothesis that males operate under a physiological constraint and that spermatozoa numbers are determined largely by sperm depletion.

AB In birds and mammals with 'helpers-at-the-nest', some individuals not only feed unrelated offspring, but also compete to do so. Non-adaptive explanations for alloparental care do not predict competition for access to offspring that, in its most extreme form, can include kidnapping young from adjacent territories. A common adaptive explanation holds that allofeeding promotes a 'social bond', with non-relatives. This proximate hypothesis does not explain why the recipient later cooperates with or helps at the nest of its former benefactor. An extension of this hypothesis posits that, by helping to care for unrelated young, individuals may take advantage of a kin-recognition mechanism based on associations learned by nestlings while being fed. The deceived young later may offer assistance according to its perceived relatedness to the former helper. This mechanism, termed kinship deceit, may be a form of bet-hedging in cooperative breeding systems where mortality is high, where breeders can benefit from contributions by helpers, and where helpers normally assist relatives.

TI RESPONSE OF EASTERN CHIPMUNKS TO CONSPECIFIC ALARM CALLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID CALIFORNIA GROUND-SQUIRRELS; PREDATORS; SIGNALS; INFORMATION
AB Eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, were more likely to flee the area and assume a motionless alert posture in response to playback of conspecific alarm calls than they were in response to two types of control (silence and white-noise). Qualitatively similar responses were given to three call types: trills (single calls typically given as chipmunks evade a pursuer), chucks (repeated calls typically given by motionless animals after detecting an aerial predator), and chips (repeated calls typically given by motionless animals after detecting a terrestrial predator). However, chipmunks showed a higher probability of fleeing and slightly longer alert times in response to chucks than to chips. Chipmunks did not differ in their response to calls recorded from different individuals or calls played back at different amplitudes, but calls played at higher rates, and from two speakers as opposed to one, elicited longer alert responses. Visual and auditory disturbances during playback of chips and chucks resulted in a higher probability of fleeing and longer alert times than did the same disturbances in the absence of calls. These results suggest that chipmunks are sensitive to characteristics of alarm calls that could indicate a degree of risk, and that part of the response to these calls is an increased awareness of visual and auditory stimuli associated with the approach of a predator.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Food-storing birds relocate scattered caches of food using surrounding features and objects as visual cues to the location of caches. Black-capped chickadees, Parus atricapillus, were observed storing food in an enclosure in which the visual cues available to the birds could be controlled. In the first experiment, distal objects on the walls of the enclosure and proximal objects at cache sites were both present when chickadees stored sunflower seeds in artificial trees. Removal of distal objects prior to cache recovery significantly reduced search accuracy, while removal of proximal objects had no significant effect on accuracy. In a second experiment, birds stored seeds with only distal objects present. Rotation of these objects around the walls of the chamber significantly reduced search accuracy. Birds searched for stored food at sites that were correct with respect to the distal objects, rather than at the original cache sites. These results show that black-capped chickadees remember the position of caches with respect to prominent global features of the environment.

   HUMILE (MAYR) (=IRIDOMYRMEX HUMILIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB In the Argentine ant Linepithema humile (=Iridomyrmex humilis) only males disperse whereas female sexuals (unmated winged queens) stay in their mother nest where they mate. This study investigated (1) whether dispersing males are accepted into foreign colonies, (2) whether they can mate with resident female sexuals, and (3) whether the propensity of males to disperse is affected by the expectation of mating in their mother nest. Field experiments demonstrated that males were accepted into foreign colonies only when these colonies contained female sexuals or queen pupae. Before and after the time of (sic) female sexuals, workers attacked and killed most of the foreign males. Laboratory experiments snowed that males that successfully enter foreign colonies can mate with resident female sexuals. The propensity of males to disperse was significantly influenced by the presence of female sexuals in their nest. Males were more likely to fly out from colonies containing no female sexuals than from those with them. These results are consistent with males preferentially dispersing when there is little or no opportunity to mate in their mother nest. Thus there are two mating strategies available for males: staying in their mother nest when an opportunity to mate arises or dispersing and attempting to mate in a foreign nest when there are no female sexuals in their mother nest. This latter behaviour could mediate gene flow between colonies and account for the lack of significant inbreeding previously documented in this species.

ID REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SPAWNING SUCCESS; PISCES; CHOICE; CYPRINODON;
   EVOLUTION; LABRIDAE; PUPFISH
AB The mating system of the dark chub is a form of male-dominance polygyny. The principal spawning ground in this study was at the shallow end of pools where males fought to obtain females. Mating was promiscuous with little female choice, and dominant males commonly took females from other males. Spawning was performed by a female and single large dominant male, while other individuals dashed to the spawning pair to release sperm or eat eggs. At sites of low fish density, spawning was infrequent but was generally accomplished successfully because of the scarcity of satellite individuals, and the males'' dominance hierarchy was stable throughout the reproductive season. Conversely, at sites of high density, although many females spawned, spawning was frequently interfered with. Furthermore, the dominance hierarchy was unstable and the most dominant male tended to become exhausted after frequent reproductive activities. In addition to his body size and dominance, how long he spent around the spawning grounds, his skill at spawning and the selection of spawning site affected a male''s reproductive success. While the larger dominant males mainly used the most frequently used spawning grounds where many females spawned, the smaller sub-dominants tended to use the less frequently used spawning grounds.

TI PATTERNS OF RECRUITMENT TO THE BREEDING GROUP IN THE KITTIWAKE
   RISSA-TRIDACTYLA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A study of the behaviour of kittiwakes in the North Shields colony shows how competition for space and aggressive behaviour by breeding pairs may influence the rate of recruitment of breeding birds and thus limit colony size and density. During recruitment of the breeding group, kittiwakes face a choice of nesting sites that has consequences for their subsequent reproductive output. Nest sites are occupied according to the birds'' ability to compete. Three patterns of recruitment are described: (1) recruits arrived early in the season (by mid-April), and nested in preferred locations, replacing mates that had died or paired with other partners, (2) later arrivals that took up nest sites immediately in their return to the colony in relatively poor locations, and (3) other later arrivals that delayed nest site occupation for several weeks and took up nest sites in the dense areas of the colony once the territoriality of established nesters subsided. Individuals in the third group faced  more aggression than those in the second, which appears to be a feature common to kittiwakes nesting in dense areas of the colony, but reproductive success, measured by the number of chicks fledged per pair, was higher in the dense areas of the colony. At the colony level, nesting opportunities may be socially limited by aggression from established breeders in the recruits'' ability to compete in the colony situation.

TI MEASURING THE RISK OF PREDATION IN AN ENERGY CURRENCY - FIELD
   EXPERIMENTS WITH FORAGING BLUE TITS, PARUS-CAERULEUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A technique for measuring the ''risk of predation'', in an energy currency, is described. Experiments on free-living blue tits determined the extent to which feeding in a risky site was compensated by making food easier to obtain. The birds were trained to use operant feeding devices which were placed at different distances from the edge of woodland tree cover. The reward schedules at the feeders were controlled by a computer, which adjusted the number of hops required to obtain a food reward in relation to the extent to which each feeder was used. When the feeders were used equally the reward schedules stabilized and were recorded. There was little difference in the final reward schedules of feeders placed under the cover of trees, but the frequency of reinforcement required to persuade the birds to feed in the open rose dramatically at relatively short distances (1.5 m) from cover.

TI EFFECTS OF MALE REMOVAL ON PARENTAL CARE OF FEMALE WHITE-THROATED
   SPARROWS, ZONOTRICHIA-ALBICOLLIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The white-throated sparrow occurs in two genetically based colour morphs and exhibits negative assortative mating. Previous work has shown that birds of each morph differ in the amount of care given to nestlings. It was suggested that the ability of females of the white-striped and tan-striped morphs to compensate for the loss of male assistance in raising young may differ. To test this hypothesis, male white-throated sparrows were removed from their territories when their young were 6 days  old. After male removal, both tran-striped and white-striped females compensated for the loss of their mates by increasing their feeding rates, rather than changing the number of prey items brought per trip. Correspondingly, these females decreased their brooding time. After male removal, new birds often came into the territory and followed the resident female but did not feed the young. The young from experimental nests weighted less at fledging than control young. However, young fledged from  all experimental nests. Therefore, contrary to the expectation, both white-striped and tan-striped females compensated for the loss of male help. In the present study, differences in the level of parental care between white-striped and tan-striped birds were not as distinct as previously found. Polygyny is rare in this species, and a number of factors are suggested that may be important in selecting for monogamy.

TI CONSPECIFIC CALLS EVOKE CHARACTERISTIC CARDIAC RESPONSES IN MALLARD
   DUCKLINGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The cardiac response of mallard ducklings, Anas platyrhynchos, has a characteristic pattern, which varies according to which of three conspecific calls, or an artificial sound, is presented. Ducklings were played one of four acoustic stimuli, each of which has well-documented behavioural efects: maternal alarm calls, maternal assembly calls, ducking distress calls and a synthetic control stimulus. The evoked changes in heart rate consisted of brief phasic responses to the playbacks of each  call type, together with a cumulative (tonic) change with repeated stimulus presentations. The phasic response consisted of an acceleration during the stimulus in every case, but, while all three conspecific calls elicited a profound post-stimulus deceleration, characteristic of an orienting response, the control stimulus did not. Two of the stimuli also had significant tonic effects; the assembly call evoked a prolonged increase in heart rate, while the alarm call caused a prolonged decrease.  These tonic changes may be related to the locomoter responses characteristically elicited by maternal calls. When both phasic and tonic changes in heart rate are considered, it is apparent that each of the stimuli elicited a unique response. The cardiac response thus provides an assay of sufficient sensitivity to examine both recognition of species-typical calls and discrimination between conspecific vocalizations.

TI THE INHERITANCE OF SOCIAL-DOMINANCE, MATING-BEHAVIOR AND ATTRACTIVENESS
   TO MATES IN MALE NAUPHOETA-CINEREA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea, male social behaviour is influenced by sexual selection due to mate choice by females for dominant males. This paper reports the results of breeding experiments in N. cinerea that document genetic variation in (1) male dominance rank, (2) components of courtship associated with differences in dominance rank and important in male mating success, and (3) male attractiveness to females. Dominant males typically produced offspring that were dominant in social interactions as adults; subordinate males produced subordinate offspring. Estimates of narrow-sense and broad-sense heritabilities of sexually selected male courtship behaviour indicated that moderate to high additive genetic variation persists despite sexual selection. Estimates of genetic correlations for different components of courtship and mating suggested similar genetic influences and that these components reflect male attractiveness to females. In addition to the variability in  the length of interactions leading to copulation, some males were consistently rejected as mates. Male attractiveness to females was therefore a threshold character with two levels of expression; this acceptance/rejection trhreshold was also heritable. These results are consistent with studies of sexually selected morphology and suggest that there may be general patterns involved in the genetics of sexually selected traits.

AB The foraging and social behaviour of four species of Panamanian dart-poison frogs, Dendrobatidae, were recorded and that information was combined with an analysis of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism and with published information about food habits to test predictions about associations among behavioural, ecological and physiological characteristics of anurans. Several generalizations were supported by the data. The widely foraging species of frogs made more prey capture attempts in total and took more prey at each feeding station than did the sedentary species. The widely foraging species had higher capacities for aerobic metabolism and lower anaerobic capacities than did the sedentary species. Other generalizations were not supported. Dietary habits were only loosely related to foraging mode and neither aerobic capacity nor foraging mode was a good predictor of the frequency of vocalization or of agonistic behaviour. High aerobic capacity and widely foraging behaviour may be derived characters in the family Dendrobatidae, but the metabolic and behavioural requirements of territorial defense provide an alternate hypothesis for the association of some ecological and physiological characteristics of frogs.

TI TIME HORIZONS OF PIGEONS ON A 2-ARMED BANDIT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Time availble for foraging (time horizon) should influence optimal behaviour accoridng to some foraging models. When animals encouner two patches of unknown density (a two-armed bandit) there should be more sampling before sustained exploitation of the better patch when the time horizon is long than when it is short. Pigeons, Columba livia, were trained in two operant experiments designed to test this prediction. In the first experiment, time horizon was signalled by the point in sessions of constant length when two-armed bandit trails began. In the second experiment, long sessions occurred in one environement and short sessions in another. Contrary to reports in the literature, variations in time horizon had no consistent effect on performance. However, carryover of preference from previous sessions and length of neutralization treatments between sessions, two factors that have been confounded with time horizon in previous studies, did have large and consistent effects on the pigeons'' choices.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF MATING SYSTEMS ON PHILOPATRY - A TEST WITH POLYANDROUS
   RED-NECKED PHALAROPES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sex differences in philopatry have been linked to competition for mates and resources (Greenwood 1980, Anim. Behav., 28, 1140-1162). Philopatry and nest-site fidelity of red-necked phalaropes, Phalaropus lobatus, were examined to determine the importance of a polyandrous mating system and lack of territoriality. Over a 5-year period, natal philopatry was strongly male biased, with 23 males and five females returning, out of 555 colour-banded chicks. This bias is consistent with predicted benefits to males from experience with the area for brood-rearing, and a lack of territorial defence by females. However, adult return rates did not differ significantly by sex, with 38% of males and 34% of females returning (of 177 males and 84 females that were banded). There was also no significant difference between the sexes in distances moved between nest sites within the study area. Movements by males renesting within a year (following nest predation) were significantly greater than inter-year distances, and yearlings moved significantly farther than adults between years. Overall, the results support the role of mating systems in natal philopatry, but the distinction between mate and territory defence is not sifficient to account for the high return rates of adult females. Although females do not defend territories, experience with home ranges may facilitate mate competition.

TI CHANGES IN INCIDENCE OF INFANTICIDAL AND PARENTAL RESPONSES DURING THE
   REPRODUCTIVE-CYCLE IN MALE AND FEMALE WILD MICE MUS-MUSCULUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Most studies of infanticide in rodents have been carried out on laboratory animals. In the present study, pairs of infanticidal male and female wild mice were observed for changes in their responsiveness to alien pups during the reproductive cycle. Females killed pups during pregnancy, adopted alien pups during the lactation period, and killed pups again a month after the weaning of their offspring. In males, the transition from infanticidal to parental responses occurred as early as the first half of their mates'' pregnancy, and only half of them resumed infanticide a month after the weaning of their litters. Subsequent experiments showed that two independent factors, the experience of copulation and cues from the pregnant female, accounted for the cessation of infanticide and onset of parental care in the male. The adaptive value of the co-existence of multiple mechanisms underlying the cessation of infanticide in male and female house mice is discussed with respect to the social life of this species.

TI SEXUAL AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS PRECEDING AND DURING MALE-INDUCED ESTRUS
   IN PRAIRIE VOLES, MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behaviour was quantified in pairs of prairie voles preceding and during sexual interactions through the use of time-lapse videotaping. At the onset of testing, females were either anoestrous or were in confirmed behavioural oestrus. These females were paired with either sexually naive or experienced males and behavioural interactions were monitored for at least 72 h. For anoestrus females, brought into oestrus during taping, the median latency to the onset of sexual activity was 52 h with naive  males and 41 h with sexually experienced males. Typical mating bouts lasted for more than 24 h with intermittent periods of rest. The pacing of mating behaviour differed only slightly as a function of male sexual experience and did not differ as a function of the oestrous condition of the female at the onset of videotaping. Autogrooming, which may facilitate the transfer of chemosignals, was monitored throughout the experiment. Within 13-24 h following introduction of the pair, autogrooming  increased in pairs in which the male was sexually experienced; in contrast, in pairs in which the male was sexually naive, increases in autogrooming were not observed until 25-36 h following the onset of videotaping. The oestrous condition of the female did not significantly affect patterns of autogrooming; however, autogrooming patterns in the female paralleled those of the male with which she was paired.

TI 2-CHOICE PHONOTAXIS IN HYPEROLIUS-MARMORATUS (ANURA, HYPEROLIIDAE) - THE
   EFFECT OF TEMPORAL VARIATION IN PRESENTED STIMULI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female painted reed frogs, Hyperolius marmoratus, were subjected to two-choice discrimination experiments to determine whether temporal overlap in the presented stimuli affects frequency preferences. The results showed that females preferred low frequency calls when the stimuli were presented alternately. Simultaneous presentation of stimuli resulted in a random response by females. When presented stimuli partially overlapped or abutted each other, the females responded significantly more often to the leading call irrespective of its frequency. These findings provide some insight into the possible effects of male vocal interactions on the ability of females actively to choose mates based on call frequency in natural breeding assemblages.

TI FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUAL COAL TITS, PARUS-ATER, IN RELATION TO
   THEIR AGE, SEX AND MORPHOLOGY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The aim of this study was to reveal the causes and consequences of individual differences in foraging behaviour of coal tits, Parus ater, on the island of Gotland in the Baltic. On Gotland the willow tit, P. montanus, and the crested tit, P. cristatus, are absent, while these larger species are abundant competitors on the mainland. The Gotland population of coal tits exploited parts of the foraging niches of their absent competitors. Gotland coal tits are bigger than those on the  mainland; they have thus evolved towards the size of the missing competitors. Individual differences in niche use were related to their morphology. Large birds more often used the inner parts of trees whereas small individuals foraged more on needles in the outer parts of the trees. Also, individuals with wing shapes more suitable for hovering and slow flight foraged more on needles. It is argued that morphology affects the profitability of different foraging sites. However, for foraging site selection, age was more important than morphology. Older, and probably more dominant, individuals occupied the most profitable foraging sites.

TI MECHANISMS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SELECTIVE OVIPOSITION BY THE ZEBRA
   SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Zebra swallowtail butterflies, Eurytides marcellus, were studied in the field to determine (1) whether the behavioural response of a female to host plant individuals, pawpaws (Asimina spp.), correlated with characteristics of the plant foliage, (2) whether selective oviposition improved larval survivorship, and (3) how unpredictable plant qualities affected the translation of female choice into larval success. Females laid eggs preferentially on pawpaws bearing the youngest leaves, while non-hosts and pawpaws bearing mostly mature leaves were rejected before or after the females touched the plant. By rejecting unsuitable plants early in evaluation, females concentrated their time and risk on the plants most likely to provide an oviposition site. Larvae survived longer on oviposition plants than on plants that were rejected, but unpredictable components of plant quality, particularly predation on larvae, could weaken the correlation.

TI A SOCIAL CONCEPT IN JAVA MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two adult female Java monkeys, Macaca fascicularis, demonstrated their ability to form a concept of affiliation by their choices of slides of group members. In a discrimination task, one subject correctly identified 14 out of 14 mother-offspring pairs in first trials, the other correctly matched views of offspring to their mothers in 20 of 22 pairs in unique trials in a matching-to-sample task. Both subjects apparently used a concept analogous to the human ''mother-child affiliation''. Thus, one mechanism underlying the complex social structure of a non-human primate group may be the ability of its members to categorize pairs of group members.

TI FORAGING, PREDATION HAZARD AND PATCH USE IN GRAY SQUIRRELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two patches of food, one large and one small, were placed at equal distances from protective cover. Grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, responded to the difference in food quantity, so that aggregation sizes matched predictions based on relative patch size, as well as those based on feeding rates within patches. The large patch was then moved farther from cover, where the probability of predation per unit foraging time should be greater. Aggregation sizes in the large patch decreased significantly, and overcrowding in the small patch resulted in reduced average feeding rates. The experiment was next repeated with the amount of food in each patch doubled. Increased distance to cover again resulted in decreased aggregation sizes in the larger patch, but average feeding rates did not decline in the small groups that were observed. Squirrels responded to relative, but not necessarily absolute, differences in food availability. When patches differed in both food availability and  the hazard of predation, each attribute exerted a significant effect on the pattern of patch use.

TI VARIATION IN THE SONG RATE OF THE MALE PIED FLYCATCHER
   FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA - CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The natural song rate of the pied flycathcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, was highly correlated with both air temperature and time of day as well as with date of season. The average song rate at different temperature levels rose as the season advanced. When temperature, time of day and date were held constant, males were found to slightly increase the song rate during the premating period. The average song rate did not correlate with age, tarsus length (body size) or colour type of the male. Males provided with extra food considerably elevated their song rates at low temperatures in relation to controls which indicates that song rate is limited by food resources. Under natural circumstances, females selected males that had been the longest in the area and also males with the highest song rates, even after the correction for augmented song rate with duration of premating period. It is suggested that the female, in selecting a male with a high song rate, in fact may select either the food content of his territory and/or the quality of the male directly. Alternatively, female mate choice may be based on territorial cues, and song rate and/or male quality may merely be correlatives of territory quality.

TI THE EFFECTS OF DENSITY AND RELATIVE SIZE ON THE AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR,
   MOVEMENT AND FEEDING OF DAMSELFLY LARVAE (ODONATA, COENAGRIONIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB How the aggressive behaviour of the larvae of a damselfly species, Ischnura verticalis, changed when density and size combinations were manipulated, and whether changes in feeding and movement patterns accompanied changes in aggressive behaviour were investigated in the laboratory. During aggressive encounters, larvae struck with their mouthparts at larvae of the same size as themselves more frequently as density increased. However, proportionately fewer encounters occurred between larvae of  the same size as density increased and as the size of individuals present, but not involved in the encounter, increased within the highest density. Density did not affect the behaviour used to initiate encounters by larger or smaller larvae, but both larger and smaller larvae initiated proportionately fewer encounters as density increased. All instars decreased their movement and responsiveness toward prey as larval density was increased and when paired with successively larger instars within each density. However, only the two larger instars decreased the amount of prey they consumed in response to the manipulations. Larvae appeared to reduce their involvement in aggressive encounters by increasing their vigieance of other larvae. The potential population consequences of these alterations in individual behaviour are discussed.

TI SONG DEVELOPMENT IN THE WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW - MODIFICATION OF LEARNED
   SONG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous research has shown that laboratory-tutored white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli, can learn tape-recorded song only until they are about 50 days of age. However, they can learn either conspecific or allospecific song after they are 50 days of age when a live tutor is used. Because the live-tutored birds had not been exposed to song during the first 50 days of life, a question regarding the reasonableness of applying these results to the natural, field situation can  be raised. In the experiments reported here, hand-raised nestling white-crowned sparrows between 10 and 50 days of age were tutored in the laboratory with one song, and were then placed with a live tutor singing a different dialect when they were over 50 days of age. Eight of 13 males and none of 10 females adopted the song of the second tutor. Birds were also captured in the field as fledglings and were placed with a liver tutor singing a song different from that of the natal area: three of  seven males and one of five females adopted the song of the live tutor. Four birds that had been group-isolated (two males and two females) were exposed to a live tutor when they were 100 days old, and none acquired normal song; all sang isolate song. The results of these studies indicate that there is considerable plasticity in the song learning of white-crowned sparrows, and that, for many individuals, song can be modified quite readily. The implications of these findings for the nature of  the sensitive phase and for mechanisms of song learning are discussed.

In this study, worker pupae of the facultatively polygynous ant species, Leptothorax curvispinosus, were removed from colonies and allowed to eclose and to age for 38-157 days in isolation. These isolates were readily accepted in their parental colonies, but were frequently attacked and killed in non-parental conspecific nests. The results demonstrate that individual workers produce persistent, colony-specific recognition cues following eclosion. The cues involved may be either genetically based or acquired prior to pupation. This study suggests that the special integrating mechanisms which appear to be associated with newly eclosed workers may be required only under certain circumstances, perhaps during early colony growth, after young reproductives have been adopted into established colonies, or when newly eclosed adults must acquire additional cues to achieve acceptability.

TI CONDITIONAL EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE STRATEGIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper formalizes a class of evolutionary games called conditional. A game is conditional when the payoff matrix varies systematically with conditions in the environment, even though the strategies available to the players do not. Density dependence is an example of conditionality. The paper extends the notion of Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS) from games with a single condition to the wider class of conditional games. This extension is called the Conditional ESS, or CESS. The paper  then illustrates CESS theory in a sexual selection model. Selection acts on males alone, and two mating phenotypes are present. Finally, examples of the sexual selection model are drawn from anuran mating systems.

TI SEX-BIASED PREDATION AND THE RISKY MATE-LOCATING BEHAVIOR OF MALE
   TICK-TOCK CICADAS (HOMOPTERA, CICADIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In this study, web-building spiders captured more male than female tick-tock cicadas, Cicadetta quadricincta. The preponderance of males in webs was not due to a male-biased adult sex ratio but instead appeared to be a consequence of mate-seeking activities. Males of this species flew frequently; they spent, on average, about half a min on a perch from which they sang before flying to another perch. They also made many short flights when responding to receptive females. Females did not show  these sort of flight patterns. Male behaviour appeared to be a result of the pair-forming pattern of the species. Receptive females answered calling males by flicking their wings and males moved toward the sounds produced by these movements. The risky call-and-fly tactics of males would allow them to signal for mates over a large area.

TI EFFECTS OF AGE AND BODY SIZE ON THE MALE TERRITORIAL SYSTEM OF THE
   DRAGONFLY, NANNOPHYA-PYGMAEA RAMBUR (ODONATA, LIBELLULIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Nannophya pygmaea males defended a small area including small bodies of water. Females visited these sites to oviposit and were usually captured by territorial males. There was considerable turnover in territory ownership at some sites during the course of the reproductive season. Some changes in ownership occurred because an intruder defeated the resident in an aerial contest. Old males were often replaced by young ones. High-quality territories, which attracted more females than others, were highly contended and larger males usually occupied these territories. Larger males occupied high-quality territories for more days than smaller males. Smaller or old males adjusted their behaviour to their social environment, occupying low-quality territories or sneaking into established territories if excluded from favoured ones. As a result, larger males had a higher lifetime mating success than smaller ones. However, multiple regression analysis showed that most of the variation in male  mating success could be explained by two variables related to weather conditions (number of sunny days during the reproductive span of each male, and number of sunny days while each male occupied a high-quality territory) and not by male size.

TI ALLOMOTHERING AMONG AFRICAN ELEPHANTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Elephant, Loxodonta africana, calves are born into stable family units, with a variety of partners with whom they can interact. In a population of elephants with known lineages and calf ages, interactions between calves and other elephants were found to be frequent and consisted of either relaxed, friendly greetings and investigations of others or assistance when calves were threatened or distressed. Juvenile and adolescent females comforted, assisted and protected calves; these females were defined as allomothers. Allomothers tended to be family members but were not always siblings. Siblings maintained close proximity to calves while calf defence also involved less closely related family members. The early establishment of close caretaking relationships within families may act to enhance the stability of the family through time. Suckling of calves by non-mothers was extremely rare, and unlikely to enhance the nutritional intake of calves.

TI PREY DETECTION IN THE RED-BACKED SHRIKE (LANIUS-COLLURIO) - AN
   EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Distance-dependent prey detection was experimentally studied in the red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio L.). Maggots were presented at varying distances and the time a food-deprived bird scanned for prey before attacking it was measured. The probability of detecting a prey decreased with increasing distance. There was a tendency for less precision in the strike with increasing attack distance. There was a greater probability that the birds would detect a prey at a given distance from a high perch than from a low perch. Prey concealment reduced the detection probability. Detection time for a prey increased significantly with increasing predator-prey distance. Several of the findings are consistent with the predictions of an optimal predator search model (Andersson 1981).

AB A simple model of an environment in which prey are distributed in patches is considered. It is assumed that each patch contains at most one item, but items may vary in the ease with which they can be found. The time spent in unsuccessful search on a patch gives information of whether a patch contains an item, and if it does, how difficult that item is to find. This information can be used to find the policy which maximizes the mean rate of reward for the environment. The analysis is illustrated by 2 examples.

TI MANIPULATING DAYTIME SLEEP IN HERRING-GULLS (LARUS-ARGENTATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The regular provision of a sufficient quantity of food on the territory of pairs of breeding herring gulls led to an increase in the time individuals spent on the territory durng the day, relative to controls. This ''extra'' time was not used to increase overall sleeping time, as predicted. Instead, the experimental gulls reduced their overall sleep time due to a decline in front-sleep. Back-sleep remained relatively unaffected, with both groups spending similar amounts of time in this posture. The consequences of the 2 postural types of sleep were examined with respect to the cost of allowing intruders to remain on an owner''s territory. Intruders arrived more often on control territories and stayed longer when only 1 pair member was present. Intruders were seen on control territories for more consecutive scans when the solitary control gull was in a sleep posture, particularly front-sleep. These results imply a difference in the consequences resulting from the 2 sleep postures and  give additional support for the multiple function hypothesis of sleep.

TI INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION OF PARENTAL CALLS BY BANK SWALLOW CHICKS
   (RIPARIA-RIPARIA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Antiphonal responses of newly fledged bank swallows (R. riparia) to the calls of their parents during the joined flights to and from the home burrow suggest that recognition of parents by offspring is a mechanism promoting family cohesion, a necessary condition for the adequate provisioning of chicks in this highly colonial species. Paternal and maternal calls used while leading chicks revealed higher inter- than intra-individual variability in temporal and frequency parameters, indicating that these calls could reliably identify individuals. When tested in the field at the onset of the fledging period, chicks answered significantly more playbacks of parent calls than of alien adult calls. Quantified observations of the rearing activity of the parents suggest that chick-parent recognition is based on familiarity, because of the chicks'' differential exposure to the parental calls prior to fledging. During the development of the chicks in the burrow, both parents (which share the  rearing activities equally) often call before feeding the chicks.

TI ADJUSTING PARENTAL INVESTMENT TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS - THE
   EFFECT OF FOOD RATION ON PARENTAL BEHAVIOR OF THE CONVICT CICHLID,
   CICHLASOMA-NIGROFASCIATUM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Animals that care for their offspring may vary the amount of care provided for a particular brood in relation to environmental conditions. Food availability is one factor that may affect the costs and benefits associated with parental investment. The convict cichlid, C. nigrofasciatum, is a small substrate-spawning cichlid from Central America. Both male and female provide parental care for eggs and fry. Pairs were kept at 1 of 3 ration levels, high, medium or low. Time spent in parental fanning by females was positively related to ration. Males spent less time fanning than females and their parental behavior varied considerably between individuals. Males on the high ration spent slightly more time fanning than those on the lower rations. The number of eggs produced per spawning and the post-spawning weight of both males and females were significantly and positively related to ration. Foraging frequency of both males and females was inversely related to ration. There was no significant effect of ration on the frequency of mouthing eggs and young or on itnra-pair aggression. Eggs of low-ration fish hatched earlier than those of medium- and high-ration fish but there was no significant difference in the number of days that the young survived. These results suggest that the allocation of time and effort between parental and maintenance activities differs in relation to food supply. Parents may provide more care for the large brood when food is plentiful but place more emphasis on their own survival when food is short and broods are small.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Salamanders of the P. glutinosus-P. jordani complex were tested for the ability to distinguish conspecific, sex-specific and heterospecific chemical cues. Male and female P. glutinosus perferred substrates previously occupied by conspecifics over their own, but randomly chose between substrates marked by male or female conspecifics. While these salamanders are able to distinguish between their own and conspecific substrate odors, they are unable to identify sex by means of substrate  odors. Experiments using an olfactometer showed that male P. jordani, male and female P. glutinosus and an electrophoretically distinct and non-hybridizing sympatric phenotype in the P. glutinosus complex (called species A), all preferred female airborne odors over male airborne odors. This demonstrates that these salamanders can identify sex by means of airborne odors. Male P. glutinosus and species A both preferred conspecific female odors over heterospecific female odors in  olfactometer experiments. An important role for olfaction in the sexual and social behavior of these salamanders, particularly as a pre-mating isolating mechanism is suggested.

AB Domestic chicks were exposed to a moving, stuffed jungle fowl or a rotating red box. The effects on the imprinting process of lesions to a restricted part of the hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV) were studied in a series of experiments. Sham-operated control chicks developed a strong preference for the training object. Damage to IMHV impaired chicks'' preferences for the training stimulus. The effect on chicks exposed to the red box was profound; the effect on chicks exposed to the jungle fowl was  relatively weak. Information about a complex object, which in the experiments described resembled the chicks'' own species, seems to be stored in a different way from information derived from a relatively simple artificial object.

TI A PREDATORS COSTS OF OVERCOMING THE CONFUSION-EFFECT OF SWARMING PREY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Swarms of prey (Daphnia) are known to have a confusion effect on predators that increases with swarm density. Hungry sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) overcome the confusion except when frightened by a predator of their own. Whether the costs of overcoming the confusion consist of decreased attention for predators was investigated. Hungry sticklebacks detected a predator of their own less often when they fed upon a prey swarm of high density than when they attacked a low density swarm. They also overlooked the predator more frequently when they fed with a high rate than with a low one in the same high density. Thus, there is a cost of attacking high density swarms. These results confirm 2 necessary conditions of a model for balancing feeding rate and predator risk. The decreased attention is assumed to be due to the limited channel capacity of the nervous system in processing sensory information.

TI COMPETITION IN A RED DEER STAG SOCIAL GROUP - RANK, AGE AND RELATEDNESS
   OF OPPONENTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Patterns of association and interaction in a free-living group of male red deer (C. elaphus L.) on the Isle of Rhum, Scotland [UK] were examined for factors affecting individual involvement in competition. Association was more clearly related to social rank, which depends on competitive ability, than to age or genetic relatedness. There was no indication that stags could generally recognize relatives. They usually associated with others of similar rank, which may have been because severe  agonistic interactions were rarest between rank-neighbors. This finding was contrary to a prediction that escalation would be most common between individuals close in rank. When association was taken into account close-ranking opponents did not interact more frequently than others as expected. These results may be accounted for by the very small benefits that could be gained from particular interactions compared to the costs that could be incurred.

TI AGGRESSIVENESS AND VOCALIZATION IN THE LEOPARD LIZARD
   (GAMBELIA-WISLIZENNII) - THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In both the laboratory and the field, body temperature alters the defensive responses of leopard lizards (G. wislizenii) toward predators. At high body temperatures lizards flee rapidly from predators. At lower body temperatures, which greatly retard running ability, lizards switch to a stationary defense consisting of aggressive postures, vocalizations and attacks. This temperature-dependent switch from flight to aggressive defenses may be selectively favored in species capable of inflicting damage on a predator. Increased shyness at low body temperature may function as an alternative response in species lacking the ability to inflict damage upon a predator.

TI PRIMER PHEROMONES AND POLYMORPHISM IN THE DESERT LOCUST
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Olfactory stimuli are known to alter the labile phase status of polymorphic locusts. This study looked at the way in which the gregarization pheromone, found in the feces of crowd-reared nymphs, is perceived by nymphs of the desert locust, S. gregaria. It was necessary to expose isolated-reared nymphs to this stimulus for 7 days to see changes towards values typical of crowded locusts in nymphal social behavior and body color. Antennaeless nymphs were unable to perceive the stimulus. Feces from crowd-reared adults, had an opposite effect; previously crowded nymphs, on isolation, lost their tendency to form social groups faster than controls, when exposed to the feces of adult locusts. This solaritizing stimulus had an effect in 4 days. The stimulus was not strong enough to overcome the gregarizing effect of rearing nymphs in pairs. Amputation of the antennae had a short-term solitarizing effect masking the role of the antennae in perception of the solitarizing stimulus of the adult feces.

TI ROLES OF THE WING WHISTLE IN THE TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR OF MALE
   BROAD-TAILED HUMMINGBIRDS (SELASPHORUS-PLATYCERCUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Suggested roles of avian wing sounds in territory defense have not been tested experimentally. The non-facultative, shrill wing whistle of male broad-tailed hummingbirds occurs during aerial displays used in defense of courting territories. Males were observed before and after being experimentally silenced and after having wing whistles restored. Silenced birds intruded in territories more easily than normal males, suggesting that the wing whistle is a conspicuous signal advertising the  presence of adult male birds. Birds were less active and aggressive in territory defense after silencing than they were either before silencing or after restoration of the wing whistle. Silenced birds tended to lose their territories to rival hummingbirds more readily than non-silenced birds. Silenced birds defend their territories less effectively because they cannot communicate threat and because they lack sensory feedback that normally enhances a bird''s aggressiveness. Results suggest that the wing whistle of male broad-tailed hummingbirds is important in maintenance of courting territories and in reproductive success.

TI THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BODY SIZE IN TERRITORIAL INTERACTIONS OF MALE
   BEEWOLVES (HYMENOPTERA, SPHECIDAE, PHILANTHUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In many species of the sphecid wasp genus Philanthus, males defend their mating territories. Field observations on 3 spp., P. crabroniformis, P. pulcher and P. psyche, demonstrated that size differences among males influenced the outcome of competition for territories. Body size varies considerably within males of all 3 spp. In P. crabroniformis, 100%, and in P. pulcher 97% of aggressive interactions on territories were won by the larger of the 2 contestants. Resident males from territories were captured and monitored for the arrival of replacement males. These manipulations yielded several interesting results: individuals from large pools of non-territorial males quickly assumed possession of abandoned territories, the original residents removed from territories were significantly larger in mean body size than those that replaced them, and only 8% of the replacing males were larger than the original resident of the territory. A size-conditional strategy in which larger males defend or usurp territories and smaller males opportunistically take over territories that have been abandoned (e.g., the resident leaves to feed or is preyed upon) is suggested.

TI OPTIMAL PREY SELECTION - WHY DO GREAT TITS SHOW PARTIAL PREFERENCES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Contrary to the predictions of optimal foraging theory, great tits (P. major) in an experimental feeding situation show partial preferences: instead of treating all items of a given prey type in the same way, they take some and reject others. Whether misidentification of prey items or sampling of presentation schedules alone can account for this result was examined. They cannot, and a factor other than energetic efficiency is influencing the foraging behavior. This idea is supported by the finding that hungry great tits follow the predictions of energetic efficiency more closely than partially satiated ones. The partial preferences shown in this specific experiment are due to the combined action of satiation and prey misidentification: as the birds satiate they appear to aim less and less at a maximal energy intake rate; they apply an increasingly stringent criterion which leads to a shift of diet.

DT Article
AB Males of the barred sulfur, E. daira, perform a unique wing-waving display in courtship. This display and its significance are described in detail from motion picture records of successful and unsuccessful courtships. Wing-waving is done in bouts and is a requisite part of successful courtship. The display appears to have evolved in response to female choice for males that clearly announce their species identity; there are 2 other pierid species of very similar size and color pattern that occur sympatrically with E. daira.

TI STARTLE RESPONSES OF BLUE JAYS TO VISUAL-STIMULI PRESENTED DURING
   FEEDING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Feeding responses of blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) were studied experimentally to determine whether unfamiliar colors would cause hesitation when presented during a feeding act. The blue jays were trained to push flaps aside and pick out discs under these flaps to obtain mealworms in a specially designed feeding apparatus. If the interval between the time when a bird pushed a flap aside and took out the underlying disc was significantly longer in experimental trials than the mean established over a control series of trials, the hesitation was considered a startle response. Novel colors (colors that birds had never seen before in this context) caused a startle response, as did rare colors that the birds had never seen before in this context but that they had not been trained on. Experimental latency times were also affected by avoidance training. Birds trained to avoid dark grey discs subsequently took longer to pick up black discs. These findings suggest that dark colors would cause more hesitation by predators than would light colors.

TI THE ONTOGENY OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH GROUP COMPANIONS AMONG
   FREE-RANGING INFANT RHESUS-MONKEYS .2. DIFFERENTIATION AND
   ATTRACTIVENESS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Infants are frequently with their mothers when troop members initiate interaction with them. To what extent are the infants'' companions attracted specifically to them rather than to the mother? A simple method is presented for approaching this question and for assessing the extent to which the relationships of 11 free-ranging rhesus (M. mulatta) infants on Cayo Santiago acquired qualities independent of (differentiated from) those of the mother. Companions of all ages tend to be attracted specifically to infants between 1 and 14 wk of age and not simply to their mothers. This tendency is less marked for sibling companions than for more distantly related companions. No differences are found between infants of high- and low ranking mothers. Infantile attractiveness is not necessarily sustained when infants are 17-30 wk of age. The degree to which relationships with infant companions and with older female companions have differentiated by 17-30 wk is negatively related to the companion''s age. Infants show early and increasingly marked tendencies to develop differentiated relationships with one another, but by 30 wk of age they show no signs of doing so with adult female companions.

TI DISTRESS CALL ALTERNATION IN PEKING DUCKLINGS (ANAS-PLATYRHYNCHOS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Peking ducklings (A. platyrhynchos) alternated their distress calls with those of conspecifics. This alternation response consisted of 2 components: a strong tendency to suppress vocalizing during the conspecific''s calls and a weaker tendency to increase vocalizing (above the level given by birds tested in auditory isolation) following those calls. Similar results were obtained whether pairs of ducklings were tested or individual ducklings were tested with tape-recorded cells. Visual contact with the conspecific, or a mirror image, although not necessary for eliciting an alternation response, did have a significant facilitative effect on this response. This latter effect may have been due to the general arousal-reducing properties of the visual stimulus. In contrast to the strong response of ducklings to conspecific distress calls, they displayed a much weaker tendency to alternate their calls with clicking sounds and 7.0-kHz tones with the same temporal patterning and intensity as the taped distress calls, 3.8-kHz tones that additionally matched the dominant frequency of the taped cells and synthetic distress calls that also approximated the frequency modulation of the taped cells. The distress call alternation response is probably not simply an artifact or a more general orienting response in which ducklings inhibit their own vocalizations whenever they hear any salient auditory stimulus; the response appears to be triggered specifically by the sound of the sibling calls. The present results stand in contrast to the common assertion that young birds largely ignore the distress calls of siblings. These results are consistent with recent literature emphasizing the importance of sibling interactions in the analysis of mallard early social attachments.

TI SPARROWS AND A BRUSHPILE - FORAGING RESPONSES TO DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS
   OF PREDATION RISK AND ENERGY-COST
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations of wintering house sparrows (Passer domesticus) feeding on cracked corn at feeders placed at different distances from a brushpile, and in positions differentially exposed to the wind supported the hypothesis that, when food patches are equal in net energy return, foragers use the one furnishing the most protection from predation. Results reinforced the hypothesis that, when food sources furnish equal protection from predators, homeotherms below their lower critical temperature use the one providing the largest net energy return. When the sparrows had available both a colder, safer feeding site and a warmer, riskier one, they frequented both over the course of the winter and, as predicted, their use of the colder, safer site was negatively correlated with wind velocity and positively related to temperature and solar radiation. In this last case, the birds apparently decided where to feed on the basis of some threshold difference between metabolic rates at the colder, safer site and the warmer, riskier location.

AB Pairs of juvenile firemouth cichlids, C. meeki, were allowed to feed on Tubifex worms for 5 min. In the experiment, the worms were distributed to simulate a patchy resource with 2 levels of average abundance. The dominant member of each cichlid pair exhibited feeding behavior consistent with expectations from optimal foraging theory, i.e., it fed primarily in the most profitable patch initially. When food was relatively abundant, the subordinate fish fed predominantly in the 2nd most profitable patch. In this way it minimized the costs associated with agonistic activity. The usefulness of a multivariate approach in the study of foraging behavior is illustrated.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The social interactions within groups of Norway rats (R. norvegicus) had a strong impact on the individual pattern of copulation which, in turn, affects sperm precedence and the probability of implantation of this species. Males alternated uninterrupted ejaculatory series, augmenting each other''s copulatory investment. Females took turns mating after receiving an intromission, collectively potentiating the males'' copulatory behavior; increasing the number of estrous females increased the number of intromissions and ejaculations achieved by each male but did not affect the amount of copulation experienced by each female. These turn-taking patterns within each sex provided the opportunity to change partners and permitted the emergence of different sex-typical patterns of copulation. The dominant male contributed more intromissions and tended to give each female more ejaculations than the subordinates did. Dominant males were also more likely to inhibit the subordinates'' sperm transport. Females competed among themselves for the opportunity to mate with a male as he approached ejaculation and were likely to protect more of the dominant male''s sperm transport than the subordinate male''s.

DT Article
AB A 9 1/2 wk study of 8 pairs of wild-caught, full-winged, green-winged teal in flight pens showed that paired males both directed courtship toward, and attempted forced copulation on, females paired to other males. Chronology of activities in individuals indicated the following conclusions: this courtship was probably related to building of liaisons and subsequent mate-changes; males were assessing female reproductive condition and selectively attempting to force copulation on females in laying or pre-laying condition; and attempts by males to force copulation on their own mates were associated with forced copulation attempts on the latter. Females tried to avoid forced copulations by fleeing and hiding from pursuing males; their mates attacked assaulting males and tried to dislodge them. A mixed male reproductive strategy involving sperm competition is indicated.

AB Six different behavior patterns were studied across the circadian spectrum in the tropical feshwater snail B. africanus. Snails entrained to a circadian light/dark regimen show a diurnal rhythm of locomotor activity, and feeding, photokinetic responsiveness, egg laying and hatching all follow a similar pattern. The rhythms are endogenous and persist under constant conditions. In contrast, defecation occurs mainly during the dark period. This antiphase relationship may be due in part to a cycle of absorption and fragmentation in the digestive gland cells, but it is likely that other factors are involved.

AB Territories of the chaffinch (F. coelebs) and great tit (P. major) overlap on the mainland of Scotland but are mutually exclusive on adjacent islands. Birds on the mainland responded only to playbacks of conspecific song. On the island, both species responded to conspecific song and non-conspecific song, but not to the song of the willow warbler. On the island, great tits responded significantly more strongly to songs than did the chaffinches. When chaffinches were removed from part of the island woodland, great tits rapidly expanded into the vacated areas. On the island there may be a limit to the co-existence of these 2 spp. because they forage in a similar manner, resulting in interspecific territoriality not seen on the richer mainland environment.

TI PARENT-OFFSPRING RECOGNITION IN BANK SWALLOWS (RIPARIA-RIPARIA) .1.
   NATURAL-HISTORY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A field study of the highly colonial bank swallow (R. riparia) revealed several contexts in which parent-offspring recognition occurs. Parents find their young away from the bank when the young make spontaneous flights from the burrow, and also when the young, after such flights, have returned to incorrect burrows. The resident adult in the latter situation also shows recognition, by evicting alien chicks. Resident adults also make mistakes and feed alien chicks. An analysis of these mistakes revealed that the majority of mistakes are made by the male parent, and mistakes generally do not exceed 0.5% of the parent''s total feeding bouts. Parents also feed young in a creche away from the bank, both before and after the burrow is vacated.

TI ON THE FUNCTIONS OF STRIDULATION BY THE PASSALID BEETLE
   ODONTOTAENIUS-DISJUNCTUS (COLEOPTERA, PASSALIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) are most hesitant to continue attacking and take longer to kill and eat stridulating passalid beetles (O. disjunctus) than silenced beetles. This is an experimental demonstration of the deterrent capability of disturbance stridulation by an insect but has no active defences against the predator. Stridulation is not necessary for congregation by colony members. Silenced beetles congregate as effectively as controls. There is no evidence that the disturbance stridulation causes predictable responses in other colony members of this presocial beetle.

TI VISUAL GUIDANCE OF PREDATORY ATTACK BY A SCINCID LIZARD,
   EUMECES-LATICEPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Visual stimuli are important determinants of the exact placement of predatory bites by the broad-headed skink (E. laticeps), a member of a varied group of lizards known for their chemoreceptive abilities, the Autarchoglossa. The skinks preferentially attack large larval bess beetles (Popilius disjunctus) just posterior to the head and use visual cues to identify the attack site. Head coloration or contrast between the dark head and light anterior thorax releases attack just behind the edge of the darkly colored region. Skinks also employ a directional cue to guide attacks to the postcephalic region. This directional stimulus is anterior position with respect to the prey''s direction of motion, which is a fairly reliable indicator of head location even in the absence of distinctive head color. When color/contrast and directional cues disagree, the end of the prey bearing head-color stimuli is selectively attacked if the color cues are strong, but both ends are attacked with nearly equal frequency when coloration is less obvious. An artificially large and brightly painted head appears to function as a supernormal releasing stimulus for attack.

TI EQUILIBRIUM FLOCK SIZE AND FACTORS AFFECTING ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE IN
   FEEDING HOUSE SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB One way in which the size of flocks of sparrows [Passer domesticus] feeding on barley seed was limited was through the attainment of an equilibrium flock size (EFS). The 2 most important factors influencing the EFS were the size of the densest patch of seed at a feeding site and seed density outside the patch. Birds appeared to arrive at random but to depart in response to a giving up time (GUT), the length of which was positively related to preceding interpeck intervals. The GUT correlated best with the average interval for the last 3 pecks before leaving. The rate of fighting per bird increased with flock size. Some birds remained behind when others left and may be those whose low peck rate increased when other birds left.

AB Reproductive success of male fiddler crabs U. rapax depends on the numbers of females a male can attract, and the fecundity of these females. The latter correlates directly with female size. The size of a female in a mated pair is directly correlated with the size of the male. Older, larger males experience greater reproductive success than smaller, younger males. Females may be highly selective in mating, while males are not. The question of why females should select a male whose size is correlated with hers is discussed.

TI ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR AND PREDATOR RECOGNITION IN BELDINGS
   GROUND-SQUIRRELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Whether Belding''s ground squirrels (S. beldingi) recognize predators under natural conditions was examined. These squirrels were observed for 300 h during 2 consecutive summers, during which 1029 aerial and terrestrial interactions were described, including 299 interactions with animals known to prey on squirrels. Squirrels responded differentially to predators and non-predators, to predators that hunt differently, and to contextually different interactions with the same predator. Responses shown in encounters with predators included trill and chirp vocalizing, upright posting, crouching, running to burrow entrances, entering burrows, approaching or chasing predators and doubling-back on pursuing predators. Ground squirrels appear to adjust their antipredator behavior, depending on the amount and kind of danger they face during an encounter.

AB When 1-yr-old rhesus monkeys and their mothers were removed from the colony to a strange situation, infants'' activity was initially low compared with behavior 6 days later. Although absolute values did not differ between males and females, correlations did. That is, 3 days after the return to the colony, correlations with baseline colony behavior were significantly positive for females, while males had 1 significantly negative correlation. Males had more significant correlations than females when behavior in the strange situation was correlated with colony scores. Of the 6 individuals that had adverse early experience, 5 showed extreme behavior. The exception was CT, son of a female with a very low excitability score. In fact for all males, mothers''s colony scores were significantly correlated with sons'' behavior in the strange situation.

TI BABOON PROGRESSIONS - ORDER OR CHAOS - STUDY OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL GROUP
   GEOMETRY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Baboon progressions were sampled in Africa during 1963-1972. There was no invariable progression order, either by individual or by age-sex class. Most progression orders were essentially random. In the few deviant cases, usually in dangerous situations, juveniles and adult males were over-represented in the front third, adult males in the last third. Small infants were usually next to their mother, large ones next to each other. Deviations probably result primarily from residual effects of pre-progression social groupings, sometimes combined with differential roles in group co-ordination, and shifts in position, including male peripheralization, when baboons are faced with danger. Statistical techniques for analysis of group geometry are discussed. Some are insensitive to subtle spatial patterns.

Female offspring are more frequently associated with their mothers than are male offspring. Hinds which do not breed again in the offspring''s 2nd yr are more frequently associated with them than are hinds which do. Hinds which breed, but whose calves die, also associate more frequently with their preceding offspring than hinds whose calves survive, though not as highly as hinds which do not breed at all. There is a decrease in association between hinds and their male offspring during the rut. Possible causal and functional explanations for these differences are discussed.

AB In this investigation of mother-infant behavior in the field, quantitative data were collected comparable to those available from studies of captive baboons (P. anubis) and rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Using a variety of measures, the course of the mother-infant relationship of 7 infants over ages 3-23 mo. is described. Many of the measures of the mother-infant contact decreased most sharply between 10-12 mo. of age. Maternal rejection had an important role in decreasing infant suckling and riding. These behavior patterns were replaced by the infant grooming its mother or staying nearby. Individual differences between mother-infant pairs were marked. Such differences in infant experience probably lead to the marked differences in personalities observable in adult baboons.

TI EFFECTS OF TESTOSTERONE UPON FEEDING IN MALE MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Food intake and pattern of feeding were recorded in intact and castrate male mice. Intact adults are larger and eat more than pre-pubertal castrates, due to rapid growth at puberty. Castration in adulthood has little effect upon food intake, but feeding becomes concentrated into large, infrequent meals. Change in meal size appears primary and is reversed by testosterone. During rapid growth at puberty, both meal size and frequency are high. Testosterone may affect feeding in 2 ways. Rapid weight gain at puberty leads to high meal size and frequency, but in adulthood meal size is depressed. Meal size in adults is further depressed by stimuli from females; testosterone probably affects a general mechanism for altering feeding when other activities have a high priority.

AB As animals move from one place to another, there are patterns to their movements. It is hypothesized that these patterns are such that the net rate of food gain is maximized. To test this hypothesis, a model of a harvesting animal is formulated. A harvesting animal is one whose movements are determined solely by previous movement and not by responses to sensory stimuli. Available data suggest that this harvesting model is inappropriate and that models which incorporate responses to sensory stimuli are likely to provide a better predictive understanding of animal movement patterns.

AB Temporal and sequential aspects of the courtship of the small sulfur butterfly, E. lisa, are described quantitatively from motion picture film and videotape recordings of interactions between males and perched, virgin females in outdoor cages. Successful courtship (ending in copulation) is divided into 8 distinct behavioral events, is sequentially highly stereotyped, and lasts only a few seconds. Examination of unsuccessful courtship reveals features required if copulation is to occur. Field observations of induced and naturally occurring interactions point out that the courtship has no prolonged aerial components and that ascending flights occur between males and mated females only. The discussion focuses on relationships between mating behavior, color patterns and ecology of butterflies.

TI PRECOCIAL BEHAVIOR OF CALLOW WORKERS OF ARMY ANT NEIVAMYRMEX-NIGRESCENS
   - IMPORTANCE OF STIMULATION BY ADULTS DURING MASS RECRUITMENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Callows of the army ant N. nigrescens do not participate in predatory raids until 3-7 days after their eclosion. Within 24 h after their eclosion, the entire callow population joins with the adult ants in emigrating to a new nesting site. This emigration is accomplished by mass recruitment of the callows by the mature adult workers. Tests show that adults use mechanical stimulation to arouse callows to trail-following. Callows remain in the nest during raiding because their central location effectively sequesters them from the excitatory effects of the adult workers. Early participation of callows in the predatory raids suggests a precocial development that might have evolved as an adaptation for group predation and nomadic emigrations.

TI BIRD SONG DIALECTS, REPERTOIRE SIZE, AND KIN ASSOCIATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The possession of large repertoires of songs by some species of songbirds is offered an explanation arising from a model of the evolutionary restraints which restrict aggression within a species (Treisman 1977). This showed that animals which settle near kin may obtain a selective advantage, provided both sides can recognize their relationship in the sense that they apply appropriately modified aggressive strategies. To ensure this recognition a genetic marker will not suffice. Two factors may favor such kin association. There may be in some species a tendency to prefer territories near the place of hatching, or further guidance on where to settle may be provided by the observation of learned characteristics of the behavior of neighbors where these are associated with place of origin (and therefore with relatedness). Dialect variations in song may serve this purpose, providing an indicator which can vary continuously in 2 dimensions and in relation to which a bird may position itself at the point of maximum familiarity. The greater the potential behavioral variability, the greater will be the scope for conveying this information by developing dialect variations. This advantage would lead to selection for the acquisition and expression of large repertoires of songs.

TI DO HENS SUFFER IN BATTERY CAGES - ENVIRONMENTAL PREFERENCES AND WELFARE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The question ''Do hens suffer in battery cages?'' is difficult to answer because of the problem of objectively assessing suffering in animals. Preference tests may be one way of throwing light on this difficult problem. Some experiments on habitat preference in domestic hens are described. No preference was observed between a commercial battery cage and a large pen when hens were given continuous access to both. A simultaneous choice between a battery cage and an outside hen-run showed a clear preference for the run, but choice was strongly influenced by prior experience. The strength of the run preference was investigated by pitting the run against food and access to companions.

TI MALE TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR IN MASON BEE HOPLITIS-ANTHOCOPOIDES
   (HYMENOPTERA-MEGACHILIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male H. (H.) anthocopoides patrol territories defended against conspecific males. Each territory includes blooming Echium vulgare, sole food of females, and rocks or bare soil for resting perches. Dominant territorial males chase intruders, engage them in face-to-face hovers before chasing, and briefly grapple with them. Subordinate males disperse up to 0.5 km from emergence sites to establish territories. Territorial males may also chase heterospecific visitors to Echium. Females mate once, soon after emergence, when visiting Echium. Territoriality progressed in 4 stages. In the pre-Echium stage (4 days) before blooming, a few males patrolled large territories. In the maximum competition stage (7 days) 80% of males and 20% of females emerged but only a few Echium bloomed. Each territorial male patrolled only 1 Echium plant and was replaced by a competitor in a median of 2 days. In the mature territory stage (15 days) the remaining bees emerged and the remaining Echium bloomed. Males increased territorial size to a mean length of 5.3 m, encompassing several Echium plants, and remained a median of 16 days. Boundaries often overlapped and shifted during the day. In the senescent stage (28 days) males became scarce and patrolled greatly extended territories. Territoriality in H. anthocopoides may give a mating advantage to the males, disperse the subordinate males to new stands of the ephemeral E. vulgare where they might meet virgin females emigrating from unfavorable localities, and increase the probablity of outcrossing among the bees. Male territorial behavior in other megachild bees is compared with that of H. anthocopoides.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Readiness to attack is controlled by various stimulus patterns displayed in the context of social behavior. The effect of such stimulus patterns and their combinations can be measured in terms of behavioral quantities. In search of algorithms, f(a, b), describing the combined effect of 2 stimulus patterns, a and b, those solutions are of particular interest which represent f as the combination of 2 terms, f1(a) and f2(b), which each depend on one stimulus pattern only. The existence of such solutions supports the aummption of independent processes controlled by a and b, respectively. Social communication is viewed as a process in which a slender manipulates and controls states of behavioral readiness in receiver. Threat displays may tip the balance between aggressive and submissive tendencies in either direction, with the probability of the outcome largely depending upon the initial disposition of the receiver.

TI EFFECTS OF VISION ON GENERAL LOCOMOTOR BEHAVIOR OF GOLDFISH,
   CARASSIUS-AURATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Comparison of the locomotor behavior of normal, unilaterally and bilaterally blinded goldfish (C. auratus) demonstrated the roles of perspective vision (depth perception), which requires binocular vision, and of vision provided by only one eye, in the control of locomotion. Because normal and bilaterally blinded fish exhibited similar size and direction of angles of turn, a similar number of consective turns in the same direction and the same turning frequency, normal, binocular vision plays no role in the control of turning behavior. Unilaterally blinded fish exhibited a strong bias in turning behavior which resulted in their displaying circus movements toward the blinded side, a direction opposite to that reported by others for both invertebrates and vertebrates with unilateral sensory elimination. The mean step length was significantly increased by both uni- and bilateral blinding, and its temporal relationship with turning frequency and distance swum was also changed. Perspective vision (binocular) therefore controls these parameters. The significantly lower velocity of bilaterally blinded fish and the similarity between the other 2 test groups, indicated that sight by one eye only was sufficient to mediate velocity control.

TI COMMUNICATION AND SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN A COLONY OF COMMON GRACKLES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Most communication among common grackles Quiscalus quiscula occurs at distances of less than a few meters in the noisy environment of a breeding colony. The adaptations of communication to these conditions and the effects of communication in regulating individuals'' spatial relationships were examined. For each of 6 vocalizations and 5 action patterns studied in one colony, variation in the form of the display, the circumstances associated with its use and the response it elicits were studied. Each individual, male or female, has one characteristic, stereotyped song pattern that would facilitate individual recognition between mates. Variation in the components of vocalizations and action patterns is of 2 kinds: unidimensional, with either covarying or nested components, or multidimensional, with independently varying components, alternatives that have different implications for communication. The wide-spectrum sounds made by common grackles offer advantages in close-range communication in colonies because the ease of locating such signals would minimize the cocktail-party effect, although they would have disadvantages in long-range communication. Most vocalizations of common grackles lack associations with specific responses or external contexts, a situation that should often characterize short-range communication between acquainted individuals. The responses to vocalizations vary with context, especially the initial spatial relationships and identities of the interactors.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB The procedures of this experiment were carried out on 61 dyads of 12 Macaca irus monkeys. None of the monkeys had had prior experience with any of the others. Each of the 61 pairs was placed in an observation cage for 2 10 min. observation periods spaced approximately 2 mo. apart. In the interim, each pair was together for 4 additional 10 min. periods under 1 of 3 acquaintance conditions: no acquaintance, visual acquaintance, and physical acquaintance. The dependent variables of the experiment were changes in social behavior frequencies as a consequence of the 3 acquaintance conditions. Physical contact produced reliable decreases in total social interaction, grooming and increases in average distance. Visual contact by itself produced no reliable effects. Thus, the experiment failed to show that the macaque''s elaborate visual communication system is effective in the absence of the opportunity for physical contact.

DT Article
AB Intra-specific ag-gressive interactions between individuals of 8 species of hermit crabs were observed. The displays executed and the reactions to those displays during 1000 to 2000 interactions were recorded. These results were transferred to IBM punch cards and analyzed to 7094 computer. The repertoire of behaviors shown by recipient crabs during aggressive interactions, regardless of the preceeding act, was determined and the spectrum of acts following each behavior pattern compared to this overall spectrum. Thus it was determined if, how much, and in what way an act by one crab affected the behavior of a recipient crab. Some 3-act sequence analyses were carried out and showed that 2nd-order probability effects are significant in determining what act will be executed following any given act. In all species, a strong social facilitation effect was noted for some displays. Using information theory formulae, the average information transmitted by each display in each species was calculated. This varied from 0.35 bits/display for Clibinarius tricolor to 0.52 bits/display in Pagurus marshi. The average for the 8 species was 0.41 bits of in-formation/display.

AB Experiments are reported which investigate the effect on the discrimination of circles and squares in tropical fish of specific pretraining on circle/rectangle and circle/large square discriminations. It is noted that training on a series of circle/rectangle pariings enables the discrimination of circles and squares to take place, while training on a series of circle/large square pairings does not. These results tend to disprove the theory of shape discrinination put forward by Deutsh, while supporting the more general theories of the type put forward by Sutherland and Lawrence.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Development of social behavior and the stimuli associated with it were studied in 2 separate experiments. In the first, a schedule of classes of social behaviors, ages of occurrence, and the relevant stimuli were suggested from observations of White Cobb cockerels. The results led to a 6-item schedule, part of which followed work by Guhl. In the second study, 2 groups of White Leghorn cockerels were used. Birds in one group were isolated from one through 70 days of age; the other group were raised normally. During isolation 4 patterns shown by the normal birds were shown by the isolated birds. However, systematic delay in the behavior was noted among the isolated group. At 70 days of age the isolated birds were assembled together; immediate and intense interactions took place involving all of the birds. Full social organization was apparent within several days. It was concluded that social behaviours occurred during isolation in the absence of stimulation from other birds and that isolation does not prevent later social organization. The specific behaviors shown during development were further classified as synthesized and differentiated and this classification was applied to the present data.

DT Article
AB The following statements are restricted to heterosexual pairs of domesticated strains provided with suitable nest boxes. The effects of being able to hear the Loud Warble of other males appears to stimulate males to warble more than they would otherwise. This also seems to stimulate, or be associated with, continued sperm production (i.e. availability of sperm upon milking) and oviposition. The effects of being able to see or being able to hear other pairs are associated with significantly heavier testes and vasa deferentia. The opportunity to hear large amounts of warbling from other pairs seems to inhibit female receptivity to male precopulatory behavior, as measured by the number of times females solicited for or engaged in copulation per hour. The opportunity to hear other males warbling seems to stimulate more males to perform extensive precopulatory behavior, thus, perhaps, in the long run helping to offset the decreased female receptivity also produced. The opportunity to see but not hear others appears to stimulate reproductive activities in both members of a pair as compared to neither being able to see nor hear others. The opportunity to hear other pairs seems more stimulating in this regard than being only able to see other pairs. The opportunity to see other pairs appears to stimulate female''s nest box activities; however, the opportunity to see and hear other females is less effective in unpaired females than also being able to hear male vocalizations. The opportunity to see others seems more stimulating to all reproductive activities than not being able to see or hear other pairs.

AB A variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors shape an animal's antipredator behaviour. Flight initiation distance (FID) is a common way to evaluate antipredator behaviour and is used to assess an individual's shyness or boldness. Numerous FID studies, in a variety of taxa, have shown that FID is a decision that is sensitive to both the costs and benefits of flight. While there is some evidence that individuals may have repeatable FIDs, and there are several genes associated with FID (DRD4 and SERT), few studies have quantified the genetic variance of FID. Knowledge of genetic basis permits us to understand the evolutionary potential of a trait within a population, and heritable variation is yet another mechanism that enables animals to respond to a dynamically changing world. Here we conducted a variance decomposition analysis using the quantitative genetic mixed model (i.e. the 'animal model') to identify the degree to which genetic and nongenetic factors explained variation in FID within a population of wild yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. Within our 18-year data set of individually marked individuals, we found significant heritable variation for FID that we estimated at 0.15. These results demonstrate that genetics, in addition to environmental factors, influence an animal's fear response. Understanding evolvability and plasticity of FID could have important implications for conservation. (c) 2025 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social learning, which enables the transfer of information between individuals, is a key adaptive function. Many ungulate species live in large gregarious groups, where there is potential to obtain vital information from conspecifics. However, there is a lack of data concerning the cognitive processes involved in social learning in the ungulates. This study focuses on a domestic species, the goat, Capra hircus, and tests whether they are capable of using social information to solve a foraging problem and if successive transmissions can corrupt information. We used a diffusion-chain paradigm, in which an individual can learn by observing a single trained model and subsequently become a model for the following individual in the chain. We used a puzzle box that could be opened using two different techniques. A majority of goats were able to use the same technique that they saw performed by a conspecific, with a positive association between opening success and rate of observation of the model. Unsuccessful goats also made more attempts to open the box with the technique previously used by the model. This is the first evidence of horizontal diffusion for a new foraging technique in goats. As dispersed foragers, goats may be efficient at monitoring the foraging activities of their conspecifics. (c) 2025 The Authors.

AB This paper is the first step in a study that aims to use details of mating and courtship behaviour to explain realized patterns of interbreeding between closely related species. We worked with three Galapaganus weevil species (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in the Galapagos Archipelago, one introduced (Galapaganus howdenae) and two endemics that are sister species: Galapaganus conwayensis and Galapaganus ashlocki. We tested three hypotheses regarding divergence in mating behaviour. The first hypothesis is based on the widespread pattern of rapid divergence in sexual traits and predicts pronounced divergence between all three weevil species, with no 'phylogenetic signal'. The second hypothesis is based on the weevils' phylogeny and predicts greater similarity between the endemics relative to the introduced species. The third hypothesis is based on an observation of gene flow into the more distantly related introduced species (G. howdenae) from one of the endemics (G. ashlocki) and predicts greater overall similarity between the endemic and its more distantly related introduced relative. We found a complex suite of similarities and differences between the weevils. However, we found no predominant pattern of similarity between endemics or between the highland endemic and the introduced species. There was also no broad overall divergence between the three species. These results suggest that realized hybridization and introgression may follow specific key traits that make a disproportionate contribution. We discuss which particular copulatory courtship behaviours may have such a role. Further work involving mate preference and host plant preference tests is required to relate genome-wide patterns of hybridization and introgression between the weevils to potential causes of reproductive isolation between them. It is clear, however, that understanding such patterns will benefit from detailed analysis of potential behavioural causes of reproductive isolation.

AB The assassin bug Stenolemus giraffa preys upon various web-building spiders, which are themselves dangerous predators. Here I review several aspects of the predatory behaviour of S. giraffa to argue that, unlike many web-invading araneophagic species, its primary predatory strategy is based on stealth. Going unnoticed in a spider web is a difficult task for an insect because the web acts as an extension of the spider's sensory system. Despite encountering substantial variation in web type and spider behaviour, S. giraffa can successfully adjust its behaviour to prey upon several distinct spider species. This supports the idea that dangerous prey can act as selective factors that favour flexibility in predators. Further, I suggest that the complex behaviour of S. giraffa can emerge from a simple set of seemingly 'hardwired' yet flexible rules that are principally guided by sensory systems. Still, other details in the behaviour of S. giraffa suggest that its ability for flexible problem solving could also involve cognitive processes that can fine-tune an innate predatory strategy. As part of this special issue honouring Bill Eberhard and Mary Jane West-Eberhard, I also briefly illustrate how detailed observations of behaviour are essential in disentangling hypotheses about the predatory strategy of araneophagic species.

AB Courtship vocalizations can influence mate choice and reproductive success and thus evolve through sexual selection. House mice, Mus musculus, are intensively studied; however, little is known about their vocalizations emitted during courtship sequences and whether and/or how they influence male copulatory success. To address these questions, we recorded the behaviour and vocalizations of pairs of wild house mice across distinct phases of courtship and mating. Over 53 000 vocalizations were detected and classified, and of these ca. 90% were ultrasonic (USV) and 10% were broadband (BBV) vocalizations, presumably emitted by males and females, respectively. Mice altered their vocal rate, composition and repertoire at each stage of courtship and mating. They increased the emissions of all simple USVs while reducing other calls upon contact with a potential mate. Then, once males began mounting and engaging in other sexual interactions, the pairs emitted more complex calls, especially harmonic USVs and BBVs with spectral nonlinearities. Vocalizations were closely associated with male mating behaviour and peaked in rates and complexity just before males approached the female to mount. USV bouts began earlier and contained more complex syllables when mounting attempts ended in copulation. As courtship progressed, the timing of USV and BBV emissions became tightly synchronized, as with duetting of songbirds. We observed several differences in the vocal repertoire and spectral features of calls between mice that successfully copulated with ejaculation and those that did not. USV emission was positively correlated with male sexual behaviours, especially among copulating mice, suggesting that the effect of USV emission on male mating success depends on their sexual behaviour, and vice versa. Our results show that the courtship vocalizations of wild house mice are more complex and dynamic than those previously reported and provide the first evidence for vocalizations that correlate with and predict male copulatory success.

AB Awareness of one's own mental states, also known as metacognition, is an important component of human self-awareness. In recent decades, several studies have investigated nonhuman metacognition and evidence of this ability has notably been gathered in catarrhine primates. Conversely, numerous studies on capuchin monkeys have reported mixed or negative results. Because it has been suggested that the failure of capuchins may be due to species-related limitations of classical metacognition tasks, we tested metacognition in the brown capuchin, Sapajus apella, using a novel experimental paradigm adapted from a study of human infants. In this experiment, capuchins had to choose between two boxes, one of which had previously been baited with a treat under their gaze, before searching the hidden content of the chosen box. As the treat was surreptitiously removed, the time capuchins were willing to search the box for the treat could be used as a nonverbal postdecision indicator of metacognitive confidence, with longer persistence times indicating greater confidence in remembering which box was baited and expecting to find the treat in the chosen box. Consistent with the possibility that capuchins possess metacognitive abilities, capuchins persisted longer in their search after a correct versus incorrect choice. This result suggests that metacognition in primates is not restricted to catarrhines. Although nonmetacognitive explanations are possible, experimental paradigms involving a postdecision indicator of confidence, such as persistence, have advantages over classical paradigms and offer promising perspectives for investigating metacognition in a wide range of animals.

AB While acoustic signals are highly flexible, their context-dependent changes remain poorly understood. Birdsong is a model of choice to explore these aspects. As repetition and diversity of song elements largely determine the overall characteristics of signals and such song characteristics as versatility and repertoire size can plastically change in different social contexts, we hypothesized that the repetition of syllables and syllable sequences could also be context dependent. Here, we used the song of the collared flycatcher as a study system. We recorded the song of focal males under different simulated sociosexual contexts (solo singing, intruder male, approaching female and counter-singing situations in the natural environment), and quantified the context-dependent changes in song structure. As well as the commonly used acoustic variables repertoire size, number of syllables in the song and versatility, we also measured the richness (number of different types) and abundance (number of occurrences) of the repeated syllables and syllable sequences in the song bout recorded in different social contexts. We found lower richness of short repeated sequences and a smaller repertoire size in the context of an approaching female compared to the solo context. Conversely, we found higher richness of long repeated sequences and songs with more syllables in counter-singing compared to the solo context in the song of the focal male. Our study provides evidence that the syllable sequences in the song bout can change depending on the social context in collared flycatchers. Our study also emphasizes the importance of considering the repetition-describing characteristics in addition to the commonly used acoustic characteristics when studying animal acoustic communication.

TI Shedding light on nocturnal behaviour: a cost-effective solution for
   remote, infrared video recording in the field
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
DE DIY; field equipment; field observation; infrared camcorder; IR filming
AB For behavioural ecologists who study nocturnal animals, recording behaviour at night is essential but expensive. Added difficulties arise when filming minifauna, as the most popular methods of recording nocturnal behaviour (i.e. trail cameras) function at a minimum focal distance of 3 m or greater. Infrared (IR)-sensitive camcorders can provide excellent footage of smaller animals at a shorter distance but can cost over $1000 USD. In addition, these pricey cameras rarely stand up to the elements in the field and are also limited by short battery life. Here, we provide a field-tested method to record nocturnal behaviour, of both small and large animals, at a fraction of the cost. We have had great success modifying inexpensive, commercially available action cameras (GoPro Hero4 camcorders) to be IR sensitive, powering these units with cellular phone power banks and continuously recording behaviour overnight while using an array of a dozen cameras. In total, all components of a recording kit are available for under $150 USD at the time of this writing (February 2024) and can be easily assembled using the guidelines described in the present paper. This paper provides researchers with an economical strategy to record continuous behaviour in nocturnally active animals, with a kit that outperforms most currently available camera options across various contexts. While the proposed kit may provide the greatest benefits to researchers studying minifauna, the recording set-up can be easily and cheaply adapted to capture nocturnal megafauna behaviour. As such, we hope these methods increase the accessibility of science and expand the experimental toolkits of biologists interested in the fascinating, but much understudied, world of nocturnal animal behaviour.

AB Across their lifetime, individuals experience differing social environments and may adjust their social behaviour accordingly, leading to age-dependent social behaviour. Studying the ontogeny of social behaviour is of great importance, as it can provide valuable insights into the development and maintenance of sociality. So far, most studies investigating age-dependent social behaviour have focused on animal species exhibiting parental care (e.g. primates, cetaceans). However, in species lacking parental care, juveniles' behaviour likely has a greater impact on their survival than in species with parental care, owing to the lack of parental feeding and protection. Here, we explored whether affiliative behaviour differed between juvenile and adult eastern water dragons, Intellagama lesueurii, a species with no parental care. Specifically, we investigated the effect of age on individuals' social associations and social environment (i.e. number of available social partners). We found that adult males were less gregarious, found in smaller groups and had fewer associates than both juveniles and adult females. Additionally, adult males fostered weaker associations than juveniles. Most importantly, this phenomenon was observed despite adult males experiencing similar opportunities to socialize as adult females and juveniles on the observation scale, while having more opportunities than juveniles on the yearly scale. Our findings may be driven by an adaptive avoidance of adult males by juveniles and adult females. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Within breeding years, male birds vary in their reproductive strategy. While some maintain monogamy with a social partner, others also engage with extrapair partners, while others forgo monogamy altogether in favour of exclusively seeking extrapair paternity. Although theory predicts that extrapair paternity is beneficial to males, which sire extrapair offspring without investing in costly parental care, empirical examples from wild populations are sparse. We used 17 years of data from a closed population of house sparrows, Passer domesticus, with a complete genetic pedigree, to test the hypothesis that extrapair paternity increases male lifetime reproductive success. We compared a mixed strategy of within-pair (or social) and extrapair paternity with total genetic monogamy and total extrapair paternity. We demonstrate that males who combine within-pair and extrapair paternity have increased reproductive success against the other two groups. Our results also suggest that males that exclusively seek extrapair paternity have the lowest lifetime fitness. Overall, we provide an empirical demonstration of the theory, showing that where males can sire extrapair offspring alongside within-pair offspring, extrapair paternity is beneficial to male lifetime fitness.

AB Joint attention, the ability for interlocuters to coordinate their attentional state on an aspect of the environment or behaviour of mutual interest, is considered one of the key capacities underlying human cooperation. Originally considered unique to primates, emerging evidence in diverse taxa now suggests it may have convergently evolved in response to similar socioecological pressures. Here, we examine a previously undescribed visual signal in the plains zebra, Equus quagga: the 'headbob'. Headbobs are flexibly produced in two major contexts: initiating joint travel and initiating social behaviour between partners. We investigated whether this signal meets three key criteria used to infer joint attention in nonhuman animals: first-order intentional communication, sensitivity to receiver attentional state and common ground. In response to a headbob, receivers modified their behaviour to facilitate joint engagement in a coordinated act. We found that behaviour was more synchronized between social partners following a headbob and that travel initiations were more likely to result in coordinated travel than those without a headbob. These preliminary findings suggest this behaviour may serve as a joint attention mechanism, warranting further and more detailed investigation. This study illuminates the importance of including understudied taxa, such as ungulates, in the study of advanced sociocognitive and communicative capabilities.

AB The number and quality of social bonds can have major consequences for fitness. For example, in socially monogamous species with biparental care, pair bond quality has been linked to the latency to breed as well as the number and survival of offspring. Given these benefits, what mechanisms prevent some individuals from forming strong pair bonds? Markers of physiological stress and ageing, such as oxidative stress and telomere length, might mediate individual differences in behavioural performance. However, the possibility that physiological stress could also constrain the strength of the pair bond has rarely been investigated. We show that in captive colonies of the socially monogamous, gregarious zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, individuals with higher levels of plasma lipid oxidative damage formed weaker pair bonds. This effect was sex specific: while males with more oxidative damage spent less time in bodily contact with their prospective breeding partners, no such link was found in females. Although females experienced higher absolute levels of plasma oxidative damage, pair bond investment may have been more constrained in males due to the costly expression of their sexually selected traits. Pair bond strength was not associated with levels of the key antioxidant glutathione or with telomere length. Individuals' ability to form strong pair bonds may thus be constrained by their levels of oxidative damage, with potential downstream effects on fitness. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Behavioural lateralization, derived from cerebral lateralization, has generally been suggested to be closely associated with cognitive performance among all classes of vertebrates. Although extensive evidence has demonstrated the possible relationship between hand laterality and cognitive abilities, it remains unclear whether learning performance is well reflected by behavioural lateralization in scatterhoarding rodents that are highly dependent on paw -processing efficiency and cognitive ability during caching and cache recovery. Here, we measured the preference of the left/right paw and the speed with which rodents solve problems to examine the relationship between laterality and learning performance in three species of scatter -hoarding rodents, Pallas's squirrels, Callosciurus erythraeus, David's rock squirrels, Sciurotamias davidianus, and Siberian chipmunks, Tamias sibiricus. Two species (C. erythraeus and S. davidianus) had individual level lateralization of paw use and the strength of this lateralization correlated positively with learning performance. Although there were no significant paw preferences at the individual level in T. sibiricus, a negative relationship was found between learning performance and paw preference in this species. Our findings suggest that the correlations between learning performance and paw preference are species dependent, at least in the scatter -hoarding rodents. Future work is recommended to investigate the phylogenetic aspects of behavioural lateralization on cognitive performance of scatterversus larder -hoarding animals.

AB Wildlife tourism is expanding globally, driving the need to quantify its potential impacts. Studies on the effects of marine tourism on wildlife have focused on documenting behavioural changes, but whether tourism affects the activity levels, energy budgets and ultimately the survival prospects of target animals is largely unknown. To assess the effects of cage diving on the energy expenditure of white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, animal-borne cameras and accelerometer loggers were deployed on 18 white sharks at a cage-diving site (Neptune Islands Group Marine Park, South Australia) and recorded shark activity for ca. 490 h. A random forest machine-learning model was used to predict their behaviours based on 38 h of acceleration data with behaviours ground-truthed by animal-borne cameras. The presence of cage-diving boats using food-based attractants led to white sharks spending more time undertaking high-energy swimming and bursts of acceleration while decreasing low-energy swimming. However, raised activity during cage-diving operations was not reflected in a substantial shift in energy budgets. Calorific quantification of baits used by the cage-diving industry showed that one bait (tethered southern bluefin tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, gills and entrails) could fuel a white shark for more than a day, which could lead to temporary reduction or cessation of natural foraging, potentially impacting the health and fitness of the individual. Our study reveals new insights into the energetic effects of wildlife tourism on large marine predators. We highlight that while increases in metabolic rate are relatively small for continuously moving predators, the amount of food consumed may impact the health and fitness of individuals and should be considered when managing wildlife tourism activities.

AB Sociality is a key aspect of the ecology of many species, and it has important implications for conservation. Nevertheless, research on vertebrate sociality has focused predominantly on mammals and birds, while reptiles have been largely neglected. Here we present some of the first evidence of group living in freshwater turtles outside of resource use or reproduction contexts. We monitored the movements of clusters of juvenile Central American river turtles, Dermatemys mawii, and used simulations to compare our results to the null hypothesis of no social association. We found that turtles moved together non randomly and formed tighter clusters than would be expected by chance. Indeed, in several cases, two juveniles were monitored moving closely together, apparently following one another. This work was conducted in an area with uniform habitat and little or no structure, and the results cannot adequately be explained by habitat selection, foraging behaviour or mating behaviour, thus leaving social clustering (i.e. group living) as the most parsimonious interpretation. This suggests that turtles are more social than generally assumed and expands our understanding of the contexts and taxa in which sociality arises.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

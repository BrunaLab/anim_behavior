ID MALE SEXUAL ORNAMENTS; FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY; SELECTION; PATTERNS;
   SIGNAL
AB Fluctuating asymmetry is defined as random deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry in otherwise symmetrical morphological traits and originates from developmental errors during ontogeny. It is thought to reflect the inability of a genotype to buffer itself effectively against environmental perturbations, thus providing an honest phenotypic indicator of genetic quality. It has been proposed that females use the degree of asymmetry in male ornaments to assess male quality in mate choice. We studied whether fluctuating asymmetry in vertical bars in the sailfin molly, Poecilia latipinna, is a criterion in female mate preference, as has been shown before in a swordtail, Xiphophorus cortezi. Using both live stimulus males and silicon models, we found that females have significant preferences both for bars per se and for males with symmetrical bars. The total number of bars and the degree of fluctuating asymmetry were negatively related so fluctuating asymmetry in bars may be an honest signal. This phenomenon may have influenced the evolution of the male courtship display in P. latipinna. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We studied the interactions between cleaning gobies, Elacatinus spp.. at cleaning stations and territorial dusky damselfish, Stegastes fuscus, on a Barbadian fringing reef to;enhance our understanding of the behavioural impact of cleaning stations on members of a coral reef community. Cleaning stations within damselfish territories were visited by significantly fewer species and fewer individuals than those outside damselfish territories. At cleaning stations within damselfish territories, the main client was the territory holder itself. Client behaviour did not differ between the two types of cleaning station; however, cleaning gobies at stations within damselfish territories spent less time cleaning clients? their cleaning bouts were shorter, and their feeding rate on clients was slower. These effects appear to be due to the repeated aggression of territorial damselfish towards fish intruding on to their territories to visit cleaning stations. The overlap between a territorial damselfish and a cleaning station therefore appears to have detrimental impacts on cleaning goby foraging. The presence of cleaning stations within damselfish territories exerted some effects on the territory owners. Although the rates of intrusions were similar on territories with and without cleaning stations, damselfish with cleaning stations tended to chase intruders more often, had a lower foraging rate, and were at higher risk of egg predation because of increased intrusions by egg predators. A potential benefit to territorial damselfish is regular access to a cleaning station; however, the magnitude of this benefit is unknown. This study reveals that damselfish, which are ubiquitous on coral reefs, can generate significant variation in levels of use of cleaning stations, which leads to new questions relating to the settlement behaviour of both cleaning gobies and damselfish.

AB Two-chick broods of the blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, ordinarily exhibit stable dominance-subordinance, with the senior (first-hatched) chick habitually aggressive and the junior one habitually submissive (Nelson 1978, The Sulidae. Gannets and Boobies. London: Oxford University Press). But are both the subordinate and the dominant chick affected in their agonistic tendencies by early social experience? To answer this, we permanently paired subordinate and dominant chicks, 2-3 weeks old, with singletons (chicks lacking experience with a nestmate) by cross-fostering. During the first 4 h after pairing, subordinate chicks were seven times less aggressive than singletons and twice as likely to be submissive; dominant chicks were six times as aggressive as singletons. Although most subordinates consistently lost agonistic encounters during the first 10 days after pairing, the proportion of dominants that won decreased progressively until, by day 6, only about half of dominant chicks were winning. Early social experience has a strong but reversable training effect on both subordinates and dominants. Training as a subordinate showed more persistent effects than training as a dominant, possibly in part because our testing situation perpetuated subordinate training and counteracted dominant training.

AB We investigated intraspecific variation in incubation behaviour of wild Eurasian kestrels, Falco tinnunculus, in Finland and tested whether patterns of hatching asynchrony could be predicted from patterns of incubation. The timing of the onset of incubation varied considerably for 17 female kestrels. Eggs generally hatched in the order they were laid, and both total hatching span of the clutch and the pattern of eggs hatching on certain days corresponded well with incubation behaviour. This result was consistent with the idea that females have much control over hatching patterns. In the majority (65%) of cases, the proportion of daily incubation increased monotonically with the laying sequence, a pattern described previously in other birds. Unusual patterns of incubation (35%) were most common in females with poor body condition during incubation and may be the result of energy constraints during laying.

AB Spawning success of males and its correlates were investigated in a natural colony of whitebelly damselfish, A. leucogaster (Pomacentridae), to explore the criteria that females use in choosing mates, The mating success of individual males was variable, with some males acquiring as few as 5000 eggs and others as many as 450 000 eggs during a breeding season, Male spawning success was not correlated with body size, territory size, nest site parameters or parental care behaviour. Egg hatching success was not related to either male size or egg clutch size, and all males were capable of rearing eggs to hatching. The temporal sequence of choices by females indicated non-independent choice by females, such that males chosen by females on the first spawn of the day were also chosen by females that spawned later in the day. Field observations indicated that, in the absence of male courtship, females preferentially visited males that had eggs in their nest site. Males that had recently mated were preferred by females over those males with either late-stage eggs or no eggs in the nest. This female preference did not appear to be related to increased paternal care or egg clutch survival. Given that the mating system is promiscuous and non-resource based, and that there appears to be little difference among males in body size, females may be mating non-independently by mimicking the choice of other females.

AB Red squirrels, can produce alarm calls when they detect a potential predator. Observations of natural interactions between red squirrels and large birds, and predator-presentation experiments in the field, showed that red squirrels produce acoustically different alarm calls in response to aerial danger (live birds and a model hawk flown towards them) versus danger approaching from the ground (dogs and humans). The alarm call produced in response to aerial danger is acoustically convergent on the 'seet' alarm call produced by many species of passerine birds in response to raptors. The squirrels' 'seet' alarm is a short, low-amplitude, high-frequency call. These characteristics make the call difficult to localize, and is in a frequency range that is poorly perceived by raptors. Red squirrels produce much louder, wide-bandwidth bark calls in response to terrestrial danger. This is the first demonstration of predator-class specific alarm calls of red squirrels.

AB Models of reliable signalling assume that secondary sexual characters and other displays are more costly to individuals of low than high phenotypic quality, and that low quality individuals disproportionately compromise their reproduction and survival prospects by investment in signalling. A field study of barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, with sexually exaggerated tail feathers, supported this prediction. Males were captured by sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, more often than females, and captured males had shorter and more asymmetric tails than male barn swallows that were still alive at the end of the breeding season. These results suggest that there was a negative relationship between degree of sexual ornamentation and predation risk, consistent with the hypothesis that the secondary sexual character is a reliable indicator of quality.

AB Flights from foraging flocks of sanderlings, Calidris alba, were observed at Redcar, northeast England, in order to investigate how individual decisions to fly related to the behaviour of other flock members. Flights of sanderlings tended to be either of all birds in the flock on the ground, or of single birds or groups representing only a small proportion of the foraging flock. The latter accounted for the majority of movement events but after weighting by flock size the former accounted for the majority of bird movements. As flock size increased, the number of birds that flew without the whole flock taking flight increased. Thus, as flock size increased, it took more individual departures before the whole flock took flight. When flocks were disturbed by people or dogs, they were more cohesive, with more departures being of whole flocks. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Helping-at-the-nest in Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps, has been uniquely explained as an altruistic 'signal' used to 'show-off' and gain 'social prestige' within the group. Evidence from other cooperatively breeding bird species, however, instead suggests that helpers invest in nestlings in order to gain kin-selected benefits. This study investigates patterns of provisioning behaviour among parents and helpers for 27 broods over three breeding seasons, and assesses the potential for chick-feeding to operate as a signal in Arabian babblers. Provisioning rate accounted for much of the variation in fledging brood mass, suggesting that observed provisioning effort had potential fitness consequences for the brood. All group members provisioned at similar rates and made similar adjustments in feeding effort, irrespective of Sex and/or dominance rank within the group. Chick age had a positive linear effect, and group size a negative linear effect, upon provisioning rates of all group members. There was no obvious evidence that nestling provisioning operated as a signal within groups in any way. Contrary to earlier reports, individuals did not appear to 'interfere' with the provisioning efforts of subordinates; individuals in larger groups did spend longer in the nest tree before reaching the nest, but this was unaffected by sex, dominance rank and presence of other (more dominant) birds. These results suggest that provisioning by both helpers and parents in Arabian babblers functions not as a signal, but as sensible investment in chicks. In this species, high relatedness within groups may provide helpers with kin-selected benefits via such investment, although possible advantages from augmentation of group size cannot be ruled out.

ID INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; FIELD EXPERIMENTS; INTERFERENCE; BIRDS
AB Competition for a specific resource that is essential for the survival of both the competitors may be intense even between very dissimilar taxa. However, the importance of the effects caused by such interspecific competition has seldom been emphasized. These effects can appear as differences in individual foraging behaviour during the breeding season, which can result in critical variation in fitness. In this study we examined the effects of wood ants (Formica rufa group) on the abundance of other invertebrates on tree trunks and on the foraging site selection of breeding Eurasian treecreepers, which use the same habitat as wood ants. Arthropods were scarcer on the trunks with ants present; the treecreepers avoided these trunks and foraged for a shorter time on trunks with ants than on trunks without ants. We also tested experimentally the existence of competition between ants and treecreepers by comparing the foraging behaviour of breeding treecreepers on spruce trunks with ants, without ants and with experimentally reduced numbers of ants. On average arthropods were scarcest on trunks with ants present. Male treecreepers also foraged for a shorter time on spruce trunks with ants. The reduction in ant numbers allowed food resources on trunks to recover over a week and led to longer foraging times of the treecreepers on these trunks than on trunks with ants present. The longest treecreeper visits were on trunks without ants. Our results suggest that competition between two very different taxa may be effective in determining the behaviour of foraging individuals.

AB Among penguins, well-developed feeding chases where chicks run after adults and beg for food are found only in the genera Pygoscelis and Aptenodytes. Feeding chases involving adult Adelie penguins, with two chicks, compared to feeding chases involving those with one chick, were longer, occurred further from the breeding group and included more runs between each feed. Feeding chases were more likely when chicks were close together, and which chick was fed was more likely to switch after a feeding chase. These results suggest that feeding chases serve to minimize harassment from other chicks during feeding and to reduce the effects of sibling competition.

AB The brightness and colour of birds' plumages have been considered sexually selected traits, indicating health, condition or parasite resistance. However, recent studies with pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, suggest they are not signals used by females in mate choice. Instead, males might rely on plumage when assessing the quality of competitors. In this study, bright and experimentally dulled males were presented to a group of captive male pheasants to determine the response to differences in plumage brightness of the intruder. Males in the group directed more aggression to the experimentally dulled males than they did to any other males. This may be partly because they considered the dull males as novel males. When the bright and the dull males were both unknown, both still received more aggression than the average for any individual in the group, but dull males were attacked by more males. Bright males were attacked more by the dominants and dull males by the subordinates. The results show that plumage brightness may affect individual recognition, but also that it is used by males to assess the quality of competitors. Male-male interactions, therefore, may have played a role in the evolution of plumage brightness, either in the context of competition for mates or for resources when males gather into unisexual groups.

AB Feather pecking is a serious problem in poultry housing, as it may lead to feather damage, injuries and even mortality. We tested predictions of the two prevalent hypotheses claiming that feather pecking is related to dustbathing and foraging, respectively. Forty-two groups of 30 laying hen chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, were reared in pens with a slatted floor. Access to sand as a dustbathing substrate and straw as a foraging substrate was varied between groups. The rate of Feather pecking was measured in early development up to week 7. The provision of a sand area did not prevent the chicks from developing high rates of feather pecking that caused injuries. Chicks that had access to sand from day 10 showed higher rates of feather pecking than chicks that had access to sand from day 1. The provision of straw to chicks that had developed high rates of feather pecking led to a decrease in this behaviour. Chicks that could use both sand and straw from day 1 on did not show high rates of feather pecking, and no injuries were observed in these groups. There was no significant difference in dustbathing activity between housing conditions characterized by high or low rates of feather pecking. On the other hand, foraging activity was inversely related to the rate of feather pecking, and the occurrence of feather pecking could be delayed from week 4 to week 7 by postponing procedures that led to changes in foraging behaviour. In conclusion, the results show that the presence of an appropriate substrate for dustbathing does not prevent domestic chicks from developing feather pecking. On the other hand, housing conditions that promote foraging behaviour are effective in reducing and preventing feather pecking. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The Orthoptera include many species established as important model systems in the study of animal behaviour, particularly in relation to communication and mating systems. Although most interest has focused on auditory communication, increasing circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a widespread additional communication channel in the form of cuticular contact pheromones. Using the field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, we conducted a behavioural assay which demonstrated that males can distinguish the sex of conspecifics using such a Channel. Male response to females (courtship song) was completely abolished by using an organic solvent to remove cuticular hydrocarbons and associated compounds from a stimulus female. It was subsequently restored by painting the washed female with the dissolved extract. This technique controls for the possibility, inherent in previous tests, that the lack of response to washed body parts might be due to the washing process itself. The composition of the cuticles of males and females was analysed using gas chromatography. This revealed that the two sexes differ markedly in the quantities of the majority of the compounds found in the cuticular extract thar had previously been shown to be used in mate recognition. This suggests that mate recognition is likely to be due to the relative concentrations of several cuticular compounds, rather than a single 'sex pheromone'. It supports previous assertions of the existence of contact pheromones in the Orthoptera, suggesting that they may be widespread in this group.

TI Mate choice and competition for mates in the boat-tailed grackle
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID FEMALE CHOICE; SEXUAL SELECTION; MATING SUCCESS; EVOLUTION; BIRD; LEK
AB Behavioural studies have implicated both female choice of mates and male competition for access to mates as proximate mechanisms of sexual selection. Few studies have examined the interactions between these mechanisms in a natural setting. In this study, I explored how dominance interactions between male boat-tailed grackles, Quiscalus major, determine the mating success of males and how the behaviour of female boat-tailed grackles influences this process. Male grackles defended colonies of females and performed courtship displays to females that were building nests. These conspicuous displays incited dominance interactions between males, with the result that dominant males interrupted subordinate males' attempts to copulate. Female grackles were receptive only to males that performed courtship displays, but their receptivity to males did not vary with male dominance rank or tail length. Females were more likely to be receptive in a colony than away from a colony, and females became receptive asynchronously during the breeding season. The timing and spacing of females' receptivity to males permitted dominance interactions between males to determine male mating success. By establishing the conditions for male competition, females indirectly chose high-ranking males. Recent studies have emphasized discrimination among potential mates as a behavioural mechanism for mate choice. The results reported here, however, demonstrate that other aspects of females' behaviour can produce mate choice, indirectly rather than directly.

AB In songbirds, males are usually the more competitive sex and they use vocalizations to attract females and to compete with rival males. When levels of female-female competition were experimentally increased in a population of dunnocks, Prunella modularis, females were predicted to increase their vocalization rates and to use vocalizations in comparable ways to competing males. Females produced tseep calls in territorial conflicts with rival females, and trill calls during the pre-breeding and fertile periods when they were left alone by their mate. Males were more likely to approach trills than tseeps, and females were more likely to trill than tseep in response to the song of their mate. Removal experiments to increase polygyny showed that females produced both types of call more when they were competing for male attention. Three out of 13 polygynous, fertile females also produced complex songs when their mate left to join another female. Songs were produced in the same context as the songs of female alpine accentors, P. collaris, a congener which breeds in large, polygynandrous groups where female competition for mates is intense, and females attract males with song. The possible functions of the mate-attracting trills and songs of females are discussed; in dunnocks they may (1) attract mates away from other females to reduce the likelihood of polygyny, (2) ensure that the male copulates sufficiently to cross a helping threshold, and (3) enable the female to assess future levels of parental care from her mate.

   WARBLERS; ECOLOGY
AB Brood parasitic cowbirds, Molothrus spp., should lay their eggs in host nests at a time that maximizes both the probability of acceptance by the host and the chances of survival for the parasitic egg and young. Moreover, because multiple parasitism of a host nest is likely to result in low cowbird success, cowbirds are expected to avoid it by defending nests or laying territories, avoiding already parasitized nests or by destroying previously laid cowbird eggs. Shiny cowbird, M. bonariensis, egg-laying behaviour was studied in house wren, Troglodytes aedon, nests, to determine whether cowbirds monitor host nests to lay their eggs in synchronization with the host's laying period, and whether cowbirds avoid multiple parasitism. Shiny cowbirds monitored nests of house wrens during early and late nest building and during egg-laying stages. Each female cowbird monitored several wren nests over several days, and each wren nest was monitored by several cowbirds. Although to some extent shiny cowbirds synchronized egg laying with their host, they did it ina fairly sloppy manner. Of 185 cowbird eggs laid in 40 nests, 47% were laid in coincidence with the wrens' laying period, but 35% were laid before the wrens started laying, and 18% were laid after wrens had finished laying and started incubation. Cowbirds also laid 82 eggs in 20 nests that were abandoned by wrens before laying. Multiple parasitism was common and cowbirds did not avoid multiply parasitized nests. There was no evidence that cowbirds removed previously laid eggs, and only six of 150 cowbird eggs were destroyed in nests. Therefore, shiny cowbirds seem to follow a 'shotgun' strategy; i.e. they rely more on high fecundity and chance than on the precise placement of each egg. This strategy is possible with house wrens because wrens do not reject cowbird eggs. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Four series of song playbacks to paired and unpaired resident birds were used to test hypotheses proposed for the function of male song, female song and vocal duets in the bay wren, Thryothorus nigricapillus, in the Republic of Panama. One series of experiments served as a control and established that bay wrens distinguished the duets of conspecifics from those of heterospecifics; a second series indicated that these results were not dependent on which type of male vocalization was used as a stimulus. Two series of experiments compared the responses of paired and unpaired males and females to playbacks of male versus female song. Both paired and unpaired females responded strongly to playback of female song and weakly to playback of male song. These data are consistent with previous results that showed no effect of mating status on female song rates and support the hypothesis that female song functions in intra-sexual aggression, probably in the context of territorial defence. Furthermore, because females initiate all duets in this species, females may be singing independently of males, and thus it is only male behaviour that produces a duet. In contrast to what was observed in females, males responded strongly to playback of both male and female song, but paired males responded more strongly to playback of male song, and unpaired males responded more strongly to playback of female song. These results provide a preliminary indication that female songs are attractive to males and that males may participate in duets as a means of acoustically guarding their mates from other males.

AB Cannibalism of the entire brood by mouthbrooding males was observed in the cardinal fish, Apogon doederleini, in warm temperate waters of southern Japan. This filial cannibalism always occurred within a day of spawning. Males preferentially ate broods produced by females smaller than themselves and by non-resident females, and always changed mates after cannibalism. Cannibalistic males re-mated more quickly than males whose broods were experimentally removed. These results indicate that cannibalistic males take advantage of multiple mate availability, by eating the first brood and rearing the second. It is suggested that filial cannibalism in this fish is associated with mating strategies of females that can shorten inter-spawning intervals by changing mates.

AB Black-capped chickadees, Parus atricapillus, were presented with two prey patches in an aviary. In the first experiment ('single-step change'), an unstable patch offered an initially high prey density (60% or 30%) that declined unpredictably to zero, and a stable patch offered a low (10%) but unvarying prey density. The birds displayed a significantly shorter mean giving-up time in the unstable patch when the initial prey density in the unstable patch was 60% than when it was 30%. In the second experiment ('double-step change'), treatments were as follows: (1) first step=60%, second step=10%; (2) first step=60%, second step=30%; and (3) first step=60%, second step=60%. The mean giving-up time in the 60%-60%-0 treatment was significantly shorter than that in the 60%-30%-0 treatment, indicating that information from the 30% second step influenced the birds' patch-leaving decisions. The mean giving-up time in the 60%-10%-0 treatment was intermediate between those in the 60%-60%-0 and 60%-30%-0 treatments. The data agree with the predictions of a statistical decision theory model that compares the probability of capturing a prey in the current patch with the probability of capturing prey in alternative patches (the capture-probability model).

ID ANIMAL-WELFARE
AB Gaining access to resources can be measured in terms of the time spent with, or the number of visits to, a resource. For some resources, time spent with the resource might be more important, for others the number of visits might be more meaningful. By using traverses of shallow water, the costs of gaining access to food, shelter, a conspecific, increased space, a running wheel, deep sawdust, or enrichments (e.g. balls, a variety of small objects) were increased for laboratory mice. When 30 cm of water was present, the number of visits to each resource decreased to 39-64% of the number recorded when no water was present, but the proportion of time spent with each resource was defended. Increasing the width of water to 120 cm had no further effect on the number of visits or on the proportion of time spent with each resource: thus both the frequency of visits and the proportion of time with each resource were ultimately defended. Possible reasons for this change in behavioural organization, including the importance of patrolling, are discussed. The data support previous findings that laboratory mice are highly motivated to patrol areas made accessible to them, and suggest that care is needed when interpreting what animals perceive as reinforcement during visits to resources. Furthermore, it was shown that for laboratory mice under conditions that penalize initial access only, the time spent with a wide variety of resources was defended more diligently than the number of visits, but the number of visits was rarely allowed to decrease to zero.

ID INTERACTIVE PLAYBACK EXPERIMENTS; TURDUS-MERULA
AB The Louisiana waterthrush has two main song forms, termed the primary and extended songs. Each has distinctive behavioural correlates. A flexible interactive playback procedure was used that is especially suited for investigating how the different songs uttered by birds responding to a simulated territorial intruder inform about the singer's behaviour. Subjects that approached in response to playback of either song form sang mostly extended songs. Al! uttered their longest extended songs in correlation with approach flights. In contrast, before playback, subjects that were not near other waterthrushes sang predominantly primary songs. Naturalistic observations of the subjects and other individuals support the distinction between the behavioural correlates of the two song forms. These observations also suggest that,when singing primary songs and incomplete variants of primary songs, individuals less actively approach or seek out other birds. To facilitate comparisons between species, such singers can be described as taking less initiative to interact. The results of this study, the first using these interactive playback procedures on an oscine species, are comparable to those previously obtained with three species of suboscine tyrannid flycatchers. This similarity suggests that providing information about the extent to which a singer will take the initiative to interact, by approaching or seeking out other birds, may be a widespread property of songs.

AB Hymenoptera are characterized by a haplodiploid sex determination system where females are diploid and males haploid. Because females can decide whether they fertilize their eggs they have control over the sex of their offspring. Females are thus expected to lay haploid and diploid eggs in a ratio that maximizes their fitness. A surprising finding of recent studies on the primary sex ratio of ants has been that queens lay male eggs outside the time of production of sexuals, a period during which all haploid eggs are usually destroyed by workers. It has been suggested that the production of a high proportion of haploid eggs by queens might be a mechanism to achieve higher reproductive success when the colony loses all its queens and rears new sexuals from the brood present within the colony. Here it is shown that, as predicted by this hypothesis, the proportion of haploid eggs laid by Linepithema humile queens is higher in colonies containing several queens than in single-queen colonies. Because L. humile sexuals mate in the nest, the females that produce a higher proportion of haploid eggs should have higher fitness when the colony sex ratio of the brood is female-biased and sons of several queens compete to fertilize the new queens produced.

AB The foraging ecology of rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, suggests that this species may have good spatial memory capabilities. Six adult male hummingbirds were tested in a one-trial learning experiment in the field. Subjects searched for a single sucrose reward among four identical artificial flowers (Search Phase). Following a retention interval, subjects returned to locate the reward again (Return Phase). Performance during the Search Phase was no better than expected by chance, indicating that the hummingbirds could not detect the sucrose through intrinsic cues (e.g. odour). During the Return Phase, subjects performed significantly better than chance and could have done so only by remembering the spatial location of rewarded flowers. In addition, subjects avoided revisiting non-rewarded flowers, suggesting memory for these locations as well. Finally, information about rewarded and non-rewarded locations was combined to direct sampling behaviour towards flowers the birds had not yet encountered.

AB A cornerstone in the study of anti-predatory vigilance in socially feeding vertebrates is the idea of collective detection, that all members of the group are unambiguously alerted to an attack as long as it is detected by at least one group member. Collective detection in mixed flocks of emberizid sparrows, however, is an ambiguous and uncertain process. In these flocks, detectors of attack impart little information directly to their flockmates. Non-detectors infer the possibility of an approaching threat based upon the occurrence of departures from the flock, and appear unable to distinguish non-threat-induced departures from those induced by an approaching threat. Under such circumstances, theory suggests that multiple detections of attack (or multiple departures) may be required to incite alarm in the flock. Experiments demonstrated such an effect: multiple threat-induced departures over a short time interval had a markedly greater effect on the escape behaviour of non-detectors than did single threat-induced departures. The effect of departures was moderated by their environmental context. Non-detectors responded more readily to departures that (1) originated from the outer portion of the flock, or (2) occurred when feeding far from protective cover. These sparrows also showed a range of behavioural responses to departures, from no response, to alertness, to immediate, full-blown escape. This ambiguous, departure-based form of collective detection implies that individuals must rely considerably on personal vigilance to detect predatory attack. Such a reliance may leave animals more vigilant than suggested by models of vigilance based upon the conventional version of collective detection.

AB Worker honey bees, Apis mellifera, are able to discriminate between combs on the basis of genetic similarity to a learned comb. The nestmate recognition cues that they acquire from the comb also have a genetically correlated component. Cues are acquired from comb in very short exposure periods (5 min or less) and can be transferred among bees that are in physical contact. Gas chromatographic analysis demonstrates that bees with exposure to comb have different chemical surface profiles than bees without such exposure. These results support the hypothesis that comb-derived recognition cues are highly important in honey bee nestmate recognition. These cues are at least in part derived from the wax itself, rather than from floral scents that have been absorbed by the wax. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The functional significance of nest co-occupation in Cerceris arenaria (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae) was investigated. Willmer (1985a, Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol, 17, 151-160, 1987, Proc. 3rd fur. Congr. Entomol, 2, 229-240) suggested that in this species co-occupation is a mutualistic response to ecophysiological pressures, and that these pressures might have played a general role in the evolution of eusociality. In this study nest-less 'Searcher' females almost always (99%, N=80) accepted (started using) pre-existing nests rather than digging new burrows. Burrows were occupied by sequences of females whose periods of occupation overlapped briefly. Go-occupations began when Searchers accepted nests that already had owners. The behaviour of Searchers after nest acceptance depended on time of acceptance. Late in the day, Searchers remained inside nests and usually closed them. Early in the day, Searchers started provisioning accepted nests. If these nests were already occupied, the result was joint-provisioning. When a nest was joint-provisioned, it received significantly more prey than the owner could provision alone, but less than twice what she could provision alone. Go-occupations rarely (4%, N=47) lasted more than 1 day, and ended when one female left the nest for good. Searchers remained in possession of nests after 49% (N=47) of co-occupations. Searchers appear functionally to be usurpers: they are known to prefer nests with owners and on average, owners lose out if Searchers accept their nests. Willmer's hypothesis that co-occupations are mutualistic is rejected. An analysis of time costs suggests that accepting a pre-existing nest has larger payoffs than digging a new burrow. The high rate of replacement of nest owners (11-16% per day) will reduce the relatedness of offspring emerging from the same nest, presenting a barrier against the kin-selected evolution of nest-sharing. Variation in social interactions in the genus Cerceris may be consistent with the predictions of a recent model of cooperation based on reciprocity.

AB Both species and populations within species display variation in spacing patterns, and the number of published reports documenting this variation is increasing rapidly. The potential for instructive comparisons is high, but the comparative approach requires common terminology. Vague or implicit definitions of spacing systems undermine the rigour of comparisons. Papers were reviewed that examined interspecific and intraspecific variation in spacing systems to determine the degree to which definitions currently produce a common terminology. This report describes and classifies the 48 conceptual and operational definitions of territoriality found in the literature. Only 12% of the papers gave an operational definition of territoriality. The single criterion of 'defended area' was used in 50% of the papers, and the other 50% used other definitions which often consisted of multiple criteria. These definitions were variants of three main themes: defended area, exclusive area, and site-specific dominance, and authors used up to three criteria to define territoriality. Conceptual and operational definitions differed because different questions were asked and because of logistical problems, such as collecting the same data on different species or populations. The taxonomic group being studied also seemed to determine which type of definition was chosen. Although defended area was used most often across four classes of vertebrates, researchers studying mammals chose spatial criteria, for example, amount of home range overlap, more often than researchers studying other taxa. Workers pursuing research in this area can enhance their contribution by using clear conceptual and operational definitions of territoriality, making them explicit at the outset.

DT Article
ID MATING TACTICS; DELAWARE BAY; SELECTION; EVOLUTION
AB Male horseshoe crabs have two mating tactics: some come ashore attached to females, whereas others remain unattached and crowd around the pairs that are nesting on the beach. The benefits are clear because unattached males release sperm and gain fertilizations by their satellite behaviour, but there are also costs associated with this alternative mating tactic. Horseshoe crabs sometimes become overturned and stranded on beaches during spawning, which can result in death by desiccation or predation. In some populations, such as in the Delaware Bay where this study was conducted, large numbers of horseshoe crabs may be stranded on the beach after spawning. Most overturned crabs right themselves quickly using their telsons, but stranded individuals are unable to do so. The results of this study show that stranding is due to two interacting factors, mating tactic and righting ability. First, unattached males were more likely to strand than attached males. Second, unattached males were, on average, older than attached males. Experiments reveal that once overturned, older crabs were less likely to right themselves than younger ones. Ultimately, the reason that older males are more likely to strand is probably related to senescence and parasitism.

AB The responses of yellow warblers, Dendroica petechia, to naturally laid and experimentally introduced eggs of the brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater, were recorded. Some female warblers accepted naturally laid cowbird eggs. Rejected eggs were usually buried, sometimes along with warbler egg(s). Yellow warblers more frequently buried cowbird eggs that were laid in their nests before their own clutches were initiated through the day on which they laid their second eggs. Warblers accepted most cowbird eggs laid in their nests later in the laying cycle and during incubation. Warblers were more likely to reject parasitic eggs when they occurred during the first half of the clutch-initiation period. Cowbirds parasitized yearling and older female yellow warblers with equal frequency and rejection was not related to the age of the female warbler. Yellow warblers responded differently at nests parasitized experimentally with real cowbird eggs. At about 25% of the nests, warblers buried cowbird eggs added before clutch initiation. However, nearly all cowbird eggs added during the warbler's laying cycle were accepted, regardless of whether (1) a warbler egg was removed at the time of parasitism, (2) clutches were reduced, or (3) hosts were exposed to a stuffed female cowbird before being parasitized. The dichotomy of responses yellow warblers exhibit to cowbird parasitism may be because of the high cost of rejection. Selection for rejection/acceptance may oscillate over time as costs and benefits of each strategy vary with different environmental conditions.

ID TITS PARUS; TEMPERATURE; EXPRESSION; STORAGE
AB The effects of season and photoperiod on food storing by black-capped chickadees were examined in two experiments. Chickadees were captured in March (experiment 1) or November (experiment 2), and food storing was tested regularly in the birds' home cages. In both experiments, two groups were matched for initial level of food storing. The long-day group was then exposed to a summer photoperiod (16:8 h light:dark cycle) and the short-day group to a winter photoperiod (LD 8:16 h) for 2-3 months, followed by 2-3 months in identical conditions for both groups. Birds in experiment 1 stored very little at first, but those maintained on long days moulted and began to store after 6-8 weeks; the group maintained on short days eventually increased storing as well. Birds in experiment 2 began by storing about three times as much food as those in experiment 1; storing declined over time in both groups and was not affected by photoperiod. The results suggest that food storing in parids is controlled by photoperiod in a similar way to other annually varying behaviour patterns such as breeding and migration in birds.

AB A negative relationship between group size and levels of individual vigilance is widespread in socially feeding vertebrates. The main explanation of this 'group-size effect', the many-eyes hypothesis, is based on the simple premise that as group size increases, there are progressively more eyes scanning the environment for predators. Thus an individual forager can devote less time to vigilance (and more time to feeding) as group size increases without any lessening of the group's ability to detect an attack. Basic to this hypothesis is the assumption of collective detection: that all members of the group are alerted to an attack as long as it is detected by at least one individual. In addition, an important presumption associated with the many-eyes hypothesis is that individuals monitor the. vigilance behaviour of their groupmates in determining their own level of vigilance. Neither the idea of collective detection nor behavioural monitoring received strong support in an experimental study of vigilance in mixed flocks of dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, and American tree sparrows, Spizella arborea. The lack of support for behavioural monitoring was particularly evident; however, some degree of collective detection was apparent. It is possible that anti-predatory rules-of-thumb may explain the group-size effect while keeping intact the basics of the many-eyes hypothesis.

AB Clay-coloured sparrows, Spizella pallida, have often been reported deserting nests parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. Sparrow nests were experimentally parasitized and manipulated to determine whether desertion is an anti-parasite defence. Responses to experimental parasitism with and without the presence of a cowbird model, the addition of broken eggs to the nest, changes in clutch composition (combination of sparrow and cowbird eggs), clutch reductions, and human nest visitation were recorded. Only clutch reduction elicited nest desertion. Because such reductions can occur in the absence of brood parasitism, desertion apparently has not evolved as an anti-parasite defence in this species. Desertion of naturally parasitized nests appears to be a response to host egg removal by female cowbirds, rather than to parasitism per se. The absence of anti-parasite defences in clay-coloured sparrows is not adequately explained by the equilibrium hypothesis and, contrary to an earlier suggestion, clay-coloured sparrows are not in transition between being an acceptor and rejector species of cowbird parasitism. More attention needs to be paid to the host egg removal aspect of cowbird parasitism.

TI OVIPOSITIONAL PREFERENCES AND LARVAL CANNIBALISM IN THE NEOTROPICAL
   MOSQUITO TRICHOPROSOPON DIGITATUM (DIPTERA, CULICIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID AEDES-AEGYPTI; EGG RAFTS; CONSPECIFICS; SELECTION; STIMULANT; FIELD
AB The effects of age, size, food availability and relatedness on larval cannibalism in the Neotropical mosquito Trichoprosopon digitatum were investigated. The eggs of this mosquito are laid in small water receptacles and guarded by females until they hatch. No significant differences in the median level of cannibalism were detected between larvae of the same age derived from the same and from different clutches. Only 4-day-old larvae showed a significantly higher median level of cannibalism at low than at high food levels. When larvae of different ages were placed together, cannibalism was highly size-dependent. A parallel series of experiments was conducted in the held to determine the ovipositional preferences of T. digitatum for pots that contained particular developmental stages of the mosquito. Adult females preferentially laid their eggs in (1) pots that contained high levels of food and (2) pots that already contained an adult female guarding its clutch. Adult females avoided laying into pots that contained 8-day-old larvae. The data suggest that the oviposition decisions of the mosquito reduce the chances of its offspring being consumed by conspecifics. It is unclear precisely why ovipositing females should prefer to lay where there are other recently laid eggs although there appears to be little fitness cost in terms of cannibalism.

TI MANIPULATION OF SEX-DIFFERENCES IN PARENTAL CARE - THE EFFECT OF BROOD
   SIZE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In species with biparental care, the evolutionarily stable strategy for investiment in the brood depends on the value of the brood to the parents and on each partner''s contribution. Any shortfall by one parent should be partially compensated for by the other parent, with the magnitude of this ''respnse'' depending on the value of the brood. Small weights were attached to one member of European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, pairs, to introduce biases in the division of labour whilst retaining a biparental system. Manipulation of both brood size and a partner''s work rate demonstrated that: (1) each sex compensated for a partner''s experimentally reduced work rate; (2) the magnitude of response depended on the manipulated brood size; (3) weighted birds and their partners delivered more small invertebrates than did controls; and (4) male and female effort was asymmetric with respect to brood size. These results accord with several general predictions of game theoretical models, but specific departures from expectation are discussed.

TI URINE MARKING IN POPULATIONS OF WILD HOUSE MICE MUS-DOMESTICUS RUTTY .1.
   COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Various hypotheses proposed for the function of urine marking in communication between male house mice were examined by comparing the predicted responses towards urine marks with those observed within eight captive territorial family groups. The responses of individual resident males in four classes (dominant and subdominant adults, subadults and juveniles) were measured towards familiar resident, familiar neighbour and unfamiliar urine marks from dominant and subadult males, and towards a clean patch of substrate, introduced into their family-marked territory. Attraction, avoidance, investigation and counter-marking responses were consistent with the hypothesis that territorial males mark at high frequency to advertise their aggressive dominance over the other resident and intruder males. Dominant males counter-marked resident and non-resident male marks strongly, while dominant male marks were investigated closely by males subordinate to the mark donor. Both dominant and  subordinate males appear to use dominant male marks to orient to their resident territory and away from areas marked by other dominant males.

TI PROVISIONING OF NESTLINGS BY MALE AND FEMALE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS,
   AGELAIUS-PHOENICEUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to identify the factors that affect the rate at which nestlings were fed by male and female red-winged blackbrids, and the effects of this provisioning on reproductive success. In addition, discriminant function analysis was used to examine the differences between pair-fed and female-fed broods. Both maternal and paternal feeding rate were found to increase with breeding experience, brood size, proportion of males in the brood and nestling age. The male was most likely to feed nestlings in the most advanced nest when two or more were concurrently active on his territory. Female feeding rate decreased through the nesting season. Female feeding rate was independent of male feeding rate and female status, so nestlings fed by both parents received more food than those fed only by the female. As a result, fewer nestlings starved in pair-fed broods, and these broods produced more fledglings than female-fed broods. Thus, both males and females are affected by their experience, and appear to respond to ''nestling demand''. While male and female provisioning can be interpreted in terms of the costs and benefits of specific investment strategies, identification and quantification of the costs and benefits, and experimental studies to examine their effects are clearly needed for a more complete understanding of parental investment in the red-winged blackbird.

TI RESOLUTION OF SPATIAL COMPLEXITY IN A FIELD SAMPLE OF SINGING CRICKETS
   TELEOGRYLLUS-COMMODUS (WALKER) (GRYLLIDAE) - A NEAREST-NEIGHBOR ANALYSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The nearest-neighbour distances for a sample of singing crickets were analysed for spatial pattern using a goodness-of-fit test. There was an excess of individuals in the lower and upper tails of the distribution, indicating aggregation of some crickets, and a spacing out of others. Regularity within the aggregated component was also demonstrated, using the Pielou (1962, J. Ecol., 50-357-367) test for competition. Thus, to obtain an overall analysis of spatial pattern of the sample, both tests were required. The presence of aggregation together with regularity in a population results in a loss of sensitivity of the Clark and Evans test (1954, Ecology, 35, 445-453) and the Thompson test (1956, Ecology, 37, 391-394) because for these single-component tests the effects of opposing deviations from randomness can cancel out. This was illustrated by applying the tests to a synthetic sample, and to the sample of singing crickets. A computer program NN-TESTS was used for the analyses. The  behavioural significance of the spacing in crickets is discussed.

TI PLUMAGE VARIABILITY FUNCTIONS FOR STATUS SIGNALING IN LEAST AUKLETS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study investigated whether the variable plumage of the least auklet, Aethia pusilla, a small seabird of the Bering Sea, functions for status signalling. Adult least auklets varied continuously in underpart colour from unmarked white to nearly black. Although there was variablity within age groups, adults tended to lighten in plumage as they aged. There were no differences in plumage between the sexes. Observations of natural interactions among adult and immature birds of different  plumage indicated that lighter birds usually defeated darker birds in agonistic interactions within each age group. Model presentation experiments were performed to test whether plumage colour alone signals social status. Auklet models presented in white plumage were approached less closely and induced more responding adult and immature birds to flee compared to the same models presented with dark plumage. Furthermore, birds with lighter plumage approached the white model closer than did birds with darker plumage. The results provide evidence for status signalling by plumage in a non-passerine bird and document another species where status signalling works within age (adult versus immature) categories.

TI THE EVOLUTION OF ALARM CALLING - A COST-BENEFIT-ANALYSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three arguments for the likelihood of alarm calling in colonial animals are presented. The first, a game-theoretic portrait, predicts that alarm calling should be less probable per animal in larger groups and also that actual fitness benefits and costs are not quantitatively important in determining the evolutionarily stable probability of calling in large populations. The second is a geometric model of the dependence of risk upon position within a colony of sedentary animals. The two models  are integrated to form a third, which predicts that the probability than an animal gives an alarm call is independent of both group size and the ratio of benefits to costs, above some minimum group size. Some of the available data are consistent with the models, and some are not.

TI DETERMINANTS OF CHORUS PARTICIPATION AND THE EFFECTS OF SIZE, WEIGHT AND
   COMPETITION ON ADVERTISEMENT CALLING IN THE TUNGARA FROG,
   PHYSALAEMUS-PUSTULOSUS (LEPTODACTYLIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The individual mating success of male tungara frogs is best predicted by the number of nights spent in chorus activity, yet individuals are often absent from the chorus for several nights without calling at another site. To test whether males leave the chorus to forage to pay the energy cost of calling, males were captured in groups of four and their calls were recorded over 3 or 5 nights, while half of them were starved and the others fed. Feeding had no effect on the number of males that stopped calling, or on the changes in call rate, call complexity (number of secondary notes) and chorus leading over time. When they were released, fed males did not return faster to the chorus, and were not more likely to return, than starved males. Playback of a tape of a large chorus increased the number of males present in the small natural chorus. Chorus size in three pools was positively correlated with the minimum temperature, and negatively correlated with the rainfall, over the  previous 2 days. These results suggest that males are conservative in their chorusing activity because chorusing increases predation risk, not because they need to forage. Males use variation in chorus size, rainfall or temperature to select those nights that offer reduced predation risk and increased mating opportunities. Playback of a tape of a large chorus caused males in a small chorus to increase their call rate by 104%, their call complexity by 38%, and the net energy cost of calling by  70%. Male size and weight had no effect on the mean call rate, call complexity or the amount of chorus leading, but were positively correlated with the maximum call rate of males; this effect may contribute to the higher mating success of larger males observed previously. Size and weight had no effect on the maximum rate of production of secondary notes, or on the influence of playback on call rate. Weight was correlated with the relative increase in call complexity as a result of playback;  larger males used relatively more secondary notes in larger choruses, whereas smaller males use relatively more in small choruses.

TI SITE-SPECIFIC ASYMMETRIES IN MALE COPULATORY SUCCESS IN A FALLOW DEER
   LEK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a fallow deer, Cervus dama, lek in central Italy, most copulations occurred in a few male territories on one side of the lek. Individual territories were fixed in space between years, and most maintained their relative rank in terms of numbers of copulations in successive years. High-ranked territories were peripheral, near paths used by females to enter the lek ara. Successful territories were defended more often than territories where few or no copulations were seen, but their defence  did not involve a greater frequency of fighting. The turnover of males on territories was unrelated to the number of copulations seen there. Females appear to choose mates partly on the basis of location, and thus males should compete for ownership of territories preferred by females.

TI RISK-SENSITIVITY - AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE AFFECTS FORAGING CHOICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Short-term physiological requirements strongly constrain some foragers. During the limited time available for foraging, they must consume sufficient food to meet all energetic expenditures for 24 h. Models for risk-sensitive decision-making predict that such of forager should be risk-averse toward reward variance when the animal expects to meet its requirement, and should be risk-prone toward reward variance when expecting an energetic deficit. Some previous demonstrations of this shift from risk-averse to risk-prone behaviour relied on differences in both pre-experimental deprivation and inter-trial delays within an experiment to vary the subjects'' energy budgets, and these differences have allowed an alternate interpretation of observed preferences. Therefore, earlier work on risk-sensitive foraging in small birds was complemented by manipulating ambient temperature to induce positive and negative expected energy budgets. For a given mean reward, the inter-trial delay was the  same, constant length at both temperatures. When subject experienced a positive energy budget (warm temperature), risk-aversion exceeded preference for risk strikingly; the opposite occurred when the subjects could anticipate a negative energy budget (cold temperature). Variation in inter-trial delays could not have influenced the change in preference reported here.

TI SOCIAL TOLERANCE AND PROXIMATE MECHANISMS OF DISPERSAL AMONG WINTER
   GROUPS OF MEADOW VOLES, MICROTUS-PENNSYLVANICUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Proximate mechanisms for movement among communal groups of meadow voles were examined during two winter seasons. Radiotelemetry and live trapping were used to identify group members and monitor the movement of voles. Paired encounters between individuals removed from the field indicated that aggression neither precipitated nor prevented movement of animals between groups during winter. Dispersal most often occurred in conjunction with loss of nestmates to predation. The removal of nestmates resulted in increased home range size and movement between groups for males, but not for females. With the onset of reproduction, aggression increased toward individuals from other groups, but not toward nestmates. Winter groups did not break up with the onset of breeding, but these groups were closed to the immigration of new members.

TI ALTERNATIVE MATING TACTICS IN THE GREAT PLAINS TOAD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male Great Plains toads, Bufo cognatus, exhibit two mating tactics. At any time, most males give advertisement calls to attract females, while other males, ''satellites'', remain silent and station themselves near callers in an attempt to intercept females. Females are usually capable of moving through choruses undetected by males. Those females detected by males can avoid being clasped by quickly darting away; but if clasped, can detach the male by inflating. Females initiated amplexus with callers; subsequently, but if clasped, can detach the male by inflating. Females initiated amplexus with callers; subsequently, calling males mated with 92% of the females and satellites mated with the remaining 8%. Toads employing the satellite tactic associated with males and that longer calls and that were larger, although call duration was the stronger predictor. The percentage of males exhibiting satellite behaviour during a sampling period varied from 0 to 575. Several hypotheses explaining satellite frequency were explored, including variation in male density, male quality, and operational sex ratio. Of the variables considered, only two aspects of male density (namely, the number of unmated males per m of shoreline and number of calling males per m shoreline) affected satellite frequency. High male density may cause at least some calling males to lose vocal conspicuousness, thereby favouring satellite behaviour. However, male density accounted for only 17% of the  observed variation in satellite frequency. This, plus the fact that up to 74% of marked males switched between tactics, suggests that factors such as higher energetic demands of calling may affect satellite frequency.

TI HERITABILITY OF DISPERSAL IN BANNER-TAILED KANGAROO RATS,
   DIPODOMYS-SPECTABILIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a wild population of banner-tailed kangaroo rats, heritability of dispersal was estimated using two measures of dispersal tendency: distance moved from the natal site and likelihood of leaving the natal home range. Neither of the heritability measures was significantly different from 0. The results indicate that the main causes of variation in dispersal behaviour in this species are environmental, and suggest that there is no class of ''innate'' dispersers. The possibility cannot be excluded that this population retains modest additive genetic variance for dispersal tendency. The survival consequences of dispersal in kangaroo rats are known to depend on population density and to change significantly between years, so that selection should maintain genetic variation in dispersal tendencies. Modest genetic variation for dispersal tendencies, especially if dispersal is a conditional trait, will be extremely difficult to detect in field studies.

TI PREDATION, LIGHT-INTENSITY AND COURTSHIP BEHAVIOR IN POECILIA-RETICULATA
   (PISCES, POECILIIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The colour patterns of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, represent a balance between selection for crypsis (by predators) and selection for conspicuousness (by females). To a predator or mate, the conspicuousness of a colour pattern depends on environmental light conditions at the time of viewing. In this study light intensity and predation had significant effects on male courtship behaviour in guppies. Males courted less and used visually conspicuous behavioural elements less often in the presence of predators or under high light levels. Maximum risk due to predation naturally occurs at the highest light intensities, so either light intensity or the presence of a predator can be used as a cue for predator avoidance. Guppies minimized predator risk during courtship by shifting visually conspicuous displays to times of day when visual predation is minimal, and using the visually less conspicuous sneak copulation strategy when predation risk is greatest. Because ambient light conditions vary with time of day, the same colour patterns are seen under different visual conditions by predators and mates. Such context-dependent conspicuousness reduces the need for an evolutionary compromise between colour patterns that reduce te risk of visual predation and those that increase visibility of females.

TI THE IMPORTANCE OF AMNIOTIC FLUIDS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
   MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR IN EXPERIENCED AND INEXPERIENCED EWES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Maternal behaviour at parturition was studied in multiparous and primiparous ewes whose lambs had been washed to remove amniotic fluids from their coats. In multiparous ewes, washing of the newborn with soap or water decreased licking of the neonate but did not significantly affect other parameters of maternal behaviour (aggressive behaviour, maternal bleats, or acceptance at udder). By contrast, in primiparous ewes, washing of the neonate with only water dramatically reduced licking behaviour and acceptance at udder, while the incidence of aggressive behaviour towards the neonate was increased (P < 0.05 in all cases). It is concluded that for inexperienced ewes amniotic fluid on the lamb''s coat is necessary for the normal development of maternal behaviour at parturition. For experienced ewes amniotic fluids also play a facilitatory role, but other sensory inforation can substitute for this cue.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To study experimentally the function of the red epaulettes and the black body colour of adult male red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, territory owners were removed and replaced with dummies. Intruding males avoided the two mounts with colourful epaulettes compared to the mount with blackened epaulettes and the mount-stand control; intruders also avoided mounts with enlarged epaulettes compared to mounts with normal-sized epaulettes. These results provide the first direct evidence  that exposed epaulettes are perceived by intruders as a threat and that larger epaulettes would be more effective signals of threat than are normal epaulettes. Comparisons between the mount with blackened epaulettes and the mount-stand control showed that intruders land closer to the blackened mount than to the control. This result suggest that the conspicuous black body colour of male redwings is not threatening; it is argued that it is a distance signal of attraction that facilitates flock formation.

TI THE FUNCTION OF COURTSHIP FEEDING DURING INCUBATION IN THE PIED
   FLYCATCHER FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The male pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca feeds his female frequently while she is incubating. The present paper focuses on the adaptive value of this behaviour. Results of a nest predation experiment, forcing birds to re-nest, did not support the hypothesis that courtship feeding strengthens the bond between the sexes. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the rate of courtship feeding is a reliable indicator of the quality of male parental care. Instead, the food provided by the male seems to be of essential nutritional value to the female. There was a positive correlation between the body weight of the female and the rate of courtship feeding. Females in good condition during incubation showed a reduced incubation period and produced heavy fledglings. Courtship feeding is only one activity that would enhance male fitness, others include polyterritorial and polygamous behaviour and extra-pair copulations. Polyterritorial males fed their mates less often than those with a single territory. The proportion of male effort allocated to courtship feeding may vary according to local circumstances such as the availability of nest sites, the number of potential mates, and the probability of nesting failure.

TI CONTRIBUTIONS OF REPRODUCTIVE EXPERIENCE TO OBSERVATION-MAINTAINED CROP
   GROWTH AND INCUBATION IN MALE AND FEMALE RING DOVES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous work has established that experienced male ring doves (Streptopelia risoria) can maintain prolactin-dependent crop growth and readiness to incubate by observing an incubating partner. We report that this is also true for female ring doves. The role of experience in this phenomenon was examined in separate experiments with males and females. Observation of an incubating mate from 3 days after completion of egg laying is sufficient to maintain crop growth and incubation in both male and female ring doves in their second, but not in their first, reproductive cycle. Male and female doves in their first cycle must incubate for a greater part of the cycle before observation of an incubating mate is an effective stimulus; there are no differences between first and second cycle doves separated by a glass plate from the mate and nest 8 days after laying. Experience obtained within the first cycle apparently ensures that previously neutral stimuli come to elicit prolactin  secretion. The effectiveness of these stimuli is reinstated early in a second cycle.

TI SOCIAL-INTERACTION AMONG PLEOMETROTIC QUEENS OF VEROMESSOR-PERGANDEI
   (HYMENOPTERA, FORMICIDAE) DURING COLONY FOUNDATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Queens of the pleometrotic seed-harvester ant Veromessor pergandei associate without respect to relatedness during colony foundation in laboratory choice tests. This species may be used as a test case for social competition where kin selection cannot occur. Co-founding queens contribute equally to the initial brood and exist without dominance prior to eclosion of their first workers. Before worker eclosion, claustral founding ants exhibit a closed-energy system. We argue that social competition cannot operate under such circumstances. Among pleometrotic, claustral founding ants, inter-queen aggression should not occur before worker emergence; this is verified for V. pergandei.

TI CENTRAL PLACE FORAGING BY AN ANT (CATAGLYPHIS-BICOLOR FAB) - A MODEL OF
   SEARCHING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A computer model of the searching activity of Cataglyphis bicolor (Fab.), based on quantitative data obtained in the field in Greece, was investigated. This ant searches for individual items of food (mainly dead arthropods) in the open on flat ground, on which its paths can be followed and mapped. The model was based on an analogy with molecular diffusion from a center, suggested by the fact that the average distance of ants from the nest increased in porportion to the square root of time, up  to a distance more than 0.5 the radius of a circle enclosing 90% of the search area. Actual behavior was well described by a model in which individual ants went out for the 1st time to search in a direction determined at random. Subsequently they went out in a straight line in a direction and to a distance related to that of the previous find before commencing a semi-random search, on path consisting of straight portions branching at random angles, with restriction on turns in a backward direction. Individual real ants search in restricted areas, commonly sectors centered on the nest. This behavior was reproduced in the model as were quantitative aspects of the nest behavior. Communication between individuals was not required in the model.

   ANALYSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB We describe between- and within-individual variation in signalling behaviour for a population of male Ligurotettix coquilletti in a North American desert. For each observation date individual males were categorized as actively-signalling or inactive by the amount and regularity of their stridulation and their signalling location. Few males were active or inactive on all dates they were observed. By comparing the behaviour of individuals on consecutive observation dates, we identified the primary ways that individuals changed between active signalling and inactive behaviour. Behavioural transitions were frequently associated with movement between bushes. Inactive males became inactive upon moving to a vacant bush, and lone active males often became inactive after moving to a bush containing other males. Male-male aggression (primarily chases involving no contact between the participants, or only very brief contact) had a pronounced, short-term effect upon the signalling behaviour of males that received an attack. Approximately 33% of these recipients that had been stridulating became silent immediately following the chase. However, chases did not markedly alter the behaviour of recipients on the following observation date. Recipients were no more likely to change from inactive to active behaviour than vice versa between the observation dates immediately preceding and following the day of the chase. Although the transition analysis failed to detect marked behavioural  changes among recipients, analyses based on longer periods of time revealed that males observed to be recipients were more likely to display inactive behaviour and less likely to mate than males observed to be initiators of aggression.

Larger males defended their perch sites more successfully than did smaller males, perched higher than smaller males, and were most often the first male to enter the other male''s territory. Larger males also exhibited more challenge displays than did smaller males. Head-nods, a display given by subordinate individuals, were observed only in smaller males.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Recently born garter snakes (Thamnophis radix) were subjected to a variety of threatening stimuli. They would crawl away from the investigator until high levels of lactate were attained, and then adopt one of a variety of antipredator displays. These antipredator behaviors were surprisingly variable between individuals of a single population, but behaviors of individuals were consistent in replicate trials and in response to different stimuli. Snakes became more defensive when simulated predator attacks were more severe, but they became more offensive when tested at a lower temperature. Analysis of behavioral variation within and between 15 litters of full-sibling (172) snakes gave heritability estimates of 0.37 for single trials and 0.45 for the average of 2 replicate trials. This is the first study to examine the heritability of antipredator behavior in any terrestrial vertebrate species.

TI FEMALE SECONDARY SEXUAL COLORATION AND SEX RECOGNITION IN THE KEELED
   EARLESS LIZARD, HOLBROOKIA-PROPINQUA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Relationships between male social behavior and female reproductive coloration in the iguanid lizard Holbrookia propinqua were examined by introduction of tethered non-resident lizards into the territories of adult males. Introduced lizards were plainly colored females, females having bright reproductive coloration, adult males, plain females painted to resemble brightly colored females, bright females painted to mimic plain females, and males painted with the bright yellow and orange  secondary sexual coloration of females. Resident males courted all unpainted females, despite being aggressively rejected by the brightly colored ones. They also courted all but 2 females in each of the painted groups. All unaltered non-resident males were challenged, attacked or subjected to other aggressive behavior by residents, but all non-resident males painted to resemble bright females were courted. This differential treatment is highly significant. The bright female pigmentation functioned in sex recognition, identifying a female to males. Other stimuli, especially pheromonal and behavioral cues, may contribute to sex recognition. Because sex recognition alone seems insufficient to account for the evolution of bright female coloration in H. propinqua and several other iguanids, several proposed additional functions were discussed.

TI ETHOLOGICAL ISOLATION BETWEEN LOCAL-POPULATIONS OF HOUSE MICE
   (MUS-MUSCULUS) BASED ON OLFACTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Some rodent populations are composed of demes which remain reproductively isolated within the major population. Territoriality has been advanced as a possible isolating mechanism. This research investigated the possible role of olfaction in the isolation of feral house mouse (Mus musculus) demes. When given a choice, male and female mice spent more time with the air-transported odors of members of their own deme than with those of neighboring deme members. Tests with a fresh-air control showed that mice avoided the odors of members of an adjacent deme. In addition, more time was spent with urine and feces odors of members of a mouse''s own group than with those of the members of an adjacent deme. The production and detection of odorous substances may contribute to the autonomy and relative reproductive isolation of some local populations of mice.

TI SEXUAL AND MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR AT THE POSTPARTUM ESTRUS - THE ROLE OF
   EXPERIENCE IN TIME-SHARING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The postpartum sexual and maternal behavior of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) was observed in a seminatural habitat. Behavioral decision-making by the female was examined by disrupting the nest and newborn offspring during mating. In experiment 1, multiparous females responded to nest disruption with an increase in maternal behavior that was largely restricted to the post-ejaculatory intervals. The temporal and frequency measures of copulation were largely unaffected, implicating behavioral time-sharing. In experiment 2, following nest disruption primiparous females did not switch efficiently between maternal and sexual behavior, showed poor retrieval of pups, and returned to the nest during ejaculatory series. They did not display the characteristics of behavioral time-sharing, indicating that previous experience may play a role in the ability to time-share.

TI GAMES SPIDERS PLAY .3. CUES UNDERLYING CONTEXT-ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN
   AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The proximate cues underlying context-associated variation in the agonistic behavior of the spider A. aperta (Gertsch) are considered. At the initiation of a contest, individual opponents assess their relative weights; the subsequent behavior of each is adjusted according to the result of the assessments. Escalation to potentially injurious behavior early in the contest, for instance, is a threshold effect of weight bias. Several lines of evidence indicate that only the territory Owner (resident) has information about the quality of a site at the initiation of a territorial dispute. Owners of poor-quality sites that received food supplements exhibited significantly greater persistence and estimated energy expenditure in contests over these sites than unsupplemented individuals did over theirs. A significant correlation was observed between web area and the behavior of Owners, but not between web area and the behavior of Intruders (individuals that encroach on occupied webs). No correspondence was observed between spider body temperature and agonistic behavior. The presence or absence of prey on the web during the dispute did not affect the agonistic behavior of either opponent. The Intruder''s behavior is in some way adjusted to that of the Owner rather than directly to some aspect of the disputed site. Partial correlation analyses show site quality to have a greater influence on agonistic behavior than weight bias, although both are important determinants of spider behavior in territorial disputes.

TI DELAYED COURTSHIP IN THE FIDDLER CRAB UCA MUSICA-TERPSICHORES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Courting male fiddler crabs, U. m. terpsichores, congregate in the upper central portion of the colony: receptive females have their burrows located at the colony''s periphery and wander among the communally displaying males prior to choosing a mate. Courting males in a newly-established population were significantly smaller than courting males in large high-density colonies. This observation led to a series of translocation experiments designed to ascertain whether high population density influences the size (= age) at which males begin to court. Smaller courting males from a low-density population failed to court after being placed among larger courting males in a high-density population. The reciprocal translocation showed that smaller non-courting males from the high-density population would start courting shortly after being placed in a low-density population. Smaller males placed in the high-density population were subsequently observed significantly further away from where  they were initially placed than were larger males similarly translocated. Smaller males may delay courtship activities once they are forced, via encounters with larger males, to the periphery of the colony. Intrasexual selection (competition from larger males) and intersexual selection (female choice of large males) are responsible for the delay in male courtship activities.

TI COMPARATIVE ONTOGENY OF SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR IN 3 SOUTH-AMERICAN CANIDS, THE
   MANED WOLF, CRAB-EATING FOX AND BUSH DOG - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIALITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Aspects of behavioral development were investigated to determine how a relatively social canid like the bush dog S. venaticus differs from the moderately social crab-eating fox C. thous or the relatively solitary maned wolf Chrysocyon brachyurus. Differences emerged that were surprising in light of conventional ideas about sociality. The behavioral repertoire of Speothos was more limited than those of the other 2 spp. and Speothos'' interaction sequences were simpler, comprised fewer different elements and were more rigidly determinate. Submissive behaviors, biting, vocalizing and object play were prominent in Speothos, Cerdocyon and Chrysocyon interaction sequences were more like the play behavior described for Canis spp., being characterized by vigorous wrestling, frequent switching between behavioral categories and maneuvring to upset the partner. Although Speothos pups spent a greater percentage of their time interacting, there were no interspecific differences in the length of interaction sequences. In contrast to what has been seen in some polygamous mammals, no sex differences in behavior were found here, indicating that in monogamous, monomorphic species with little adult social role differentiation, the young are behaviorally alike as well. Dominance hierarchies among pups were only very weakly indicated and unstable in these intact litters by both parents.

TI ANALYSIS OF TIME-INHOMOGENEITY IN MARKOV-CHAINS APPLIED TO MOTHER INFANT
   INTERACTIONS OF RHESUS-MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When studying the interaction between mother-infant pairs of rhesus monkeys, inhomogeneities appear to exist during the awake phase of the infant, even under externally constant circumstances. These inhomogeneities are obscured by the stochastic nature of the bout lengths as well as the transitions between the several behavioral acts. An accurate description of the interaction, with the changes in the behavior during the awake phase included, is necessary in order to be able to quantify the  influence of the mother on the social development of the infant and vice versa. A mathematical model is described belonging to the class of continuous time Markov chains. This model gives an adequate characterization of the behavioral processes in a restricted number of ethologically well interpretable parameters. New procedures for estimating these parameters are derived, as well as tests on hypotheses concerning the number and magnitude of abrupt behavioral changes of the pairs. The pervasive  motivational changes prior to or after napping by infants could be described comprehensively by the parameters developed.

AB Orians and Pearson (1979) present models of optimal behavior for central place foragers. The models for single-prey and multiple-prey loaders are superficially similar, but fundamentally different. The similarity appears to have led Orans and Pearson to a mistake in the formulation of the single-prey-loader model. The correct form of the graphical solution is presented and one of its implications discussed.

TI TERRITORIALITY AND THE DEFENSE OF PREDATOR-REFUGES IN JUVENILE LIZARDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Juvenile A. aeneus lizards in clearings compete for foraging home sites with a complex topography. Juveniles rapidly colonize and defend new artificial home sites and there is strong competition for home sites from which the residents have been removed. The structure of preferred home sites is important for the behavioral avoidance of important predators by juveniles. In the laboratory, juveniles prefer complex home sites even when food is uniformly distributed and the use of complex home  sites by juveniles is significantly higher in the presence of potential predators. In the field and in the laboratory, predators have low success in capturing juveniles in complex home sites. These results indicate that defense of predator-safe home sites is probably an important function of juvenile A. aeneus territoriality.

TI SCENT-MARKING AND ITS TERRITORIAL SIGNIFICANCE IN STOATS,
   MUSTELA-ERMINEA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Stoats (M. erminea) and weasels (M. nivalis) perform 2 types of marking behaviour: anal drag and body rubbing. In stoats, the 2 secretions have different chemical composition and individual differences were found in the anal sac secretion. Dominant male and female stoats marked more frequently than did subordinates. Different messages were probably carried out by the 2 marks; body rubbing occurred associated with agonistic interactions and seemed to have a threat significance. Anal drag is probably used to imprenate the area with the individual''s odor. Scent-marking is considered important in allowing assessment of the asymmetry in a conflict, as between a territory owner and an intruder.

AB During their pre-breeding song period, male stonechats (S. torquata) varied widely in rates of song production. Unpaired males sang more than males associated with females. Song-rates were significantly correlated with later participation in parental care, measured as the share taken, relative to their mate''s share, in feeding nestlings, and defending them from predators by warning and distraction displays. Males that sang most did not consistently have the best breeding performance. The implications for the use of male song in mate selection by females are discussed.

   DEPENDENCE ON ANDROGEN OF COMPONENT PATTERNS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male behavior patterns, including ultrasonics, olfactory investigation, grooming and sequences of following of estrous females during the pre-copulatory period, were described for the Mongolian gerbil. Differences in dependence of these patterns on gonadal hormones were examined by measuring the rates of decline after castration and the degree of restoration following the s.c. injection of testosterone propionate (20 .mu.g/2 days per animal). Castration and androgen therapy did not influence the performance of male genital grooming, allogrooming and the olfactory investigation of both female secretory products and the female''s body, excluding the posterio-dorsal area. The other male patterns differed in the extent to which they were affected. Thus ventral gland marking, foot stomping and sequences of fallow/dart interactions declined rapidly and were not restored to pre-castration levels by androgen; the upsweep ultrasonic vocalization and olfactory investigation of the female''s perineal area declined more gradually, and were completely restored. These consistent differences in both decline and restoration suggest that mechanisms underlying some pre-copulatory patterns are influenced by androgen to a greater degree than others.

AB The involvement of genotype, family group and sex in the regulation of the response to young was studied in non-lactating wild vs. laboratory house mice (M. musculus). Regardless of the sex, naive wild mice typically killed young, in contrast to laboratory mice, which characteristically exhibited parental care. After cohabiting with parents attending their offspring, wild males exhibited parental behavior, while the majority of wild virgin females continued to display infanticide. Contrary to the prevailing view, the results indicate that parental behavior in wild mice does not occur spontaneously, and the domesticated mouse may not always reliably represent the species M. musculus in behavioral studies.

TI ENDOCRINE ASPECTS OF FEMALE-FEMALE PAIRING IN THE WESTERN GULL
   (LARUS-OCCIDENTALIS-WYMANI)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Investigations of the colonies of western gulls on Santa Barbara Island, California, USA, revealed a surplus of females and the occurrence of female-female pairs that produce clutches with as many as 6 eggs. Females are able to establish and defend breeding territories, behaviors generally thought to be under the control of androgens. Few significant differences in circulating levels of the luteinizing hormone and androgens are seen among breeding males, breeding females in heterosexual pairs and breeding females in homosexual pairs. In both homo and heterosexual pairs sampled in 1977, only females had elevated plasma levels of estrogens in spring, coincident with the period in which they show courtship behaviors such as food begging and solicitation of copulation. Given a sex ratio skewed in favor of females, as with the colonies of this species on Santa Barbara Island, and the essentially equal plasma levels of androgens in males and females, it is not difficult to rationalize the formation of female-female pairs. The hypothesis that female-female pairing involves hormonal masculinization of 1 member of the pair was not supported.

TI INTEROBSERVER AGREEMENT ON A MOLECULAR ETHOGRAM OF THE GENUS PAPIO
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Reliability of observations is a problem in ethological studies because the observations are collected over time and often by several individuals. Interobserver agreement was investigated in simultaneous sampling sessions on primate subjects (superspecies: P. cynocephalus) by 2 ethologists who were trained for 3-4 mo. to achieve a 0.90 level of interobserver agreement and who used an ethogram of 200 behavior types. In 262 sampling sessions over 22 mo., 8968 pairs of records were obtained and 129 of the 200 behavior types in the ethogram were observed. There were 158 disagreements, 776 omissions and 8034 agreements. Interobserver agreement assessed by the unweighted kappa statistic was .kappa. = 0.89 (SE = 0.003). With sufficient training, high levels of interobserver agreement are attainable and can be maintained over time.

DT Article
AB Alternative evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) may be possible for animal contests characterized by some asymmetry that can be perceived with perfect accuracy. Where roles A and B refer to the asymmetry between opponents, ESS are fight when A, retreat when B, and vice versa. Either can be an ESS, but only if the reserve strategy (= what an animal does when it fights) is sufficently damaging. The war of attrition (winner = opponent that persists longer) was examined. In a population at either ESS, reserve strategy is never normally shown; it is subject to drift unless the selective action of rare individuals which break the convention is considered. These could arise either by mutation or by mistakes in role assessment. When mutations and mistakes simply specify that occasionally an animal fights when it should retreat, selection adjusts reserve strategy to a level where only 1 ESS (the commonsense ESS) is possible, if the asymmetry is relevant to payoff. Thus for asymmetries in fighting ability or resource value, the individual with the lower score will retreat. If opponents sustain contest costs at rates KA and KB, and their resource values are VA and VB, an optimal assessor strategy defined by the interaction between the 2 asymmetries, is a unique ESS. It obeys the rule fight on estimating role A, where VA/KA > VB/KB; retreat in B. If mistakes can occur in both roles, but are very rare, the ESS is not fundamentally altered though there will be infinitesimal tendencies for persisting in role B. Selection to improve assessment abilities intensifies as abilities improve, but is weak if roles A and B are rather similar. Over a range of similarity between roles, an owner wins convention may be adopted if ownership correlates positively with role A and B an individual cannot tell when it would otherwise pay him to break the convention. A contest was also examined in which information about roles can be acquired only during a contest itself, and at a cost. Much depends on the rate at which information is acquired relative to the rate at which costs are expended, and on whether contests normally escalate in intensity, remain at the same level, or de-escalate. Selection favors short contests when costs are high relative to resource value, where the outcome of a round contains much information about fighting ability and where the actual disparity in fighting ability is large.

TI POPULATION-DENSITY, RESOURCE PATTERNING, AND TERRITORIALITY IN THE
   EVERGLADES PYGMY SUNFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The means by which pygmy sunfish compete for food are influenced by the density of the population, the dispersion of the prey and the sex and dominance status of the individual. At all densities when the prey were predictably located in a central clump, males established territories. When prey were dispersed randomly in both the high and low density population, males abandoned territorial behavior and, like females, swam freely about the aquaria. Only in the intermediate density populations did the males maintain territories and continue to defend resources. Development of a simple cost-benefit model shows that male territorial behavior is governed to a large extent by economic considerations. Despite these overall patterns, differences in competitive strategies were observed within populations. Dominant individuals tended to possess territories nearest the central patch of prey, and use the most intense and physiologically exhausting displays. Only under the most stressful conditions did they acquire significantly more food than subordinates, and even then these benefits were not translated into increased growth, largely because dominant fish engaged in disproportionately more energy-consuming contests.

TI INDIVIDUALITY IN THE USE OF ORIENTATION CUES BY GREEN FROGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The common assumption that test groups are motivationally homogeneous and utilize the same orientation reference cues may not be correct. Green frogs (R. clamitans) were trained in a circular arena to seek a goalbox located 90.degree. counterclockwise from a lamp. Most frogs learned the task, but an analysis of the training and testing records showed marked individuality in task learning. Some frogs found the goalbox only with the lamp as a cue; others used the goalbox, the goalbox and lamp, or the goalbox and the lamp separately as cues. One individual learned to orient non-randomly to some still-unknown but geographically fixed cue. These observations show that even though frogs can learn a common task, under supposedly identical training conditions they may utilize a diversity of cues. Larger (older) frogs were significantly more consistent in their patterns of movement. Paths of movement that succeeded in reaching the goal tended to be repeated in later tests. Frogs trained to move around a partition to a goal continued that path even when the obstruction was later removed, suggesting use of a motor memory of kinesthesia. Standard orientation tests, in which the group was significantly oriented in the expected direction, consisted, of frogs moving according to several individually stereotyped factors. The heterogeneity of individual experimental animals should be more fully taken into consideration in orientation research.

TI THE COORDINATED AEROBATICS OF DUNLIN FLOCKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Flocks of dunlin (C. alpina) were filmed during rapid aerial maneuvers. Two types of maneuvers were identified: course-change movements in which the entire flock altered course, and rotation movements in which individual birds rotated on their sagittal axes without necessarily changing direction. Either maneuver could make a flock''s overall appearance shift suddenly from light to dark (or vice versa) as the birds oriented first with their light ventral, then with their dark dorsal, plumage toward the observer. Slow-motion analysis revealed that the average time required by a majority of birds in camera view to change orientations during a maneuver was 196 ms (SD = 137 ms). Self-generated synchrony is a possible mechanism for this highly coordinated group behavior.

AB An analysis of the underwater mating behavior of seals was described. The courtship behavior of this species of ice-inhabiting phocid is more complex and variable than that of seals in other habitats. Underwater mating was observed during April and early May in 1973-1977. Most pre- and post-copulatory behaviors and vocalizations were drawn from the repertoire observed throughout the year. For a 1 yr period, 6 vocalizations and 7 behaviors, 4 of which involved interactions between the pair were monitored. Nosing and biting interactions and growling and drumming vocalizations increased significantly 2 wk prior to copulation and progressively increased up to the day of mating.

TI PREDATION AND PREDATORY PLAY-BEHAVIOR OF DOMESTIC CATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The factors controlling behavioral responses of the domestic cat to its prey were studied. Experiment 1 identified 3 temporally-associated groups of behaviors, and associated these differentially with killing. Cat behaviors were independent of prey activity. Hunger was not a necessary condition for killing. In experiment 2, hunger and the size of the prey were manipulated. The probability of a kill increased directly with hunger. When the prey was large or difficult, the probability of a kill decreased. The probability of killing was predictable if the levels of the factors hunger and prey size were known. When these factors were in conflict, cats tended to play with the prey before, after or instead of, killing. The relevance of these results to other studies of the control of predatory and playful behaviors is discussed.

Learning-set formation of the pattern characteristic of eutherian mammals was observed in all tests for all subjects, but performances were superior in tests of positional discrimination and in reversal-shift conditions. The results were consistent with those obtainable for eutherian mammals in comparable tests and suggest that echidnas can be used as subjects in experimental studies of operant learning.

AB Juveniles in a natural troop of 70 yellow baboons were ranked in dominance hierarchies according to the direction of supplanting interactions. Relative rank between juvenile males was dependent on size/age, but relative rank between juvenile males and adult females was dependent on mother''s rank. Juvenile females ranked according to their mother''s rank with same-sex peers and with adult females. Correlations between individual rank in these hierarchies and rates of supplanting interactions and proximity to others were examined to assess possible competitive advantage. Solicitations and supportive behavior between kin were assessed as possible mechanisms for transmission of maternal rank. The functional consequences of these different hierarchies were discussed.

In immigrant (transferred) males, dominance rank was highly correlated with reproductive activity and the alpha male in each troop was likely to have fathered a disproportionately large number of offspring. The alpha males did not father all offspring conceived during the study, and factors other than dominance which affected male reproductive activity are also considered.

TI MUTUAL INTERFERENCE DURING NEST-PROSPECTING IN THE SHELDUCK,
   TADORNA-TADORNA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The shelducks (T. tadorna) of the Ythan estuary, Aberdeenshire, [Scotland, UK], defended feeding territories on the estuary, but in the sand dune nesting area they formed groups while nest-prospecting, although they would be expected to space out their cryptic nests. Within the groups there was frequent aggression and the development of dominance hierarchies. Nesting success decreased significantly with increasing population size. During the selection of nest sites, mutual interference, i.e., a decrease in the amount of time spent nest-prospecting, increased with the number of birds present. There was some indirect evidence that such interference might be the cause of the density-dependent reduction in nesting success. This process will tend to have a regulatory effect on population size. The individual survival value of joining groups may be to reduce the risk of predation on the adults, but is perhaps more likely to be to gain information on the location of good nest sites.

AB Newborn female hamsters received testosterone, testosterone propionate or oil. Androgenized females showed male sexual behavior as adults when treated with testosterone propionate, but only those treated neonatally with testosterone propionate showed a reduction in lordosis. Masculinization and defeminization of behavior may be separate phenomena. There were no inverse relationships between male and female behavior in individuals which were both masculinized and defeminized compared to controls. Newborn females received testosterone, androstenedione or oil. Androgenized females showed mounting as ovariectomized adults receiving no additional hormone treatment. Masculine behavior was enhanced by androgen treatment in adulthood, particularly if the androgen corresponded to that given neonatally. The masculinized behavior of neonatally androgenized female hamsters is partly androgen-independent and partly androgen-dependent.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB The methodological problems associated with the time-sampling of behavior [human] are reviewed. Time-sampling conventions are investigated by an analysis of event recorded observations and a computer simulation. The abilities of each convention to approximate to the actual value on measures of frequency, duration and bout-length are compared. For each comparison the distributions of the bouts of behavior and the inter-bout intervals are known. Of the conventions compared, one-zero sampling may be the least satisfactory. Instantaneous sampling and predominant activity sampling give better approximations under most circumstances. Depending upon the parameters of the behavior studied, all 3 conventions can give accurate or inaccurate estimates on particular measures. Recommendations concerning the use of the conventions are made.

TI INTERACTIONS OF IMMATURE MALE AND FEMALE BABOONS WITH ADULT FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Immature males interacted at lower rates than immature females both with their mothers and with unrelated adult females. Immature males interacted with unrelated adult females primarily when the females were sexually cycling; immature females interacted with adult females primarily during lactation. Immature males tended both to groom and to copulate with adult females who ranked lower than their mothers. Immature females generally groomed and interacted with the infants of adult females who ranked higher than their mothers. Some of the differences in the behavior of immature males and females may be related to differences in the ways in which members of each sex potentially benefit as adults from bonds formed with high-ranking adult females in their natal troops.

TI ETHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES OF BEHAVIOR AND SOME CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR
   CONFLATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A bridgehead is established between contemporary ethology and some recent work in the philosophy of mind. Ethologists categorize behavior according to its form, its function and its causation, but have not always been aware of the conceptual problems arising from the employment of several different conceptual schemes in one science. Philosophers of mind have recently discussed in detail the difference between thinking of human behavior as action and thinking of it as movement, and this distinction is in some ways considered analogous to the distinction between behavior categorized by function and by form. Wherever more than one conceptual scheme is employed in a science there is a pressure to run together concepts taken from the different schemes, and such conceptual confusion in ethology can lead to obscurity, misrepresentation of experimental results, and the construction of unfruitful theories.

TI MALE-FEMALE PARENTAL-ROLES IN HEROTILAPIA-MULTISPINOSA (PISCES -
   CICHLIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Parental role-sharing in the substrate-brooding cichlid H. multispinosa was assessed by twice-daily monitoring of behavior of both parents during 15 breeding cycles. Some behavioral patterns were specific to 1 developmental brood stage; none was specific to 1 parental sex. Fanning and rocking over the eggs, mouthing wrigglers and pit-digging in the wriggler stage were performed more often by females; chasing other conspecifics and hovering, both during the egg stage, were performed more by males. Partial sharing of parental duties exists in this species, especially when the brood is at the egg and wriggler stages. As the progeny become free-swimming fry, quantitative behavioral differences between the parents disappear.

TI DISPLAY BEHAVIOR IN A CONFINED TROOP OF JAPANESE MACAQUES
   (MACACA-FUSCATA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Display behavior was studied in a semi-natural troop of 127 Japanese macaques (M. fuscata) confined to a 8058 m2 corral. Five types of display are described: shaking, kicking, leaping, tossing and swinging. Their frequency of occurrence was recorded during an annual breeding season. Individual male displays were significantly correlated with ejaculation rank, and more males displayed much more frequently than females. The significant increase in frequency of male (but not female) displays during the mating season did not correlate with individual dominance rank or attack frequency. In this troop of Japanese macaques these displays may serve as a mechanism of sexual selection and influence the females'' choice of males.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The frequency of aggression increased in late winter, without change in flock density. Dominance was shown in both captive and wild males and the wild population could be divided into high-ranking and low-ranking groups. Rank position within the former group was not related to subsequent performance, but high-ranking males were older, arrived earlier from migration and hatched more broods than low-ranking ones. The latter were seen less frequently at a feeding station, and may have been excluded from it by the high-ranking birds.

TI QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS OF MALE RESPONSES RELEASED BY FEMALE SEX-PHEROMONE
   IN PERIPLANETA-AMERICANA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Serial dilutions of purified female extracts of sex pheromone were analyzed for their activity in releasing courting behavior in males. Running activity and courting displays by males increased with the higher concentrations of sex pheromone. Males responded to sex pheromone in 3 distinct levels: arousal, running and courting displays. Individual male responses to equal dilutions were variable in that certain males had higher thresholds and required higher concentrations to initiate similar responses. Each level, respectively, was initiated by increasing concentrations of sex pheromone. When exposed to the highest concentration, there was a minimal temporal response time prior to the terminal courting displays. Secondarily purified extracts, as low as 4.5 .times. 10-14 g, elicited a response from males.

TI EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL FEEDING ON AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR OF RHESUS-MONKEYS
   IN INDIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Artificial feeding of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), which provides the major food source for most rhesus groups in rural and urban habitats, is common practice in India. Such feeding results is significant increases in aggressive competition within the monkey groups: during feeding periods the frequencies of aggressive threats, chases and attacks increased 2-6 times above those of non-feeding periods in each of 8 different groups. Fighting behavior did not increase in most groups studied, but did show a rise in one large urban group in Calcutta. The implications of these results for the management of primate breeding colonies are discussed.

AB The behavioral repertoire of 4 captive breeding pairs of C. j. jacchus is described. Social communication took the form of postures, facial expressions, vocalizations and piloerection displays. Detailed analyses were made of piloerection displays, adult play, copulatory, aggressive, and prey-catching behavior. Aggressive behavior was uncommon in adult mated pairs. Play between adults showed a degree of temporal organization. Vocalizations were the main methods of intragroup communication while piloerection displays were directed towards members of other groups and to unfamiliar objects. The behavioral repertoire of C. j. jacchus is compared with that of other primates.

   SMITH)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An ethogram is presented of Z. varians, a morphologically advanced member of the ''turtle ants'' comprising the neotropical ant tribe Cephalotini. The species displays unusual and in 1 or 2 cases possibly even unique social behaviors, including the consumption and sharing of infrabuccal pellets, the apparent absence of adult transport, a primarily or exclusively mechanical form of colony defense, and a remarkable form of abdominal trophallaxis. All of these specializations seem to be associated with more primary adaptations by the species to arboreal nesting and scavenging. Among the additional results is the demonstration that the major worker is more specialized as a defensive caste than is the case in certain species of Camponotus and Pheidole.

TI BREEDING EXPERIENCE AND BREEDING EFFICIENCY IN RING DOVE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The efficiency was measured of various aspects of the breeding activity of ring doves Streptopelia risoria in pairs matched for age, but differing in previous breeding experience. In 1 experiment, the breeding efficiency of pairs with previous breeding experience was compared with that of pairs without previous breeding experience. In a 2nd experiment, the comparison was made between pairs in which only the female had had previous breeding experience, and pairs in which only the male had had such experience. The data collected assessed: the readiness with which the female produced eggs as a result of stimulation by the male; the efficiency of incubation behavior; the efficiency of parental care of young after hatching and over-all breeding effectiveness. It was found that experienced pairs were superior to inexperienced pairs with respect to all of these measures, and the experience both of male and of female contributed to this difference, except that the shorter latency to egg-laying in experienced pairs is due to the increased responsiveness of experienced females, rather than to the increased effectiveness of experienced males.

TI OESTROGEN STIMULATION OF NEST MATERIAL PREPARATION IN PEACH-FACED
   LOVEBIRD (AGAPORNIS ROSEICOLLIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study was to determine whether the behavior involved in nest material preparation by female Agapornis roseicollis is stimulated at least partly by an estrogen and at what age this behavior can first be induced with an exogenous hormone. A pilot study indicated that an estrogen can stimulate nest material preparation but only after the female has reached a certain minimum age. A 2nd experiment was done to determine this age. Four 10-week-old females received estrogen pellet implants; 4 others were given control pellets. After 9 weeks the treatments were reversed. Measures of the treatment effects were the number of strips cut from paper sheets and the area of paper left uncut. The treated birds showed nest material preparation beginning the 3rd week of treatment[long dash]at least 2 weeks before they would normally begin[long dash]whereas the control birds showed almost none until after treatment reversal.

TI FORMATION OF ATTACHMENTS BY DOMESTIC CHICKS TO 2 TEXTURES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In 3 experiments chicks were reared with either a smooth-lined or a rough-lined box just big enough to be entered, and were then tested for preference in a pen containing both boxes. It was found in experiment 1 that conditions of rearing influenced the chicks'' preferences in the direction of the rearing texture, the effectiveness of rearing apparently depending to some extent upon the initial attractiveness of the texture used. The results of experiment 2 were difficult to interpret, but those of experiment 3 tended to confirm the finding, as well as indicating that controls reared without an object or with one unlike the smooth-lined and rough-lined boxes were less responsive in the choice test. By analogy with visual imprinting, it would appear that chicks may be capable of becoming imprinted to objects of specific textures.

AB Activity levels were measured from weaning until 43 days of age in male Swiss-Webster mice housed from weaning under either isolated or grouped housing conditions. Significant differences in motor activity between groups emerged on the 4th post-weaning day; activity of the isolated animals tended to be higher than that of the aggregates which tended to show decreased activity levels over days. Activity differences as a function of post-weaning housing were considered in view of the possible contribution of "stress", biochemical differences, and motivational factors.

TI ON DORSAL LIGHT RESPONSE IN A MAYFLY NYMPH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The position of a light source has a marked influence on the maintenance of the primary dorso-ventral orientation of the penultimate instar, middle and early stages of the nymphs of the baetid, Baetis harrisoni Barnard. In the ultimate instar the direction of light is operative as an orienting stimulus only to a limited degree and the effect on the dorso-ventral orientation is small. This response is possibly the sole means of determining the dorso-ventral position and is undoubtedly of importance to the swimming nymphs. The disorientation caused by the absence of a dorsal light source probably explains the phenomenon of "drift" which occurs predominantly by night in this species.

TI OBJECTS ATTACKED BY CATS DURING STIMULATION OF HYPOTHALAMUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Nine laboratory cats which would not spontaneously attack albino rats were tested for selection of an attack object under electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus. In a preference procedure, an anesthetized and a stuffed rat were present on every stimulation trial; a hairy toy dog, a block of foam rubber, and a block of hard styrofoam, all approximately rat-sized, were rotated to serve as the 3rd object. Eight of 9 cats attacked the 3rd object significantly less frequently (p<0.01 by separate X2 analyses) than the rat objects; 7 of 9 cats never attacked either block. Three cats significantly preferred the anesthetized to the stuffed rat; the other 6 showed no significant preferences. Eight of 9 cats had longer attack durations on the anesthetized rat than on the stuffed rat (significant for combined X2 analyses, p(<.001). Supplementary evidence suggesting that the sensory modalities mediating attack are olfaction, vision and touch is compatible with these results.

To judge from their learning scores, rich behavior repertoire, and social interaction, these monkeys are at least as intelligent as M. mulatta. They have proved to be naturally docile and submit readily to laboratory routine. Since they are so easily managed, they are regarded as superior to M. mulatta for investigations where handling becomes necessary.

AB In avian species offspring sex ratio adjustment in response to environmental and hormonal factors is well-studied. However, inconsistencies in the literature regarding the impact of environmental stress and corticosterone on offspring sex ratios arise from varying hormone dosages. Herein, dexamethasone (DEX), a high-potent synthetic glucocorticoid, was orally administered at two dosages over 10 days to chukar partridges to investigate its effect on sex ratio as well as on circulating glucose, cholesterol and aminotransferase levels, which have been indirectly linked to sex ratio. Ninety-six female partridges were randomly assigned to four treatment groups: untreated, vehicle, low dose of DEX and high dose of DEX. Females in the low-dose group produced a higher proportion of male hatchlings compared with untreated and vehicle. However, the proportion of sons in the high-dose group birds did not differ significantly from those groups. No significant differences were found in egg production and hatchability, suggesting no sex-specific embryo mortality. Group differences in glucose concentrations showed a similar pattern of statistical significance as that of sex ratio that, in turn, correlated with glucose. Our findings indicate a dose-dependent effect of glucocorticoids on avian sex ratio and suggest that glucose may be part of the underlying mechanism.

AB Predation risk in the wild varies across the day in a relatively predictable way, as a function of environmental conditions, such as light intensity and temperature, and of predator habits. Prey animals can thus adjust their own activity rhythm to avoid the most dangerous periods. We studied this situation in a coevolutionary perspective, considering that, if prey spread their activity across the day to counter predator temporal preferences, these preferences may in turn change to track prey activity. We therefore built a game-theoretical model to derive evolutionarily stable activity patterns for a predator constantly trying to maximize its chance of capture and a prey trying to minimize this probability. Key parameters concern circadian variations in environmental conditions and their influence on predator hunting efficiency and energy demands of the prey, which dictate its total amount of activity. The model predicts high levels of prey activity during periods of reduced predator efficiency. The predator may then either track these activity peaks and copy the activity patterns of its prey, or concentrate its hunting effort during periods when prey activity is low but conditions favour hunting. In the first case, predator and prey activity patterns will be synchronized. In the second one, they will exhibit strong temporal segregation. We show how these diverging scenarios emerge and how they can help to disentangle the wide variety of situations existing in the wild. (c) 2025 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Recent studies showed that some species of birds can combine two distinct calls (alert and recruitment calls) into a mobbing sequence that triggers mobbing behaviour in conspecifics and heterospecifics. Interestingly, some bird species also react appropriately to the mobbing sequences of allopatric species. Great tits, Parus major, are known to react appropriately to the mobbing sequences of allopatric chickadees. This study investigated whether great tits appropriately responded to the mobbing sequences of an allopatric non-Paridae species, namely, the Carolina wren, Thryothorus ludovicianus, a North American species producing similar mobbing sequences to great tits. The reaction of great tits to the mobbing sequences (alert & thorn; recruitment calls) and recruitment calls of Carolina wrens was compared. Results indicated that recruitment calls and mobbing sequences triggered a similar approach in receivers. In addition, the probability of displaying wing flicking was significantly higher during the playback of mobbing sequences than during the playback of controls and recruitment calls, indicating that they appropriately respond to the mobbing sequences given by an allopatric non-Paridae species and their isolated parts.

AB Acoustic communication is prevalent in a broad range of taxa, playing an important role in a variety of scenarios. Acoustic signals attenuate with distance, allowing individuals to assess proximity, which is one of the crucial factors affecting animal decision making in intraspecific competition. Female choice and male -male competition in anurans (frogs and toads) are highly dependent on acoustic signals, and numerous studies have shown that males adjust their call effort, call complexity or call type according to competitive contexts. However, there is less empirical work focused on the effects of spatial distance between calling males on the calling strategy. In the present study, we used playback experiments to investigate whether and how male Hainan frilled treefrogs, Kurixalus hainanus, adjust their calling strategies based on spatial distance. We found that compared to the spontaneous period, focal males produced significantly fewer advertisement calls but more suppression calls and encounter calls when presented with conspecific advertisement calls, regardless of the distance from the simulated rival. We also found that the number and proportion of advertisement calls and corresponding note type increased with distance. In contrast, the number and proportion of suppression calls, encounter calls and their corresponding note types decreased with distance. Interestingly, the descending trends of these two types of aggressive calls were not quite the same. These findings suggest that male K. hainanus can alter call types and their frequency of occurrence based on the distance from a calling rival, demonstrating a graded aggressive interaction. Our study provides evidence for a distance-dependent competitive strategy in vocal interaction and contributes to a better understanding of the reproductive trade-off in male-male competition.

AB Mushroom bodies (MB) are integrative structures in the insect brain that, in social bees, contribute to both visual and olfactory learning. Changes in the density of presynaptic boutons (or microglomeruli) within the calyx region of the MB have been linked to various aspects of foraging, including forms of learning that are believed to be key in supporting foraging efficiency. Here, we directly tested the relationship between foraging efficiency and microglomerulus density in a bumble bee model, Bombus terrestris. We found no evidence for microglomerulus density predicting real-world foraging performance, nor any relationship with foraging experience. Instead, our data suggest a potential nonlinear relationship between an individual's age, which is independent of foraging experience, and microglomerulus density in the lip region of the calyx, which is associated with olfactory processing. Our findings suggest that in real-world scenarios there is no simple direct relationship between microglomerulus density, learning ability and foraging efficiency in bumble bees, highlighting the knowledge gap regarding the relationships between learning abilities, neuroanatomy and foraging efficiency.

AB Foraging increases predation risk. As such, prey frequently attend to potential predator cues when making decisions about foraging behaviour. Environmental cues, such as light levels, can impact predation risk, and populations from different environments may vary in how they respond to such cues. Here we experimentally manipulated foraging conditions for a frugivorous bat, the Jamaican fruit bat, to ask whether individuals rapidly alter their foraging behaviour based on potential predator cues and light levels. Specifically, we ran bats in multiple foraging trials across a night in which we varied the level of ambient light or predator cues (auditory or visual) and measured latencies to feed. We found that bats in a more urban population were most affected by simulated full moonlight, delaying their foraging behaviour. In contrast, bats from a rural population were sensitive to simulated urban light. Furthermore, rural bats were also more sensitive to potential predator cues and foraged more rapidly in the presence of novel objects and auditory predator cues. These results reveal variation across populations of the same species with respect to their response to potential predator cues, possibly indicating differences in their evaluations of foraging risks.

AB Many animals devote substantial time, energy and resources to assessing nonmating social partners. However, relatively little is known about how individual characteristics influence the process and outcome of social partner choice. Social partner choice is an important aspect of Polistes fuscatus wasp lives, as nest -founding queens form and dissolve many short-term social relationships before settling down in stable cooperative groups. Here, we asked how personality and body size influence social partner assessment, the specific partners chosen, behaviour within social groups and group offspring production. We evaluated social and nonsocial personality traits (exploration, affiliation, aggression, investigation) and body mass in 75 individually marked queens, then released them in a large naturalistic enclosure where we recorded social partner assessment, nest founding behaviour and behaviour on nests. At the end of the season, we collected nests as a measure of group reproductive output. Exploratory personality had a stronger effect on social behaviour than other personality measures. More exploratory wasps sampled more social partners, joined nests later and spent fewer days as members of stable nests. Less exploratory wasps were more likely to become dominant on nests and were more aggressive after partnerships were established. Larger wasps sampled more potential nest sites, suggesting that sampling induces energetic costs that larger individuals are better able to bear. Among dominant and solitary -nesting wasps, more affiliative wasps built larger nests and more aggressive wasps built smaller nests. We did not find that wasps selected partners based on any measured trait. Overall, our work demonstrates that personality traits play an important role in how social partners are assessed, how social groups are formed, behaviour within established social groups and the success of social groups. Our study also suggests that personality mediates a trade-off between time spent sampling partners and social bond stability. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Examining manual lateralization (handedness) in nonhuman primates might be an interesting approach to gaining insight into the evolution of asymmetry in humans. Moreover, handedness could also reflect the effect of environmental alterations on the free-ranging animals that are forced to live with anthropogenic interferences. Despite addressing the handedness among monkeys and apes, only a few studies have focused on these free-ranging urban-adapted nonhuman primates, which could challenge our perception of habitat loss and deforestation. Here, we conducted experimental trials with two tasks, one unimanual (simple reaching) and one bimanual (tube task) to explore manual lateralization in a highly human-provisioned group of free-ranging Hanuman langurs. Experimental outcomes revealed an asymmetrical hand use distribution, with a bias towards the left hand. As bimanual tasks elicited a higher degree of lateralization, these tasks seem to be more suited to study manual laterality, and our results also highlight the significance of experimental tasks in establishing hand preference in langurs. This study also reveals that such lateralization developed with age as adults distinctly displayed their preference towards left-hand usage in contrast to juveniles and subadults which used both hands comparably. Mostly considered to be arboreal, the langurs of our study group spend a considerable amount of time with humans on the ground, thereby showing a terrestrial tendency. Postural origin theory states that terrestrial animals tend to use their right hand and arboreal ones their left. Therefore, the presence of a group level left-hand bias in the adult langurs of Dakshineswar creates a dilemma for this theory. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The coexistence of sympatric species with similar ecological requirements involves niche partitioning via interspecific differences in resource use and behaviour. Behavioural patterns of coexisting species can also be indicative of the functions of interspecific interactions, including those between species that form mixed-species groups. Here, we used Markov chain analysis applied to behavioural focal follow data of Australian humpback, Sousa sahulensis (hereafter 'humpback dolphins') and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus (hereafter 'bottlenose dolphins') observed around the North West Cape, Western Australia, to investigate potential behavioural coexistence mechanisms and the functions of their mixed-species groups. During six austral winter (April to October) field seasons (2013-2015, 2018 -2019 and 2021), we recorded 560 dolphin sightings from which we obtained 562 sequences of behavioural transitions: 222 humpback dolphin single-species sequences, 262 bottlenose dolphin singlespecies sequences and 78 mixed-species sequences. Humpback dolphins spent more time travelling in addition to having higher transition probabilities towards travelling and longer bout lengths of travelling, while bottlenose dolphins spent more time foraging and had longer foraging bouts. These behavioural patterns indicate that humpback and bottlenose dolphins differ in their use of the study area. In particular, they suggest interspecific temporal differences in foraging behaviour, which may facilitate coexistence. When in mixed-species groups, humpback and bottlenose dolphins altered their behavioural patterns by exhibiting higher transition probabilities towards socializing and increasing time spent socializing, suggesting that their mixed-species groups may have a social function. Overall, our results indicate that behavioural differences may play an important role in facilitating the coexistence of sympatric delphinids and that social benefits may be a key driver of the formation of mixed-species groups.

AB For many animals, making informed decisions is crucial to survival. A critical problem is how to make optimal decisions in the face of incomplete, unreliable or conflicting information. In many aquatic environments, fish use visual information to guide key behaviours, but the environment itself can alter or mask the very signals they rely on. Here, we asked how a highly visual species, Rhinecanthus aculeatus , responds to a learned discrimination task as signal reliability decreases, and whether probabilistic information gained during previous experience can be incorporated into their decision strategy. Fish were first trained to select a target (dark grey circle) from three distractors (light grey circles). In the first experiment, the target was more likely to appear in one of four possible stimulus positions. In the second experiment, the target appeared in all positions equally. In a series of trials, the difference in brightness between the target and distractors was reduced until all four stimuli were identical. We found that target selection accuracy decreased with decreasing target and distractor disparity. In experiment 1 where the target was more likely to be in one position, fish increasingly selected stimuli in the biased position as target selection accuracy decreased, but not in experiment 2. These results demonstrate (1) that fish learned more than a simple select/avoid rule based on stimulus brightness; they also integrated information (stimulus position), which could be considered ancillary to the primary task. (2) Fish can learn probability distributions and apply this knowledge as uncertainty increases, ultimately increasing the overall frequency of correct choices. Our results reveal that probabilistic decision rules can be used by fish when visual information is unreliable, indicating a possible mechanism for decision making given the inherent noise in incoming sensory information.

AB Ecologists strive for laws that explain interactions between organisms. Myriad hypotheses have been fundamental in increasing our understanding of plant-herbivore interactions, including the forage maturation hypothesis (FMH). The FMH has recently been extended to include contingencies of body size and digestive system: selection for greater energy potential should be negatively correlated with body mass and selection for proximity to surface water should be greater for hindgut fermenters compared to foregut fermenters or ruminants. While these general trends hold at a broad scale, intrapopulation variability still exists. For feral species that did not coevolve within their current ecological context, variability in habitat selection among populations may be greater. Consequently, understanding habitat selection of each population is imperative to properly inform management. For the case of feral horses, Equus ferus caballus, a large-bodied hindgut fermenter, understanding how they compare in habitat selection to sympatric species is of particular interest due to habitat alteration and potential competition. Across much of their range in western North America, horses are sympatric with the smaller-bodied ruminant pronghorn, Antilocapra americana. The two species overlap in space use, but we lack information on how each species selects resources within areas of overlap. Accordingly, we compared habitat selection between these two species during the growing season to understand how each responded to predictions of the FMH and to better guide potential management actions. Horses followed FMH predictions by selecting proximity to surface water and greater forage biomass. Meanwhile, pronghorn did not follow predictions of the FMH; pronghorn selected greater forage biomass but did not select greater energy potential. Both species selected greater herbaceous cover, flatter slopes and farther distances from oil and gas well pads. Our analysis reveals a high degree of selection overlap and underscores the importance of conducting population level studies to best understand how herbivores interact with the unique environments they inhabit.

AB Repeated use of a winning foraging strategy can be profitable when individuals use memory to return to successful food patches. However, in environments where patches are unpredictable, variable foraging behaviour may be more profitable. To test this idea, we explored how individual variation in foraging trip characteristics impacts breeding success in black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla, on Middleton Island, Alaska, U.S.A., during a period of highly variable environmental conditions, the largest recorded marine heatwave. As anticipated, foraging trip characteristics were highly variable, within and between years and individuals. While characteristics of foraging trips alone did not influence annual breeding success, both age and variance in those trip characteristics explained variation in breeding success. Specifically, individuals with smaller variance in foraging trip characteristics among trips were more likely to fledge a chick. There was a maximum distance threshold in foraging implying that individuals searched within a restricted area, increasing foraging time rather than distance when searching was not profitable, and providing additional support for the idea that kittiwakes are most successful when foraging in known areas rather than exploring new areas. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is associated with large scale shifts between cold and warm ocean climate and ecosystem regimes in the region, impacted breeding success but did not change foraging behaviour. However, mean breeding success decreased as mean time spent resting and in area-restricted search (intensive search) on foraging trips during incubation increased. Based on nearly a decade of data, we conclude that smaller variability in behaviour, even during challenging foraging conditions, enhances breeding success. As climate change and marine heatwaves continue to increase in intensity, individuals more variable in foraging behaviour may be unable to compensate.

AB Accelerometry and machine learning are powerful tools for gaining indepth information about animal behaviour. However, such methods are rarely used to quantify behaviours that contribute to mating success, such as intrasexual competition, courtship and copulation. In part, this is probably due to the inherent challenges of classifying behaviours that can be brief and infrequent, and that are not necessarily exhibited by all individuals. In this study, we used triaxial accelerometry and machine-learning methods to quantify the mating behaviours of captive male ruffs, Calidris pugnax. The ruff is a poly-morphic, lekking shorebird with highly skewed mating success. Mating behaviour in ruffs includes ritualized postures that can be distinguished during observations. Using this system as a case study, we (1) describe possible approaches to classifying mating behaviour; (2) compare the classification performance of three supervised machine-learning methods: random forests, hidden Markov models and neural networks; (3) highlight potential pitfalls that can cause overestimation of model performance; and (4) offer suggestions for avoiding these pitfalls. In our study, some models distinguished mating behaviours from nonmating behaviours with high precision and sensitivity (>75%), but only when trained and tested on the same individuals within the same timeframe. Estimates of model performance were much poorer when models were tested on future data or data from different individuals. Nevertheless, even when tested on different individuals, the hidden Markov model provided a reasonably accurate estimate of which males invested more time in mating behaviour overall. Here, we provide an end-to-end workflow for classifying behaviour from accelerometry, including recommendations, con-siderations and code. Although posture-based mating behaviours in ruffs proved challenging to distinguish, the methods that we describe show promise for displays associated with distinctive, dynamic movements.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Environmental conditions are fundamental drivers of animal behaviour. Aggression in ectotherms is a marked example and is often considered positively correlated with temperature. However, many studies exploring this relationship, and its important consequences, focus on a few temperatures and implicitly assume a linear relationship between the two variables. This may limit our understanding of the influence of temperature on aggression. We measured levels of aggression in Neolamprologus pulcher, a cichlid fish commonly used as a model in studies of aggression-based social hierarchy, across a range of temperatures in a mirror aggression test. We used temperatures expected from their natural range with a 2 degrees C extension on either end. As predicted by thermal performance curves, rates of aggression increased with temperature at the lower end of the temperature range. After reaching a peak, any further increase in temperature resulted in a considerable drop in rates of aggression. Exploring responses at a finer temporal scale, we found that the influence of high temperatures changed dramatically during the 25 min trials. Early in the trials the frequency of aggression increased linearly with temperature, across all temperatures. The initially high levels of aggression at the higher temperatures were not sustained and dropped with increasing duration of exposure to the mirror at high temperatures. Together these findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of short-term exposure to different temperatures on aggression, such as acute exposure to increased temperatures caused by global warming and associated rapid thermal fluctuations, in African rift lake fishes and in ectotherms more generally. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of measuring aggression across a range of temperatures or otherwise account for nonlinear changes in thermal performance. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Female song and male-female duetting have been detected mainly in tropical passerines, in which female singing serves a variety of functions that vary with social contexts. Females of numerous temperate passerine species also sing and engage in male-female duetting, but it is still unclear whether these vocalizations function in a similar manner to those of tropical species. To help address this knowledge gap, we used multiple field experimental approaches to investigate the function of female song and male -female duets in a colour-marked population of the plain laughingthrush, Pterorhinus davidi, a socially monogamous, pair-living, resident, temperate species. Baseline observations revealed that both unpaired males and females sing more than paired individuals, and both paired males and females sang more when they were apart, suggesting that females sing to attract potential mates and/or contact their partners. Playback experiments revealed that pair members coordinated their approach to the playback speakers and engaged in duetting, suggesting that duets play a significant role in joint territorial defence. Responses of focal birds to playback stimuli were not sex specific and joint territory defence was male dominated. Mate removal experiments found that both males and females sang more when their mate was experimentally removed, suggesting that females also use songs for contacting a missing mate within their territory. Simulated intrusions using live decoy experiments indicated that duets may also function in shared resource defence during the nonbreeding season. Our study highlights the importance of investigating the functions of female song and male-female duets in songbirds by using a combination of different field approaches to quantify the multifunctional nature of these vocalizations.

AB The polymorphic colour vision system of platyrrhine monkeys is a remarkable example of balancing selection. Yet, the underlying mechanism of natural selection remains debated. Here we test the potential for dietary niche differentiation between sensory phenotypes. Monkeys with dichromacy (red-green 'colourblindness') are predicted to eat more camouflaged foods while trichromatic monkeys ('typical' human-like colour vision) are predicted to eat more reddish foods. We studied a population of wild Costa Rican capuchins (Cebus imitator), comparing the diet and nutrition of adult female dichromats and trichromats. We classified the conspicuity of diet items in capuchin visual space and calculated dietary intake, nutritional intake and niche overlap during periods of high and low habitat-wide fruit abundance. Dichromats and trichromats had similar nutritional profiles, but we found evidence of niche differentiation in the invertebrate prey consumed. In support for our prediction regarding cryptic invertebrate prey, dichromats ate more camouflaged surface-dwelling invertebrates, while trichromats ate more extracted ants. Contrary to our prediction regarding reddish foods, dichromats consumed more dark reddish figs than did trichromats. However, these fruits were likely to be conspicuous to both dichromats and trichromats in luminance contrast. Overall, our results suggest that monkeys with different colour vision types achieve similar nutritional intakes in slightly different ways. Behavioural flexibility driven by sensory differences may decrease intragroup feeding competition while meeting species-specific nutritional needs. Our research sheds light on the extent of foraging niche differentiation in a population of wild mammals and its potential contribution to maintaining colour vision polymorphism.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB The social structure of gregarious animals can be influenced by phenotypic differences, including signals of quality or of social dominance such as colour ornamentation. Familiarity among individuals can also influence social behaviour. When individuals are already familiar with each other, it is unclear whether ornamentation remains important in shaping social behaviour. Here, we tested how long-term associ-ations among individuals are affected by two types of perturbations. First, we tested whether experi-mentally manipulating ornamental plumage affected social dominance and network centrality among familiar individuals. In a second experiment, we tested whether temporary absence of individuals affected their long-term associations. In our first experiment, we reduced the size of the red breast plumage of wild-caught common waxbills, Estrilda astrild, that had been living together for over a year in a large mesocosm and monitored their social network and aggressive interactions before and up to 2 months after the manipulation. We found that waxbills with experimentally reduced red breast plumage did not change in social network centrality or social dominance, compared to controls. In our second experiment, we temporarily removed a subset of waxbills from the mesocosm and found that their social network centrality was not affected upon their return to the group 3 months later. The strength of as-sociations between separated birds remained stable, not having changed more than those between control birds that remained together in the mesocosm. In contrast to these temporarily absent birds, waxbills entering the mesocosm for the first time occupied more central network positions. Results indicate that long-term associations among familiar waxbills are resilient to changes in ornamentation and to prolonged absence. We propose that resuming long-term associations with familiar individuals stabilizes social structure, which may increase the benefits of social living for gregarious species like the waxbill, which in nature exhibits fission-fusion and vagrant movements. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Testosterone promotes mating effort, which involves intraspecific aggression for males of many species. Therefore, males with higher testosterone levels are often thought to be more aggressive. For mammals living in multimale groups, aggression is hypothesized to link male social status (i.e. dominance rank) and testosterone levels, given that high status predicts mating success and is acquired partly through aggressive intragroup competition. In male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, dominance rank has been repeatedly linked to interindividual variation in testosterone levels, but evidence directly linking inter -individual variation in testosterone and aggression is lacking. In the present study, we test both aggression levels and lean muscle mass, as measured by urinary creatinine, as links between dominance rank and testosterone levels in a large sample of wild male chimpanzees. Multivariate analyses indicated that dominance rank was positively associated with total rates of intragroup aggression, average urinary testosterone levels and average urinary creatinine levels. Testosterone was positively associated with creatinine levels but negatively associated with total aggression rates. Furthermore, mediation analyses showed that testosterone levels facilitated an association between dominance rank and creatinine levels. Our results indicate that (1) adult male chimpanzees with higher average testosterone levels are often higher ranking but not more aggressive than males with lower testosterone and (2) lean muscle mass links dominance rank and testosterone levels in Ngogo males. We assert that aggression rates are insufficient to explain links between dominance rank and testosterone levels in male chimpanzees and that other social variables (e.g. male-male relationship quality) may regulate testosterone's links to aggression.

AB Human activities can have complex effects on the antipredator behaviour of wildlife, and an under-standing of the intricacies can provide important information for conservation management. In some cases, 'human shields' that attract wild ungulates may form around human settlements due to a lower density of large predators. However, human presence may also be associated with increased exposure to a range of anthropogenic threats, such as poaching, predation by dogs and costly interactions with livestock and their herders. Here we compared the antipredator behaviour of two savannah antelopes, topi, Damaliscus lunatus, and Thomson's gazelle, Eudorcas thomsonii, between the relatively undisturbed areas in the interior of the Maasai Mara National Reserve (Kenya) and the peripheral areas next to human settlements by the reserve boundary. We found that both antelope species were less vigilant in the more human-impacted peripheral areas, suggesting a reduction in the overall predation risk. However, both species also responded more strongly to conspecific (but not heterospecific) alarm calls in the human -impacted areas. We suggest that alarm calls in the human-impacted areas may be elicited by a more variable and unpredictable set of threats, many of which are anthropogenic, and that these require more careful assessment by the antelopes. Human presence can thus have opposite effects on different aspects of antipredator behaviour, emphasizing the need to better understand how animals perceive threats in their environment and the consequences for population performance.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   COMPETITION; BEHAVIOR
AB Male-male competition over matings is a key driving force in the evolution of courtship. Typically, male-male competition is an individual affair selecting for dominance and aggression. Yet, some males forgo direct confrontation improving their reproductive success through cooperation. Occasionally, this leads to specialized alternative reproductive tactics that operate at the intersection of cooperation and conflict. We informed a community game model with empirical data derived from previous studies, to examine cooperation dynamics between lekking male ruffs, Calidris pugnax, using two tactics: resident and sat-ellite. Residents defend display courts against one another on leks of up to seven residents. Nonag-gressive satellites forgo court defence and engage in cooperative co-displays with residents. Previous studies suggest such co-displays alter female mate choice, yet the exact magnitude and consequences remain unclear. We modelled the propensity for resident/satellite co-display by examining its influence on male mating success. Male mating success was a function of lek size, resident rank, satellite competitiveness within a co-display and female preference for co-display. We assumed that co-display alters female preference such that copulations are drawn from single display courts to co-display courts proportional to the existing resident mating skew. Under this assumption, all residents benefit from co-display over single display, except for a-residents co-displaying with the most competitive satellites on large leks. Thus, satellites could predominantly choose their preferred co-display partner, but achieved the highest copulation rates with lower-ranking residents on intermediate-sized leks. Co -display between the satellite and lower-ranking residents reduced the resident mating skew. However, satellite copulation rates were similar over a range of co-display partners, meaning that a variety of co -display dyads is possible, which is consistent with observations in nature. We conclude that, given our model assumptions, co-displaying reduces the impact of male dominance on mating success and ulti-mately alters the course of sexual selection.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Foraging animals must repeatedly decide whether to exploit current resources or explore to gain in-formation and locate new resources. Balancing these two often mutually exclusive options is made more difficult by environmental changes that can occur predictably, as seen in daily patterns of nectar secretion in flowers, or unpredictably, as seen when resources are depleted by competitors. Recent ex-periences with predictable and unpredictable rewards potentially provide information that foraging animals can use to decide when it is beneficial to explore versus exploit. However, it is unclear how the predictability of recent experiences can shape an animal's future exploration after rewards vanish and they have no option but to search. We tested how experience with unpredictability related to two types of environmental change, unpredictability in reward location and unpredictability in daily timing of rewards, shaped the exploratory behaviour of honey bees in the absence of a reward. We found that honey bees that experienced unpredictable rewards in space or time were less precise in their explo-ration after those rewards vanished. In spatial experiments, bees searched more broadly within a patch if they had experience with unpredictably located rewards and spent more time searching outside the patch than bees that experienced predictably located rewards. In temporal experiments, bees that experienced unpredictably timed rewards distributed their search effort more broadly outside of the time they last received a high-quality reward; also, bees that experienced any change in reward searched more intensively regardless of how predictable the reward had been. In contrast to the differences in search precision, a bee's previous experience with spatial or temporal unpredictability of rewards did not change how persistently she searched for a reward. This study provides novel insights into how pre-dictability of previous experiences can shape exploratory behaviour even in the absence of rewards.

AB Predation is a major force that shapes prey phenotypes, species interactions and ecological communities. Prey respond to variation in predation risk and intensity by either increasing or decreasing vigilance and balancing energy requirements under high-or low-risk scenarios. We test the possible mechanism of sensory adaptation and decision making while responding to risk in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. We maintained three risk treatment groups (no risk, low risk and high risk) for 20 days before testing them under multiple cognitive and behavioural challenges involving a predatory stimulus. Under a configural learning procedure where snails learned to forgo feeding when encountering food in the presence of a predatory threat, the high-risk group snails did not show learning/memory formation. However, when high-risk group individuals were transferred to a no-risk environment for 20 days, they were able to form configural learning memory. In a social interaction trial, snails from the no-risk group reduced interactions under threat whereas the high-risk group showed no change between risk environments. All risk groups responded similarly to an operant conditioning training under predation threat that enhanced memory. The decreased antipredator response of the high-risk group in comparison to the low-risk groups shows that snails are able to respond to risk based on past experience, especially when there exists a trade-off between survival and antipredator response. The variation in response to predation threat under different circumstances provides evidence of decision making rather than sensory adaptation as the mechanism involved in prey response. Our study combines multiple phenotypic responses to elucidate animal decision making under different intensities of risk and highlights the importance of experience in shaping antipredator responses.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Competitive dyadic interactions frequently attract the attention of bystanders that follow and disrupt the ongoing contest. The motivation for bystanders to engage in such third-party behaviour is considered by several different theoretical approaches; one such model argues that bystanders intervene to prevent subordinates from gaining a winner effect, thereby becoming a threat to the individual's dominant status within the group. This study investigates the role of contestant morphology as a motivating factor in initiating third-party behaviour. We investigated whether two correlates of resource-holding potential, prerut body weight and antler weight, were associated with third-party behaviour in rutting male fallow deer, Dama dama. In addition, we examined whether a third factor, reproductive effort (weight loss during the rut) was associated with third-party behaviour. There was a positive relationship between antler weight and the number of times individual males experienced third-party behaviour during contests. This relationship was not evident for either prerut weight or weight loss. An analysis of third -party behaviour showed that as the difference in both prerut and antler weight between the competing males declined, there was an increase in the probability that the dyad would experience third-party behaviour. However, there was no such association between the difference in weight loss between contestants and third-party behaviour. Thus, dyads of males closely matched in terms of individual quality were likely to experience third-party behaviour. We show for the first time that morphological traits associated with resource-holding potential are important cues used by rivals as a basis for engaging in third-party behaviour.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Inhibitory control is one of several cognitive mechanisms required for self-regulation, decision making and attention towards tasks. Inhibitory control is expected to influence behavioural plasticity in animals, for example in the context of foraging, social interaction or responses to sudden changes in the envi-ronment. One widely used inhibitory control assay is the 'detour task' where subjects must avoid impulsively touching transparent barriers positioned in front of food, and instead access the food by an alternative but known route. However, because the detour task has been reported to measure factors unrelated to inhibitory control, including motivation, previous experience and persistence, the task may be unreliable for making cross-species comparisons, estimating individual differences and linking per-formance with socioecological traits. To address these concerns, we designed a variant of the detour task for wild great tits, Parus major, and deployed it at the nesting site across two spring seasons. We compared task performance of the same individuals in the wild across 2 years, and with their perfor-mance in captivity when tested using the classical cylinder detour task during the nonbreeding season. Potential confounds of motivation, previous experience, body size, sex, age and personality did not significantly predict performance, and temporal and contextual repeatability were low but significant. These results support the hypothesis that our assays captured intrinsic differences in inhibitory control. Instead of dismissing detour tasks and 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater', we suggest confounds are likely system and experimental-design specific, and that assays for this potentially fundamental but largely overlooked source of behavioural plasticity in animal populations, should be validated and refined for each study system.

AB Yawning is a stereotyped action pattern that is prevalent across vertebrates. While there is growing consensus on the physiological functions of spontaneous yawning in neurovascular circulation and brain cooling, far less is known about how the act of yawning alters the cognition and behaviour of observers. By bridging and synthesizing a wide range of literature, this review attempts to provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution and elaboration of derived features of yawning in social vertebrates. Recent studies in animal behaviour, psychology and neuroscience now provide evidence that yawns serve as a cue that improves the vigilance of observers, and that contagious yawning functions to synchronize and/or coordinate group activity patterns. These social responses to yawning align with research on the physiological significance of this behaviour, as well as the ubiquitous temporal and contextual variation in yawn frequency across mammals and birds. In addition, these changes in mental processing and behaviour resulting from the detection of yawning in others are consistent with variability in the expression of yawn contagion based on affinity and social status in primates. Topics for further research in these areas are discussed. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Human speech is marked by a signal-function decoupling, the capacity to produce sounds that can fulfil a variety of functions, in contrast to nonverbal vocalizations such as laughter, cries and screams, which are functionally more rigid. It has been argued that this decoupling provides an essential foundation for the emergence of language, in both ontogeny and phylogeny. Although language has a deep evolutionary history, whether this capacity for vocal functional flexibility also exists in the vocal systems of nonhuman animals has been much overlooked. Reasons are multiple. Here, we propose to diagnose the problems that have thus far hindered progress on understanding the evolutionary basis of functional flexibility, an issue which can shed broader light on the evolution of language. In particular, we aim to clarify what vocal functional flexibility is, why it matters, why we believe it should be investigated in nonhuman animals and how this could be best achieved.

AB Birdsong is an important signal used in intra-and intersexual communication in a reproductive context. Strong sexual and natural selective forces act on this behaviour, such that singing individuals can be viewed as vocal athletes whose performance is critical for reproductive success. In this review, I argue and illustrate how a solid understanding of song production mechanisms can enhance our investigations of performance. From a production perspective, temporal and spectral features of song are relatively well understood and therefore are discussed in detail. Performance ranges of temporal and frequency characteristics can be broad, but often involve different production mechanisms, with different constraints and trade-offs underlying their generation. Based on these multifaceted features, I argue that song may be perceived as an 'acoustic gestalt', which for each syllable represents a specific location in a complex multidimensional parameter space characterized by differential contributions of individual features. Derived from this view, I also propose that individual males may be showing specialization for exceptional performance of some, but not all, features of song. To illustrate this possibility for a future research focus, I quantify some song features of seven male European robins, and, although the data set is limited, it shows that different individuals exhibit different performance levels across a number of song features.

Predator cues perceived by gravid prey have the potential to prime offspring to alter their behaviour in the presence of predation threats after birth. Wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) provide an opportunity to explore this phenomenon since females carry their eggsacs prior to eclosion and, after emergence, carry spiderlings for days as they disperse. During maternal care, mothers may prenatally expose offspring to predator odour cues and potentially influence their posteclosion dispersal when in the presence of these cues. Spiderlings of the wolf spider Tigrosa helluo are eaten by adults of the wolf spider Pardosa milvina. We measured differences in substrate preferences of spiderlings produced from egg-carrying T. helluo females that had or had not been exposed to cues of adult P. milvina. Over a 15-day period we counted the number of offspring climbing on substrates previously walked on by P. milvina, crickets or blank control substrates. For the first 10 out of 15 days, spiderlings of predator-exposed mothers climbed on Pardosa substrates significantly more compared to control mothers. We found no significant spiderling preference in time spent on cricket-cued or control substrates across treatments and no difference in chemical cue substrate preference of the mothers while spiderlings dispersed. Among wolf spiders, vertical climbing and contact with predator-cued substrates can induce adaptive tonic immobility (freeze response) that has been associated with increased survival in the presence of live predatory lycosids. Spider predator cues may prime spiderling antipredator behaviour either directly through prenatal exposure in the eggsac or indirectly by modifying the mother's behaviour prior to eclosion, but we found no evidence of mother substrate preference influencing spiderling distribution during dispersal.

AB Social selection, via intra- and intersexual competition for sexual (e.g. mates) and/or nonsexual (e.g. territories) resources, is thought to drive the evolution of ornaments in both sexes. However, the relative importance of intra- and intersexual competition in promoting the evolution of female and male ornamentation and, hence, sexual dichromatism remains poorly understood. We addressed this issue in antbirds (Thamnophilidae), a radiation of sexually dichromatic passerines wherein eumelanic plumage patches have evolved multiple times in both sexes. In antbirds, the degree of sexual dichromatism differs between closely related species primarily due to eumelanic dark patches in either sex. If eumelanic patches evolved by social selection, individuals of species bearing more conspicuous eumelanic patches should display stronger territorial responses regardless of their sex. Using playback experiments, we simulated three conspecific territorial intrusion types - a social pair, a female and a male - and measured responses by social pairs of two sister species pairs exhibiting greater interspecific differences in female coloration and one sister species pair exhibiting greater interspecific differences in male coloration. We found that females of species bearing more conspicuous eumelanic patches responded more strongly than females of species bearing less conspicuous eumelanic patches, but only towards simulated female and/or male intruders. However, males responded similarly to all intrusions regardless of interspecific coloration differences. Our results suggest that eumelanic patches in antbirds may function as ornaments and that greater female ornamentation may function in intra- and intersexual contexts and reflect stronger social competition in ornamented females for territories and, possibly, mates. In contrast, in species pairs with greater interspecific differences in male ornamentation, territorial competition may occur predominantly among males and female mate choice may drive the evolution of male ornamentation. Our study highlights that social selection pressures acting on both sexes may drive the evolution of contrasting sexual dichromatism patterns.

AB Individual-specific mate preferences are thought to be widespread, but they are still poorly understood in terms of mechanisms and function. Earlier work on a songbird (the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata) showed predominantly individual-specific mate preferences and signs of behavioural incompatibility with certain partners. However, the phenotypic target of preference or aversion remains unclear. A previous study suggested that female preferences may be related to variation in male song. Male zebra finches have individually distinct songs and together with individual-specific female song preferences they could function according to a 'key-lock principle'. Here we report on a preregistered study in which we tested the hypothesis that individual females respond to males with highly similar songs in a similar way. We selected 18 duos of males with nearly identical songs and released them with females in communal breeding aviaries. We scored female preference as the female's responsiveness to male courtship and confirmed that females indeed had strong individual-specific mate preferences. However, female responsiveness scores were not positively correlated across males closely matched for their song, thereby rejecting the idea of a song-based 'key-lock principle' as an explanation for the observed individual-specific preferences. We suggest researchers should focus on details of the interactions between potential partners to elucidate the cause of behavioural incompatibility.

AB Many social mammals form discrete social communities within larger populations. For nonterritorial, polygynous, size-dimorphic species, sex-and age-class differences in life-history requirements might mediate differences in social connectedness and transitions among communities. We conducted social network analysis and community detection with an extensive data set of 1081 individually identified wild giraffes, Giraffa camelopardalis, over 5 years to test predictions that adult males and young of both sexes show greater social connectedness (degree, closeness and betweenness centrality) and transition more often among social communities than adult females, which form stronger and more stable relationships. We also expected that young animals would be more socially connected than adults. Using both static and dynamic network clustering techniques, we detected four distinct mixed-sex social communities, which we termed 'super-communities' to differentiate this apex level of social organization from intermediate-level female-only communities. Most (similar to 70%) giraffes remained within their same super-community, and those (usually adult males) that visited a different super-community often returned to their original super-community. Males-both adults and calves-had higher social centrality scores than females, and adult males were closer to all other individuals in the network and transitioned among super-communities twice as often as females and calves, reflecting their roaming reproductive strategy of seeking females in oestrus. Of all age and sex classes, young males had the most social ties and highest betweenness (moved most often among groups), which we attributed to social exploration prior to natal dispersal. Overall, female giraffes have stronger social associations than males, but males exceed females in measures of social connectedness, reflecting differences in reproductive and life-history profiles. Our findings suggest that giraffe translocations that do not consider sociality are likely to break up established social associations and potentially reduce fitness.

AB Foraging animals usually select foods that balance the intake of key nutrients, for example essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized and must be obtained from the diet. However, the ability to gain optimal ratios, proportions and amounts of nutrients may be hampered by a changing environment, competitive conspecifics or species and predators. Here, we used an experimental system in which house sparrows, Passer domesticus, were fed a manipulated diet with different compositions of amino acids (in the experimental diet phenylalanine and tyrosine content was 42% of that in the control diet). Phenylalanine and tyrosine are precursors of coping hormones: dopamine, noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and adrenaline (epinephrine) which are involved mainly in the expression of stress and fear, but also in learning and long-term memory formation. Accordingly, birds fed a diet deficient in these amino acids learned to avoid unpalatable food markedly slower, coped worse with stress in the presence of a novel object and were more aggressive towards other sparrows than control birds. Surprisingly, circulating amounts of the catecholamines in blood plasma were higher in these birds than in sparrows on the control diet. This study provides the first evidence that variation in amino acid composition in the diet is associated with variation in behaviours and hormone levels in birds. We conclude that food, besides its nutritional function, seems to represent one of the modulators of behavioural expression making a balanced diet crucial for survival.

AB While the proximate and ultimate causes of sexual segregation have been well studied over the past 30 years, most of the research has focused on species with a pronounced sexual size dimorphism. Species with a smaller size dimorphism are probably understudied, because the assumption is that aggregation rather than sex segregation should be the norm. We used 6 years of direct observations of goitered gazelles, Gazella subgutturosa, an ungulate with a small degree of sexual size dimorphism, to explore sexual segregation and aggregation patterns and habitat choice at two timescales. We predicted minimal differences in activity budgets between the sexes, based on their small size dimorphism, and did not expect any evolutionary niche divergence based on size. However, we found that goitered gazelles showed considerable sexual and habitat segregation for most of the year, and only showed a tendency to randomly aggregate during the peak of the rutting season. We also found that they segregated socially and by habitat and had different activity budgets in some months. Behavioural asynchrony and sexual differences in habitat use were much greater than predicted for a species with such a small sexual dimorphism in body size. Our study confirms strong multifactorial sexual segregation patterns, and points to the potential importance that social factors (aggression and territoriality) may have on sexual segregation in goitered gazelles.

AB The proximate and ultimate mechanisms behind individual behavioural phenotypes are still only partially understood, with studies often focusing on a single or a few factor(s) that affect behaviour in a controlled environment. To understand the development and consequences of individual behavioural phenotypes in their complexity, a comprehensive approach is needed that analyses the effects of a broad spectrum of factors and their interactions on behaviour within the natural environment. We used focal observations to quantify four key behavioural components of Gala = pagos sea lion, Zalophus wollebaeki, pups under natural conditions: general social interactions, swimming, resting and social play behaviour. We then investigated the influence and interplay of age, sex, body condition, basal cortisol and testosterone levels, personality scores and the social environment on the observed behaviour. We identified significant correlations between all measured factors and behaviour. Complex interactions between testosterone, boldness and social play especially stand out, with the effect of boldness on social play being dependent on testosterone levels. We also demonstrate the importance of the early social environment, defined as local population density, for social play and, interestingly, time spent swimming. This could have consequences for the development of social and hunting skills, crucial for later stages of ontogeny. For this endangered pinniped, a decline in the diversity of social environments due to dwindling population numbers could lead to a decline in behavioural diversity and lower coping abilities towards future changes in their environment. Our study reveals important factors for the development of individual behavioural phenotypes of young Gala = pagos sea lions and elucidates some aspects of the architecture behind this individual variation in behaviour.

AB Eusocial insect societies possess complex multilevel disease defences, including individual level protection conferred by physical (e.g. cuticle) and immunological obstacles and colony level protection mediated by collective behaviours (social immunity). It remains unclear whether and how these two levels of disease protection are related to one another in jointly driving colonies' susceptibility to disease. Here, we examine whether a relationship exists between individual worker survival after exposure to a fungal pathogen (a proxy for immunity) and corpse removal (a colony level social immunity metric) in the acorn ant Temnothorax curvispinosus. Since behavioural avoidance is the first line of defence against infection, we also tested whether individual ants exhibited parasite avoidance behaviour during exploration and whether colonies exhibit avoidance behaviour during foraging. We found that individual level and colony level immunity were negatively correlated: colonies that removed corpses more rapidly contained workers with weaker individual defences. We did not detect parasite avoidance behaviour by individual workers or whole colonies, nor were these two factors related. These data suggest that individual immunity and social immunity may trade off, regulating overall parasite protection. Alternatively, optimized social immunity at the colony level may compensate for disease vulnerability to infection at the individual level, and thus provide a protective benefit in overall colony defence in the absence of pathogen avoidance.

AB The manner in which vocal learning is used for social recognition may be sensitive to the social environment. Biological invaders capable of vocal learning are useful for testing this possibility, as invasion alters population size. Some vocal learning species use frequency modulation patterns of acoustic signals for individual recognition. In such species, frequency modulation patterns should be more complex in larger social groups, reflecting greater selection for individual distinctiveness. We used numbers of nests and nest densities as proxies of local population sizes of native range monk parakeets, Myiopsitta monachus, in Uruguay and invasive range populations in the United States. Flock sizes were obtained to estimate maximum social group sizes per range. Supervised machine learning and frequency contours were employed to compare contact call structure between native and invasive range populations, and the effect of urban habitats on call structure was also assessed. Invasive range populations exhibited fewer nests, lower nest densities and smaller maximum flock sizes, which is consistent with a reduction in population size following invasion. Parakeets at invasive range sites also produced contact calls with simpler frequency modulation patterns. Beecher's statistic (HS) revealed reduced individual identity content and fewer possible unique individual signatures in invasive range calls. Simpler individual signatures are consistent with relaxed selection on the complexity of learned calls likely used for individual vocal recognition in the smaller local populations that we identified post-invasion. Frequency modulation patterns were simpler in urban habitats in both ranges, indicating that urban habitats could also alter the social environment and in turn influence the complexity of learned individual signatures. These findings contribute to a growing literature on the use of vocal learning for individual recognition and indicate that vocal learning can be used to produce individual vocal signatures in a manner sensitive to local population size.

   CONSTRAINTS
AB The importance of nocturnal display in diurnal birds has been neglected for a long time, owing to the difficulties in recording behaviour by night. Using loggers with an accelerometer (ACC) we studied nocturnal display in male African houbara bustards, Chlamydotis undulata, ssp. fuertaventurae. Diurnal display of male houbaras consists of a visual component, the display run, and an acoustic component, the boom. Nocturnal display runs were only recorded twice, both on full moon nights. Nocturnal booming intensity was highest on full moon nights when it reached similar levels to those during peak diurnal display at dawn. The more favourable physical conditions for sound transmission and the reduced acoustic competition with wind and other birds at night have been proposed to explain nocturnal vocalizing. Minimizing copulation disruptions, a frequent intramale competition mechanism in bustards, could be an additional advantage of nocturnal display. However, these factors do not explain why vocal activity is highest on full moon nights. We suggest that moonlight may help displaying males to detect predators, as well as to communicate visually with approaching females. Moonlight also allows males to combine booms with visual signals produced by the white neck feathers exposed during booming into more efficient multimodal signals. Moonlight would thus ultimately lead to males achieving nocturnal copulations, which indeed might be more frequent than previously thought, according to rates of nocturnal ACC-recorded precopulatory movements. Finally, nocturnal booming sequences had almost twice as many booms as diurnal ones, which suggests that nocturnal vocalizations transmit higherquality information about signalling males than diurnal vocalizations. Nocturnal booming significantly increased the total display time of male houbara bustards; thus, future studies should investigate whether nocturnal vocal activity represents an important contribution to individual fitness in this and other nocturnally vocalizing diurnal species.

AB Animals compete in contests over limited resources, and contestants with greater fighting ability, or resource-holding potential (RHP), typically win contests. Contest strategies have evolved to balance contest costs with the benefit of winning resources. Sometimes, contestants decide to leave by estimating their opponent's relative RHP. This strategy (mutual assessment) is cost-effective because it allows weaker opponents to leave contests against formidable opponents before accruing higher costs. However, acquiring reliable information can be costly. Here, we showed that in snapping shrimp (Alpheus angulosus) contests, contestants assessed relative RHP quickly and cost-effectively by assessing their opponent's recent contest success. By staging 26 contests between randomly matched individuals and 24 contests between RHP-matched individuals, we determined that snapping shrimp assessed their opponent's RHP during initial contest phases but no longer assessed relative RHP during escalated phases. Then, after staging 24 contests between individuals with contest experience the day prior, we found that snapping shrimp integrated RHP and recent contest success to make contest decisions. This strategy facilitated fast and accurate judgments when the recent winner was also larger but often resulted in the larger individual retreating when facing a small recent winner. Notably, these systematic biases were corrected when RHP differences were stark. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that by assessing recent contest success early in a contest, snapping shrimp can avoid risky contests. Furthermore, by integrating recent contest success with direct observations of RHP, contestants avoid losing contests prematurely. Similar assessment strategies may be widespread, because they circumvent risky contests while minimizing premature defeats from weaker recent winners.

AB Environmental changes caused by urbanization and noise pollution can have profound effects on acoustic communication. Many organisms use higher sound frequencies in urban environments with low-frequency noise, but the developmental and evolutionary mechanisms underlying these shifts are generally unknown. We used a common garden experiment to ask whether changes in minimum song frequency observed 30 years after a songbird colonized an urban environment are a consequence of behavioural flexibility. We captured male juvenile dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis thurberi, from two populations (urban and mountain) soon after they reached independence (aged 25-40 days), raised them in identical indoor aviaries and studied their songs at an age of 3 years. We found that the large population difference in minimum frequency observed in the field persisted undiminished in the common garden despite the absence of noise. We also found some song sharing between the common garden and natal field populations, indicating that early song memorization before capture could contribute to the persistent song differences in adulthood. These results are the first to show that frequency shifts in urban birdsong are maintained in the absence of noise by genetic evolution and/or early life experiences.

AB Intra- and intersexual selection drives the evolution of secondary sexual traits, leading to increased body size, trait size and generally increased reproductive success in bearers with the largest, most attractive traits. Evolutionary change through natural selection is often thought of primarily in terms of genetic changes through mutations and adaptive selection. However, this view ignores the role of the plasticity in phenotypes and behaviour and its impact on accelerating or decelerating the expression of sexually selected traits. Here, we argue that sudden changes in selection pressures (e.g. predation pressure) may cause a cascade of behavioural responses, leading to a rapid change in the size of such traits. We propose that selective removal of individuals with the most prominent traits (such as large antlers or horns in male ungulates) induces behavioural changes in the surviving males, leading to a reduction in the growth of these traits (phenotypic expression). To test this idea, we used an individual-based simulation, parametrized with empirical data of male bighorn sheep, Ovis candensis. Our model shows that the expression (phenotype, not genotype) of the trait under selection (here horn size) can be negatively impacted, if the biggest, most dominant males in the population are removed. While the selective removal of prime males opens breeding opportunities for younger, smaller males, we predicted that it would come at the expense of growth and maintenance. As predicted, we observed a rapid decline in average male horn length in our model. We argue that this decline happens because smaller males, instead of allocating energy into growth, divert this energy towards participation in mating activities that are typically exclusively available to prime males. While our model deals with ecological life-history trade-offs, it cannot predict evolutionary outcomes. However, this nongenetic mechanism is important for the understanding of evolutionary processes because it describes how heritable traits can rapidly change because of behavioural plasticity, long before any genetic changes might be detectable.

AB Brood-parasitic cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other birds and thereafter abandon their young to the care of the host. Thus, all maternal investment is restricted to investment in the egg. Optimal investment at this stage is likely to have a large impact on maternal reproductive success. Many bird species optimize the size of their eggs to suit both the prevailing environmental conditions and the number of individuals that will provide care to the chicks. However, relatively few cues are available to avian brood parasites to facilitate optimal investment in their eggs. Moreover, optimization of egg size to suit environmental conditions or the social structure of the host group may be constrained by stronger selection for egg mimicry, which reduces the likelihood of detection and rejection of foreign eggs by the host. We aimed to test how the conflicting selection pressures of (1) selection for large eggs in harsh environmental conditions versus (2) rejection of large eggs by hosts interact to influence the size and shape of Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo, Chalcites basalis, eggs. Using a sliding window approach to investigate periods of climate sensitivity, we show that climatic variables did not predict egg size. Nor did cuckoos modify their egg size or shape in relation to the group size of the host (superb fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus). Conversely, host defences did appear to have influenced cuckoo egg morphology: eggs that were relatively short and round had a higher probability of being abandoned by the host than eggs that were long and narrow. This suggests that host defences are the overriding selection pressure on cuckoo egg morphology, and, unlike their hosts, cuckoos do not adapt their eggs to the prevailing climate or host group size.

AB Interindividual variation in cognitive ability has been widely reported across a diverse array of taxa and has recently been modelled as a broad consequence of a speed-accuracy trade-off. This trade-off can result in alternative cognitive phenotypes, which in turn could be associated with differences in behavioural and life history traits. While a growing body of literature suggests that performance in certain cognitive and behavioural traits do covary, multiple traits must be measured at these different levels to understand how differences in cognition determine variation in other traits. We tested for the presence of distinct cognitive phenotypes in the honey bee, Apis mellifera, by measuring multiple cognitive traits and determining whether these traits covary in a manner that can be used to define a cognitive axis. Our results indicate the presence of two distinct cognitive phenotypes that meet the predictions of the speed-accuracy trade-off such that fast bees are described by high associative learning, high preference for novelty and high preference for variance, compared to slow bees, and that these differences are consistent across colonies. We then determined whether there were functional differences between these two cognitive phenotypes by measuring their performance in several behavioural and life history traits. We found that fast bees also engaged in more nursing behaviour and transitioned to becoming foragers at an earlier age but we detected no difference in their social behaviour or survival. We discuss our results in terms of their possible implications for social behaviour and the pace-of-life hypothesis. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Anthropogenic noise is increasing in intensity and scope, raising concern over its effects on wildlife populations. Laboratory studies suggest that exposure to elevated noise can interfere with the development of a young animal's ability to process social signals and, ultimately, its ability to communicate as an adult. Whether such effects occur in nature is unknown, however. Here, we present the first field experiments examining whether elevated noise affects the development of the ability to discriminate the vocalizations of different conspecifics. We exposed nestling tree swallows to white noise during development, and then tested, in both quiet and noisy conditions, whether they could discriminate their parents' provisioning calls and their nestmates' begging calls from those of other individuals. We predicted that noise would interfere with discrimination, because previous work showed that it decreased nestling detection of adult calls, ostensibly an easier task. Instead, noise had no discernible effect on discrimination of parental and nestmate calls, even though it reduced overall responses to adult calls, as shown previously. While our results show no long-term disruptive effect of noise on development, they also show no adjustments to sustained noise that might help nestlings better cope with noisy conditions.

TI Konrad Lorenz on human degeneration and social decline: a chronic

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Review
DE human degeneration; Konrad Lorenz; social decline
ID ETHOLOGICAL THEORY
AB Throughout his career, Konrad Lorenz, co-founder of ethology, extrapolated from animal behaviour to humans - especially concerning degeneration as a result of domestication - and then prescribed for the allegedly resulting ills of society. The descriptions were constant. Lorenz had observed that wild animals subjected to and bred in captivity often underwent various abnormal physical and behavioural changes, such as changes in stature and coloration, and also in instinctive behaviour patterns - mating, eating, raising young, and so on. He went on to posit that the same sorts of 'degeneration' of human individuals were due to overcrowding, race mixing, poor nutrition, overbreeding, etc. - any kind of human society being equated with captivity - and claimed that faults in human society arose from these sorts of individual degeneration effects. Then, of course, as a physician, he prescribed for how society might be cured. Since he came to scientific prominence during the Nazi era, there have been constant criticisms and accusations that Lorenz must have been a Nazi and that Nazi ideology underlay many of his ideas about humanity and ethology. The thesis of this paper is that Lorenz had accepted the truth of human degeneration and social decline before the rise of Nazism. While he adopted Nazi-type terminology, prescriptions and arguments during the early stages of his career (which coincided with the rise and fall of the Third Reich), he dropped them as soon as the end of World War II rendered them unacceptable. Thereafter Lorenz retained the belief in human degeneration and social decline, but chose other arguments and prescriptions based in part on popular theories of the day, e.g. capitalism, and later ecology.

AB Early life experience may have lifelong influences on an individual's behaviour in ways that are either adaptive or maladaptive depending in part on whether these early experiences accurately foreshadowed conditions in later life. Stress coping style is one example of a suite of behaviours, or personality traits, that may be influenced by early exposure to stressful stimuli. Here we examine the effect of developmental stress exposure on behavioural syndromes in adult convict cichlids, Amatitlania nigrofasciata. We found that early life stress did not exert significant effects on personality traits in adulthood at the individual level, but that this stress exposure prevented the formation of an exploration-boldness syndrome that was present in the unstressed population. These results suggest that an exploration -boldness syndrome is present in this species in the absence of stress-related environmental constraints. However, greater plasticity may be selected for in response to early life cues that reflect high predator pressure. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Predicting patterns of variation in sexual traits requires understanding how developmental environments influence mate choice. Here, we studied how long-term perceived high predation risk affects mutual mate choice in the cichlid Pelvicachromis taeniatus. From hatching onwards, fish were exposed regularly to either conspecific alarm cues signalling high risk or a control treatment consisting of exposure to water. Alarm cue-exposed and control adult fish were then offered the dichotomous choice between opposite-sex fish from different treatment groups. Under chronic predation risk, lower investment in mate choice and assortative preferences for mates from the same environment may be optimal. As predicted, alarm cue-exposed males assessed potential mates less than controls whereas females did not. Mate preferences differed as well but were independent of sex. While alarm cue-exposed fish were unselective, against expectations, control fish displayed disassortative preferences for alarm cue-exposed fish.

AB Snowshoe hares, Lepus americanus, are the dominant prey species in the boreal forest and they undergo regular, predator-driven population cycles every 8-11 years. Previous research has found that hare stress physiology is highly sensitive to both within-year (seasonal/litter group) and across-year (cycle phase) variation in predation risk and that maternal-offspring stress profiles are tightly correlated. Thus, both pre-and postnatal environments may interact to shape offspring physiological phenotype. If changes in the function and reactivity of the maternal stress axis are associated with variation in offspring behaviours that increase survival during periods of high predation risk, then the maternal effects on offspring physiology seen previously could represent a mechanistic route of adaptive maternal programming. To examine the relationship between physiology and behaviour in snowshoe hares, we monitored free-ranging adult and juvenile stress hormone levels in the first and second litters of the breeding season and assessed open field exploratory behaviour in weaning-age and independent juveniles in the southwestern Yukon (Canada) during 2013-2015, when predator density was low but increasing. Thus, our study spanned the late low phase (2013) and the early increase phase (2014-2015) of the hare population cycle. We found that increased concentrations of faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) were associated with aspects of risk avoidance in weaning-age hares. Juveniles with higher stress hormone levels spent more time under cover and were less active during open field trials, highlighting a potential mechanistic route to allow individuals to sensitively cope with a changing environment. Although average FCM levels of breeding females and juveniles were not correlated with one another and litter-based differences in physiology and behaviour were not present during these low-risk phases of the cycle, the association between stress hormone levels and behaviour sets the stage for adaptive maternal effects on offspring behaviour and survival as the cycle progresses and predation risk intensifies.

AB Male same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB), where males court or attempt to mate with other males, is common among animal taxa. Recent studies have examined its fitness costs and benefits in attempts to understand its evolutionary maintenance, but the evolutionary consequences of SSB are less commonly considered. One potential impact of SSB might be to facilitate the evolution of traits associated with less sexually dimorphic males, such as alternative reproductive tactics, by diverting costly aggression from other males. To test this, we capitalized on the recent rapid spread of a silent male morph of the field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, which is unable to produce characteristic male acoustic signals, benefits from satellite mating behaviour and has feminized appearance and cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. We tested the prediction that interactions involving these nonsignalling, less sexually dimorphic male morphs would show heightened rates of SSB, which could reduce the strength of male-male competition and permit greater access to females. We found no evidence that SSB was more common in trials involving silent males. Instead, SSB was predicted by courtship of females presented during a pretrial treatment. Our results provide evidence supporting the view that SSB represents a spillover of sexually selected courtship behaviour in a nonadaptive context, but do not support a strong role for SSB in the evolution of less ornamented males in this system.

AB Due to the difficulty of simultaneously assessing variation in individual physiology, behaviour and fitness, we often know little about the mechanistic basis of life-history trade-offs and fitness variation. It is similarly challenging to examine how physiological variation in one individual has cascading fitness consequences for others in the social environment. Using a wild-living fish (ocellated wrasse, Symphodus ocellatus), we manipulated a neuropeptide pathway associated with courtship, aggression and parental care in vertebrates (arginine vasotocin, AVT) and directly examined the behavioural and fitness consequences. Nesting males injected with the AVT antagonist increased their paternal care, resulting in increased hatching of offspring and increased reproductive success of all individuals that mated at his nest. By directly examining physiology, behaviour and reproductive success, we revealed how a small change in individual physiology has clear and direct fitness consequences for multiple individuals.

AB Turbidity reduces the distance that animals can detect food, predators and conspecifics. How turbidity affects decision making in social contexts has rarely been investigated; moreover, it is unknown whether decreased shoaling in turbid water is due to visual constraints (a mechanistic explanation) or a reduced perception of predation risk (an adaptive explanation). Using a V-shaped decision-making arena, we investigated the effect of turbidity on foraging in groups of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. In turbid conditions, fish took longer to leave a refuge and locate the food in one of the arms and consumed less food once it was found. This increase in risk-averse behaviour was further supported by improved accuracy over repeated trials and a speed-accuracy trade-off only being observed in turbid conditions. Despite evidence of a higher perception of risk in turbid water, the first fish to choose an arm of the maze was more likely to be alone in turbid water; thus, this individual lost the antipredator and decision-making benefits of collective behaviour. This suggests that turbidity acts mechanistically as a visual constraint, shifting decisions away from being made collectively to being made by individuals separated from the group, which could have potential impacts for wild prey populations.

AB Both intentionally and unintentionally introduced populations vary greatly in their ability to succeed as invasive species. What causes this extreme variability in success largely remains controversial. Understanding the extent to which these differences are due to aspects of the invasive process could lead to better mitigation of invasive species. We investigated the effect of the invasive process in selecting for individual behaviours and behavioural syndromes in the Xiphophorus helleri-maculatus hybrid, an intentionally introduced fish species. We measured three behaviours (boldness, aggression and exploration) known to play a role in invasive success across three populations representing different stages of invasion: fish from commercial breeding pools, from pet stores and from an established invasive population in Hawaii. We detected significant differences in boldness across populations, with a significant decrease from the breeding pool to the pet store and a significant increase from the pet store to the established invasive population. In addition, we detected behavioural syndromes between either two or all three behaviours that were significantly different across populations. Overall variation in behaviours was similar between breeding pool and pet store fish but appeared to decrease in the invasive population when compared to the pet store population, potentially leading to a more defined behavioural syndrome between exploration and aggression. Our results suggest that while aspects of the invasive process influenced boldness and behavioural syndromes, the increased variation, produced either through hybridization or relaxed selection in the pet trade, is at least partly responsible for the success of X. helleri-maculatus as an invasive species. Additional studies are needed to examine the source of the variation in the pet trade and its influence on the formation of behavioural syndromes in invasive populations.

AB When there is sexual conflict over mating rates, males should develop persistence to increase their mating rate, whereas females are expected to evolve resistance to keep mating at a lower rate. In the beetle Lasioderma serricorne, female remating occurs as a result of male persistence, and there is conflict between the sexes over mating rates. However, there is little information on female resistance to the persistence of males. We found that female relocation behaviours were increased by mating experience, but this change in behaviour was not observed in males. Females were also more likely to relocate in the presence of males. To investigate whether the purpose of this change in behaviour is to enable females to avoid males, we assessed how female fitness components changed in relation to two treatments (easy and difficult avoidance). The female remating rate was lower when avoidance was easy, but no difference was observed in the mating rate. In the easy avoidance treatment, we found no difference in fecundity or longevity between females that rejected remating and those that mated only once, while life span was reduced by acceptance of remating. These results indicate that females that rejected remating successfully avoided the harm caused by males by increasing their relocation behaviour. In the difficult avoidance treatment, life span was reduced, irrespective of whether remating was accepted or rejected. In this situation, because they had less opportunity to avoid remating, females might have been more exposed to a second male and thus suffered from harmful persistence. Our results suggest that changes in behaviour after mating are a result of counteradaptation to male persistence because this prevents a decrease in female fitness (female life span) and an increase in male fitness (mating success) in L. serricorne.

AB Organisms should aim to time their reproduction to match the optimal ecological conditions and thus maximize their fitness. However, social cues have been identified as determinants of reproductive decisions and might also be involved in coordinating the timing of reproduction. Breeding synchronously with other individuals can bring several advantages, including a reduced individual predation risk and an increased opportunity for social foraging. The behavioural mechanisms underlying reproductive synchrony are versatile and not well understood, particularly in species inhabiting unpredictable environments. In contrast to highly seasonal environments, more variable and unpredictable environments can support periods of extended breeding with lower levels of synchronous breeding overall, but opportunities for individuals to breed synchronously at a finer temporal and spatial scale. Zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, are a highly social species, naturally inhabiting the ecologically unpredictable arid zone of Australia. In the wild, reproduction at a broad population level is not highly synchronized and, at any time during a period of breeding activity, reproductive attempts can be found at different stages. However, previous work has suggested that at a finer spatial scale neighbours tend to breed at approximately the same time. Using nestboxes, we tested whether wild zebra finches preferentially seek to settle and initiate a breeding attempt adjacent to conspecifics at an early stage of breeding (nest building), as opposed to others at later stages of breeding and with which the opportunity to breed synchronously was reduced or absent. Pairs were more likely to initiate egg laying in nestboxes close to conspecifics at an early stage of breeding, suggesting that they do try to maximize the level of synchronicity with neighbours. Our results indicate the importance of social effects on both the phenology and spatial distribution of breeding. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many lekking systems exhibit highly skewed male reproductive success, but traits preferred by females are not always evident. In the lance-tailed manakin, Chiroxiphia lanceolata, male reproductive success is correlated with age, experience and heterozygosity, but mechanisms by which females might detect these qualities are unknown. Avian chemical signals, such as volatile compounds present in preen oil secreted by the uropygial gland, have been shown to predict reproductive success, correlate with genetic diversity and indicate body condition and immune function in temperate passerines. Here we tested whether preen oil volatile compounds contain information about individual characteristics related to mate choice in male and female lance-tailed manakins, including social and breeding status, heterozy-gosity and age. In males, preen oil volatile profiles reflected heterozygosity but not social status or age. In females, we found a relationship between volatile profiles and age but not breeding status or hetero-zygosity. Volatile compounds covaried with sampling date in both sexes. The information reflected in manakin volatile profiles suggests that they have the potential to serve as mate assessment cues in this species.

AB In the face of anthropogenic change, we require a better understanding of how adaptive behavioural changes emerge from the interaction between personality and phenotypic plasticity, to be able to predict population persistence. Predation is an important context where this interaction occurs. Sampling wild fish populations revealed that boldness is size dependent in habitats with low predation risk but not in high predation habitats. This is predicted to occur due to a trade-off between a prey's metabolic demand, as per the metabolic hypothesis (smaller fish have higher metabolic requirements and thus need to be bolder) and their risk of predation, as per the predation risk hypothesis (smaller fish are subject to higher predation risk and should thus be shyer). However, since selective predation on specific individuals, age effects or the extent of direct experience with predators were not controlled for in these studies, the role of body size in modulating boldness remains unclear. Here, we tested the relationship between body size, boldness and predation risk in a widespread North American prey fish, the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas. From hatching onwards, we manipulated perceived risk by exposing minnows to either conspecific alarm cues (indicative of predation risk) or distilled water in a split-clutch design. When fish were 4 months old, we measured body size and determined boldness using an emergence assay. Different levels of perceived predation risk did not directly affect body size or general boldness in fathead minnows. However, as predicted by the metabolic and predation risk hypotheses, high perceived predation risk cancelled out the negative correlation between boldness and body size present in controls through phenotypic plasticity. This effect was independent of selective predation, direct experience with predators and age. By adjusting personality through phenotypic plasticity, perceived predation risk alone may thus be sufficient for individuals to maximize their fitness in high-risk habitats.

AB Females in diverse vertebrate and invertebrate clades often mate and produce offspring with multiple male partners. Deciphering the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the origins of females producing offspring with multiple sires remains a challenging problem, because a single male can usually provide enough sperm to fertilize all eggs produced by individual females. We tested the hypothesis that having multiple males sire individual clutches is adaptive for female eastern collared lizards, Crotaphytus collaris, by examining both the fitness costs and benefits for females of producing offspring with one versus multiple male partners. We found no support for the hypothesis that females produce offspring with multiple sires to acquire access to higher-quality food resources or refuges. However, hatching success of clutches increased with the number of males that inseminated eggs, which suggests that accepting sperm from multiple males may improve offspring hatching success through one or more mechanisms. Our results also indicate that females producing offspring with multiple male partners gained genetic advantages. Although offspring mortality from clutches sired by one versus multiple males was similar, females producing clutches sired by multiple males had more total offspring that survived to maturity, resulting in a net fitness advantage for these females. Our results suggest that producing offspring with multiple males is adaptive for female collared lizards because it promotes acquisition of several fitness benefits.

AB Mutual (simultaneous) grooming occurs in a variety of mammals and is characterized by a distinct payoff structure compared to unidirectional grooming, as in mutual (but not in unidirectional) grooming both partners simultaneously get the benefits of the receipt of grooming. Mutual grooming, however, has been very little investigated. We studied a captive group of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, to test the hypothesis that mutual grooming functions to prolong grooming received. Lemurs were more likely to initiate grooming when they were being groomed than when they were simply approached by a group mate. They were also less likely to terminate grooming if their partner was simultaneously grooming them. These results support the hypothesis that mutual grooming represents a form of immediate repayment of cooperation received that facilitates further investment by the partner. It remains to be ascertained how natural selection may favour mutual over unidirectional grooming in different social and ecological conditions.

AB Animals are equipped with sophisticated guidance systems that enable them to navigate efficiently. Previous studies suggest that foraging animals such as desert ants tend to combine guidance systems in a weighted manner, where the weight given to each cue gradually changes during the approach to the goal. However, when subjected to rapid enforced decision making (e.g. under predation risk), the animal may use alternative mechanisms, as recently suggested for ecologically relevant decisions involving time constraints in humans. We show here that fiddler crabs, Uca perplexa, scuttling to their burrows when threatened, responded to visual cues only if their path integration (PI) systems indicated nearness to their burrows. When homing errors were imposed by placing fake entrances (visual cues) along their homing paths and masking their true burrows (the goal of PI), the threatened crabs altered their behaviour towards visual cues according to the remaining PI vector length; if it was long, they continued running until they arrived at the masked true burrow, ignoring the visual cue, but if it was short, they suddenly stopped at the fake entrance. Our results suggest that, for fiddler crabs, PI and the view are mutually exclusive cues and that they instantly shift from one to the other if they approach the end of the home vector, instead of combining systems in a weighted manner. This could enable them to avoid entering the wrong burrow, where they would be ejected by the resident crab and be subject to predation. (c) 2018 The Authors.

AB According to theory, individuals forage in ways that maximize net energy intake. Distinct foraging strategies may emerge within a population in response to heterogeneous resources, competition and learning, among other drivers. We assessed individual variation in, and ecological consequences of, an unusual, specialized foraging tactic between animals and humans. In southern Brazil, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, herd fish schools towards artisanal fishermen, who cast nets in response to behavioural cues from the dolphins. This apparent cooperative tactic likely involves costs as well as benefits for both interacting parties, but such trade-offs remain poorly understood, especially for dolphins. We show that individual dolphins vary markedly in the frequency with which they interact with fishermen, and that this foraging variation is linked to ranging behaviour. Not all individual dolphins interact with fishermen; those that routinely do so concentrate around the limited interaction sites and have smaller home ranges than independent foragers. This suggests that foraging with fishermen increases foraging success and reduces search costs (i.e. foraging range). Competition for interaction sites may offset such benefits, since some individuals often forage at the high-quality sites while others forage at low-quality sites. Taken together, our findings suggest that two alternative tactics emerge in the population from trade-offs involving food access, foraging area, learning techniques and competition: dolphins either forage by themselves over larger areas on unpredictable resource patches (passing fish schools), or learn to interact with fishermen to access and compete for more predictable resource patches (interaction sites). By revealing some of the ecological drivers of this remarkable human-animal interaction, our study contributes two broader insights. First, specialized foraging can have ranging consequences for individuals and so structure the population spatially; second, interspecific cooperation may be founded upon intraspecific competition.

AB Numerous studies have shown that dyadic fights are regularly disrupted by the intervention of third-party group members. Empirical and theoretical attention with respect to these interventions have focused predominantly on the fitness advantages that accrue to the intervening individual; conversely, little attention has been given to studying the fitness implications of suffering from third-party intervention behaviour. Therefore, we investigated this issue by examining the relationship between variation in individual mating success and suffering third-party interventions during a fallow deer, Dama dama, rut. Mating success was analysed using a 'hurdle' model against three explanatory variables: daily variation in suffering an intervention, dominance rank and fight rate. The lower, logistic level of the model indicated a negative interaction between variation in suffering an intervention and fight rate in relation to whether a mating was achieved or not. Further investigation of this interaction showed that the proportion of matings achieved by males declined as interventions suffered increased regardless of whether males had a high (five or more fights per day) investment in fighting. There was no meaningful effect observed in the upper level of the model. We also investigated whether there was evidence for a temporal association between suffering interventions and mating success: two models investigated interventions suffered on a previous day and the cumulative sum of interventions suffered over 2 days in relation to mating success. Neither model showed a meaningful association at the lower or upper level indicating that the effects of intervention behaviour are temporally limited in this population. Our results underline the complex nature of the relationships at play during third-party interventions in relation to mating success. We suggest that there is a need for greater empirical investigation and wider theoretical scrutiny with respect to suffering intervention. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal weaponry has long captured the imagination of researchers and these weapons are frequently exaggerated in size. Large weapons are particularly common in species in which males defend females from potential rivals and sexual selection is generally credited with driving this pattern of exaggeration. Male New Zealand sheet-web spiders, Cambridgea foliata (Araneae: Desidae), possess chelicerae (jaws) that are substantially larger than those of female conspecifics. To investigate whether chelicerae exaggeration is selected for in the context of male-male competition, we staged contests between males and analysed how different components of resource-holding potential influenced the outcomes and durations of contests. We found that while males with large chelicerae were more likely to win contests, body condition and body size were better predictors of contest outcome. While contest durations were highly variable, there is some evidence that males make decisions about when to retreat from contests using self-assessment. As a result, only very large males are likely to reach the most escalated phase of fighting in which they lock chelicerae with their opponent. In this way, regardless of whether extra-long chelicerae impart any advantage over similarly sized opponents, exaggerated chelicerae are only used by especially large males and are therefore of little use to small males.

AB Recent studies have shown that several species within the Carnivore order show impressive cognitive skills. However, bears, especially sloth bears, have received little attention with regard to their cognitive abilities. Here we presented seven sloth bears with three tasks to test their object permanence, short-term memory and ability to use acoustic cues to infer food location. In the object permanence test, subjects saw an object disappear in one of the three holes of a tree trunk. Bears retrieved the food in the correct hole significantly above chance, suggesting that they have some basic understanding that objects continue to exist even when they are not visible. To study sloth bears' short-term memory, we used different time delays (30 s, 60 s, 2 min) between the object's disappearance and the subject's retrieval. Bears performed at chance levels in all conditions. In the acoustic cues test, the experimenter shook one of two identical opaque containers, only one of which had been baited: when the baited container was shaken, this made a noise and thus revealed the presence of food inside; when the unbaited container was shaken, there was no noise, revealing by exclusion the presence of food in the other container. In both cases, bears selected the baited container significantly above chance. As sloth bears are a mainly insectivorous solitary species, good performance in the object permanence and acoustic cue tests suggests that their cognitive skills may be the result of foraging challenges rather than social ones. Failure in the short-term memory test, instead, may suggest that memory for short-term punctual events has little evolutionary significance for bears, although further studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions.

AB Many bats form colonies and undergo nightly emergence in dense, fast-moving streams. Although the flight mechanics of individual bats have been well studied, the effect of flying in a group has not been studied with large aggregations under natural conditions. We tested the hypothesis that group size affects flight mechanics and behaviour in Brazilian free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis. We measured the flight path, flight path time and wing beat rate of individual bats by analysing videos of bats in flight and compared values across different flight group sizes. Flight path, flight speed and wing beat rate of individual bats were all unaffected by group size. Additionally, bats maintained a constant wing beat rate regardless of flight speed. These results suggest that Brazilian free-tailed bats experience neither an aerodynamic benefit nor a cost to travelling in groups. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal migration is receiving increasing research attention through ever more sophisticated tracking technologies, but the difficulty of trapping nonbreeding floaters has prevented comprehensive tracking studies of how migration varies in young breeders and floaters and whether this has consequences for recruitment (i.e. the transition from floating to breeding). To fill this gap, we satellite-GPS tracked young black kites, Milvus migrans, which start to breed when 1-7 years old. In the prebreeding migration, floaters departed and arrived later than breeders, travelled faster with fewer days at stopovers, as if in a hurry, and suffered more from cross-winds. Survival, recruitment, the territory quality and offspring production of the first reproductive attempt, as well as eventual longevity, declined rapidly with small departure delays. The high payoffs for small gains in timing set young kites on a race for early arrival: individuals improved their departure through early life and late migrants were progressively removed from the population or lingered as old floaters. As a result, individual improvements and selective mortality caused each cohort to progressively split after 3 years of age between a vanishing tail of late floaters and a body of early travelling individuals that then shaped the migratory traits of the adult population. Thus, migration in early life acted as a demographic bottleneck that filtered the transition to the next stage of the life cycle through a carryover effect that linked events operating on different continents.

AB Increasing evidence suggests that key fitness-related behaviours of animals related to courtship and mating may be disrupted by anthropogenic stressors, including artificial light at night (i. e. light produced from anthropogenic sources). Despite its ubiquity in urban habitats, we currently know very little about how artificial night lighting affects the reproductive behaviours of most animals. Our study examined the effects of chronic (lifetime) exposure to one of four ecologically relevant intensities of artificial light at night (0, 1, 10 or 100 lx at night) on courtship and mating behaviours and acoustic sexual signalling in a common nocturnal and crepuscular insect, the Australian black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus. We found that lifetime exposure to brighter (10-100 lx) artificial light at night affected some aspects of courtship and mating behaviour: it influenced mate choice and mating efficiency in a sex-specific manner, but did not affect the multivariate structure of male courtship calls. Our results suggest that chronic exposure to bright light at night may affect some aspects of mate choice and reproductive behaviour in this common insect, and warrants further study across taxa.

AB Developmental plasticity is a key feature of many organisms and individuals can benefit from early programming to optimize their phenotypes for the expected environmental conditions. However, environmental conditions may sometimes change unexpectedly. Mismatches between early and adult life, for example, can have important repercussions for adult phenotypes, potentially leading to better performance under matched than mismatched conditions as predicted by the predictive adaptive response hypothesis. We conducted a long-term experimental manipulation of dietary conditions in a population of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Broods were exposed to two early nutritional treatments until independence and we used a split-brood design to independently manipulate nutritional conditions after independence to create matched and mismatched nutritional environments in later life. Developmental trajectories of all individuals were followed for more than 5 years and we scored behavioural responses in trials in a special environment and while interacting with a special object three times during adult life. Overall, we found no evidence for early programming affecting morphology. Tarsus and wing length were exclusively influenced by the early nutrition. Body weight showed lasting effects of the early treatment and independent effects of nutritional condition during adulthood, but no effects of environmental matching or mismatching. Special-object trials showed effects of the adult nutritional treatment while environmental matching affected hopping activity in special environments. These behavioural responses showed substantial long-term individual stability over a 3-month period and were only marginally smaller when measured over a period of more than 4 years. Interestingly, survival of individuals from low-quality early nutritional condition was higher compared with highquality early condition individuals, which became evident only after years of survival monitoring. Beyond the nutritional treatment itself, we found sizable brood identity effects that slowly but steadily declined with age, indicating a significant but decaying effect of natural variation in parental provisioning on adult phenotypes.

AB Individuals often modify their behaviour in response to environmental cues and their own condition. Here we asked whether males modify ejaculates based on information from the sociosexual environment and their physiological age, and how those two factors may interact. We used two populations of the chorusing bushcricket, Ephippiger diurnus, to test whether males strategically adjust large, costly spermatophores they transfer to females during mating based on experience of rivals' calls, and whether males change their investment strategies with age. Males broadcast highly consistent, rhythmically repeated calls of syllables in daily choruses. Populations differ in average syllable number, an important trait under selection via female preference, and females from our two populations prefer calls with more syllables than the population mean. We reared males in one of five acoustic environments that varied in call syllable number. We then mated males twice, as young and old adults, measuring spermatophore size each time. We found that acoustic experience, age and their interaction all significantly influenced male investment, resulting in reaction norms with different slopes. Young males differentially invested in spermatophores in response to acoustic experience, whereas old males generally invested in larger spermatophores across environments. We then tested for a broad pattern of age-related investment with eight different field-collected populations, finding the majority of old males significantly increased spermatophore investment. Our findings demonstrate that both environmental context and an individual's life history state influence plasticity in reproductive investment, and such adjustments may optimize their reproductive success.

AB Efficient navigation is a critical component of fitness for most animals. While most species use a combination of allocentric (external) and egocentric (internal) cues to navigate through their environment, subterranean environments present a unique challenge in that visually mediated allocentric cues are unavailable. The relationship between egocentric spatial cognition and species differences in ecology is surprisingly understudied. We used a maze-learning task to test for differences in egocentric navigation between two closely related species of mice, the eastern house mouse, Mus musculus musculus, and the mound-building mouse, Mus spicilegus. The two species are sympatric in Eastern Europe and overlap in summer habitat use but differ dramatically in winter space use: whereas house mice occupy anthropogenic structures, mound-building mice survive the winter underground in intricate burrow systems. Given species differences in burrowing ecology, we predicted that M. spicilegus would learn the maze significantly faster than M. m. musculus when tested in complete darkness, a condition that eliminated allocentric spatial information and served as a proxy for the subterranean environment. We found strong support for this prediction. In contrast, the two species performed equally well when different mice were tested in the same maze with lights on. This context-specific species difference in spatial cognition suggests that enhanced egocentric navigation in M. spicilegus is an adaptation to the burrow systems on which the overwinter survival of young mound-building mice depends. The results of this study highlight the importance of ecological adaptations to the evolution of cognitive traits. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In social species individuals living in the same group may synchronize activities such as movements, foraging or antipredator vigilance. Synchronization of activities can also be observed between partners especially during breeding and can be crucial for breeding success. Vocalizations are behaviours that can be coordinated between individuals, but simultaneous vocalizations in groups have mostly been considered as noise that does not bear any information. Indeed, little is known about the structure and function of vocal communications involving a network of individuals. How individual vocal activity forms part of the communal sound and how the group influences individual vocal activity are questions that remain to be studied. Zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, are social, monogamous songbirds that form lifelong pair bonds. In the wild, they are typically found in small groups, with the pair as the primary social unit, and they gather in 'social' trees where both females and males produce vocalizations. Here we investigated in the laboratory the influence of group size and composition on general vocal activity and synchrony, as well as the influence of pair bond and spatial location on the finer characteristics of dyads' vocal interactions. We used a set-up that locked the birds at fixed spatial positions of our choosing to control the proximity network and allowed us to match most of the vocalizations with specific individuals. We used an in-house software suite that automatically detects vocalizations from hours of passive recording. We found that zebra finch groups synchronized their general vocal activity with waves of collective vocalizations, which depended on both the size and the composition of the group. The acoustic network was shaped by pair bonds at different timescales. Birds preferentially vocalized close in time to (synchrony) or directly after (turn taking) their partner when it was present and the nearest neighbour when the partner was not available.

AB An animal's metabolism changes throughout development, obliging the animal to coordinate its feeding behaviour with its stage-specific nutritional requirements. Previous studies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster showed that the developmental transition known as critical weight alters the response to nutrition in larvae; starvation reduces survival and dramatically delays development in precritical weight larvae, whereas it has more moderate effects on survival and accelerates development in postcritical weight larvae. We thus hypothesized that this change in sensitivity to nutrition might result in differences in feeding behaviour between the two stages. Using both no-choice and two-choice assays, we found that pre- and postcritical weight larvae had similar strategies for macronutrient balancing, both regulating protein intake at the cost of under- or overconsuming carbohydrates. Despite these similarities, precritical weight larvae regulated protein intake within more narrow limits than postcritical weight larvae. In addition, the larvae showed significant differences in the way they regulated macronutrient intake in the presence of bitter, potentially noxious compounds. Whereas precritical weight larvae avoided bitter food and showed only mild deficiencies in protein intake, postcritical weight larvae responded to these compounds by consuming less. When larvae were forced to choose between a higher quality diet tainted with quinine or caffeine and a lower quality diet containing less protein, larvae of both stages showed similar avoidance strategies but precritical weight larvae maintained a more constant protein intake than their postcritical weight siblings. Together, our results show that the developmental transition at critical weight modifies larval feeding behaviour, increasing our understanding of how developmental processes influence behaviour.

AB Prospecting for a future breeding site may help individuals decide whether to disperse and where to settle. However, little is known about it because of methodological constraints limiting the acquisition of data at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, especially for individuals that have failed breeding. Using recently developed solar-powered GPS-UHF not requiring the recapture of individuals, we tracked failed breeding black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla, nesting in a failed subcolony of a large Norwegian colony from the end of incubation and across the chick-rearing period. As predicted, their movement patterns differed significantly from those of successfully breeding birds tracked simultaneously in a nearby successful subcolony. After 1 week of tracking, all failed breeders rapidly abandoned their nesting cliff and males and females simultaneously increased prospecting visits to other parts of their nesting colony and to neighbouring kittiwake colonies situated 40-50 km away. Conversely, none of the successful breeders prospected over the same period. Our results provide new insights on prospecting movements linked to potential dispersal decisions after breeding failure. They suggest that males and females have similar temporal but different spatial prospecting patterns, possibly due to different costs associated with prospecting and dispersal decisions. They also highlight the need to track more comprehensively the movements linked with breeding habitat selection and dispersal in contrasting environmental conditions to better understand the complex behavioural responses of individuals to breeding failure and their consequences for the spatial dynamics of populations.

AB Pair bonds are the cornerstone of a monogamous relationship. When individuals of the same species engage in monogamy and promiscuity (i.e. alternative reproductive tactics) it can be difficult to determine which tactic confers greater fitness, as measures of fitness can be difficult to ascertain. However, in these circumstances, whether animals preferentially establish pair bonds can reveal decisions that presumably reflect the animals' assessment of how to best maximize reproductive success. In nature, the majority of prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, establishes pair bonds and engages in social monogamy while a minority of individuals remains single and presumably mates promiscuously. The existence of these two tactics raises the interesting question: do bonded male prairie voles choose to 'settle' (for just one partner) or are they preferentially 'settling down'? To determine which of these two tactics is preferred, we provided single male prairie voles simultaneous access to two sexually receptive females for 24 h and then subsequently tested males in 'partner preference tests' with each female independently contrasted with a novel female. We aimed to determine whether males would form a pair bond with one, both or none of the original females. We found that males formed pair bonds with one of the two females. We also investigated male- and female-initiated aggression and found that during the bonding process males were more aggressive with females that they did not ultimately form a bond with. In the partner preference tests, males showed more aggression towards unfamiliar females than towards familiar females. Mismatches in male- and female- initiated aggression suggest that aggressive interactions may be perpetuated more by males than by females. Taken together, our results demonstrate that under conditions that are ideal for forgoing bonding and engaging in multiple matings, males choose to establish a pair bond, suggesting that selective pressures may have facilitated bonding by males.

AB Dominance hierarchies characterize social groups of various species and can significantly influence individual fitness. Personality traits, consistent behavioural differences between individuals, have been proposed to influence individuals' social status. However, few studies so far have investigated the link between personality traits and dominance in groups of animals in the wild. Here, we investigated the relationship between three personality traits hypothesized to be linked to the proactive-reactive axis (i.e. exploration, activity and object neophilia) and dominance in wild groups of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, a resident passerine bird that overwinters in flocks characterized by linear dominance hierarchies. We predicted that if dominance is linked to personality within these social groups, dominant individuals should be more exploratory, active and neophilic than subordinates. Dominance relationships in our groups of black-capped chickadees were highly transitive and asymmetric, which is typical of linear hierarchies. However, none of the personality traits were significantly correlated with dominance, and there was no evidence that they correlated as part of a syndrome. These results suggest that proactive-reactive personality traits do not contribute to the establishment of black-capped chickadee hierarchies in the wild. We discuss the growing body of evidence suggesting that individual attributes are not sufficient to explain the linearity of many dominance hierarchies found in nature.

AB The concept of behavioural syndromes (i.e. correlations between behavioural traits) has provided an important framework for understanding individual variation in animal behaviour and its link to individual variation in physiology and life-history traits. The pace-of-life syndrome concept posits that behavioural, physiological and life-history traits coevolve in response to correlated selection pressures, and therefore predicts a positive correlation between boldness (i.e. exploration and risk taking) and metabolic capacity for locomotor performance in individuals. We tested for a pace-of-life syndrome linking boldness and metabolic capacity for locomotor activity in juvenile bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus. Individual fish were screened and classified as bold or shy using an established refuge emergence test. Subsequently, the aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms of bold and shy individuals were quantified using respirometry and by measuring the metabolic by-products of white muscle anaerobic glycolysis following exhaustive exercise, respectively. Bold fish demonstrated 25% greater metabolic scope for activity (i.e. aerobic capacity) than shy fish, which was attributable to a 15% greater maximum metabolic rate. However, there was no significant difference in resting metabolic rate or anaerobic energy expenditure (i.e. anaerobic capacity) between bold and shy fish. These results partially support a pace-of-life syndrome linking boldness and aerobic metabolism in juvenile bluegill sunfish, but did not reveal a link between boldness and anaerobic metabolism. Our findings suggest that aerobic and anaerobic capacities may be subject to different selection pressures, and that physiological processes governing maximum anaerobic performance in fishes are independent from behavioural and physiological traits related to boldness.

AB The impacts of human activities on the natural world are becoming increasingly apparent, with rapid development and exploitation occurring at the expense of habitat quality and biodiversity. Declines are especially concerning in the oceans, which hold intrinsic value due to their biological uniqueness as well as their substantial sociological and economic importance. Here, we review the literature and investigate whether incorporation of knowledge from the fields of animal behaviour and behavioural ecology may improve the effectiveness of conservation initiatives in marine systems. In particular, we consider (1) how knowledge of larval behaviour and ecology may be used to inform the design of marine protected areas, (2) how protecting species that hold specific ecological niches may be of particular importance for maximizing the preservation of biodiversity, (3) how current harvesting techniques may be inadvertently skewing the behavioural phenotypes of stock populations and whether changes to current practices may lessen this skew and reinforce population persistence, and (4) how understanding the behavioural and physiological responses of species to a changing environment may provide essential insights into areas of particular vulnerability for prioritized conservation attention. The complex nature of conservation programmes inherently results in interdisciplinary responses, and the incorporation of knowledge from the fields of animal behaviour and behavioural ecology may increase our ability to stem the loss of biodiversity in marine environments.

AB Complex behaviour may incur a cost. We assumed here that web-building behaviour for two species of orb-web spider, Cyclosa argenteoalba and Eriophora sagana, was more complex when their webs were asymmetric from top to bottom than when their webs were symmetric. The rationale for this assumption was that, while spiders have to adjust their spiral building behaviour in different web sectors to build asymmetric webs, they do not have to make these adjustments for symmetric webs. To estimate the costs involved in building more asymmetric webs, we measured the time taken for spiders to build orb-webs with various up-down size asymmetries and used this as a measure of the complexity of web-building behaviour. The results showed that the spiders required more time to lay the spiral threads as their webs became more asymmetric even when the length of spiral threads was the same, suggesting a time cost of processing complex information. Furthermore, we found that spiders built more symmetric webs when they perceived a risk of predation, perhaps to reduce the web-building time during which they are more vulnerable. This suggests that the cost of behavioural complexity may mediate the outcome of interspecific interactions and thus may be ecologically important.

AB The spatial configuration of a group of animals should reflect the ability of its members to respond to environmental contingencies. Under predation risk, the optimal position for an individual in a stationary group is at the group's centre. The resulting group geometry is circular, with individual placement determined by competitive ability. Where it compromises efficient foraging, a long-standing question has been whether this topology can deform adaptively in response to the local distribution of resources. Here we show that the shape described by a group of foraging chacma baboons, Papio hamadryas ursinus, changes in response to habitat structure and that this promotes foraging efficiency while conserving the predation-risk-related distribution of group members. Adult baboons improve unimpeded access to the small, dispersed food items found in grassland by adjusting both their interindividual distances and their relative positions along the line of movement in order to forage in rank formation. Dominant animals occupy the centre of the group and do so regardless of its geometry. Our results demonstrate that spatially explicit data can address emergent group level properties directly. This global approach complements analyses of individual action and can help direct the search for potential local rules of interaction. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Researchers from various disciplines have hypothesized a positive correlation between the level of intergroup contest competition (IGCC) and the evolution of behavioural traits, such as cooperation, altruism and friendship, which promote intragroup affiliation. Empirical support for this hypothesis is, however, scarce and mainly available from humans. We tested whether the level of IGCC affects intragroup affiliation (i.e. intragroup grooming exchange) among male and female nonhuman primates. To quantify intragroup affiliation, we used social network measures and a grooming index. Our measure of IGCC combined frequency of intergroup encounters and proportion of aggressive encounters and was calculated separately for males and females. We ran our analyses on 27 wild groups of primates belonging to 15 species (13 Cercopithecinae, one Colobinae and one Cebinae). Our analyses reveal a clear pattern of correlated evolution between grooming network density and interindividual variation in the number of grooming partners on the one hand and the intensity of IGCC on the other in females, but not males. Thus, our results suggest that the exact nature of the relationship between IGCC and intragroup affiliation is sex specific. These results may be explained by the differential costs and benefits males and females experience during aggressive intergroup confrontations and by sex-specific differences in intragroup affiliation.

AB Rhythmic activity patterns are ubiquitous in animals and in the marine environment a dominant rhythmic activity is the diel vertical migration (DVM) of pelagic organisms, moving or 'migrating' from deep waters during the day to shallower waters at night. While this overall pattern of movement is well understood, the cryptic nature of the marine environment has limited the study of fine-scale movements within each phase. Active pelagic predators, such as tuna, perform consistent, predictable large-scale vertical movements; however, the fine-scale movements nested within these larger movements have not previously been investigated in detail. Further, the prey field densities are known to differ significantly between day and night, presenting an opportunity to study differences in foraging patterns between these two phases. Here, using long-term depth time series recorded from 93 bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus, with electronic tags (18 003 days of data), fine-scale changes in vertical movement patterns between day and night time phases were investigated in the context of the Levy foraging hypothesis, which predicts a Levy distribution of move steps during foraging when prey is scarce, but an exponential distribution when prey is abundant and searching is not required. During the day, T. obesus were found to exhibit scale-free movements well fitted by a Levy distribution indicating optimized searching for sparsely distributed prey. During night-time hours, however, exponentially distributed scale-dependent move step lengths were found to be dominant, supporting a simple, Brownian, movement pattern sufficient where prey is abundant. This study not only confirms the predictions of the Levy foraging hypothesis but suggests that the identification of Levy patterns in movement data can be a useful indicator of foraging activity in animals that are difficult to observe directly.

AB Host selection in parasitoids can be influenced by learning cues obtained during natal and/or adult experience. We investigated the effects of natal and adult host experience on host selection by the indigenous parasitoid Necremnus tutae (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), with an exotic host, the invasive tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), and a native host, Cosmopterix pulchrimella (Lepidoptera: Cosmopterigidae). Colonies of the parasitoid N. tutae were reared on the exotic host T. absoluta and the native host C. pulchrimella, infesting tomato and upright pellitory plants, respectively. Six groups were obtained based on their rearing histories (T. absoluta or C. pulchrimella larvae) and adult experience (no exposure to host larvae or oviposition experience on the two host species). Parasitoid females of the six groups were tested for behavioural responses to the two host plant complexes (HPCs) in Y-tube olfactometer assays and in two-choice assays in test arenas. The results suggest that host experience during both natal and adult life may affect the HPC preference of this parasitoid species. In particular, adult experience proved to influence the host preference in both olfactometer and two-choice assays. By contrast, natal experience showed a significant influence on host choice only in naive parasitoid females in the olfactometer bioassays. In general, the exotic host T. absoluta tomato complex was the odour source preferred by the parasitoid N. tutae. The role of natal and adult experience in host shifting dynamics and how these experiences can combine in adapting mechanisms to a new exotic insect of a generalist parasitoid species are also discussed.

AB To fully understand how problem-solving ability provides adaptive advantages for animals, we should understand the mechanisms that support this ability. Recent studies have highlighted several behavioural traits including persistence, behavioural variety and behavioural/cognitive flexibility that contribute to problem-solving success. However, any increment in these traits will increase time and energy costs in natural conditions, so they are not necessarily advantageous. To examine how behavioural traits vary during learning to solve a problem efficiently, we gave grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, a problem-solving task that required them to obtain out-of-reach but visible hazelnuts by making a lever drop in the laboratory. We recorded persistence, measured as attempt rate, flexibility, measured as the rate of switching between tactics, and behavioural selectivity, measured as the proportion of effective behaviours, in relation to problem-solving efficiency on a trial-by-trial basis. Persistence and behavioural selectivity were found to be directly associated with problem-solving efficiency. These two factors also mediated the effects of flexibility and increased experience. We also found two routes that led to more efficient problem solving across learning trials: increasing persistence or increasing behavioural selectivity. Flexibility was independent from learning. Flexibility could increase problem-solving efficiency, but it also has a time cost; furthermore, it seemed to involve a trade-off with behavioural selectivity, with high flexibility being associated with a higher frequency of some disadvantageous ineffective behaviours. These results suggest that flexibility is an independent cognitive process or behavioural trait that may not always bring advantages to animals.

AB For migrating birds, late arrival at the breeding grounds reduces reproductive success. Hence, while en route, late migrants are expected to accelerate migration. Most time can be saved by shortening stopovers, periods of rest and fuel replenishment (refuelling) in between flight bouts. In several field studies late migrants have indeed been observed to shorten stopovers. The length of stopovers is assumed to depend, at least partly, on refuelling rate (fuel deposition rate, FDR). Therefore, shorter stopovers later in the spring migration season may be explained by a seasonal increase in FDR. We tested this idea by measuring both migratory restlessness (an accurate proxy for departure likelihood from stopover) and FDR in the same set of temporarily caged wheatears, Oenanthe oenanthe, a long-distance songbird migrant, throughout spring migration. We found that the amount of migratory restlessness increased with the progress of the season, indicating higher departure likelihood in late migrants. Clearly, however, late migrants in our sample did not accelerate migration by increasing their FDR; daily FDR was relatively constant during the season in lean birds, and even decreased over the season in fat birds. There was little seasonal variation in daily food intake in both lean and fat birds. Because we eliminated and/or corrected for environmental factors influencing departure likelihood, these results strongly indicate that an endogenous time programme is involved in the regulation of departure from stopover in spring.

AB Multimodal signalling can improve or maximize information exchange. A challenge is to show that two independent signals, such as vocalizations and visual displays, are deliberately coordinated. Male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, signal visually and acoustically during courtship, performing a stereotyped dance while singing. The male approaches the female hopping in a zig-zag pattern, turning his body axis, and wiping his beak repeatedly on or above the perch. The only previous quantitative study of song and dance choreography in zebra finches revealed that the distribution of all movements during song was not strongly patterned across birds but very similar in fathers and sons. This raises the possibility that particular movements may follow a choreography. Here we report that three operationally defined dance movements, 'beak wipe' (BA), 'turn-around' (TA) and 'hop', occurred with different frequencies and speed during singing than during silence. BW, TA and hops clustered significantly at the start and end of song bouts and were arranged in a nonrandom fashion. In addition, BW, but not TA, were performed faster during song than nonsong. Finally, hops coincided significantly more often than expected by chance with particular notes. Together, these results suggest that male zebra finches integrate their song and dance during courtship. This may help females to identify courting males in a noisy environment and evaluate the intensity and quality of the courtship performance. Our results underscore that the choreography of movement gestures with learned vocalizations, such as hand gestures accompanying speech, is a further parallel between human and avian signalling. They invite future investigations into the underlying neural mechanisms and consequences for mate choice. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Intersexual agonistic encounters prior to mating are thought to result from the 'spillover' of the advantages of a voracious personality within a foraging context that is maladaptive in a mating context. We tested this idea by examining the repeatability and cross-context consistency of aggressive behaviours associated with foraging and mating in the raft spider, Dolomedes fimbriatus, in which some, highly voracious females reportedly kill approaching males and thus remain unmated. We failed to find support for a maladaptive spillover of voracious female personality. While females exhibited consistent inter-individual differences in voracity towards prey, voracity did not correlate with female aggressiveness towards males. Instead, we show that female D. fimbriatus adjusted their tendency to attack courting males according to their size relative to the male. Females commonly attacked males during or after copulation, but sexual cannibalism depended on relative mate size difference, with mating success tending to be compromised in females with lower body weight.

AB Nest ectoparasites can impose significant costs to altricial nestlings that are confined to the nest and dependent on parental care. These costs are often passed on to parents who may compensate for, or magnify, the direct costs of parasites on their nestlings through adjustments in parental care behaviour. If the effects of ectoparasites on nestlings vary across development, parents would be expected to dynamically adjust their behaviour across time with the possibility that males and females may vary in their responses. Currently, we lack a complete understanding of the potential sex differences and variation in parental care behaviour across the nestling period as a function of offspring parasite infection. Our experimental study compared disinfected and parasitized treatment groups to examine how northern fowl mites, Ornithonyssus sylviarum, in nests of the North American barn swallow, Hirundo rustica erythrogaster, affect parental care behaviour. Specifically, we addressed how provisioning rates and nest attendance behaviours (time spent at the nest) changed in response to ectoparasite infection early (day 7) and late (day 13) in the nestling period, and between male and female parents. Early in the nestling period, female provisioning rates were lower for parasitized nests than for disinfected nests whereas male provisioning rates did not differ between treatments. However, males of parasitized nests showed higher nest attendance whereas females did not alter their attendance of nestlings as a function of the parasite manipulation. Later in the nestling period, parental care behaviours changed dramatically. Male provisioning rates were higher for parasitized nests than for disinfected nests whereas female provisioning rates did not differ between treatments. Both males and females showed greater nest attendance for parasitized nests compared to disinfected nests on day 13. These findings suggest that parasites do affect provisioning and nest attendance behaviours: parental care responses differ between males and females, and are dynamic across the nestling developmental period.

AB The selfish herd hypothesis, as proposed by Hamilton (1971, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 31, 295-311), is a powerful hypothesis to explain emergent grouping behaviour by individuals acting in their own self-interest. However, immediately after prey detect a predator, the prey group may undergo a rapid disassembly, called a flash expansion, which might be considered a 'repulsive herd'. Although flash expansion occurs in bird flocks, fish schools and insect swarms, few empirical or simulation studies have directly examined it or tested whether there are differences among its members. In addition, although flash expansion is typically thought of as a near-simultaneous movement of individuals away from the group centre, little data has been collected to verify this. We performed an empirical study to test whether the overall movement of individuals within a flash expansion is away from (1) the first individual to startle, (2) the geometric centre or (3) the point of highest density. We videotaped replicate swarms of marked whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae: Dineutes) during flash expansion and determined their trajectories. Overall, individuals moved away from the geometric centre more strongly than from the density maximum or the first to respond (starter). The geometric centre hypothesis was also supported by the lack of polarization of the group and that the bearing angle was away from the geometric centre. The starter was more likely to be a female at the edge of a group, and she moved more quickly than others and favoured the centre of the group. This is one of the first detailed examinations of flash expansion and the individual differences within it. Future empirical and simulation studies of the movement rules and emergent properties of flash expansion are needed to better understand the collective motion of other animals.

AB An elegant study by Kazemi et al. (2014, Current Biology, 24, 965-969) found that blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, that had been trained to distinguish between rewarding and nonrewarding prey subsequently avoided novel prey that had the same colour (but not the same shape or pattern) as the nonrewarding prey. Their work suggested that certain high-salience discriminatory traits can overshadow other informative traits, allowing imperfect mimics to establish. Here we began by replicating their ambitious experiment by evaluating the behaviour of 320 human subjects foraging on computer-generated prey. However, to fully understand how overshadowing might facilitate the establishment of incipient mimics, we significantly extended their protocol to a full factorial design involving mimics with colour, pattern and/or shape in common with their former models. As Kazemi et al. reported, participants placed more weight on colour similarity than on shape similarity when rejecting prey. Two-trait mimics with the same colour and pattern or the same colour and shape as their former models were avoided as frequently as perfect mimics, while colour-only mimics were avoided more frequently than shape-only mimics. Nevertheless, novel prey with no traits in common with nonrewarding models were avoided at high rates, possibly in part due to their dissimilarity to familiar rewarding prey. The implications of these findings for mimicry evolution are discussed. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   females' webs less attractive to rival males

AB Male adaptations that limit sperm competition include guarding females, applying mating plugs and chemically reducing the attractiveness or receptivity of females. In many web-building spider species, females attract males with silk-borne volatile pheromones. In widow spiders (Latrodectus, 30 species), the courting male often engages in web reduction behaviour during which he excises and bundles sections of the female's web and wraps them with his own silk. Hypothesized functions of this widespread behaviour include sexual communication (e.g. through dissemination of male sex pheromone) and/or decreasing the female's attractiveness to rivals. The latter function was previously demonstrated in a single spider species, Neriene litigiosa, but the extent to which web reduction may decrease male -male competition has never been quantified in the field. In a dense population of western black widows, Latrodectus hesperus, we ran mate attraction experiments to test the hypothesis that web reduction and/or male silk addition decrease web attractiveness to potential rivals. Webs reduced by males attracted three times fewer males than intact webs; webs with a similar proportion of silk experimentally removed attracted as many males as intact webs. However, the experimental addition of male silk did not affect the attractiveness of intact webs. We conclude that web reduction in black widows limits male-male competition by reducing the attraction of rival males to females' webs. This effect is probably mediated through targeted excision of pheromone-laden silk by courting males, possibly in combination with the male's silk forming a physical barrier to pheromone emission.

AB Ants provide one of the best examples of the division of labour in animal societies. In many species, although workers still have ovaries, they refrain from laying (haploid) eggs when a queen is present in the colony and, instead, dedicate themselves exclusively to domestic tasks. In monogynous species, workers generally begin laying eggs once the queen dies, which allows the colony's remaining resources to be invested in the workers' offspring. However, we found that in the fission-performing ant Aphaenogaster senilis, worker reproduction was also inhibited by brood pheromones; the presence of larvae, irrespective of their ploidy or origin, inhibited egg laying by orphaned workers in a dose-dependent manner. The end result was that workers allocated resources to the larvae that were present in the colony before starting to lay their own eggs. We also found that, while the number of workers reared was proportional to the number of larvae provided, the number of queens reared tended to plateau at six, regardless of the number of totipotent larvae present. This finding concurs with what has been observed in colonies in the field and fits with what the theory of local resource competition predicts. One explanation is that one of the queens produced is likely to mate and replace her dead mother as the head of the colony. Therefore, by rearing the queen's brood after her death, workers may have an opportunity to prolong the life of the colony. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Predation-induced mortality rates of aquatic species are much higher in larvae than in adults. Consequently, the ability of an organism to recognize relevant predators as early as possible could increase its chance of survival, especially in areas with high predator diversity. Heart rates of embryonic cinnamon clownfish, Amphiprion melanopus, were monitored to assess their reaction to damage-released conspecific alarm cues. These cues were then combined with a predator odour in a conditioning trial to establish whether the embryos were capable of learning a predatory threat. Results showed that A. melanopus embryos were not only able to detect and react to conspecific chemical alarm cues, but were also capable of using this information to learn about predation risk before they hatched. This recognition could lead to a number of antipredator behavioural adaptations, such as modifications of habitat choice at settlement, and could affect development and behaviour in postembryonic individuals, all of which may increase their chance of survival.

AB Developmental stress has been shown to affect adult flight performance in birds, with both negative and positive effects reported in the literature. Previous studies have used developmental manipulations that had substantial effects on patterns of growth. They have also examined mean levels of flight performance per individual, rather than investigating how developmental stress might alter trade-offs between different components of flight performance. We recorded multiple components of escape flight performance in 20 adult European starlings previously subjected to a manipulation likely to have altered levels of developmental stress. Siblings had been cross-fostered to nests where they were either slightly larger (advantaged treatment) or slightly smaller (disadvantaged treatment) than their competitors. The manipulation had no detectable effect on growth. However, developmental treatment affected performance in escape flights a year later by strengthening the trade-offs between different flight parameters. Disadvantaged birds faced a steeper trade-off between take-off speed and take-off angle, and a steeper trade-off between take-off angle and total time in flight, than advantaged birds. The results suggest that even subtle early life adversity that has no obvious effect on growth or size can leave a lasting legacy in the form of constraints on locomotor performance later in life.

AB Many animals learn skills that can take a long time to acquire. Such learned skills may have high payoffs eventually, but during the period of learning their net profitability is low. When there are other options available, it is not clear how animals decide to learn how to perform tasks that initially have low or no benefits. Bees in particular visit many types of flowers that vary in the time required to learn how to access their food rewards. We used bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to address how individuals decide to persevere with learning to handle 'complex' flowers. We tested two hypotheses: (1) individuals have unlearned preferences for more complex flowers; (2) individuals use the absolute reward value of the flower to decide whether to learn to handle a particular flower type. We presented individual bees with mixed arrays of colour-distinct 'simple' and 'complex' flowers, either containing the same value of reward, or where the complex flowers contained twice the concentration of sucrose as the simple flowers. Foragers did not show any unlearned preferences towards the complex flowers, but instead preferred the simple flowers. The strongest initial preferences were for flower colour (purple over pink). Our second hypothesis was supported, because when the purple complex flowers contained a higher reward than the simple flowers, more bees persevered with visiting them, foraging on them exclusively by the end of the test period. There was significant variation between individuals in whether they learned to handle, and how much they visited, complex flowers. These results highlight the complex interplay between unlearned biases and environmental feedback in making decisions about what to learn. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Among factors hypothesized to favour consistent individual differences in behaviour (i.e. personality or behavioural types), the social environment has received relatively little attention. Within-group variation in personality may facilitate the emergence of division of labour, if individuals with different personalities tend to specialize on different tasks. In turn, functional benefits derived from division of labour may promote the coexistence of alternative behavioural types. We investigated how intracolonial variation in personality influences individual and collective patterns of task performance in the social spider Anelosimus studiosus. Colonies composed of a mixture of aggressive and docile females showed greater nonreproductive division of labour than monotypic colonies of either behavioural type. Within mixed-personality colonies, aggressive individuals tended to perform more prey capture, colony defence and/or web repair, while docile individuals became brood care specialists. Task differentiation was shaped by social dynamics, but behavioural plasticity varied with personality type: docile individuals were more socially responsive, shifting their task allocation in the presence of aggressive colonymates. Efficiency gains from personality-linked division of labour may help to explain the superior performance of diverse colonies and to maintain individual behavioural variation in A. studiosus and other social species.

AB The 'female nutrition' hypothesis proposes that food provided by males during incubation is an important energy source for females in bird species in which females alone incubate. Females should be able to communicate their needs through begging signals to mates and males may compensate for the energetic limitations of females through their feeding visits, owing to their overlapping reproductive interests. To test whether female begging during incubation is an honest signal of energetic need and whether mates respond to it we experimentally handicapped female pied flycatchers at the beginning of incubation by clipping two primary flight feathers on each wing. Experimental manipulation led females to intensify begging displays arising from condition impairment and males accordingly increased their incubation feeding rates. Female begging intensity explained more than half of the variation in male incubation feeding rate, thereby showing that female nutrition is the main factor explaining male incubation feeding. Moreover, handicapped females consumed a higher proportion of male food deliveries during the first few days after hatching and weighed less at the end of the nestling period than control females. Handicapping had no influence on female incubation behaviour, hatching and breeding success, nestling and male condition or female nestling provisioning. The provisioning rates of males in the late nestling stage were higher in experimental nests. This is the first experimental study showing that males adjust incubation feeding rates to behavioural displays of need by their mates. The ability of females to modify their begging displays according to need may be an important adaptation that allows females to maintain a good energetic condition during incubation.

AB Fitness proxies such as performance measures are used to quantify relative fitness in systems where direct measurements are unobtainable. To provide meaningful results at the individual level, fitness proxies must demonstrate not only repeatability, as measured by high intraclass correlation coefficients, but also rank repeatability. Here we illustrate the importance of rank repeatability in fitness proxies using a commonly employed example: righting time in hatchling turtles. Our results show that individual righting time varies strongly among trials and is not replicable enough to provide repeatable rankings of individuals or clutches. To illustrate the potential implications of this finding, we use our data to test the predication that larger turtles have faster righting times, using three consecutive trials of righting time. The resulting conclusions vary substantially among trials. Thus, we conclude that righting time does not meet the criterion of rank repeatability required for estimates of relative individual fitness, performance or phenotypic quality. Researchers employing similar proxies should assess the rank repeatability of a proxy before applying it to questions of relative individual fitness. If a measure shows satisfactory repeatability, the final test for a fitness proxy is to demonstrate a correlation with actual fitness, ideally in the organism's natural habitat.

AB When reproduction occurs seasonally, males are expected to concentrate their reproductive effort when the abundance of females in oestrus is highest. In colonial species, large body size and prior residency correlate with the ability to establish dominance and ultimately to achieve matings. However, in addition to dominance, attendance in proximity to females may also enhance male mating success. If females come into oestrus highly asynchronously, males are unable to attend females for the entire breeding season. We expect the attendance of the most competitive males to increase with the availability of receptive females while less competitive males may primarily attend colonies when more competitive males are rare. In Galapagos sea lions, Zalophus wollebaeki, large males defend semiaquatic territories, but are unable to hold these over the entire reproductive season. They are sighted most often during the peak reproductive season. In this study, we found that nonterritorial males frequented the colony less during this time. However, the percentage of days intermediate-sized and resident males were sighted increased towards the peak of the reproductive season. Reproductive success was positively correlated with male attendance and therefore highest among territorial males. However, the correlation between attendance and reproductive success also existed for nonterritorial males. This suggests that male Galapagos sea lions adjust their attendance to the competitive situation in the colony. By increasing attendance during the peak of female oestrus, territorial males increase their chance of reproducing successfully. By adopting size-dependent strategies, nonterritorial males are able to achieve fitness while still growing. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Male dark fishing spiders (Dolomedes tenebrosus Araneae, Pisauridae) always die during their first and only copulation, making all males monogynous. Such obligate male death can be adaptive if it facilitates sexual cannibalism, and if sexual cannibalism results in male reproductive benefits, such as an advantage in sperm competition through reduced female remating. We first conducted an experiment to determine the extent to which D. tenebrosus (1) males are cannibalized by females and (2) females engage in remating, both of which are prerequisites for several adaptive hypotheses of male self- sacrifice. We then conducted an experiment to test the hypothesis that the cannibalism of the male by the female reduces the likelihood of female remating. We found that obligate male death appears to facilitate sexual cannibalism in D. tenebrosus; females always cannibalize males postcopulation. We also found that half of all females copulated with multiple males. Finally, we found no support for the hypothesis that cannibalizing a male reduces the likelihood of female remating. We were additionally able to document that even though males may appear to act as whole- body mating plugs immediately after death, by hanging from the female's genital opening, this rarely functions in preventing subsequent copulations (i. e. mate plugging). In summary, obligate male death and associated cannibalism in the dark fishing spider D. tenebrosus does not appear to function to reduce sperm competition through reduced female remating.

AB Recognition of conspecifics is essential for territorial and monogamous animals in order to maintain pair bonds, mate-guard and defend territories. However, cues required for mate discrimination are essentially unknown in monogamous fishes, despite the importance of recognition behaviour that promotes this mating system. This field study tested the role of visual and olfactory cues in the discrimination of mates and unfamiliar conspecifics in the territorial, socially monogamous pebbled butterflyfish, Chaetodon multicinctus. A series of model bottle field experiments presented cues from a mate and an unfamiliar nonmate to a focal resident fish within its feeding territory. When both visual and olfactory cues were first matched, the resident spent more time and engaged in more agonistic displays near the bottled intruder. In contrast, when olfactory cues of bottled fish were first mismatched, the resident fish spent equivalent time at each bottle stimulus. When scent cues were then reversed to a matched odour condition (odour released next to bottled fish), the resident again spent more time with the nonmate. Resident fish spent equivalent time with the mate and nonmate in the absence of any associated odour stimuli. In addition, resident fish did not show a differential response when the mate's odour was associated with only one of two intruder fish. Thus both visual and olfactory cues are necessary for butterflyfish to discriminate their mate from intruders within feeding territories. These results indicate that mate recognition in animals with long- term pair bonds may require multimodal stimuli and future studies on mate recognition should address multiple sensory channels.

AB Developmental stress affects a range of phenotypic traits in later life-history stages. These long-term effects are thought to provide information to potential mates on individual quality and the ability to cope with adversity (i.e. the developmental stress hypothesis). Developmental stress appears to affect learning broadly, but the direction of effect is not always consistent between studies. This disparity may arise from indirect effects of developmental stress on other physiological or behavioural systems, which can affect outcomes in learning paradigms. Here, we examine the effect of elevated corticosterone (the dominant avian stress hormone) during development on the ability of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, to learn a novel foraging task as adults. Additionally, we evaluate treatment effects on metabolism, to determine whether changes in metabolic rate indirectly alter learning results. We found that birds exposed to elevated corticosterone during development solved a foraging task faster than control siblings. This outcome could result from differences, not in learning ability, but in motivation for reward. However, we found no difference between treatment groups in metabolic rate. Hence, our results indicate that developmental stress can increase learning ability, and suggest that the effects of stress will vary based on the type of learning studied.

AB Animals foraging in groups commonly respond to the presence of others by increasing their foraging rate, an increase that could come at the expense of prey detection accuracy. Yet the existence and consequences of such so-called 'speed-accuracy trade-offs' in group-foraging animals remain unexplored. We used group-feeding zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, to determine how search speed affects food detection accuracy and how a potential speed-accuracy trade-off influences feeding success. We found significant between-individual differences in hopping speed as well as evidence that faster individuals were more likely to overlook food, demonstrating the existence of a trade-off between speed and food detection probability. We also found that feeding success was positively predicted by an individual's food detection probability, whereas it was unrelated to hopping speed. These findings have several implications. First, they indicate that social animals, like solitary foragers, may be affected by perhaps universal constraints when foraging, such as limited attention. These constraints may contribute to promote between-individual variation in foraging tactics within social groups. Second, the existence of a speed-accuracy trade-off suggests that between-individual behavioural differences are more likely to come from differential allocation between speed and accuracy than from differences in general intrinsic abilities to exploit food resources. Finally, scramble competition's outcomes are likely to be determined by a combination of foraging abilities that individuals must trade off against one another, calling for an integrative approach of how natural selection shapes interactive behavioural dimensions during foraging.

AB In nature, animals must contend with the presence of noise, which may limit their ability to detect prey, attract mates and escape predators. Sources of noise vary and may originate from natural (e. g. animal sounds, water) or anthropogenic (e. g. traffic, construction) sources. The vibratory sensory modality has long been overlooked in the study of anthropogenic effects on wildlife. Human-induced environmental changes may introduce noise sources as well as artificial substrates that alter vibratory noise profiles, leading to maladaptive behavioural responses. We conducted field measurements of vibratory noise on various substrate types (natural and artificial) used by animals in human-developed habitats. Next, we conducted laboratory experiments on how vibratory noise affects the prey detection ability of the European garden spider, Araneus diadematus. We tested whether changes in vibratory noise profiles consistent with anthropogenic alterations of vibratory habitats are sufficient to alter the spider's sensitivity to prey cues. We found that overall noise amplitude on artificial substrates was lower and less variable across contexts compared with natural substrates. In experiments with different noise levels, we observed that garden spiders showed noise-dependent changes in sensitivity to prey-mimicking cues, with response thresholds lowest at intermediate noise levels. Experimental levels of intermediate noise consistent with field measurements on natural substrates suggest that spiders' predatory performance is higher when webs are constructed on natural substrates. This suggests that human-introduced substrates may interfere with spiders' predatory performance. As human activities and habitat alteration are widespread, our findings highlight the need to consider the vibratory sensory channel in assessing anthropogenic impacts on wildlife.

AB The prevalence of stable behavioural differences between individuals of a species (i.e. personality) is puzzling because it indicates that there are limits on animals' behavioural plasticity and, therefore, optimality of behaviour. Personality may result from individual state characteristics (e.g. morphology or physiology). In turn, these characteristics can lead to differential fitness outcomes for individuals. Cognitive processing of environmental information may be such a characteristic. We developed a subjective personality assessment for Amazona amazonica. We then assessed whether personality predicted a cognitive state difference in attention bias, as measured by the proportion of balks and errors when performing a spatial foraging task in the presence of a passive human observer. Attention biases occur either because individuals attend more quickly to certain environmental stimuli, or because they cannot disengage their attention from such stimuli. Two factors, 'neuroticism' and 'extraversion', accounted for 66% of the total variance in personality. There was individual variation between parrots' scores on both personality factors and both factors were temporally consistent over 1 year. There was a significant correlation between neuroticism and attention bias. Evolutionarily, attention biases are selected for because the fitness cost of failing to attend to potential threats is much greater than the cost of expending energy attending to benign stimuli. Therefore, cognitive biases such as attention bias are logical candidate cognitive states driving stable personality differences. Our findings show that differences in personality in A. amazonica are correlated with attention bias, a biologically relevant difference in cognition.

AB Stress hormones are emerging as major factors regulating the expression of elaborate male traits. Surprisingly, however, the effects of glucocorticoids on such traits have not been formally integrated with androgen-based models of sexual selection. Here we point out that consideration of glucocorticoid-mediated effects on the phenotype provides new insight into long-standing hypotheses and controversies associated with such models. In particular, androgen-based 'handicap' models of sexual selection characteristically hinge on graded effects of androgens on male traits, but few studies have found support for such a relationship, suggesting that androgens may not be a primary target of selection. We propose, however, that in many instances, androgens may not appear to have a graded effect on the phenotype because elevated glucocorticoids mask the effects of androgens. Glucocorticoids may be inextricably linked to elaborate traits because the energetic demands associated with such traits promote glucocorticoid production. We thus propose that glucocorticoid-mediated effects on male traits warrant re-evaluation of androgen-based models of sexual selection. In particular, we argue that androgen-based handicap models cannot be dismissed based on the lack of evidence for a graded relationship between androgen level and the extent or magnitude of the trait. Our review of the literature indicates that most studies have examined either the effects of androgens or the effects of glucocorticoids, but not both. A more integrated approach involving the effects of both steroids is necessary to fully understand the role of androgens and the endocrine targets of selection associated with the expression of elaborate male traits.

AB Ectotherms compensate for variation in thermal environments in diverse behavioural ways. Despite widely occurring sex differences in morphology and physiology, the sex-specific thermal sensitivity of behavioural traits has received little attention. We tested the interactive influence of sex and environmental temperature on predator-induced responses in the Alpine newt, Ichthyosaura alpestris. Escape decisions and the duration of flight were less thermally sensitive in females than in males. Males ran more slowly than females. Both sexes required more stimuli at intermediate temperatures than at other temperatures. We conclude that temperature and sex are important determinants of a newt's defensive repertoire. The sex-specific thermal sensitivity of defensive responses suggests both asymmetric selection regimes and an impact of environmental change in newt populations.

AB Prenatal and early postnatal conditions can prime developmental trajectories, with short- as well as major long- term effects on phenotype. Variance in perinatal conditions may be caused by many factors, including number of siblings of either sex, which is expected to influence individual phenotype for two complementary reasons. First, male and female offspring can differ in susceptibility to extrinsic conditions. Second, the effect that an individual has on its siblings can differ according to their sex. Yet, few studies of vertebrates and only one of birds have addressed the long- term consequences of family sex composition on offspring of either sex. We analysed the effect of brood sex composition on adult phenotype and breeding performance in the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica. Male offspring growing with more sisters had shorter wing length, an aerodynamically important trait, and tail length, a condition-dependent, sexually selected trait. In addition, tail length of females decreased with increasing brood size but more steeply so when they grew with more female siblings. Body size of females also declined with increasing brood size. Notably, breeding output of females declined with an increasing proportion of male siblings and also with increasing brood size. This study thus suggests that social environment has major consequences for phenotype and breeding performance in adulthood and that variation in brood sex composition has long- term effects which depend on the sex of the individual as well as on the specific trait considered. Hence, optimal parental sex allocation decisions depend not simply on additive fitness costs and benefits of producing males or females, but also on the long- term effects that sons and daughters exert on each other.

AB A principal hypothesis for the evolution of leks (rare and intensely competitive territorial aggregations) is that leks result from females preferring to mate with clustered males. This hypothesis predicts more female visits and higher mating success per male on larger leks. Evidence for and against this hypothesis has been presented by different studies, primarily of individual populations, but its generality has not yet been formally investigated. We took a meta-analytical approach towards formally examining the generality of such a female bias in lekking species. Using available published data and using female visits as an index of female mating bias, we estimated the shape of the relationship between lek size and total female visits to a lek, female visits per lekking male and, where available, per capita male mating success. Individual analyses showed that female visits generally increased with lek size across the majority of taxa surveyed; the meta-analysis indicated that this relationship with lek size was disproportionately positive. The findings from analysing per capita female visits were mixed, with an increase with lek size detected in half of the species, which were, however, widely distributed taxonomically. Taken together, these findings suggest that a female bias for clustered males may be a general process across lekking species. Nevertheless, the substantial variation seen in these relationships implies that other processes are also important. Analyses of per capita copulation success suggested that, more generally, increased per capita mating benefits may be an important selective factor in lek maintenance.

AB Hatching asynchrony is widespread in birds laying clutches containing multiple eggs, yet is seemingly paradoxical as the age and size hierarchies result in asymmetric sibling competition and low survival prospects for late-hatched nestlings. We examined the causes of variation in hatching asynchrony between broods of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, in three environments: domesticated, captive wild and wild free-living. We found that broods of both domesticated and wild birds taken into captivity hatched more asynchronously than wild free-living broods. This was directly attributable to both male and female parents of domesticated and captive wild broods initiating incubation as soon as the first egg was laid as opposed to when the clutch was virtually complete in wild free-living broods. Wild free-living birds that were transferred to captive environments immediately switched to the incubation onset behaviour seen in domesticated birds, thereby demonstrating a previously unsuspected level of intraspecific plasticity in incubation behaviour. This finding suggests that something about the captive environment is driving the early onset of incubation and contributing to an elevated level of hatching asynchrony in captive birds. Across all populations and environments males contributed almost equally to incubation, and the onset of incubation by males was highly coordinated with that of their partner.

AB Females often adjust their mating preference to environmental and social conditions. This plasticity of preference can be adaptive for females and can have important consequences for the evolution of male traits. While predation and parasitism are widespread, their effects on female preferences have rarely been investigated. Females of the cricket Gryllus lineaticeps are parasitized by the parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea. Infestation with fly larvae substantially reduces female life span and thus reproductive opportunities of the cricket. Both female G. lineaticeps and flies orient to male song and both prefer male songs with faster chirp rates to songs with slower chirp rates. We tested the effect of parasitic infestation on female responsiveness to male song and female chirp rate preferences. The proportion of individuals responding to male songs did not differ between infested and control females. Control females preferred intermediate chirp rates to slow chirp rates and did not discriminate between fast and intermediate chirp rates. In contrast, infested females showed no preferences in the choice trials, indicating reduced chirp rate selectivity. This plasticity in female preferences may be adaptive; parasitized females may have a higher probability of reproducing before they are killed by the parasitoids if they are less selective (i.e. there will be a larger pool of males considered acceptable). The change in preferences suggests relaxed selection on male chirp rate during times of parasitism. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aggregations in the distribution of individuals are an almost universal phenomenon in living organisms. Groups of animals that display collective coordinated movement without forming stable social bonds such as fish schools are a special type of aggregation. In tropical tuna fisheries, aggregating behaviour is directly exploited through the use of artificial fish aggregating devices (FADs). Hence, understanding the dynamics of schooling behaviour and the potential impacts of FADs upon it may have ramifications for tuna management. As a novel way of quantifying spatiotemporal co-occurrences of animals, we applied network statistics to acoustic tracking data to identify the co-occurrences of individual yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, in an array of FADs and determine the frequency and temporal dynamics of these co-occurrences. We observed large interannual variation in movement rates of tuna between FADs, and corresponding interannual variability in the mean number of spatiotemporal associates for each individual as well as the temporal stability of associations. When movement rates were high, associations within FAD aggregations decayed to randomness three times faster than when movement rates were lower. This raises the possibility that if FADs are sufficiently close for fish to perform frequent betweenFAD movements, school mixing may be increased and cohesion reduced.

AB To date, most studies of spatial learning have been conducted in the horizontal plane, with few addressing animals' use of the vertical dimension. It is not clear, therefore, what difference adding a vertical component to the learning/memory of a spatial location makes. The aim of this study was to examine the learning by rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, of a rewarded location in the vertical and horizontal axes. We found that their ability to learn the location of a rewarded flower in a linear flower array depended on its orientation and on the spacing distance between the flowers in the array. Birds chose the flower in the rewarded location more than any of the other four flowers in the horizontal array but only when flowers were spaced 30 cm apart. In contrast, in the vertical array or when the flowers were 5 cm apart horizontally, birds only avoided visiting the two distal flowers. In addition, the cues the birds used to learn the rewarded location depended on the spacing scale in the horizontal dimension: at 30 cm flower spacing, birds learned the absolute location whereas at 5 cm they chose the relative and absolute locations equally. In a diagonal linear array, birds chose the rewarded flower more than any other. When the array was oriented either vertically or horizontally for the test, the birds chose the flower in the same horizontal location as for the rewarded training location. The hummingbirds appear to favour the horizontal over the vertical component of a learned location. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sentinel behaviour, where individuals take turns to watch for danger and give alarm calls to approaching predators, has been observed in a number of animal societies. However, the evolutionary causes of this behaviour remain unclear. There are two main, competing hypotheses regarding the evolution of sentinel behaviour. The first hypothesis is that it is a cooperative behaviour, where group members benefit from the detection of danger but share the workload of acting as a sentinel. The second is that it is a safe, selfish behaviour. Under the second hypothesis, once an individual is satiated, being a sentinel is safer because sentinels can detect threats more readily and can therefore escape from predators faster. We examined whether sentinels are safer than foragers in a wild, free-living cooperative bird (the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor) with a well-described sentinel system. We found that sentinel behaviour was costly because (1) sentinels were targeted by predators more often, (2) they were further from cover than foragers, and (3) they took longer to reach the safety of cover following a predator alarm. These results suggest that individuals do not become sentinels because it is safer. This is the first study to demonstrate that sentinels are at greater risk of predator attack than foraging group members and suggests sentinel activity may have evolved as a form of cooperative behaviour.

AB In many species, some males gain access to females by cheating, i.e. by exploiting the reproductive investment made by other males. There are two main nonmutually exclusive hypotheses to explain the decision of an individual to switch from the classical reproductive tactic to the parasitic one: the inherent disadvantage and energetic constraint hypotheses. For the first time, we tested and compared these two hypotheses in an experimental design by manipulating food availability of males with different degrees of inherent disadvantage in the caller/satellite system of Hyla arborea. Small males were more likely to be satellites than large individuals as predicted by the inherent disadvantage hypothesis. However, food deprived males were not more likely to be satellites than those that were fed, suggesting that the energetic constraint is not the main process explaining the use of a parasitic reproductive tactic. Moreover, all else being equal, males were more likely to act as satellites if confronted with an attractive competitor than if confronted with an unattractive one. In addition, males had a greater probability of being satellites at the beginning and end of the night, whereas they were more likely to call during the middle of the night. These results could highlight synchronization between male tactics and expected female availability during the course of the night. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Decision making is vital to the fitness of all animals, with many social species making consensus decisions that require efficient communication. Chemical signals are the most important tools for many animals, and are used notably by social insects in a wide variety of contexts, from foraging for food to recognition of nestmates. However, chemical cues may be biosynthetically limited and costly to produce, making their use in multiple contexts potentially beneficial. In this study we examined the role of foraging pheromones during nest migrations in the Pharaoh's ant, Monomorium pharaonis. Using a Y-shaped bridge apparatus, we tested whether ants would prefer migrating to a novel nest site along branches coated with attractive foraging pheromones rather than to a nest site reached via a control branch. We found that ants preferred to migrate to nest sites reached via branches with attractive foraging pheromones, and that there were more queens and workers in those nests at the end of the migration than in nests at the end of control branches. The results show that attractive foraging pheromones are utilized during nest migrations in the Pharaoh's ant, highlighting the evolutionary pressure to use signals in a parsimonious manner to improve communication during decision making.

AB 'Tradition' has been invoked to explain instances in which animals aggregate repeatedly in the same locations for no apparent reason, but alternative explanations, such as cryptic habitat selection, are difficult to rule out. Distinguishing among these hypotheses requires field experiments. We studied a species of harvestman (Prionostemma sp.) that forages solitarily at night and forms roosting aggregations in spiny palms by dawn. Aggregations have formed repeatedly in the same sites for over a decade, and yet the aggregation sites do not appear to differ from unused sites in tree characteristics or microclimate. Previous research suggested that the harvestmen find aggregation sites by detecting chemicals left behind by conspecifics. If so, it should be possible to establish new aggregation sites simply by moving harvestmen to new locations. We carried out such an experiment and, as predicted, release sites attracted harvestmen at much higher rates than did matched control sites. Most individuals that came to release sites were new recruits, and one site continued to attract several harvestmen for at least 7 days, suggesting that a new roosting tradition was established. We also revisited the question of whether any other factors, besides past usage, predict site use. Among sites used by the harvestmen, the size of the aggregations was strongly predicted by microclimate and spiny palm characteristics. Together these findings support the hypothesis that attraction to conspecific cues is the primary mechanism responsible for the long-term stability of aggregation sites, while also suggesting that site characteristics play a previously unrecognized role. Understanding how site traditions develop may have direct applications in conservation. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Animals use a variety of aggressive signals to mediate territorial interactions. Often these signals can be sufficient to ward off potential rivals, thus minimizing the chance of injury due to physical encounters. Yet not all behaviours produced during territorial interactions are aggressive signals. In this investigation, we examined the aggressive signals of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, by determining which signals predict attack on a competitor. We used a recently developed playback protocol involving a loudspeaker and a taxidermic mount to simulate an intruder on males' breeding territories. We examined males' behaviours prior to any physical attack on the mount, both in the minute before attack and the time period preceding this minute. In the minute before attack, we found that gargle calls consistently predicted attack. In the preceding time period, we found that high song rate predicted attack. Surprisingly, we found that attack and the behaviours associated with attack were not significantly correlated with male dominance status. We conclude that song rate and gargle calling behaviour communicate intent to attack during territorial interactions in black-capped chickadees. These results expand our knowledge of aggressive signals during territorial encounters by revealing novel vocalizations used to communicate an animal's probability to attack an opponent.

AB Economic games are often used in an attempt to reveal the underlying preferences or motivations that govern human behaviour. However, this approach relies on the implicit assumption that individuals are rational and fully aware of the consequences of their decisions. We examined behaviour in a standard economic game that is often used to measure social preferences: the public-goods game. We found that giving information to individuals about the relative success of their group led to (1) significantly higher levels of cooperation and (2) emotional responses to group success. This is despite the fact that group success had no effect on the payoffs in our game, and so knowledge of group success should not influence the behaviour of rational players. Consequently, these results suggest that cues of group competition have an automatic or unconscious effect on human behaviour that can induce increased within-group cooperation. More generally, this framing effect emphasizes the potential problem with drawing biological conclusions from the quantitative comparison of cooperation levels in economic games with the predictions of theory. Instead, our results emphasize the advantage of testing theory by qualitatively comparing behaviour across treatments, and with regard to expected adaptations and expected ontogeny.

AB Optimal decisions in classical foraging models depend on the encounter rate with food items that are often distributed heterogeneously at one or multiple spatial scales. Only a few studies, however, provide a detailed assessment of the determinants of foraging efficiency by free-ranging animals across spatial scales. We evaluated multilevel search efficiency of free-ranging plains bison, Bison bison bison, and whether it varies with social factors, sex and season. We assessed search efficiency by contrasting encounters with the most profitable plant species, Carex atherodes, from random expectations within meadows or along foraging paths. We found that bison selectively occupied areas of meadows rich in C. atherodes. Once in these areas, females took shorter steps in locations of high C. atherodes biomass in summer and winter, as expected from an area-restricted search tactic. In winter, the presence of conspecifics further increased the chances of finding locations of high C. atherodes biomass, presumably due to social information. Unlike females, once males were in areas generally rich in C. atherodes during summer, they moved towards locations with lower C. atherodes biomass more than expected by chance alone. The fine-scale movement strategy of males does not appear to maximize instantaneous energy intake rate, but might reflect a tactic for efficient guarding of females during the rut. Overall, our study shows that the efficiency with which free-ranging herbivores find high-quality food during social foraging strongly differs between sexes, and depends on conspecific distribution and season.

AB Recent studies have documented that social bees can use heterospecific information to find or avoid food resources, but little is known about whether bees gain information from heterospecifics about predation risk. We report the first detailed field tests in bees of hetero- and conspecific avoidance of olfactory information associated with predation. We determined whether Apis mellifera and Bombus impatiens would respond either to hetero- or conspecific haemolymph as an indication of a predation event, or to sting gland contents, which provide an alarm pheromone in honeybees and in many other social Hymenoptera. Bombus impatiens avoided their own haemolymph and A. mellifera haemolymph in foraging arena choice experiments. Bombus impatiens did not respond to A. mellifera alarm pheromone or to the odour of conspecific sting gland. In field experiments, A. mellifera avoided their own haemolymph and their own sting alarm pheromone, but did not avoid the haemolymph or sting gland contents of B. impatiens or native bumblebees (Bombus vosnesenskii) that regularly foraged around their hives. One factor behind the response of B. impatiens to heterospecific cues of predation may be its habit of solitary foraging, which may lead to more interactions with heterospecifics than would social foraging in which bees recruit nestmates to resources.

AB Male wolf spiders, Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz) (Araneae: Lycosidae), produce a complex courtship behaviour called jerky tapping. This multimodal display contains both visual and seismic components, and may convey information on condition. Previous work has shown that females prefer males that are in better condition, but questions remain about how condition affects male signalling. We tested whether male seismic signals are condition dependent by first categorizing components of the signal as either dynamic or static, based on how the components are produced. Dynamic signals (i.e. signalling rate) may vary with current condition while static signals (i.e. carrier frequency) do not. Second, we manipulated male body condition (1) by comparing spiders reared in natural (field-caught, FC) and artificial (laboratory-reared, LR) environments, and (2) by conducting a food limitation experiment in which FC spiders were fed or starved for 3 weeks. Laboratory-reared spiders were in better condition and performed courtship more vigorously than did FC spiders. LR spiders also produced seismic signals that were lower in amplitude, higher in frequency and shorter in duration than those produced by FC spiders (indicative of a more attractive signal). Starved and fed spiders did not differ statistically in static traits (i.e. frequency) but differed statistically in some dynamic signalling traits (i.e. courtship vigour). Some changes in dynamic attributes of well-fed spiders resembled those of LR spiders, supporting the hypothesis that seismic signals are condition dependent, as natural wolf spider populations probably exist under food-limited conditions, which may explain a large portion of the variability in signalling attributes.

AB Bird colonies are potentially rich sources of social information that can be used to compensate for the numerous disadvantages of communal life. This information can reduce uncertainty about nest locations, mates or food sources. However, there is little empirical evidence that colonies can actually serve as an information exchange point. We asked whether a large nesting colony of ring-billed gulls, Larus delawarensis, could provide its members with social information about the quality and location of food resources during the chick-rearing period. We first determined whether social information was available in the colony, then whether it was signalled by some reliable cue, and finally, whether the birds used it by following knowledgeable individuals. We combined observations of flight departure bearings at the colony with flight tracks obtained from birds fitted with global positioning system (GPS) data loggers. We found that reliable information about feeding site locations could be obtained by observing the vanishing bearings of gulls leaving their nest. Birds nesting in different parts of the colony flew in different directions to reach their feeding grounds, but this did not influence the type of food brought to the chicks. To test whether gulls actually followed departing individuals, we searched for temporal clumping of departures and bearings for different time intervals during a day. We found that departures of gulls nesting in the same neighbourhood were not temporally clustered, nor did the gulls tend to leave in the same direction as their previously departing neighbours. We conclude that ring-billed gulls do not appear to use social information at the nest site to locate foraging opportunities. However, stopovers on nearby water or along the colony edge after a short flight from the nest could allow exchange of information that we could not document.

AB Social costs are one mechanism whereby reliability in signalling systems can be maintained. We measured the strength of aggressive response to territorial playback to ask whether the reliability of 'soft song', a strongly aggressive signal in the song sparrow, Melospiza melodia, is enforced by a social cost in the form of the receiver's aggressive response. We also asked whether this cost is imposed by all receivers, or whether a differential response is found primarily or exclusively among the most aggressive subjects. We first measured the strength of each male's aggressive response to playback on his territory, and then tested his responses to 'warbled' soft song and to broadcast song playbacks. While we found substantial variation in individual aggressiveness, nearly all males responded more strongly to warbled soft songs. Thus we provide evidence that warbled soft song imposes a social cost in the form of receiver retaliation, and provide a possible explanation for how the signal's reliability is maintained. Questions about soft song remain, notably why selection should favour low amplitude in vocal signals of aggression in songbirds. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Inbreeding is generally rare in large, natural populations yet mate choice often appears to be random with respect to kinship. This suggests that the risks of inbreeding may be small because passive mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance, for example dispersal, are effective at lowering inbreeding risk. Previous theoretical and empirical studies have assumed that the risks of inbreeding are constant over an individual's life span, but in the lek-breeding black grouse, inbreeding increases with female age. To determine whether inbreeding avoidance mechanisms are also age dependent, we generated four null models of random mate choice ranging from complete randomness to more biologically realistic mate choice criteria and compared these to 8 years of data on inbreeding levels at four different female age classes. We additionally tested whether mate fidelity decreased inbreeding risk. Observed inbreeding in female age classes 1, 2 or >= 3 were not significantly different from random, but was approximately 3.5 times higher in female age class >= 4. Alternative models using mate choice criteria showed no significant differences between observed and expected levels for any age class. Our results are in line with previous studies on noncooperatively breeding passerine birds, which indicate that mating is random with respect to kinship and that increased inbreeding in older females can be explained by reduced male availability caused by restrictive mate choice criteria. We also found that individuals that switched mates significantly increased relatedness to partners suggesting that mate fidelity may have evolved as an important passive inbreeding avoidance mechanism.

AB It is well established that communication in social organisms often occurs within a network of individuals rather than within signaller-receiver dyads. Most of these investigations, however, have not assessed how other social factors might influence communication. In the present study, we investigated whether previous exposure to an opponent influences audience effects on male-male interactions in Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens. Males interacted with an unfamiliar opponent or a familiar opponent in the presence of a male, a female or no audience. Opponent-directed gill flaring was greatest when opponents were unfamiliar with one another and a male audience was present. In contrast, opponent-directed tail beats were most frequent when a female audience was present, especially when opponents were unfamiliar. Opponent familiarity appears to have a greater effect on opponent-directed gill flaring than on tail beats. This may reflect the difference in the function of these behaviours as tail beats are commonly used in courtship as well as during aggressive encounters. Our findings suggest that audience type and the social history of the opponents work together to influence aggressive interactions in this species.

AB Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV) provide important information that influences host location behaviour for insect natural enemies, such as parasitoid wasps, that develop in the bodies of herbivorous insects. The dietary breadth of both the parasitoid and its host may affect the extent to which a searching parasitoid relies on HIPV. Specialist species are expected to rely on specific volatile cues to which they respond innately, whereas generalists are expected to show a higher degree of phenotypic plasticity that depends on foraging experience in the parasitoid. We compared the response to HIPV emitted by different plant species damaged by host and nonhost caterpillars for two congeneric parasitoid species, the specialist Diadegma semiclausum and the generalist Diadegma fenestrale, attacking caterpillars of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. For the three tested plant species, Brassica oleracea, a feral Brassica population and Sinapis alba, both parasitoid species preferred volatiles from host-infested plants over those produced by undamaged plants. However, both parasitoid species only distinguished between volatiles induced by host and nonhosts when the caterpillars had been feeding on B. oleracea, the plant on which they had been reared. Chemical analysis of the volatile blends could not explain volatile preferences of the parasitoids. Despite the difference in their dietary breadth, the two parasitoids responded similarly to HIPV and experience treatments. A flexible response to a wide array of volatile blends by parasitoids is probably important in nature, given that different generations of the host and the parasitoid probably develop on different food plants.

AB Social insects rely extensively on interactions to coordinate their activities. Some studies have recently explored several attributes of insect colonies from a network perspective, providing evidence of variation in connectivity patterns among group members. The temporal stability of interaction networks, however, has rarely been examined. In this study, ants of the species Odontomachus hastatus were individually equipped with passive microtransponders to collect their spatial positions in artificial nests automatically. Colonies were surveyed for 3 consecutive weeks to build weighted networks of proximity between ants. The analysis revealed important interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and showed that proximity networks were stable over time. The removal of the queen did not impact the patterns of association between workers, confirming that she did not contribute to shaping network structure. Ants forming long-lasting associations with a small number of nestmates exhibited a reduced tendency to move. In contrast, mobile workers were more likely to interact homogeneously with their nestmates and did not display any privileged associations.

AB Gaze following, the ability to follow the direction in which others are looking, is thought to allow individuals to acquire valuable information from their physical and social environment. Recent studies, using artificial stimuli, showed that gaze following can be modulated by social factors such as dominance or social context, suggesting the importance of integrating these factors in future cognitive studies to understand better the evolution and function of gaze following. Whether this finding still holds true when animals are tested with conspecifics is unknown. Moreover, additional social factors remain to be tested. Testing live conspecifics, we show that friendship (i.e. strong positive bonds between individuals) improved gaze-following responses in a tolerant primate: the crested macaque. Subjects did not follow the gaze of friends more often, but in dyads characterized by a high friendship index, subjects were quicker to react to gaze cues. The increased social tolerance characteristic of crested macaques' social relationships may lessen the constraints imposed by dominance and kinship, thus allowing sociocognitive abilities to be better used among friends. Together with previous findings, our results suggest the importance of relationship quality and species' social style in shaping primate cognition.

AB A variety of nectarivorous species have demonstrated a bias to 'win-shift' (shift away from/avoid locations that have recently yielded food, as opposed to 'win-stay' behaviour where the animal returns to such locations). Since recently exploited flowers contain no nectar, the win-shift bias is a candidate for an adaptive specialization of cognition. This bias tends to manifest as faster learning and/or better performance on a win-shift than a win-stay task. In standard win-shift/win-stay tasks (multiple two-phase trials where animals first find rewards in particular locations, and must subsequently avoid, or return to, such locations) noisy miners, Manorina melanocephala, and rainbow lorikeets, Trichoglossus haematodus, developed patterns of revisits/errors in the exploration phases that corresponded to the spatial contingency they experienced in the test phases: birds reinforced to shift revisited locations in the exploration phase that were unrewarded; birds reinforced to stay revisited rewarded ones. This was true even for birds that failed to shift or stay appropriately in the test phase itself. This suggests that the poorer performance of nectarivorous birds in win-stay than win-shift tasks may not be a consequence of an inability to learn the win-stay contingency. Our results suggest that these birds are equally sensitive to the win-shift and win-stay contingencies. This implies that, if the win-shift bias previously reported in nectarivorous birds is an example of a cognitive adaptation to the depleting nature of nectar, then the specially adapted mechanisms may have more to do with inhibition of the win-stay response than insensitivity to the win-stay contingency.

AB The design of animal signals is believed to reflect the combined effect of the sensory system of receivers, the type of environment in which communication is being conducted, and the distance signals must travel in that environment. Although empirical studies have examined how each of these factors might separately explain the structure of signals used by animals within species, comparative evidence supporting the predicted interaction of the sensory system, environment and transmission range in the generation of species differences in communication is lacking. I studied the long-range visual displays used by male Caribbean Anolis lizards to advertise territory ownership. The type of movements included in advertisement displays was closely predicted by the motion detection capabilities of the visual system for a given distance and the compounding effects of environmental conditions at the time of display production. Furthermore, the motion detection of Anolis receivers predicted almost precisely the type of movements included in advertisement displays among closely related species from two separate island radiations. My study provides rare comparative evidence illustrating how the sensory system of receivers sets the minimum requirements for what constitutes an effective signal, given the transmission distance of signals, with further variance in signal structure resulting from the environmental conditions occurring at the time of communication.

AB Evolution of parental care behaviour has been of considerable interest to behavioural ecologists for a long time. Incubation feeding, where an individual incubating eggs is provisioned by another individual, is an important component of avian parental care. It may be critical for breeding success by allowing the incubating bird to spend more time on the eggs. However, very little is known about environmental factors shaping incubation feeding, and incubation behaviour in general, of tropical and southern hemisphere birds, and how this differs compared to northern hemisphere species. We collated available data on the rate of incubation feeding in Australian, New Zealand and North American songbirds (78 species from 25 families). There was a strong positive relationship between female incubation attentiveness and incubation feeding by males; however, female attentiveness was higher in North America than in Australia and New Zealand for the same intensity of male incubation feeding. Incubation feeding was not related to species body mass, social organization, geographical latitude or ambient temperature. It differed significantly between families, but overall was not different between regions. Incubation feeding rate was related to nest predation rate, but differently in the two regions. It increased with nest predation rate in Australia and New Zealand, but decreased with nest predation rate in North America. We suggest that this may be caused by different predatore-prey interactions in North America versus Australia and New Zealand, which could have shaped the evolution of incubation feeding differently.

AB Songbirds often sing at higher frequency (pitch) in urban, noise-polluted areas, which reduces acoustic masking by low-frequency anthropogenic noise. Such frequency shifts, however, are less efficient at overcoming background noise than simply singing louder. Therefore, it was suggested that high-frequency singing might not be a functional adjustment to noise, but a physiological consequence of singing louder (also known as the Lombard effect). We tested for the first time the main tenet of this hypothesis, for birdsong whether increasing sound amplitude has a concomitant effect on song frequency, using a representative species with higher urban minimum frequency, the dark-eyed junco, Junco hyemalis. The frequency bandwidth of songs and syllables increased with amplitude, involving lower minimum frequency in louder songs and syllables. Therefore, louder singing does not explain the higher minimum frequency of urban dark-eyed juncos. Amplitude and peak frequency were weakly positively related across but not within songs, suggesting that increased frequency is not an obligatory outcome of singing louder. Instead, birds may adjust both amplitude and frequency in response to changing noise or motivation across songs. Our results suggest that adjustments in song frequency and amplitude are largely independent and, thus, can be complementary rather than alternative vocal adjustments to noise. We discuss oscine vocal physiology and details of the behaviour of urban birds, both of which we argue are consistent with the increased frequency of urban birdsong generally being a functional adjustment to noise, rather than a consequence of singing louder.

AB The self-fertilizing mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus, can produce homozygous 'clonal' offspring and are highly tolerant of severe environmental conditions, including air exposure (emersion) for weeks at a time. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) individual fish that voluntarily emerse more possess gill and skin features better suited for life on land than fish that emerse less often, and (2) individual differences in emersion tendencies cause these morphological changes. We predicted that individuals spending more time in air would have a reduced gill surface area (shorter, thicker gill lamellae and well developed interlamellar cell masses (ILCM)) and a thicker cutaneous epidermis compared to fish preferring to remain in water. These differences were predicted to disappear if fish were prevented from emersing and predicted to reappear if fish were once again allowed to emerse. Fish were videorecorded for 7 days while voluntarily moving between aquatic and terrestrial habitats to determine individual emersion tendencies. We prevented a subset of fish from emersing for 7 days, and then allowed a subset of these fish to emerse for a final 7 days. We found that individual fish spent anywhere from 0 to 78% of the time emersing. Emersion time was positively correlated with gill ILCM height, but not with any other morphological feature. There was no relationship between ILCM height and emersion time after fish were prevented from emersing for 7 days, but this relationship reappeared when fish were once again able to emerse. These results indicate that genetically identical K. marmoratus show highly variable behavioural phenotypes that influence gill remodelling. Fish that voluntarily spend more time emersed reduce gill surface area, a modification that may limit branchial water loss and provide support for gill lamellae. This is the first report of respiratory morphologies linked to variation in behavioural phenotype. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In social species with fission-fusion dynamics, individuals have the opportunity to recruit other individuals selectively by calling. An individual's decision to call to another could be determined by previous interactions with that individual, which would require individuals to be able to discriminate others based on their vocalizations and associate knowledge with their vocal identity. Alternatively, this decision may be determined solely by the current interaction. In a playback experiment, we tested the ability of orange-fronted conures, Aratinga canicularis to discriminate between calls of familiar and unfamiliar females. Males were able to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar calls from different females. Furthermore, test birds seemed to associate experience from the previous interaction with the vocal characteristics of the familiar call, but this result was marginally nonsignificant. The success of the playback in imitating the test bird's contact call in the current interaction proved important, as high similarity between playback and the test bird's contact calls elicited a stronger response from it. The importance of call imitation during current interactions probably reflects the fact that orange-fronted conures live in flocks with fission-fusion dynamics and therefore often interact with unfamiliar individuals.

AB Sexual selection theory often predicts that female preferences will produce directional selection for male traits that either reinforces or opposes male-male competition. However, without considering the complexity of preference functions and the potential for adaptive variation in female mate preferences, the direction of selection due to female preference can be misidentified. Previous studies have suggested that female preference opposed male-male competition in the evolution of the large, sexually dimorphic dorsal fin in the swordtail fish, Xiphophorus birchmanni. We present two lines of evidence to suggest that female preference selects for enlarged dorsal fins in male X. birchmanni, and therefore female preferences are not directional for small dorsal fins, but instead are potentially disruptive. Xiphophorus birchmanni females prefer dorsal fins that are larger than expected given the male's size, and during male-female interactions, males raise their dorsal fins as part of their courtship display directed towards females. We argue that selection due to female preference is likely to be much more complex than is often considered. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social assortativity, where individuals preferentially mix with certain conspecifics, is widespread among a diverse range of taxa. Animals may assort by a variety of characteristics and receive substantial benefits from these interactions, such as a reduction in predation risk, increased foraging efficiency or greater access to resources. We investigated the social network structure of an embayment population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, using a long-term photoidentification data set, and examined the impact of sex and kinship in maintaining the cohesion of the social network. We applied recently developed social network techniques that incorporate uncertainty into statistical measures to delineate four smaller social groups within two previously defined communities. Temporal stability of associations within social groups was substantially greater than among individuals from different groups. We also found that the dolphin population was not strongly segregated by sex and both males and females had similar degrees of social connectivity in the network. Moreover, genetic analyses showed that relatedness had a greater influence on female than on male social relationships, as association strength was positively correlated with genetic relatedness between females and between female and male pairs, but not between males. These results suggest that females and males may target kin interactions with females and that kinship appears to be important for maintaining the cohesiveness of this dolphin social network.

AB Cooperative-breeding studies tend to focus on a few alloparental behaviours in highly cooperative species exhibiting high reproductive skew and the associated short-term, but less frequently long-term, fitness costs. We analysed a suite of alloparental behaviours (assessed via filming) in a kin-structured, high-density population of plurally breeding European badgers, Meles meles, which are not highly cooperative. Group members, other than mothers, performed alloparental behaviour; however, this was not correlated with their relatedness to within-group young. Furthermore, mothers babysat, allogroomed cubs without reciprocation, and allomarked cubs more than other members of the group (controlling for observation time). For welfare reasons, we could not individually mark cubs; however, the number observed pre-independence never exceeded that trapped. All 24 trapped cubs, in three filmed groups, were assigned both parents using 22 microsatellites. Mothers may breed cooperatively, as the time they babysat their assigned, or a larger, litter size did not differ. Furthermore, two mothers probably allonursed, as they suckled more cubs than their assigned litter size. An 18-year genetic pedigree, however, detected no short-term (litter size; maternal survival to the following year) or long-term (offspring breeding probability; offspring lifetime breeding success) fitness benefits with more within-group mothers or other members of the group. Rather, the number of other members of the group (excluding mothers) correlated negatively with long-term fitness. Mothers may tolerate other members of the group, as nonbreeders undertook more digging. Our study highlights that alloparental care varies on a continuum from that seen in this high-density badger population, where alloparenting behaviour is minimal, through to species where alloparental care is common and provides fitness benefits.

AB In mammals, yawning is associated with social and physiological stress, as well as thermoregulation, but little is known about why yawning occurs in stressful contexts or how it is integrated with natural stressors. To investigate the stress sensitivity of yawning in birds, we exposed budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) to a handling stressor that simulated a predatory encounter. Each bird was captured, gently held for 4 min, and then released and videotaped for 1 h (experimental). On a separate day (+/- 24 h), the undisturbed animal was videotaped for 1 h (control). The relationship between handling-induced yawning and body temperature was assessed in a separate experiment, in which the underwing temperatures of the same birds were measured at 1 min intervals during a 4 min holding period. After handling stress, yawning frequency was initially suppressed, then sharply increased within 20 min. Underwing temperature increased during handling, and individuals' final temperatures at minute 4 were negatively correlated with their latencies to yawn after handling. Thus, stress-induced hyperthermia may be responsible for associations between yawns and stress. These results indicate that yawning may offer a sensitive, noninvasive measure of stress in birds.

AB Offspring begging provides parents with an honest signal of short-term nutritional need (i.e. hunger). However, offspring that have experienced contrasting levels of long-term food intake may beg differently for a given level of short-term need, perhaps as a result of developmental differences in behaviour and/or physiology. We tested for the effects of both short- and long-term need on begging and digestion by manipulating food intake rates of the junior and senior nestlings from broods of pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca. Artificial food intake at natural levels created stable and normal levels of begging in both senior and junior nestlings, over 10 h of hand-feeding individuals in isolation. In both classes of nestling, higher than natural levels of food intake led to similar progressive linear declines in begging effort, while lower than natural levels of food intake led to similar progressive increases in begging. However, there were no corresponding changes in digestive efficiency (assimilable mass coefficient). Consistent with previous studies, junior nestlings begged at consistently higher rates throughout compared with senior nestlings. There was also evidence that digestion by junior nestlings was slightly more efficient, but individual variation in begging effort (and change in begging effort) did not correspond to differences in digestive efficiency. These results show that begging does not reflect digestive efficiency across a range of natural food intake rates, and suggest that the honesty of offspring solicitation signals, such as the differences in begging between junior and senior nestlings, are not maintained by contrasting digestive development or function.

AB Ptilothrix fructifera is a solitary, oligolectic bee dependent on the flowers of Opuntia (Cactaceae). We conducted field studies to identify the mating tactics used by P. fructifera males and to determine whether factors such as male body size and available resource flowers contribute to variation in male mating tactic. Males in a population in southern Brazil showed pronounced variation in body size, but no distinct size classes. Larger males aggressively defended territories of flowering Opuntia plants, the sole pollen source for the females. Smaller males nonaggressively patrolled nonflowering shrubs growing between the nest aggregation and patches of Opuntia. Only unmated females were attractive to males. When offered to males in patrolled shrubs, up to eight males attempted to mate with the same female, but in territories only the territory owner mated with the introduced female. About 10 min after mating, females were unattractive to males. These results identify the species as monogamous and indicate that territoriality is an adaptive mating tactic. Experimental addition of Opuntia flowers to patrolled shrubs showed that nonterritorial males can switch to territorial behaviour. Thus, the number of available flowers together with the number of competitor males determines the ratio of territorial males to patrolling males at a given site. The experiment shows that male P. fructifera show a conditional reproductive strategy in which males adopt alternative tactics according to their size.

AB The study of movements of individual organisms in heterogeneous environments is of primary importance for understanding the effect of habitat composition on population patterns. We developed a new experimental methodology to measure individual movements of walking insects, based on radiotracking. Our aims were to understand the link between habitat heterogeneity and moving patterns, and to characterize the movements with dynamic models of diffusion. We tracked individual movements of adults of Cosmopolites sordidus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) with passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags under different field management practices. Diffusion models based on recapture data indicated a subdiffusive movement of this species. Substantial variation was found between individual paths, but this variation was not sex dependent. Movement of released C. sordidus was affected by banana planting pattern and the presence/absence of crop residues but not by the presence of a cover crop between rows of bananas or by banana variety. These results show that the RFID technology is useful for evaluating the dispersal parameters of cryptic insects in heterogeneous environments.

AB Sea hares release an ink secretion composed of purple ink and white opaline as a potential chemical defence against predators. The aim of our study was to identify deterrent molecules in the ink of Aplysia californica against an allopatric generalist crustacean predator, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, and to define the mechanisms of action of the deterrents against crabs. We used two behavioural assays, a squirting assay and an ingestion assay, to show that ink is highly effective and that opaline is moderately effective in suppressing feeding of crabs. Results with reversibly blinded crabs demonstrate that the deterrence is mediated through the crabs' chemical senses. We used bioassay-guided fractionation to identify the purple molecules aplysioviolin and phycoerythrobilin as a major and minor deterrent, respectively, in ink against crabs. These molecules derive from a light-harvesting protein in the photosynthetic system of dietary algae. This is the first demonstration of an animal converting a photosynthetic pigment into a chemical deterrent. Mixing opaline and ink enzymatically produces hydrogen peroxide, which also functions as a chemical deterrent against crabs. Our results and those of other studies show that sea hares use a diversity of molecules in their skin, mucus and ink secretion to chemically defend themselves against their potential predators. Aplysioviolin, phycoerythrobilin and hydrogen peroxide also exist in ink secretion of Aplysia dactylomela, a sea hare sympatric to blue crabs, and thus we posit that these molecules are potentially effective in ecologically relevant predator-prey interactions and need to be scrutinized in more ecologically relevant experiments.

AB Eusocial animal societies, as diverse as those found in the ants, bees, wasps, shrimp and naked mole-rats, are structured around one or few reproductive females. The remaining females are helpers called 'workers' that are mostly sterile. A paradigm in studies of eusociality is that worker sterility is a key to societal functions because advanced sociality cannot be achieved when there is conflict over reproduction. Yet, traits such as sensory responsiveness, foraging and hoarding behaviour that change between female reproductive life stages also vary between workers. This variation is central to worker division of labour, a complex social trait believed to be instrumental for the ecological success of animal societies. Thus, we took a step back from established views on worker sterility and societal functions, and hypothesized that division of labour can be better understood if adaptive variation in worker behaviour is seen as emerging from pre-existing mechanisms associated with female reproduction. In exploring this reproductive ground plan hypothesis (RGPH) in honeybee workers, we established that variation in foraging division of labour correlates with ovary size and is affected by expression changes in vitellogenin, an egg yolk protein precursor. Here, we explain and reconcile the RGPH with data on honeybee sensory sensitivity, genomic mapping, transcript and endocrine pro. ling, and link our discussion with Ihle et al. (2010, this issue, pp. 1001-1006). The findings bring together mechanistic and evolutionary explanations of honeybee worker behaviour. This essay suggests that a broader view on worker reproductive traits can increase the understanding of animal social behaviour. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Cooperatively breeding groups are often made up of a mixture of related and unrelated individuals. In such groups, being able to identify and differentially cooperate with relatives can bring indirect fitness benefits to helpers. We investigated the kin recognition abilities of the cooperatively breeding African cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, while controlling for familiarity between individuals. When given a choice of associating with unfamiliar kin or unfamiliar nonkin, juvenile N. pulcher spent significantly longer associating with kin. Although both chemical and visual cues were required to stimulate the fish, chemical cues were more important than visual cues in kin recognition in this species. As all stimulus fish were reared separately from the focal fish, we can also conclude that N. pulcher used phenotype matching rather than familiarity to assess relatedness to other individuals. Furthermore, when given the choice of associating with familiar over unfamiliar kin, N. pulcher showed no significant preference. Hence, relatedness rather than familiarity appears to be more important in the association preferences of N. pulcher. This is advantageous, particularly if familiar individuals within the cooperatively breeding group are not necessarily relatives. In highly social species such as N. pulcher, being able to recognize kin can bring fitness advantages through kin selection and inbreeding avoidance.

AB Grouping behaviour is widespread across the animal kingdom, and is known to reduce an individual's risk of predation, for example through predator confusion. Theory predicts that individuals that are different in appearance to the rest of the group are at a greater risk of predation because they are more conspicuous to predators (the 'oddity' effect). Thus, animals should choose group mates that are the most similar in appearance to themselves. Another common antipredator tactic is crypsis (camouflage). Fishes are capable of changing colour to match their visual background, but few studies have examined how this might influence shoaling decisions, particularly in the context of the oddity effect. We induced colour pattern changes in a colourful species of freshwater fish, the western rainbowfish, Melanotaenia australis, by maintaining fish in dark and pale aquaria for 2 weeks. Analysis of the proportion of black body pigmentation confirmed that rainbowfish in dark environments developed darker colour patterns than those held in pale environments. We then conducted behavioural observations to determine whether fish subsequently based their shoaling decisions on body coloration. We found that rainbowfish preferred to shoal with similar individuals; fish that had been held in dark aquaria preferred to shoal with other dark fish and fish from pale aquaria preferred other pale fish. Our findings are consistent with the predictions of the oddity effect and demonstrate how morphological colour pattern changes and behavioural decisions interact to mediate antipredator tactics in fish.

AB Prey often avoid their predators but may, under certain conditions, remain in or even shift to space where predators are relatively abundant when threatened. Here, we review studies of habitat choices by multiple, sympatric prey species at risk from a shared predator to show that the defensive decision to avoid or select predator-rich space is contingent on prey escape behaviour. We suggest that prey species with escape tactics offering little chance of survival following an encounter should seek predator scarcity, whereas those with tactics whose post-encounter effectiveness is spatially correlated with predator abundance should be most likely to match the distribution of their predators. Furthermore, we argue that the nature of the defensive spatial response of a prey species with a particular escape tactic also depends on the hunting approach used by its predator and the setting of the predator-prey interaction (i.e. landscape features). Accordingly, an integrated approach that accounts for prey escape behaviour and the context provided by predator hunting mode and landscape features should lead to a better understanding of antipredator spatial shifts and improve our ability to anticipate the consequences of changes in predator numbers for prey distributions and ecosystem dynamics. We conclude by encouraging further exploration of contingency in antipredator behaviour and the possibility that generalist predators might indirectly influence prey resources and community properties via diverse pathways that are mediated by spatial shifts of prey species with different escape tactics.

AB In captivity, male brown-headed cowbirds can develop adult song repertoires by the time they are sexually mature at approximately 1 year, as is the case for most songbirds studied to date. However, in the wild it generally takes 2 years for cowbirds to reach this stage. We have postulated that a crucial step in this protracted development involves a sensory learning phase during a male's first breeding season when he memorizes de novo many of his adult songs. To test this hypothesis, we exposed yearling cowbirds that had been housed in acoustic isolation since being taken from the wild as juveniles to different song culture environments. One cohort of yearlings was housed with adult males (tutors) from the Mammoth Lakes, California, U.S.A., dialect (Mam) where the juveniles had been trapped, while another cohort was housed with adults from an unfamiliar dialect, Santa Barbara, California, U.S.A. (SB). One year later when the tutee birds were recorded as 2-year-old adults, all 10 males in the Mam cohort had developed song repertoires typical of adults in the Mam dialect. In contrast, only 1 of 11 SB males had a single Mam song. Four of the SB cohort produced copies of their SB tutors' songs while the majority of SB tutees produced new song types that were shared exclusively by the SB tutees in 2007. The current results offer new experimental evidence to support our model for delayed vocal development in wild cowbirds based on environmental constraints that can also affect vocal ontogeny in other songbirds.

AB Among vertebrates, particularly birds, evidence for facultative adjustment of brood sex ratios is inconsistent. Results from cooperatively breeding species are clearer, where sex-biased dispersal and helping behaviour may accentuate any differences in fitness payoffs to parents of raising sons versus daughters. We might expect similar payoff differences for cooperative helpers raising offspring of each sex, but this has rarely been tested. Bell miners, Manorina melanophrys, are known to adjust their primary brood sex ratio according to habitat productivity. Helpers of both sexes provision broods even when unrelated to offspring, which indicates the potential importance of direct fitness benefits (e.g. group augmentation) that should depend heavily on offspring sex. As only females disperse, we anticipated helpers would invest more heavily in male-biased broods, particularly if they were unrelated to broods and thus not gaining indirect benefits. Helpers did feed all-male broods at a greater rate, although, contrary to expectations, this was the result of higher levels of effort by related and not unrelated helpers, irrespective of helper sex. The subsequent interaction between relatedness and brood sex ratio was also an exclusively between-subjects effect, and not due to any within-subject facultative adjustment by individual helpers feeding at multiple nests. Furthermore, the acoustic characteristics of nestling begging calls showed no reliable sex differences; thus helpers probably lacked accurate information on nestling sex to make facultative adjustments according to brood sex ratio. Additional work examining these kinds of trade-offs in other cooperative species where sons and daughters yield differing payoffs to helpers is warranted.

AB Males generally compete for females through courtship and aggression (conventional sex roles). However, sex roles are reversed in some species and can even vary between populations or over time within a single species. The operational sex ratio (OSR), the sex ratio of ready-to-mate individuals, is a central factor proposed to explain the strength and direction of mating competition. Density can both act as a cue for OSR and have its own effects on competition. In the two-spotted goby, Gobiusculus flavescens, a seasonal switch in sex roles coincides with a change in OSR from male to female biased and a decrease in male density. This dynamic system provides an ideal opportunity to test the effects of OSR and density on competitive behaviour experimentally. In an aquarium experiment, we created two different sex ratios at two different densities and observed courtship and agonistic behaviour in both sexes. We changed sex ratio to equality after 4 days of treatment, to test for a lag in the behavioural response. Contrary to our predictions, males courted more after prolonged exposure to a female-biased sex ratio, although we also found a tendency for a positive effect of male density on male courtship frequency. We did not find any other effects of treatment on either male or female behaviour. Furthermore, we did not find evidence for a lag in the response to a change in density or sex ratio. We conclude that OSR and density did not affect individual frequencies of behaviour in the expected direction. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB When foraging in a landscape, predators choose travelling directions according to their immediate knowledge of prey distribution within their perceptual fields and, when appropriate, to their past foraging experience. A substantial part of foraging theory is based on patch use in spatially implicit domains, and rarely has it considered foraging paths involving directional choices driven by memory and perception. Using a model mixing directed and random movements of a predator, we investigated how perception range and duration of spatial memory influence the long-term intake rate of a central place forager depending on prey spatial distribution. We found that intake rate increased and eventually saturated with increasing perception range regardless of prey spatial distribution. In contrast, the effect of spatial memory duration was mediated by the level of prey spatial aggregation. Assuming that an increase in memory or perception abilities has a cost, we found that it was not beneficial to possess simultaneously a wide perception range and a long-term spatial memory when prey distribution was aggregated. Moreover, when looking at the functional response of predators with different 'cognitive strategies', we found that those relying mainly on memory were limited by the prey global densities while those relying mainly on perception were limited by the level of prey aggregation. These results suggest that cognitive strategies might have evolved as a response to the prey spatial distribution and that prey spatial aggregation, not only prey global density, should be considered an important component of the functional response.

AB Group living in sharks is a widespread phenomenon but relatively little is known about the composition and organization of these groups. In binary choice field experiments juvenile lemon sharks were attracted to conspecifics presumably to form groups. Experiments investigating size assortment preferences indicated that lemon sharks aged 2-3 years (but not 0-1 years) preferred to spend more time with a group of size-matched individuals than unmatched ones. Furthermore, in species association tests lemon sharks spent significantly more time associating with conspecifics than with a sympatric heterospecific, the nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum. These findings enhance our knowledge of group joining decisions in sharks indicating that active mechanisms can play a role in the formation and composition of shark groups.

AB Indirect benefits derived by females that mate with males that express preferred traits are important to our understanding of 'good genes' models of sexual selection. However, few studies have explored male courtship behaviours with potential indirect benefits conferred to females in order to ascertain whether these behaviours serve as honest indicators of male quality. Using a common species of wolf spider, Pardosa milvina, we addressed the honesty of male courtship behaviours in two laboratory experiments. In our first experiment, we quantified the repeatability of courtship rate in adult males that were manipulated to be in high or low condition and were sequentially presented with adult virgin females that similarly differed in body condition. In our second experiment, we explored the effect of male courtship rate on several measures of fitness: number of offspring produced, days until offspring emerged and offspring viability measured as offspring survival. Our experiments show that male courtship rate is statistically significantly repeatable except when males in high condition have repeated encounters with females in low condition. Our results also reveal that females have the potential to gain indirect genetic benefits by mating with males that naturally court at high rates: females produced more offspring that emerged from eggsacs sooner and survived starvation better compared to females that mated with males that naturally courted at low rates. Our study provides additional support that male courtship rate is an honest indicator of quality, and it makes the novel finding that the repeatability of courtship rate is context sensitive.

AB Both cultural inheritance and cultural diversification of diets may play an important role in animal evolution. Here we studied how diet innovation and cultural change relate to cultural inheritance in a changing environment. We did this by studying diet cultures in group foragers adapting to environmental change through learning, and the consequences this has for diet differentiation between groups. We used an individual-based model of 'monkeys' that learn what to eat in a rich environment, and we changed resource species that are available in the environment. Relative to social influences on learning that arise spontaneously in groups, we found that more direct social learning, in the sense of observing another individual and copying what it eats, helps groups deal with high levels of environmental variability by generating greater group level incorporation of diet 'innovations' and enhancing cumulative cultural diet improvement. An important factor for the dual role of copying in diet innovation and cultural inheritance is how copying is mediated by foraging opportunities in the environment in the short term. During adaptation to environmental changes, groups diverge in diet. This is caused by differences in learning history and is increased when individuals copy each other, but this depends on migration. Furthermore, when groups live together in the same environment and compete for resources, diet differentiation is enhanced through what appears to be culturally mediated character displacement.

AB Pain may be inferred when the responses to a noxious stimulus are not reflexive but are traded off against other motivational requirements, the experience is remembered and the situation is avoided in the future. To investigate whether decapods feel pain we gave hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, small electric shocks within their shells. Only crabs given shocks evacuated their shells indicating the aversive nature of the stimulus, but fewer crabs evacuated from a preferred species of shell indicating a motivational trade-off. Some crabs that evacuated attacked the shell in the manner seen in a shell fight. Most crabs, however, did not evacuate at the stimulus level we used, but when these were subsequently offered a new shell, shocked crabs were more likely to approach and enter the new shell. Furthermore, they approached that shell more quickly, investigated it for a shorter time and used fewer cheliped probes within the aperture prior to moving in. Thus the experience of the shock altered future behaviour in a manner consistent with a marked shift in motivation to get a new shell to replace the one occupied. The results are consistent with the idea of pain in these animals. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Quantitatively characterizing the social structure of a population provides important insight into the forces shaping key population processes. Moreover, long-term social dynamics provide an avenue for understanding population-level responses to changes in socioecological conditions. This is particularly true for species that show natal philopatry and highly stable hierarchically structured social units, such as the piscivorous resident killer whales of the northeast Pacific. The southern resident killer whale population is a small, demographically closed population, comprising three commonly recognized pods (J,K and L pods), that has recently been listed as endangered throughout its range in both Canadian and U. S. A. waters. In this study, we quantitatively assessed social structure in this population from 29 years of photo-identification data to characterize significant temporal changes in sociality. Preferential affiliation among killer whales within both genealogical matrilines and pods was supported by two different analytical methods and, despite interannual variability, these social clusters persisted throughout the study. All three pods experienced fluctuations in social cohesion over time, but the overall rate of intrapod affiliation was consistently lowest within L pod, the largest of the southern resident pods. The most recent increase in fluidity within social units, occurring in the mid to late 1990s, was coincident with a significant decline in population size, suggesting a possible common response to external stressors. Quantifying these trends in social structure is the first step towards understanding the causes and consequences of long-term changes in killer whale social structure.

AB Extrapair fertilizations (EPFs) have been found in most socially monogamous passerine species. EPFs are generally beneficial for males because they increase the number of sired offspring. The benefit accrued by females, however, is less obvious. Maternal benefits may involve fertility insurance, increased genetic variability of the offspring, and improved offspring quality via compatible genes or 'good genes'. In a Hungarian population of the collared flycatcher, we investigated whether the occurrence of extrapair young (EPY) in a brood could be predicted by the traits of the females or their social mates, and whether EPY were superior to their half sibs in terms of growth and. edging condition. We found that 55.7% of the broods contained EPY. The females' participation in extrapair copulations (EPCs) was not related to any of the characteristics of their mates (body size, condition, wing and forehead patch size). The EPY did not differ from their half sibs in any measures of offspring quality. The half sibs had similar embryonic and postembryonic growth and. edged with similar body condition. Female body size was related to extrapair paternity: larger females were less likely to produce mixed-paternity broods. This suggests that the role of female traits in EPCs deserves more attention. We also found that male nestlings grew faster than females, although females could catch up by the time of. edging, so we argue that sex-dependent development should be taken into account in studies using nestling growth as a measure of nestling quality.

AB Male ungulates engage in intense competition for access to females during the breeding season. Although fights are generally dyadic level encounters, they are on occasion disrupted by the intervention of third-party males. We investigated these third-party interventions using predictions derived from Dugatkin's model (Dugatkin 1998, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 265, 433-437) of intervention behaviour. The model argues that when an individual successfully defeats an opponent there is an increase in the probability of winning a subsequent contest: a winner effect. Third-party intervention behaviour is predicted to occur as it serves to prevent either member of a competing dyad from successfully defeating his opponent, achieving a winner effect and subsequently becoming a threat to the intervener. Consistent with model predictions, our results show that intervening males held significantly higher rank than males that did not intervene and were also more likely to be dominant to both of the competing males. Intervening males did not selectively target competitors based on rank, nor did they target males based on overall dyadic rates of aggression between the intervener and competing males. Furthermore, interveners were more likely to have won their interaction immediately prior to intervention and were also likely to win their interaction subsequent to intervention when compared with contest success of the two competing males. Our results are consistent with predictions that support a winner effect for intervention behaviour in fallow deer fights. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The study of female preference for male traits is of primary importance for understanding the role of sexual selection in the evolution of natural populations. Female preference is usually investigated in controlled conditions to facilitate the manipulation of variables. However, such results are rarely confirmed in wild populations where many variables act together. Inferring the role of female preference in the outcome of reproduction thus requires field studies and a specific approach to behavioural data. We observed, over 2 years, the courtship behaviours of male and female brown trout in six populations distributed along a French watershed. We focused on behavioural items linked to female preference for male body size. We built a behavioural model describing the relationships between behaviour and female preference and estimated the parameters of the model using a Bayesian modelling approach. We found a significant preference for body size ratio: females tended to prefer males at least 1.45 times their own size. This preference varied between populations and was influenced by female size. Operational sex ratio had only a weak influence on female preference. Our model explained 44% of the observed variation in behaviour. Finally, because observed body size ratio at mating was generally greater than 1, we conclude that female preference plays a major role in the outcome of reproduction in wild populations of brown trout. These results are compared with existing knowledge and theory and their possible consequences at the population level are discussed. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Brood-parasitic birds such as cuckoos and cowbirds lay eggs with unusual by strong shells. Three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the adaptive significance of this trait. The present study focused on the puncture resistance hypothesis and tested its critical prediction that increased eggshell strength enhances the probability that the parasitic egg is accepted by the host. To address the problem, we experimentally parasitized marsh warbler, Acrocephalus palustris, nests with three types of real eggs having similar size but differing in eggshell strength and/or mimicry: (1) great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, eggs painted to be nonmimetic; (2) common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, eggs painted in the same way; and (3) unmanipulated cuckoo eggs. When we controlled for mimicry, ejection of strong-shelled (cuckoo) eggs was considerably more costly than ejection of weak-shelled (great reed warbler) eggs. However, nonmimetic cuckoo eggs were not more likely to be accepted than nonmimetic great reed warbler eggs, suggesting no effect of eggshell strength alone on rejection decisions. Mimetic cuckoo eggs were accepted more often than the eggs painted to be nonmimetic suggesting that mimicry primarily determines the probability of rejection. Thus, we found no support for the puncture resistance hypothesis in marsh warblers, which is a host with well-developed defence mechanisms against cuckoo parasitism.

AB A large variation in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of water is expected to limit activities of semi-aquatic insects, including submerged oviposition. Female water striders Aquarius paludum insularis (Heteroptera: Gerridae) perform submerged oviposition either in tandem pairs (with males on their backs) or singly. We allowed A. paludum females to oviposit in high- or low-DO water to examine the effects of DO concentration and the method of submersion (tandem pair or single female) on submerged oviposition. The duration of submersion and the number and depth of eggs oviposited were all greater in the high- DO water, but the females performed more bouts of submerged oviposition in the low-DO water. The duration of submersion was longer for tandem pairs than for single females in both the high- and low-DO water. In the high- DO water, the number and depth of eggs oviposited were greater for tandem pairs than for single females. The DO concentration did not affect the frequency of submerged oviposition by tandem pairs or by single females. We suggest that submerged oviposition with an accompanying male is beneficial for both sexes, because submersion is longer than for single females.

AB Primates rely on visual attention to gather knowledge about their environment. The ability to recognize such knowledge-acquisition activity in another may demonstrate one aspect of Theory of Mind. Using a series of experiments in which chimpanzees were presented with a choice between an experimenter whose visual attention was available and another whose vision was occluded, we asked whether chimpanzees understood the relationship between visual attention and knowledge states. The animals showed sophisticated understanding of attention from the first presentation of each task. Under more complex experimental conditions, the subjects had more difficulty with species-typical processing of attentional cues and those likely to be learned during human contact. We discuss the results with respect to the comparative impact of enculturation on chimpanzees. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In many animals females mate with multiple males during a single breeding season (polyandry), but the benefits of this mating system remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that polyandry ensures the fertilization of a female's ova (fertilization insurance hypothesis). We tested the fertilization insurance hypothesis in a natural population of African foam-nesting treefrogs, Chiromantis xerampelina, a species lacking male contest competition and in which females routinely mate with multiple males. We observed matings involving from one to 12 males and found that fertilization success was positively correlated with the number of mating males, but was unaffected by variance in clutch size or ambient temperature. Variance in fertilization success was also unrelated to the body size ratio of mating pairs. Critically, females that mated with more males also produced more tadpoles. These findings provide the first evidence that polyandry can benefit female frogs by increasing fertilization success and offspring production. We propose that fertilization insurance may account for the high incidence of simultaneous polyandry in frog species that use foam nests during breeding.

AB Theory predicts that individuals living in fission-fusion societies, in which group members frequently change subgroups, should modify grouping patterns in response to varying social and environmental conditions. Spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, are long- lived carnivores that reside in permanent social groups called clans. Clans are complex, fission-fusion societies in which individual members travel, rest and forage in subgroups that frequently change composition. We studied two clans in Kenya to provide the first detailed description of fission-fusion dynamics in this species. Because social and ecological circumstances can influence the cohesiveness of animal societies, we evaluated the extent to which specific circumstances promote the formation of subgroups of various sizes. We found that cooperative defence of shared resources during interclan competition and protection from lions were cohesive forces that promoted formation of large subgroups. We also tested hypotheses suggesting factors limiting subgroup size. Mothers with small cubs avoided conspecifics, thereby reducing infanticide risk. Victims of aggression either reconciled fights or separated from former opponents to reduce the immediate costs of escalated aggression in the absence of food. As predicted by the ecological constraints hypothesis, hyaenas adjusted their grouping patterns over both short and long time scales in response to feeding competition. Crocuta were most gregarious during periods of abundant prey, joined clanmates at ephemeral kills in numbers that correlated with the energetic value of the prey and gained the most energy when foraging alone because cooperative hunting attracted numerous competitors. Overall, our findings indicate that resource limitation constrains grouping in this species. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The expression of individual differences within a population often depends on environmental conditions. We investigated, first, whether there are differences between individual group-living forest tent caterpillars, Malacosoma disstria, that are expressed only in nutritionally unbalanced environments, and second, to what extent these individual behavioural differences influence the strategies used by the group to exploit food resources. We offered groups of caterpillars a binary choice between two equal food sources, either containing a balanced ratio of protein and carbohydrate or lacking digestible carbohydrate. Individual caterpillars responded to the diet treatment by becoming either inactive or active. The existence of these two behavioural categories was evident under dietary imbalance but not when foods were nutritionally balanced. At a collective level, the individual differences in behaviour led to colony decisions that were dependent upon the ratio of the two behavioural categories present in the group. Colonies comprising a majority of active caterpillars ('active biased') were less cohesive than inactive-biased colonies. Under dietary imbalance, active-biased groups did not focus their activity on one food source but split and exploited two sources at the same time. Since both food sources were nutritionally unbalanced, these groups grow less well than inactive-biased groups that remained on one food source. The coexistence of two foraging strategies may provide a compromise between maintaining colony cohesion and optimizing food location and diet balancing.

AB We investigated the effects of group size on egg-laying behaviour in the communally breeding, joint-nesting smooth-billed ani, Crotophaga ani. We tested the predictions of the competitive female egg-investment hypothesis, which states that females in plurally breeding, joint-nesting systems respond to increased group size and egg-laying competition by trying to skew the contents of the final incubated clutch of eggs in their own favour by tossing and/or burying competitors' eggs and by producing more of their own eggs. Results supported the predictions of the hypothesis as both the number of eggs produced per capita and the number of eggs lost per capita increased with increasing group size. Egg tossing and burial behaviours were almost entirely restricted to multifemale groups and 56% of the 829 eggs laid in communal nests were lost to either egg tossing or burial. As a consequence of this egg-laying competition, the number of eggs incubated per capita decreased with increasing group size. Large groups laid more eggs and took more time to synchronize laying than smaller groups. Finally, we found that chicks hatched late within a communal clutch were more likely than earlier hatching chicks to die during the first 5 days of life. We conclude that communal life in anis generates competition and egg production waste that reduces short-term per capita reproductive benefits. Long-term data are needed to clarify individual benefits associated with communal breeding in this species. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Despite the often dramatic negative effects of inbreeding on offspring fitness, matings between closely related individuals sometimes occur. This may be because females cannot reliably recognize related males before mating with them. As an alternative to precopulatory choice, polyandrous females may avoid inbreeding through postcopulatory mechanisms if they can assess mate relatedness during or after copulation. These mechanisms include increasing remating propensity and decreasing rate of offspring production in response to incestuous matings. Stored product pests, such as the bruchid beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, have an ecology that is likely to expose them to frequent risks of inbreeding when a small number of females found a new population on a previously uninfested store of beans. Using this species, we show that inbreeding has negative effects on offspring viability but that females do not appear to discriminate between brothers and unrelated males prior to mating. Furthermore, females that first mated with brothers did not increase their remating propensity or decrease their rate of offspring production relative to females that first mated with unrelated males. Our findings suggest that the costs of inbreeding have not been sufficient to drive the evolution of mating behaviour as a mechanism of inbreeding avoidance in C. maculatus.

AB The mechanisms whereby the reproductive behaviour and success of omnivorous insects are influenced by plant characteristics are poorly understood. We examined how the oviposition behaviour of zoophytophagous Orius insidiosus and the subsequent longevity of its progeny are influenced by the physical structure and internal anatomy of five plant species. Female O. insidiosus oviposit into plant species with the thinnest layers of epidermal and collenchyma cells, a decision that is significantly correlated with the survival of their offspring. Once a plant species is chosen, the female mainly bases her oviposition decisions on epidermal thickness and the surface density of hair-like appendages on the plants. That females laid more eggs and nymphs survived longer on plants with thinner external tissues suggest that the mechanisms that drive female oviposition decisions have evolved such that optimal plant-based resources are available for the females' progeny. Microscopic examination of plant anatomical features revealed that vascular and cellular tissues are fully accessible to the piercing-sucking mouthparts of the developing insects, suggesting that multiple sources of plant nutrients are available to this omnivore. The ecological implications of plant-based contributions to O. insidiosus fitness are discussed. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Formal models of trade-offs between individual and social learning predict situations in which animals should increase their reliance on socially acquired information. In three experiments, we found, that as theory predicts, 'dissatisfied' and 'uncertain' Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, increased their reliance on social learning. When choosing between two unfamiliar foods, rats that had been maintained for 1 week on either (experiment 1) an unpalatable, energetically dilute diet or (experiment 2) an unyielding surface in a hot, constantly illuminated room, as well as (experiment 3) rats uncertain as to which of two unfamiliar flavours that they had ingested was associated with illness showed greater reliance on socially acquired information than did their respective 'satisfied' and 'certain' controls.

AB There is considerable laboratory-based evidence that social learning plays a role in the behaviour of many animals, including fish. However, a weakness of such studies in fish, is that in virtually all to date, the behaviour showed could be learned asocially, with the social influence merely accelerating the rate of learning. Lefebvre & Palameta (1988. Social Learning. Psychological and Biological Perspectives. pp. 141-164) argued that the most compelling evidence for social learning comes from studies where inexperienced animals are unlikely to learn the target behaviour by themselves. The present study is designed to address this concern, by employing a feeding tube task in which fish gain access to food by swimming in a manner that they would not normally show. Employing a transmission chain design, we show foraging traditions in guppies, Poecilia reticulata, and southern platyfish, Xiphophorus maculatus, in which shoal members continue to exploit the food available in the feeding tube, in spite of changes in the composition of the shoal due to the gradual removal of demonstrators. Two experiments provide strong evidence for social learning underlying traditional behaviour, such as migratory routes, in fish, and reveal how the stability of such traditions (duration within a population) is affected by group size (2, 4 or 6 fish) and rate of turnover (16.5%, 25% or 50% per day). While larger shoals of fish showed more stable traditions than smaller shoals, this was found to be related to their slower rate of turnover rather than a direct effect of group size.

AB Lactation is the most energetically costly component of maternal investment in mammals. For large temperate herbivores, summer is characterized by relatively abundant forage but also high energetic needs for lactation and recovery from winter mass loss. We experimentally restricted food supply by about 20%, and compared the nursing and foraging behaviours of control and food-restricted adult female white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, and their fawns during lactation. We considered two fawn ages: 0-30 days ( after which time spent suckling dropped markedly) and 30-80 days ( the end of the nursing period). From 0 to 30 days of age, food-restricted fawns performed 17 more suckling bouts/day and spent twice as much time suckling than control fawns. Compared with controls, food-restricted fawns gained 26% less mass from birth to 80 days. Body growth was inversely related to time spent suckling and to the frequency of nursing bouts, but positively related to survival. Food-restricted fawns had twice as many suckling solicitations and rejected suckling attempts as control fawns. Solicitations for allosuckling and successful allosuckling bouts were also more than twice as high in the food-restricted group as in the control group. Mothers and fawns from the food-restricted group spent more time foraging than control individuals. We conclude that a reduction in food availability during summer, which may occur under high intraspecific competition, should lead to drastic changes in foraging and nursing behaviours as well as reduced growth rate of juveniles of large northern herbivores.

AB Cuckoos are faced with a series of reproductive decisions unique to the brood-parasitic lifestyle. Choice of the appropriate host to rear their young requires decision making at three levels. First, selection of a breeding site may take into account host densities in addition to environmental considerations. Second, once they have selected a breeding site, female cuckoos must ensure that they choose the nests of an appropriate host species to rear their young. Third, cuckoos may also choose among individuals of the host species in relation to the likelihood that the host will successfully rear their young. By observation and experiment, we investigated the factors that influenced annual parasitism rates and the mechanisms of host choice in Horsfield's bronze-cuckoos, Chalcites basalis. Parasitism rates varied from 0% to 37% annually, and were influenced by host density and spring rainfall. Despite the availability of several suitable hosts with similar nest sites within the same habitat, over 99% of Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo eggs were laid in superb fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus, nests, lending strong support to the Host Preference Hypothesis for host choice. Patterns of parasitism were nonrandom with respect to host female age and identity, but we found no evidence that cuckoos preferentially parasitized those individuals that were most likely to successfully rear their young.

AB During performance, racehorses gallop in an asymmetrical stride with either the left hindhoof striking the ground first ( right lead stride pattern) or the right hindhoof striking the ground first ( left lead stride pattern). In this study we examined racehorses for a stride pattern preference. Here, we showed that racehorses do have a preference for one stride pattern over the other. Across thoroughbreds, Arabians, and American Quarter horses 90% preferred their right lead stride pattern with 10% preferring the left. In a repeated studies test, a single racehorse consistently preferred one stride pattern over the other. We further showed that stride pattern preference is reflected in stride pattern usage during a 6-furlong morning work-out. Horses will run in their preferred stride pattern unless forced to switch while turning, injured, or fatigued ( at the end of the race). Finally, we showed that in a small sample, there were minor variations between the right and left lead stride patterns. Because running is intimately linked to respiration in performing racehorses, stride pattern preference might contribute to performance in racehorses.

AB By facilitating avoidance of kin competition and inbreeding, natal dispersal can have direct fitness consequences. Mechanisms that optimize indirect fitness may be equally important. When relatives compete for the same resources (kin competition), evolution of elevated dispersal rates can be favoured, so that most resource competition is among nonrelatives. When offspring are incapable of dispersing, maternal behaviour may influence natal dispersal in a positive way, by spreading offspring throughout the habitat. By combining laboratory and field observations, we studied dismounting behaviour of spiderlings from the maternal abdomen (i.e. maternal care) and mobility patterns of female wolf spiders, Pardosa monticola. Laboratory observations on the duration of maternal care indicated that spiderlings desert the maternal abdomen gradually within 185 h of hatching. Detailed behavioural monitoring within the spider's habitat showed that females carrying spiderlings on their back were more mobile with greater directionality of movement than females of other reproductive states. This alteration in female mobility, together with the gradual dismounting of offspring from the abdomen, indicates maternally induced natal 'hitchhiking' dispersal. These findings show that maternal effects may influence natal dispersal not only through condition dependence, but also by the active spreading of offspring throughout the habitat before they actively (decide to) disperse. This gradual dismounting of offspring is evolutionarily beneficial for the avoidance of kin competition. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We investigated whether male-specific territorial 'yodels' communicate information about individual size and condition in the common loon. Individuals in better condition and of larger body mass, but not larger structural body size, produced lower-frequency yodels, and changes in dominant frequencies of yodels between years reflected changes in male body mass and condition. An acoustic playback experiment indicated that potential receivers vocalized sooner and more often in response to low-frequency yodels, a possible indication that dominant frequencies of the yodel may communicate condition-dependent fighting abilities. Physiological constraints associated with mass and/or condition may preserve honest signalling by preventing small individuals from producing low-frequency yodels.

AB In colonial species, recognition of offspring should be under strong selection. For accurate identification to occur, offspring must produce individually distinctive signals and parents must be able to discriminate between signals. Female greater spear-nosed bats roost in stable social groups and use infant vocalizations, termed isolation calls, to locate and identify their young. In this study, we investigated both the production and perception of isolation calls in P. hastatus. First, we measured acoustic features of calls and found that, after controlling for ontogenetic effects, sufficient variation exists between pups for isolation calls to function as individual signatures. Moreover, calls of pups from the same social group were more similar in spectral and spectrotemporal features than were calls of pups from different social groups, indicating that these features are probably heritable. We used psychoacoustic experiments in the laboratory to determine whether adult females could discriminate between calls from pups in the same or different social group. Females discriminated between pups when faced with a template-matching task and their performance was correlated with the salience of spectral and spectrotemporal features. We found no difference in performance when females had to discriminate between pups from the same and different social groups. These results indicate that females should be able to accurately identify their young using isolation calls. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nuptial feeding can evolve as sensory traps where the male exploits the female's foraging motivation in a sexual context. The nuptial prey gift of the nursery-web spider Pisaura mirabilis is wrapped in white silk, and it has been suggested that males initially exploit the maternal care instinct by producing a nuptial gift that resembles the female's eggsac. In mating experiments we examined whether males exploit the female's foraging motivation or the female's maternal care instinct. We carried out a gift-switching experiment, where males presented an eggsac, a wrapped fly or an unwrapped fly as nuptial gifts. Females fed on eggsacs as well as on prey gifts. Mating success was similar for males with both wrapped and unwrapped gifts, indicating that wrapping per se does not increase male mating success. In a food manipulation experiment, we investigated the effect of the female's hunger level on male mating success. Hungry females were more likely to accept a gift and copulate; hence the female's hunger state is decisive for male mating success. Our results strongly suggest that the female's foraging motivation is the true context for the maintenance of the nuptial gift.

AB The function of olfactory signalling in social species is less well understood than in asocial species. Consequently, we examined olfactory communication in the ringtailed lemur, a socially complex primate that retains a functional vomeronasal organ, has well-developed scent glands and shows a suite of scent-marking behaviour. To assess the information content of different types of scent gland secretions, we decoupled olfactory cues from the visual and behavioural modalities with which scent marking is normally associated. We presented male and female subjects (signal receivers) with a series of choice tests between odours derived from conspecific donors (signal senders) varying by sex, age, social status and reproductive condition. We additionally examined the influence of the receivers' reproductive state and familiarity with the signaller. The reproductive condition, social status and familiarity of senders and receivers affected signal transmission; specifically, male receivers attended most to the odours of conspecifics in breeding condition and to the odours of familiar, dominant animals. By contrast, females varied their responses according to both their own reproductive state and that of the sender. Based on male and female patterns of countermarking, we suggest that scent marking serves a function in intergroup spacing and intrasexual competition for both sexes, as might be expected in a female-dominant species. By contrast, minimal female interest in male odours counters a female mate choice function for scent marking in this species. Nevertheless, scent marks are critical to male-male competition and, therefore, may be subject to sexual selection. (c) 2006 The Association for the study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Individuals of numerous rodent species engage in group living, in which they share an area of activity, a nest (or den), and interact more frequently with group members than with individuals from other such groups. Members of social groups may engage in communal breeding when they rear their young together in a common nest. We conducted an experimental study under laboratory conditions to explore the costs and benefits linked to early postnatal investment in offspring by female degus. In particular, we examined the quality and quantity of offspring produced by females rearing their litters in the presence of a second lactating (related or unrelated) female ('communally breeding') with offspring produced by lactating females in the presence of a nonbreeding (related or unrelated) female ('singularly breeding'), and the offspring of solitary females. The physical condition of mothers (mass lost through lactation) was also examined. We studied 70 female degus and their litters, and 13 additional nonbreeding females, under constant conditions of adult density, nest availability, restricted food availability and breeding experience of subjects. The number of pups, the mass of pups, and the physical condition of mothers breeding communally did not differ from those of singularly and solitarily breeding females. Similar results were obtained when kinship of breeding females was considered. When reproductive performance of individuals within communally breeding groups was examined, we found that costs and benefits were not shared equally. Weanlings of litters born in the presence of a previous litter were smaller and less numerous than weanlings of litters born when no other young were present. Taken together, our results show that female degus derive no apparent reproductive benefits from early postnatal rearing of their offspring. Moreover, a proportion of females seem to pay a net cost.

AB Mate ornaments may be signals of direct or indirect benefits to females that mate with those males. One important direct benefit to females is the level of male parental assistance they receive when provisioning young. Three main hypotheses attempt to explain the relationship between male ornament size and parental care. The good parent hypothesis predicts that males with larger ornaments will provide more care, while the differential allocation and trade-off hypotheses predict that they will provide less care. We examined the relationship between male ornamentation and parental care in two populations of common yellowthroats, Geothlypis trichas, in which the sexually selected male ornament differs. More ornamented males provided less parental care in both populations, contrary to the good parent hypothesis. However, females did not feed their nestlings more frequently when mated with more ornamented males, which is an additional prediction of the differential allocation hypothesis. Our results are most consistent with the trade-off hypothesis, which suggests that more ornamented males provide less care because they spend relatively more of their effort in pursuing extrapair mates or defending their territories from other males.

AB Males of several acoustically communicating orthopteran species form spatially and temporally structured choruses. We investigated whether male field crickets of the species Plebeiogryllus guttiventris formed choruses in the field. Males formed spatial aggregations and showed fidelity to a calling site within a night, forming stable choruses. Within aggregations, the acoustic ranges of males overlapped considerably. We tested whether males within hearing range of each other interacted acoustically. The chirps of simultaneously calling males were aphasic with respect to each other and showed no significant alternation or synchrony of calls. Some individuals changed temporal features of their calling songs such as chirp durations and chirp rates in response to a simultaneously calling neighbour. The implications of these results for female mate choice are discussed. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Food sharing is common in birds between mated pairs during courtship and by helpers at the nest in cooperatively breeding species. In contrast to primates, however, food sharing between peers in birds has received little attention. We explored the extent and pattern of food sharing in a group of juvenile jackdaws. The birds shared food with a number of individuals, regardless of sex and kinship. The frequency of food sharing and the number of recipients per donor decreased over time. Active food sharing, where the initiative for the transfer lies with the donor, appeared to be much more common in jackdaws than in any primate species studied so far. In addition, jackdaws shared more of a preferred food than of a less preferred food. Three functional explanations for food sharing between peers were tested: reciprocity, harassment avoidance and food sharing as a signal of social status. The results were consistent with reciprocity and harassment avoidance. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Timing is essential in seasonally changing habitats. Survival and reproduction are enhanced through precise adjustment to environmental conditions. Avian seasonal behaviour, that is, diverse activities associated with reproduction, moult and migration, has an endogenous basis and is ultimately linked to changes in environmental factors such as food supply. However, behaviour occurs in social contexts, and interactions with conspecifics are intimately linked to seasonal activities. Time programmes set the stage for social behaviour, which in turn fine-tunes seasonal activities. We propose that avian schedules are genuinely 'sociable': birds communicate seasonal behaviour by both intentional and inadvertent information transfer and negotiate it in competitive and cooperative interactions. Studying the interplay between seasonal and social behaviour can add to our understanding of animal behaviour, including mechanisms by which birds could cope with changing environmental conditions.

AB Social insects use a complex of recognition cues when discriminating nestmates from non-nestmate conspecifics. In the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, recognition cues can be derived from exogenous sources, and L. humile acquires prey-derived hydrocarbons that are used in nestmate discrimination. We studied Argentine ant population-level distinctions in response to external recognition cues. Ants belonging to a California population were strongly affected by the imposition of prey-derived hydrocarbons, with spatially isolated colony fragments that had been fed different cockroach prey (Blattella germanica or Supella longipalpa) showing high and injurious intracolony aggression when reunited. In contrast, colonies of Argentine ants from the southeastern U.S. showed only moderate and noninjurious aggression when subjected to the same treatment. Field-collected colonies of L. humile had hydrocarbons in the range of those provided by S. longipalpa, and colonies from the southeastern U.S. had significantly higher initial levels of Supella-shared hydrocarbons. When fed cockroaches, Argentine ants from both regions acquired additional amounts of Supella- and Blattella-specific hydrocarbons, with a significant increase in levels of Blattella-specific hydrocarbons. Therefore, diet partitioning produced a greater change in the proportion of prey hydrocarbons in the California than in the southeastern U.S. populations, which may be responsible for the altered behaviour observed in the California population. Identifying factors underlying geographical variation in cue expression and/or perception may bring us closer to elucidating the selective forces driving nestmate recognition systems.

AB Many fitness benefits of polyandry have been proposed. We addressed four hypotheses that are relevant to the agile antechinus, Antechinus agilis, a highly promiscuous marsupial: polyandry (1) involves females 'trading up' to obtain good genes for offspring; (2) promotes sperm competition/sperm choice to obtain good genes; (3) enables females to avoid genetically incompatible gene combinations (specifically inbreeding); or (4) enables females to avoid infertility. We tested the predictions of these hypotheses using female choice trials, manipulative mating experiments and microsatellite analysis of paternity. Because timing of mating affects fertility and prenatal abnormality rates in this species, we also tested whether it affects offspring growth rates. We found support for a genetic benefit of polyandry: offspring of polyandrous females grew faster than offspring of monandrous females, and this effect was more pronounced for females that mated close to ovulation. However, although larger males sire more offspring in the wild in this species, females did not initially choose large mates and did not 'trade up' based on male size. We found no evidence of genetic incompatibility effects. Monandrous females were not less likely to conceive than polyandrous females, although females in the wild are more likely to encounter infertile and subfertile males than in this study. Females that mated closer to ovulation had slower-growing litters. We conclude that female antechinuses benefit through increased offspring growth rates by mating with multiple males, and by mating several days before ovulation.

AB Explaining consistent variation in the behaviour of individuals in terms of personality differences is one of the cornerstones of understanding human behaviour but is seldom discussed in behavioural ecology for fear of invoking anthropomorphism. Recently, however, interest has begun to focus on identifying personality traits in animals and examining their possible evolutionary consequences. One major axis used to define personality traits is the shyness-boldness continuum. We examined boldness in an in situ experiment using fish from eight populations of the poeciliid Brachyraphis episcopi (also referred to as Brachyrhaphis episcopi). Fish from high- and low-predation regions within four streams that run independently into the Panama Canal were tested. Boldness scores were strongly influenced by standard length and the relative level of predation pressure in the rivers. In all four rivers, fish from high-predation areas were bolder than those from low-predation areas. Fish became increasingly shy as they grew.

ID GYPSY MOTHS; PHEROMONE; ACID
AB We examined and confirmed the hypothesis that 3-keto petromyzonol sulphate (3kPZS) constitutes a major component of a male sea lamprey sex pheromone. Previous studies have indicated that male sea lampreys release 3kPZS after spermiation, and that 3kPZS specifically influences the behaviour of ovulating females. In this study, we addressed two issues to further characterize the function of 3kPZS: (1) whether the male pheromone specifically influences the behaviour of ovulating females only, and (2) whether synthetic 3kPZS replicates the function of the male pheromone in a. natural environment. When placed in a two-choice maze, ovulating females preferred and showed search behaviours in the side scented with spermiating males, or washings thereof. Similar behavioural responses to the spermiating male odorant were not observed in males or preovulating females. Odorants from prespermiating males did not elicit similar behaviours from ovulating females. Furthermore, when released into a natural spawning stream, ovulating females located and swam to the source of water conditioned with spermiating males, or 10(-12) M synthetic 3kPZS. This knowledge has the potential to impact the integrated management of sea lampreys in the Laurentian Great Lakes.

AB Aggregating with heterospecifics may be particularly beneficial for a species that is able to exploit the antipredator behaviour of another. Territorial zenaida doves vigorously exclude conspecific intruders from their territory, but forage with, and acquire novel foraging techniques from, carib grackles. Given that doves associate with no other conspecific than their mate and they have no vocal alarm signals of their own, they might benefit from attending to the conspicuous alarm calls of carib grackles. In the present study, we found that zenaida doves suppressed foraging both in response to a model predator and in response to the sound of grackle alarm vocalizations. Although doves' responses to the predator model also involved moving away from the immediate vicinity, their responses to grackle alarm vocalizations consisted of remaining alert and tail flicking. Together, these results strongly suggest that doves attend to the antipredator behaviour of carib grackles. These findings extend earlier work demonstrating that doves obtain foraging benefits from their association with grackles, to show that they may also obtain predator avoidance benefits.

   PIPISTRELLE BATS; CAPTURE SUCCESS; BEHAVIOR; SIGNALS; CALLS; FLIGHT
AB Bats use echolocation calls that are suited for foraging in particular habitats. Many generalist bats alter their call design patterns as they move between open and spatially complex areas. This plasticity probably allows them to respond to the perceptual challenges posed by different structural environments. I tested the hypothesis that bats learn to produce these habitat-specific calls. I recorded the echolocation calls and foraging success of 14 juvenile little brown bats, Myotis lucifugus, as they foraged repeatedly in a large flight arena in two habitat treatments: open space and cluttered space. Calls were plastic across habitats. Furthermore, as bats gained experience, their foraging performance improved significantly in both open and cluttered habitat treatments. These improvements were related to changes in echolocation behaviour within the open habitat, which is consistent with the hypothesis that bats learn to produce more efficient calls in the open. Although the bats changed some aspects of their calls in the cluttered treatment, their use of space in the arena was the best predictor of foraging success. Bats that foraged in the centre of the arena were more successful. When bats switched habitat treatments, performance in the open was not affected by previous experience in the cluttered treatment. Bats that had previously experienced the open treatment, however, tended to use a more 'open-area' call when foraging in cluttered space. This result is discussed in light of habitat selection in young M. lucifugus.

ID PATTERNS; ETHOLOGY; RECEPTOR; HISTORY; UTILITY
AB We applied modern bioinformatic tools to titles and keywords of animal behaviour publications contained in an electronic library database to examine trends in animal behaviour research. We provide the first quantitative overview of animal behaviour research covering 42 836 documents published in the last three decades, across 25 journals. Our study confirms several patterns noted by previous reviews, and offers several novel insights into the history of our field. Profound historical distinctions between early ethology and comparative psychology have been recently bridged by shared interest in communication and social behaviour, and research from physiology and applied areas. Although we reiterate the rise of sexual selection and mating behaviour as prominent areas of research, we also show that interest in mechanism and development has proven particularly resilient over the years. Currently, researchers at hundreds of institutions worldwide are studying animal behaviour. Domesticated animals, foraging/dispersal and learning/memory are topics that appear most frequently in publications from regions that have little history of animal behaviour research, suggesting that these subjects are central to the early development of the discipline. Overall, the study of animal behaviour is healthy, growing, and becoming progressively more integrative over time. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   EVOLUTION; ROLES; KATYDIDS; REVERSAL
AB Paternal care has the potential to lead to female-biased operational sex ratios and sex role reversal. Whereas this issue has been repeatedly investigated in fish, we present the first study on insects. We investigated two species of assassin bug: Rhinocoris tristis, which shows male care of eggs, and Rhinocoris cannelita, which shows female care of eggs. In both species, the potential reproductive rate of males exceeded that of females. Since the population sex ratio was unbiased and there was no difference in mortality rates between the sexes, we predicted that the operational sex ratio would be skewed in favour of males in both species and thus males would be the more competitive sex. Field and laboratory observations upheld this prediction, with males competing for females in both species. In R. tristis, males also competed for ownership of eggs, whereas females discriminated between males according to ownership of eggs. However, choosiness was not restricted to females in R. tristis. Observations suggested that R. tristis males discriminated between females according to their weight: heavier females, which were likely to oviposit sooner, were guarded for longer by males in a period of postcopulatory riding. We suggest that the primary function of postcopulatory riding is to prevent females from mating with conspecifics, thus reducing the possibility of sperm competition. This behaviour might also be an important prerequisite for the evolution of male care. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

AB Social foragers receive and use information both about companions (social information) and about events external to the group, such as presence of potential predators. Scanning behaviour is often incorporated in theoretical models using simplifying assumptions in relation to the trade-off in information gathering between body postures (head-up versus head-down); however, some avian visual systems may allow individuals to scan in both body postures. We studied these issues experimentally, using starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, foraging in enclosures on natural fields. We varied the availability of information from conspecifics by placing visual barriers that blocked the view when the subjects were in head-down position and by manipulating the distance between group members. We found that as social information was reduced, starlings spent more time scanning (on and off the ground) and head-up scanning was mainly oriented towards conspecifics. The visual-obstruction effects imply that some information about conspecifics is normally gathered while starlings are foraging head-down. Neighbour distance and visual obstruction negatively affected food-searching rates and intake rates in two ways: (1) the effect of obstruction was mediated mostly through time competition between foraging and scanning on the ground, and (2) the effect of distance was due to a reduction in the rate of prey returns per searching effort while the birds were head-down. We conclude that the head-up posture is only one component of scanning, that the effects of head-down scanning should also be considered in species with ample visual fields, and that scanning in starlings is strongly connected to monitoring other flock members.

AB In the biparental convict cichlid fish, Archocentrus nigrofasciatun, males and females both spend time defending their territory and their offspring, but the typically larger male parent spends more time defending the territory and the female spends more time with the offspring. Because size correlates with a convict cichlid's ability to win a fight, the larger male parent has a clear advantage in repelling intruders compared with his smaller female mate. We tested the hypothesis that male and female convict cichlids accept their parental roles as a result of their relative sizes, rather than inherent sex differences (e.g. females are more nurturing). We allowed pairs to form in which one member was smaller or larger than the other member, or of the same size (both small = 50-55 mm; both large = 70-75 mm), thus producing four pairing types. During the S-day stationary larval stage, we subjected each breeding pair each day to a conspecific intruder that was either larger or smaller than one of the parents, or of the same size. Male and female parents adjusted their parental roles based on the size of their mates and/or the size of the intruder. Large parents displayed more defensive behaviour than small parents, regardless of sex. Male parents responded to increased threat (i.e. increasing intruder size) by increasing their defensive behaviour; but only until intruder size matched their own size, after which defensive effort decreased. Large female parents similarly responded to increased threat by increasing their defensive behaviour, but only to support their smaller mates (i.e. they did not independently attack the intruder). Larger females also showed a corresponding reduction in time spent near the offspring. Small males, in contrast, showed only a marginal increase in their time with the offspring. We conclude that the female has a more flexible parental role and, when her relative abilities change, she is more likely to expand her parental roles.

   SELECTION; SIGNAL; SIZE; TIT; DOMINANCE; VISION
AB Recent studies suggest that structural plumage coloration can indicate male quality and is used in female mate choice decisions. Whether or not structural coloration functions as a signal in male-male competitive interactions, however, has not been studied. Male eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, have brilliant ultraviolet-blue plumage on the head, back, wings and tail that is correlated with both reproductive effort and reproductive success. Bluebirds cannot excavate their own nest cavities, and as a consequence of limited nest sites, often engage in intense competition for nestboxes. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that structural coloration reflects male competitive ability by manipulating the number of available nestboxes. We erected a limited number of nestboxes in early spring and, after birds has established residency in those nestboxes, we added more nestboxes to the study site. We found that the reflective properties of the ultraviolet-blue plumage differed between males that acquired nestboxes early versus late in the spring, indicating that more colourful birds won competitions for access to nest sites. We also found that more colourful males fledged more offspring. These observations support the hypothesis that structural plumage colour is a condition-dependent trait in male eastern bluebirds that could be used to accurately assess the fighting ability of competitors.

AB Song learning in songbirds has been studied extensively in males but not in females. Females prefer songs previously heard, but it is not known whether opportunity for learning during the juvenile period affects the ability of females to judge song quality. We show that early exposure to adult song is required in the development of normal adult female zebra finch, Tueniopygia guttata, song preferences. Females were reared in conditions that varied in the exposure to song. As young adults, these females were tested for song preference using a two-choice speaker protocol with unfamiliar song stimuli. Females reared with adult males preferred tutored (normal-quality) song, whereas females reared without adult males were as likely to prefer untutored (abnormal-quality) song as tutored song. All three groups of females preferred conspecific to canary song but showed no preference for songs that were temporally reversed or played forward. Our results suggest that a normally reared female's preference for songs with more notes and spectral complexity is learned during early exposure to adult males that produce such songs.

ID JAPANESE-QUAIL; MATE CHOICE; HARASSMENT; BEHAVIOR; AGGRESSION; COERCION
AB In a pair of experiments, we determined whether recently fertilized Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, with less to gain from new sexual encounters than females without sperm in their sperm-storage tubules, would reduce their probability of sexual harassment by avoiding conspecific males (experiment 1) and affiliating with conspecific females (experiment 2). We found that after copulating with a male, female quail that were laving fertilized eggs spent less time near males and more time near females than female quail laying unfertilized eggs. Furthermore, females that were denied access to males for 14 days (i.e. those with empty sperm-storage tubules) and females that failed to lay fertile eggs after copulation behaved similarly towards conspecific males and females. We interpret these results as indicating that the cost to female quail of interacting with males of their species has led to the evolution Of female tactics to avoid male harassment when females' eggs are successfully fertilized and potential reproductive benefits of additional sexual encounters are reduced.

AB We examined geographical variation in a signal-receiver system within and between the two species of field crickets Gryllus texensis and G. rubens. We found that none of the three univariate male calling song parameters (pulse rate, trill length and intertrill interval) could separate species in allopatry, in contrast to previous reports that pulse rate is species specific. Using a multivariate measure of all three song parameters for each male, we were able to separate species in allopatric populations. In sympatry, we were not able to clearly delineate species because we found a continuous and nonbimodal distribution of both univariate and multivariate call measures. We also found males in sympatry with unique combinations of calling song parameters that do not occur in either allopatric population. We conducted playback experiments to females of both species collected in allopatry. For two kinds of tests, the species differed significantly in their strength of preference and in the direction of preferring their own species' multivariate calling song. All calling song parameters were highly repeatable, while female mate choice behaviours were not. All calling song parameters varied with season (spring versus autumn) in these bivoltine species. Additional analysis to understand the variation in calling song revealed differences in male call dominant frequency. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Pleometrosis, or colony founding via multiple queens, occurs in a localized population of the seed-harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus. In an apparently unusual secondary modification, queens of P, californicus are also obligate foragers; that is, queens must forage to garner the resources necessary to rear their first brood. Laboratory experiments measured the costs and benefits of pleometrosis and queen foraging in P. californicus in terms of queen survival, mass loss by queens and brood production. In all experiments, queen survival was positively associated with number of queens. Queen survival also varied with food level: survival was higher in fed treatments compared with unfed treatments at low queen numbers, whereas survival of unfed queens increased to the level of fed queens at higher queen numbers. Total mass loss of queens varied by food level, but not queen number, with fed queens losing about 50% less mass than unfed queens. Brood production also varied with queen number and food level. Total number of brood was positively associated with number of queens; at each queen number, fed queens produced more brood than unfed queens. The number of brood produced per queen, however, was similar across queen numbers. Fed queens also produced workers that were heavier than those produced by unfed queens, whereas head width of these minims was similar. Longer-term experiments revealed that these queen associations do not undergo queen reduction upon emergence of the first workers, but rather exhibit primary polygyny.

AB In gregarious breeders, parents often use individually stereotyped vocalizations as a cue to relocate offspring. Harp seals aggregate in large colonies on pack ice during the whelping season. During the 11-day lactation period, females alternate between periods at sea and attending their pup. If they use vocal cues in the relocation process, individual variation in pup vocalizations would be expected. We recorded vocalizations, sex and age class for 91 individuals at whelping patches in the Greenland Sea. Pups produced three call types: tonal, pulsed and a combination of the two. Only tonal vocalizations were used for analyses. To explore individual variation in measured vocal parameters, we used classification trees: 43% of 4075 vocalizations were classified correctly according to individual. The first split was driven by the third peak frequency, splitting male pups from females. For females total duration produced most further splits, whereas the maximum frequency of the lower harmonic, the maximum frequency of the second harmonic and total duration caused splits between males. We correctly identified 55% of 42 female pups and 8% of 49 male pups based on vocal parameters. Calls were misclassified according to individual but never according to sex. Repeated measures of eight individuals over several age classes showed that 82% of 869 calls were correctly classified regardless of age. Alongside vision and smell, acoustic cues appear to be important in relocating offspring. Differences in vocal variability between sexes may reflect different selection pressures working on males and females. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID BLIND MOLE-RAT; JUMPING SPIDERS; NAVIGATION; ORIENTATION; LOCOMOTION;
   DETOURS
AB We investigated whether dogs, Canis familiaris, can relocate a briefly presented food target after having been led away from it, by relying on feedback from locomotion (path integration). Dogs were led blindfolded and with earphones into a large symmetrical enclosure. Sitting at a location near the periphery of the enclosure, the subject could see the experimenter throw a food item on to a predetermined point on the ground. Again wearing the blindfold, the dog was guided outside and then to the opposite side of the enclosure. There the animal was freed from the blindfold and earphones and released to search for the food item, which was hidden among inedible food dummies. Each animal was tested four times, and the locations of the bait and the entrance into the enclosure were varied systematically between trials. In 36 of 40 trials,the dogs proceeded along a goal-directed path towards the target, found the bait fairly directly or made circular search movements in its vicinity. In control trials, the dogs failed to find the target when they could not see the target location at the beginning of the trial or were deprived of self-motion cues. Thus, they registered the bait location visually, and then updated the direction and distance to the target by 'integrating' signals derived from locomotion. Path integration may have functional implications for hunting: it allows the predator to approach prey through a detour, turning momentarily away from its target, but remaining prepared to reach it along a well-oriented path.

   WOLVES
AB Research in comparative social cognition addresses how challenges of social living have formed the cognitive structures that control behaviours involved in communication, social learning and social understanding. In contrast to the traditional psychological approach, recent investigations take both evolutionary and functional questions into account, but the main emphasis is still on the mechanisms of behaviour. Although in traditional research 'comparative' meant mainly comparisons between humans and other primates, ethological. influences have led to a broadening of the spectrum of species under study. In this review, we evaluated how the study of dogs broadens our understanding of comparative social cognition. In the early days of ethology, dogs enjoyed considerable interest from ethologists, but during the last 20 years, dogs have rarely been studied by ethological methods. Through a complex evolutionary process, dogs became adapted for living in human society; therefore, the human environment and social setting now represents a natural ecological niche for this species. We have evidence that dogs have been selected for adaptations to human social life, and that these adaptations have led to marked changes in their communicative, social, cooperative and attachment behaviours towards humans. Until now, the study of dogs was hindered by the view that they represent an 'artificial' species, but by accepting that dogs are adapted to their niche, as are other 'natural' species, comparative investigations can be put into new light.

TI Centrifugal waste disposal and the optimization of ant nest craters
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID FORMICA-RUFA; NAVIGATION; HYMENOPTERA; TIME; COST
AB We considered how ant, Tapinoma simrothi, colonies dispose of the material generated by their nest excavations in nest entrance craters. We developed a model for optimum crater formation on both flat and sloping ground (although we have not solved it in full generality for sloping ground). We found that the ants, when working on flat ground, show a close approximation to this least costly waste disposal. Craters on slopes may not be optimal even though they will be cheaper to make than ones of a similar volume on level ground. We further tested the model with a manipulative experiment, which also suggested the simple rule of thumb that ants might use. In response to having one-quarter of their crater removed, the ants focused most of their further waste disposal in that quarter. This suggests that their rule of thumb may be to deposit material at the nearest point with an angle of elevation less than that of the optimal angle. This should generate symmetrical craters on flat ground. The model also makes certain additional and testable predictions about the fine structure of craters.

AB Sperm competition studies have shown that P-2 (the proportion of ova fertilized by the last male to mate) increases as the interval between inseminations is experimentally increased. Variation in the number of sperm in storage is associated with sperm use (or loss) from the female's sperm stores between copulations (fewer sperm from previous mates at the time of the last copulation) and with the extent of prior oviposition and female receptivity to further copulation: females that lay many eggs tend to have few remaining sperm in storage and to be more receptive to further copulation. Using the bruchid beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we examined the effect of prior oviposition and female receptivity to further copulation on the extent of last-male sperm precedence (measured as P-2). Extent of prior oviposition was experimentally manipulated independently of the intermating interval by altering the availability of oviposition sites between inseminations. Females given few or no oviposition sites laid fewer eggs, were less receptive and had a lower P-2 than females given abundant oviposition sites. To examine the effect of female receptivity on P-2 independently of prior oviposition, we examined the outcome of sperm competition experiments using (1) females from lines that had been selected for different latencies to copulation and (2) natural variation in female latency to receptivity. Female receptivity to further copulation had no detectable effect on P-2. When oviposition resource is abundant, female receptivity may be a poor predictor of current sperm load.

AB Although famously cooperative, social insect colonies harbour considerable potential for genetic conflict among colonymates. This conflict may be expressed behaviourally as aggression by workers. We investigated aggression in 34 colonies of the wasp Parachartergus colobopterus, by evaluating the characteristics of both instigators and victims of aggressive interactions. We estimated genetic relatedness and queen number using DNA microsatellites and found that workers and emerging females should be most in conflict over the caste of the latter when there are many queens on the nest. We found that aggressive interactions are more likely to involve older workers attacking either males or younger workers, and that victim and aggressor females have more ovarian development than randomly sampled colonymates. Moreover, mated females with low levels of ovarian development relative to active queens were also more likely to be aggressors and victims than were randomly sampled females. Aggression among females supports the hypothesis that older workers use aggression towards younger females as a means of policing the development of emerging females into queens. Workers also may use aggression to suppress the reproduction of some mated females. Our findings thus support the hypothesis that genetic conflicts of interest motivate worker aggression in swarm-founding wasp colonies. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The spatial position of young animals within a brood affects their survival, so that marginal individuals are at greater risk of predation. Spatial brood structuring may be caused by differences in offspring size, age, hunger, or active parental manipulation through aggression. Nepotistic manipulation of brood structure would confer fitness benefits for parents accepting nondescendant young. However, insufficient kin recognition has often been considered to preclude such nepotism in birds, particularly in precocial waterfowl. We explored the spatial structure of ducklings within broods of eiders, Somateria mollissima, a seaduck with frequent brood amalgamation. We compared the distribution of ducklings of different origin relative to reference females whose kinship to the ducklings was known. We also observed female aggression towards ducklings, to evaluate the role of parental manipulation of brood structure. We found a nonrandom distribution of ducklings within broods; a female's own young were on average closer to her than unrelated young were. We also found evidence for parental nepotism: whether the brood contained unrelated young was the strongest predictor of female aggression towards ducklings. The spatial position, hatch weight and relative size of ducklings showed no significant correlations with each other, suggesting that active parental manipulation may be needed to explain the observed spatial structure. Our study conflicts with previous anecdotal evidence suggesting that brood amalgamation in eiders results in the disintegration of parent-offspring bonds, preventing parental exploitation of nondescendant young. It also opens up the possibility that the spatial position of ducklings depends on their mother's status in the female dominance hierarchy. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Studies have shown that nectar-feeding birds more easily learn to avoid a previously rewarding location (to win-shift) than to return to such a location (to win-stay). This pattern has been interpreted as evidence of an evolved adaptation to the fact that nectar is a depleting resource; however, such a conclusion requires ruling out the possibility that this tendency is a consequence of the experience of individual birds, and is more compelling if performance in the memory task reveals sensitivity to detailed features of the spatiotemporal distribution of nectar in the environment. We tested the tendency of captive-reared Regent honeyeaters, Xanthomyza phrygia, a species of nectar-feeding bird, to win-shift or win-stay at different intervisit intervals. The birds generally avoided rewarding locations after a short retention interval (10 min), but returned to these locations after a long retention interval (3 h). This behaviour tracks the replenishment rate of the flowers exploited by this species in the wild, even though the subjects were born and reared in captivity.

AB Consumer demand studies measuring the motivation that animals have for resources have almost exclusively used gregarious species, but have tested animals housed in isolation. The motivation that gregarious animals have for resources could be increased or decreased by the presence or absence of companion animals, that is, the social context. I trained a single mouse from each of six groups to perform an operant task that was quantifiable and would not be performed fortuitously or learnt by nontrained mice. The trained mice were housed with nontrained cagemates in a start cage that required them to perform the operant task to enter a resource cage providing either additional space or a running wheel. The presence of cagemates in the start cage significantly decreased the number of visits/24 h to the running wheel, the number of bouts and the duration of wheel running, but had no effect on the number of visits to additional space. The presence of cagernates increased the time spent in the resource cage whether this provided additional space or a running wheel, indicating that the mice overcompensated for the reduced frequency of visits. These results show that social context can have a significant effect on the motivation that animals have for resources, and that this effect is resource dependent. The influence of social context should therefore be considered in the design and interpretation of consumer demand studies. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The placing of animal behaviour in an evolutionary context is one of the great achievements of biologists in the last century. Life history theory has been a powerful tool in explaining both adaptation and constraint in phenotypic evolution, but rarely addresses the mechanistic bases of the traits it discusses. Recent advances in molecular biology have begun to uncover these mechanisms, and provide a challenge to the traditional view that life history trade-offs are the result of the differential allocation of limiting resources. In particular, costs of reproduction in Caenorhabditis elegans appear to arise from molecular signals, which have been claimed to be arbitrary with respect to fitness. We review the evidence that costs of reproduction in C. elegans are not resource based, and find that this is not necessarily the case. However, we welcome the challenge to traditional thinking, and suggest that integrating an understanding of mechanisms into life history theory will be one of the most exciting tasks facing evolutionary biologists in the 21st century.

AB The producer-scrounger model assumes that producers are animals that search for food, and scroungers are animals that steal food found by producers. By following foraging decisions made by beach-foraging crows, we assessed individual variability in strategy use, variables influencing the finder's share (when defined as the probability of retaining a prey item in the presence of food theft behaviour) and the benefits and costs of producing and scrounging. Data were collected using focal and all-occurrences scan sampling. Results indicated that more individuals were likely to use both producing and scrounging tactics than to be 'pure' producers. No pure scroungers were documented. When producers obtained scroungeable items, scroungers attempted to steal the item 46% of the time. Forty-one per cent of attempted scrounges were successful. Thus, producers suffered a 19% loss rate of scroungeable items to scroungers, although producers had access to large numbers of small (nonscroungeable) items. Although there were significantly more scroungeable prey items available at lower tides, there was no significant relationship between prey density and scrounge attempts or actual thefts. No ecological factors (group size, temperature, time of day, season) or individual characteristics (age, sex) influenced the probability of retaining prey. Prey retention was determined only by characteristics of the prey items: larger prey items or those with longer handling times were most likely to be stolen.

AB Most stingless bee colonies have one singly mated queen, resulting in a potential conflict between workers and queen over male production, because workers are more closely related to the sons of other workers than they are to the queen's sons. Furthermore, workers in the majority of stingless bee species have ovarian development, can produce haploid eggs, and show apparently agonistic behaviour towards their queen, suggesting a real conflict. We investigated whether genetic conflict over male production resulted in reproductive and behavioural conflict in Schwarziana q. quadripunctata. DNA microsatellite loci showed that, even though workers are more related to other workers' sons than to queen's sons, it is the queen who produces the males. Behavioural interactions between workers and their queen were not uniformly more aggressive during male production than at times with only worker production, although some differences might have been obscured by the fact that food supply was greater during male production. The potential conflict over male production in S. q. quadripunctata seems not to lead to an observable conflict between the workers and their queen. Workers might refrain from reproduction because of the costs involved for the colony or because of queen control.

TI Choice and context: testing a simple short-term choice rule
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PREFERENCE; DELAY; PARALLEL; TIME
AB Psychological studies of animal choice show that the immediate consequences of choice strongly influence preference. In contrast, evolutionary models emphasize the longer-term fitness consequences of choice. Building on recent work by Stephens & Anderson (2001, Behavioral Ecology 12, 330-339), this study presents two experiments that address this conflict. Stephens & Anderson developed an alternative choice situation based on patch-leaving decisions and compared this to the binary choice, or self-control, situation typically used in psychological studies. They hypothesized that the same short-term choice rule could account for choice in both situations, maximizing long-term gains in the patch situation, but typically producing shortsighted results in the self-control case. Experiment I used captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, to test this 'same rule' hypothesis. The results do not support this hypothesis, suggesting that if a single rule applies, it is probably a more complex rule. Stephens & Anderson also hypothesized that a rule based on the delay to the next meal could explain why the intertrial interval has little effect in binary choice studies, even though the analogous travel time strongly affects patch-leaving decisions. When an animal leaves a patch, it experiences a delay consisting of the travel time plus time spent searching in the patch until food is obtained. Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis that travel time and search time combine additively, behaving like a single delay. Using treatments that created the same combined delay via different combinations of travel and search time, we found no evidence of nonadditivity, suggesting that these two components may indeed be treated as a single delay.

AB The social complexity hypothesis asserts that animals living in large social groups should display enhanced cognitive abilities along predictable dimensions. To test this concept, we compared highly social pinyon jays, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus, with relatively nonsocial western scrub-jays, Aphelocoma californica, on two complex cognitive tasks relevant to the ability to track and assess social relationships. Pinyon jays learned to track multiple dyadic relationships more rapidly and more accurately than scrub-jays and appeared to display a more robust and accurate mechanism of transitive inference. These results provide a clear demonstration of the association between social complexity and cognition in animals.

AB The studies of behaviour that were strongly rooted in biology have had a long tradition of bringing together the 'how' and the 'why' questions. This integrative approach will serve the subject well in the postgenomic era as the long trend towards analysis at lower and lower levels starts to reverse. The new studies will make use of the resources uncovered by molecular biology and the neurosciences but will use the behaviour of the whole animal to measure outcomes and the context in which behaviour occurs to frame analytical questions. Two examples are given of how movement between levels of analysis is being used with increasing power and promise. The first is the study of filial imprinting in birds where many of the molecular and neural mechanisms involved have been uncovered and are now being integrated to explain the behaviour of the whole animal. The second is the triggering during sensitive periods in early life by environmental events of one of several alternative modes of development leading to different phenotypes.

AB The social behaviour of carrion crows varies between populations. In northern Spain cooperatively breeding groups form through delayed natal dispersal and/or immigration of individuals (usually males) into the territory. In this population, carrion crows therefore breed as either unassisted pairs, pairs with nondispersing 1-2-year-old helpers (nondispersers), pairs with immigrant helpers or mixed groups (pairs with both immigrants and nondispersers). We used a microsatellite-based genotyping system to determine the parentage of 57 nestlings (19 broods). Polygamous mating was involved in 26% of the broods and reproduction was shared among group members of both sexes in at least three groups. Immigrants of both sexes can therefore gain access to mates by living in a group, while reproduction is unlikely to involve nondispersers. This implies that nondispersers and immigrants gain different sorts of benefits from group living and helping at the nest. Our genetic data confirmed that nondispersers associated with their parents on the natal territory and therefore that delayed natal dispersal leads to family formation in the carrion crow. Polygamous mating was not found in groups without immigrants, suggesting that, in this population, breeders lose parentage in their brood when sociality is extended beyond the limit of the nuclear family.

AB Many captive birds are kept in artificial lighting that is typically deficient in ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Most birds can perceive the range of light that humans see but also have an additional retinal cone type that is tuned to UV wavelengths. Consequently, artificial lighting may be detrimental as it might limit the functionality of their vision. We examined the preferences of European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, for various artificial light environments. In our first experiment, groups of starlings showed a preference for environments that contained UV (UV+) over those where UV wavelengths had been removed (UV -). This preference was not affected by the sex of the individuals within the group or, as shown in a later experiment, by whether the birds had been previously housed in UV+ or UV - conditions. In contrast, individual starlings showed no preference for UV+ over UV - environments, although the power of our test was low. In a subsequent experiment, starling groups preferred the higher of two light intensities that were presented; however, equalizing the overall quantal flux between UV+ and UV - extinguished any preference for UV+ over UV -. The group preference for UV+ conditions in the first experiment may therefore have resulted from a preference for brighter conditions rather than a specific preference for UV. However, equalizing the quantal flux may not equalize perceived brightness, because it is not known how birds' visual systems weight input from each cone type. We conclude that, for nonbreeding, group-housed captive starlings, there is no positive evidence of a preference for the presence of UV as a specific wavelength.

AB Begging displays of nestlings in multichick broods can signal both hunger and competitive ability. Studies of begging in species with single-chick broods exclude the influence of nestling competition and may provide especially useful models for the study of signalling during parent-offspring conflict. However, there is no evidence that chicks signal hunger by begging in the absence of sibling competition. I tested predictions of signalling models in a species with single-chick broods, the Wilson's storm-petrel. Chicks used two types of begging calls, 'rhythmic' calls and 'long' calls. I found that chicks conveyed information about their current body condition by begging. When their body condition was low, chicks increased the number and frequency of long begging calls, as well as the frequency of rhythmic calling. Parents responded to increased begging by regurgitating larger meals. The study thus demonstrates that the begging system can work in the absence of nestling competition. Chicks also called in the absence of their parents, but in this context they used only rhythmic calls and there was no correlation with current body condition.

ID PREFERENCES; INTRANSITIVITY; VARIABILITY; VIOLATIONS; SIMILARITY;

AB Existing models of risk-sensitive foraging assume that animals assign value to different options according to an absolute currency. It follows from this assumption that choices are expected to be both transitive and regular, because the value assigned to an option is independent of its context. I tested these predictions by comparing preferences obtained in binary and trinary contexts. European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were trained using an operant paradigm to forage for three options: Constant (C) that provided a fixed number of food pellets; Low variance (L) with a coefficient of variation of 71% in the number of pellets; High variance (H) with a coefficient of variation of 106%. The preferences of the birds were tested in three binary choice treatments (CL, CH, LH) and one trinary choice treatment (CLH). Overall, there was no evidence for violations of either transitivity or regularity. However, overall, a bird's relative preference for its most preferred option over its second most preferred option was significantly greater in the trinary treatment than in the comparable binary treatment. This effect of context on choice is compatible with starlings' use of comparative instead of absolute currencies in decision making. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Adult cottontop tamarins are sensitive to the functionally relevant and irrelevant features of objects used as tools to gain access to food. We conducted four experiments designed to assess whether infant cottontop tamarins show comparable sensitivities to functionally relevant and irrelevant features. All subjects were reared in a species-typical social environment, but prior to the present studies had never participated in any experiments, and had no access to tools or other freely moving, manipulable objects with the exception of food. Despite their lack of experience, the pattern of object choice by infants precisely mirrored those obtained with adults. Specifically, having learned to use a hard blue cane to retrieve food (experiment 1), infant tamarins immediately generalized to other objects (experiments 2-4), recognizing that changes in colour and texture play no role in an object's functionality as a tool, whereas changes in size and shape do. These data suggest that for cottontop tamarins, a species that does not naturally use tools, and infrequently manipulates objects, that the capacity to distinguish between functionally relevant and irrelevant features develops in the absence of domain-specific experience.

   VIGILANCE BEHAVIOR; CRECHING BEHAVIOR
AB Shared parental care resulting from brood amalgamation is often considered beneficial to parents. However, the benefit of grouping (a decline in individual vigilance despite an increase in collective vigilance, with a concomitant increase in individual feeding time) has not been evoked as a factor promoting shared care. Eider females, Somateria mollissima, are subject to substantial energetic costs during breeding, and sometimes share brood-rearing duties. We compared the activity budgets and feeding behaviour of lone tenders and multifemale tenders. We also measured the collective vigilance of multifemale tenders and examined whether the coordination of feeding activity among females changes with time. As expected, the proportion of time spent feeding increased, and the proportion of time spent vigilant decreased, as the number of females attending the brood increased. None the less, the collective vigilance of multifemale tenders was at least 20% higher than the vigilance of lone tenders. Furthermore, multifemale tending allowed females to feed more optimally, as dive duration increased with the number of females tending the brood. The level of parental investment by individual females after hatching of the eggs is therefore related to the number of tending females and, based on previous work, a female's body condition when the eggs hatch is also logically connected with the number of tending females. Whether females sharing brood care on a permanent basis coordinate their feeding activity, so as to increase the potential protection of ducklings against predation, remains equivocal.

AB The chick-a-dee call of the avian genus Poecile is a structurally complex vocal system because it possesses a set of simple rules that governs how the notes of the call are ordered, and variable numbers of each of the note types strung together can generate an extraordinary number of unique calls. Whereas it has been hypothesized that chick-a-dee calls with different notes may convey different information, no experimental evidence has been offered in support of the hypothesis. Previously published studies suggested that flock members use chick-a-dee calls in the context of moving to or from a feeding site. Here, we tested Carolina chickadees' responses to playbacks of chick-a-dee calls that differed in note composition. Playbacks were conducted in the field in the context of a novel food source. Our pilot data had indicated that chick-a-dee calls with relatively large numbers of 'C' notes were given by birds on their first contact with a novel seed stand. In the present study, we found that chickadees flew in close to the playback speaker and subsequently took seed from a seed stand more often during playbacks of chick-a-dee calls containing C notes than chick-a-dee calls not containing C notes or than control playbacks. Vocal responses of chickadees to the playbacks also differed in relation to the particular vocal signal being played back. These results indicate that receivers respond differently to chick-a-dee calls containing different compositions of note types and represent a first step to link variation in note composition and ordering in these calls to possible meanings.

AB Recent work on human vocal production demonstrates that certain irregular phenomena seen in human pathological voices and baby crying result from nonlinearities in the vocal production system. Equivalent phenomena are quite common in nonhuman mammal vocal repertoires. In particular, bifurcations and chaos are ubiquitous aspects of the normal adult repertoire in many primate species. Here we argue that these phenomena result from properties inherent in the peripheral production mechanism, which allows individuals to generate highly complex and unpredictable vocalizations without requiring equivalently complex neural control mechanisms. We provide examples from the vocal repertoire of rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, and other species illustrating the different classes of nonlinear phenomena, and review the concepts from nonlinear dynamics that explicate these calls. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary significance of nonlinear vocal phenomena. We suggest that nonlinear phenomena may subserve individual recognition and the estimation of size or fluctuating asymmetry from vocalizations. Furthermore, neurally 'cheap' unpredictability may serve the valuable adaptive function of making chaotic calls difficult to predict and ignore. While noting that nonlinear phenomena are in some cases probably nonadaptive by-products of the physics of the sound-generating mechanism, we suggest that these functional hypotheses provide at least a partial explanation for the ubiquity of nonlinear calls in nonhuman vocal repertoires. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Females of the Texas trilling field cricket, Gryllus texensis, show mating preferences based on mate courtship song. To test experimentally the condition dependence of courtship song, we attempted to manipulate male condition via the diet. When the diet was manipulated at the adult moult, there was no effect on subsequent male courtship song or male condition measured as residual mass. When the diet was manipulated three moults prior to the adult moult, there was a significant effect on male residual mass, but no differences in courtship song were observed. To gain a second measure of condition in the diet-manipulated-as-nymphs group, we extracted their fat using petroleum ether in a refluxing Soxhlet apparatus. Crickets reared on the poor diet showed a clear relationship between the residual mass measure of condition and condition measured as energetic fat reserve, whereas the two measures of condition were unrelated in crickets reared on the good diet. Courtship song was unrelated to diet, fat reserve or residual mass. We conclude that courtship song does not reflect male condition in the laboratory despite its energetic cost. When given a mating opportunity it is probably in the evolutionary interest of males in poor condition to signal at as high a rate as males in good condition.

AB Aggressiveness of juvenile salmonid populations has been suggested to correlate positively with the time the fish spend in the stream. Consequently, resident populations are expected to be more aggressive than migratory populations. Aggressiveness and growth rate have been found to correlate positively at the individual level, but no studies have compared populations. We studied variation in aggressiveness and growth in 10 Finnish brown trout populations differing in their migratory behaviour (sea-run, lake-run and resident). Contrary to expectations, we found the sea-run populations to be more aggressive than the lake-run and resident populations. As all the study fish were reared under similar conditions, it is likely that the differences in aggression have a genetic basis. We also found a positive correlation between aggression and growth rate among the populations. This result supports earlier findings of a positive connection between aggressiveness and growth rate, but is, to our knowledge, the first time this phenomenon has been observed at the population level.

AB We studied time budgets in two closely related and ecologically similar gerbillids to test the effect of group size on vigilance and foraging in adult females. Psammomys obesus is strictly solitary, while Rhombomys opimus is mainly social. We compared time budgets of (1) solitary P. obesus females, (2) solitary R. opimus females and (3) R. opimus females living in male-female pairs. Solitary R. opimus females spent more time underground, more time in low-cost vigilant postures, moved more, hoarded food more and fed above ground less than paired females. However, females of both categories spent similar time in high-cost upright postures. These results conform mainly to the group size effect hypothesis, while the high level of high-cost vigilance in paired females can be attributed to within-group vigilance, masking the group size effect. Solitary females of P. obesus and R. opimus showed similar time budget patterns; however, P. obesus allocated more time to high-cost vigilance and less time to feeding. In general, differences in time budgets between heterospecific females of the same social status (solitary or paired) were less pronounced than differences between conspecifics of different status. Thus, variation in activity patterns of females can be largely explained by different social conditions rather than by species affiliation. We discuss the results in terms of predation avoidance strategies in solitary and social species. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Maculinea butterflies are parasites of Myrmica ant nests. The Alcon blue, Maculinea alcon, is unusual in that it parasitizes the nests of several Myrmica species, using M. rubra, M. ruginodis and M. scabrinodis as hosts in different parts of Europe. In Denmark it uses M. rubra and M. ruginodis, but never M. scabrinodis. Some populations use one of these species exclusively, despite the presence of the alternative host, while others use both hosts simultaneously. To examine the basis of this specificity, and local coadaptation between host and parasite, we offered freshly emerged caterpillars of M. alcon from three populations differing in their host use to laboratory nests of all three recorded host ant species collected from each of the M. alcon populations. We measured the attractiveness of the caterpillars to their host ants as the time taken for them to be adopted by each ant colony. Caterpillars from all populations took longer to be adopted to M. scabrinodis nests than to nests of the other two ant species. Adoption times to M. rubra and M. ruginodis colonies differed: caterpillars from each of the two populations that used a single host species were adopted most quickly by that species when local ant colonies were used. When ant colonies collected from the other two sites were used, this pattern broke down, and there was either no difference in adoption time, or M. rubra adopted caterpillars more quickly. Adoption of caterpillars from the population that used both M. rubra and M. ruginodis as hosts took an order of magnitude longer than caterpillars from populations using a single host species.

ID REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; FERAL HORSES; MALE LIONS; DOMINANCE; MALES
AB Breeding groups with multiple stallions occur sympatrically with single-stallion breeding groups in feral horse, Equus caballus, populations. Mutualism and reciprocal altruism between stallions have been proposed to explain the origin and functioning of multistallion bands. However, empirical support for these hypotheses is contradictory and incomplete. Furthermore, there are no explicit tests of the predictions that each hypothesis makes about stallion behaviour and social structure. We compared nine multistallion and 18 single-stallion bands in the Kaimanawa Ranges, New Zealand. Compared with agonistic behaviours, affiliative behaviours were relatively unimportant in the relationships between stallions within bands. The number of stallions in the band did not have a positive influence on mare group size, stability, home range quality or reproductive success in bands. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between aggression ('intolerance') by the dominant towards subordinate stallions and the subordinates' effort in mare group defence ('helping') but a negative relationship between helping effort by subordinates and their proximity to, and mating with, the bands' mares. Therefore, the predictions of the mutualism and reciprocal altruism hypotheses were not supported. Indeed, for some of the predictions we found the opposite outcomes to be true. Multistallion bands had significantly poorer reproductive success, and dominant stallions were less tolerant of subordinates that helped most and reduced their access to mares. Nevertheless, in all other respects Kaimanawa stallions in multistallion bands behaved like those described elsewhere. Thus, we reject cooperative hypotheses for multimale breeding groups in horses and discuss the mate parasitism and consort hypotheses as better alternatives.

AB Theoretical models of animal contests frequently generate predictions about how asymmetries (e.g. differences in size, residence status) between contestants affect fight duration. Linear regression and nonparametric correlation analyses are commonly used to test the fit of data to such models. We show how survival regression analysis (SRA) is a powerful technique for studying the effect of asymmetries on the duration of contests. SRA, which is under-utilized by students of animal behaviour, offers several advantages over more frequently used procedures. It provides unbiased parameter estimates even when including censored data (i.e. results of contests that have not ended at the time when observations are stopped). The analysis of hazard functions, which is a component of SRA, is an easy way to test for consistency with predictions of the sequential assessment game model. These and other advantages of SRA are illustrated by using SRA and more conventional methods to analyse the effect of asymmetries on contest duration for encounters between female Mediterranean tarantulas, Lycosa tarentula (L.). It is hoped that this example of the advantages of SRA will encourage more widespread use of this powerful technique. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In primates, social context is one of the factors that increases the acceptance of novel foods. Previous experiments showed that tufted capuchins, Cebus apella, eat significantly more of novel foods when in the presence of group members eating the same novel foods. Several processes may have led to these results. The mere presence of group members may reduce the individual's stress of being alone, or its neophobic response and, consequently, may increase its food Consumption. The individual may be influenced by what group members do, and local/stimulus enhancement and/or social facilitation may occur. To investigate the above processes, we assessed whether an individual capuchin monkey's consumption of novel foods is lower when (1) the individual is alone with nobody in the nearby cage than when (2) group members are present in the nearby cage with no food or when (3) they are present and eating a familiar food. We tested 15 subjects with three novel foods, each presented in one condition. In both social conditions, the more group members there were by the food box the more the experimental subject ate. In addition, when group members were present and eating food, there was a significant increase in the acceptance of the three foods, regardless of what group members were eating. We argue that social facilitation of eating isa quicker way to overcome neophobia and only social facilitation of eating what the others are eating can be considered safe way to learn about a safe diet.

AB Sex differences in habitat use (habitat segregation) are widespread in sexually dimorphic ungulates. A possible cause is that males are more sensitive to weather than females, leading to sex differences in sheltering behaviour (the 'weather sensitivity hypothesis'). However, this hypothesis has never been tested. We considered the allometric rates of net energy gain during times of cold weather,and food shortage in a model. We argue that the higher absolute heat losses relative to intake rates of larger ungulates should indeed lead to higher weather sensitivity in males than in females. Furthermore, we tested the weather sensitivity hypothesis empirically in red deer, Cervus elaphus, on the Isle of Rum, U.K. We predicted that (1) use of relatively exposed, high-quality forage habitat should be negatively influenced by bad weather; and (2) this influence should be stronger in males. We found that bad weather (strong wind, low temperature, heavy rain) in winter and spring influenced use of high-quality forage habitat negatively in all deer; that adult males responded more strongly to low temperature and strong wind than did females; and that adult males foraged on windy days at better sheltered sites than did females. Thus, the weather sensitivity hypothesis is supported both theoretically and empirically. We suggest that the weather sensitivity hypothesis ran potentially explain winter habitat segregation in a large number of ungulate species.

Here we describe two experiments demonstrating that a focal female quail that has seen a conspecific male mating subsequently shows an enhanced tendency to affiliate not only with that particular male, but also with other males that share his characteristics. The results have important implications for our understanding of the role of social learning in the evolution of male characteristics. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB King penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, vigorously defend small territories in very dense colonies. The egg-laying season lasts approximately 4 months, but only pairs that reproduce during the first half of the period succeed in hedging a chick. I examined various factors affecting aggressiveness of king penguins during the breeding season and focused on the differences between central and peripheral territories. Pairs on peripheral territories experienced twice as many encounters with avian predators as did central birds. The vast majority of peripheral birds were late breeders, indicating that reproductive success was very low among penguins defending a territory on the edge of the colony. Time invested in territory defence and rate of agonistic encounters between breeding neighbours increased from the incubation to the brooding period. Parents gave most threat displays to territorial neighbours when the chick was very young and just before creche formation. Distance to colony edge was not related to aggressiveness in incubating birds, however, the rate of pecking and flipper blows increased from the edge to the centre during brooding. In addition, aggressiveness of breeding penguins towards travelling birds trespassing into their territory increased with distance to edge. Early breeders were not more aggressive than late breeders but the proportion of time spent in territory defence increased with the number of days a bird had spent incubating. As expected, I did not detect any sex difference in aggressive behaviour. Birds occupying territories on the beach were generally more aggressive during the incubation period than those located on the valley sides. Reproductive status (incubating versus brooding) and territory location were the main factors explaining the various levels of aggressiveness observed in breeding king penguins.

AB Zygiella x-notata is an orb-weaving spider that often renews its trap daily. Web building has associated costs and benefits, and building successive webs may have consequences for lifetime reproductive success. In the laboratory, we tested the ability of Z. x-notata to modify its building behaviour in response to various stages in predation (prey detection, capture and ingestion) experienced with a previous web. We determined which stages provided information for the spiders. Spiders that detected, captured and ingested prey and then rebuilt their web used less silk and made a smaller capture area than in the previous web. There was no effect of prey detection alone on the next web. Capture without feeding gave the same results as capture followed by feeding. The spiders that ate prey without detection and capture (feeding by hand) had the same energetic gains as spiders that caught prey but delayed building a new web. The spiders thus showed plasticity in web-building behaviour and in the amount of silk used (energetic investment) in the short term (from one web to the next). Changes in body condition may therefore influence web construction. Moreover, information gained during prey capture appeared to influence the size and structure of the next web. This ability should enable spiders to adapt their web building to maximize their fitness. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   do alternative reproductive tactics favour alternative phenotypes?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID ACUMINATUS COLEOPTERA; MORPHOLOGY; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; PATTERNS
AB In a variety of organisms morphological variation is discrete rather than continuous. Discrete variation within a sex has attracted particular interest as it is thought to reflect the existence of alternative adaptations to a heterogeneous selection environment. The beetle Onthophagus taurus shows a dimorphism for male horns: males that exceed a critical body size develop a pair of long, curved horns on their heads, while smaller males remain hornless. In this study we report on the alternative reproductive tactics used by males with these two morphologies, and present-experimental and behavioural data suggesting that these alternative tactics selectively favour discretely different male phenotypes. Horned marks aggressively defended tunnel entrances containing breeding females. Fights involved the use of horns, and males with longer horns were more likely to win fights. In contrast, hornless males employed nonaggressive sneaking behaviours when faced with competitively superior males. Sneaking behaviours appeared to require high degrees of manoeuvrability inside tunnels to access and mate with females despite the presence of a guarding male. Comparisons of running performances of males with identical body sizes but different horn lengths suggest that the possession of horns reduces male agility inside tunnels. Thus, horn possession confers a clear advantage to males using fighting behaviours to access females, whereas hornlessness may be favoured in males that rely primarily on sneaking behaviours. Combined, the two alternative reproductive tactics used by male O. taurus appear to favour opposite horn phenotypes, which may explain the paucity of intermediate morphologies in natural populations of O. taurus.

AB Growth rate has been established as a key parameter influencing foraging decisions involving the risk of predation, Through genetic manipulation transgenic salmon bred to contain and transmit a growth hormone transgene are able to achieve growth rates significantly greater than those of unmanipulated salmon. Using such growth-enhanced transgenic Atlantic salmon, we directly tested the hypothesis that relative growth rates should be correlated with willingness to risk exposure to a predator. We used size-matched transgenic and control salmon in two experiments where these fish could either feed in safety, or in the presence of the predator. The first experiment constrained the predator behind a Plexiglas partition (no risk of mortality), the second required the fish to feed in the same compartment as the predator (a fintie risk df mortality). During these experiments, transgenic salmon had rates of consumption that were approximately five times that of the control fish and rates of movement approximately double that of controls. Transgenic salmon also spent significantly more time feeding in the presence of the predator, and-consumed absolutely more food at that location. When there was a real risk of mortality, control fish almost completely avoided the dangerous location. Transgenic-fish continued to feed at this location, but at a reduced level. These data demonstrate-that the growth enhancement associated with the transgenic manipulation increases the level of risk these fish are willing to incur while foraging; If the genetic manipulation necessary to increase growth rates is achievable through evolutionary change, these;experiments suggest that growth rates of Atlantic salmon may be optimized by the risk of predation.

AB Predictions from Trivers & Willard's (1973, Science, 179, 90-92) hypothesis of sex-biased maternal investment in polygynous species do not apply well to species where mothers produce more than one offspring per reproductive attempt. First, as litter size increases, the benefits to the mother of adjusting sex ratio decrease because (1) she could benefit more by adjusting litter size and (2) sex differences in reproductive potential are negatively related to litter size. Second, testing sex-biased investment in these species requires predictions about the simultaneous adjustment of sex ratio and litter size. The wild boar, Sus scrofa, although polygynous, produces large litters. Here we present data for 58 litters from a free-ranging wild boar population in central Spain. Maternal expenditure per individual offspring, as measured by piglet weight, was higher for male than female fetuses. in-more than 81% of cases the heaviest fetus in the litter was a male regardless of the quality of the mother; this might have influenced his ranking within the 'teat order' and consequently his development and survival. Mother quality (size and weight) appeared to be related to litter size but not to the sex:ratio of the litter. However, it was highly related to a variable that combined the effects of litter size and sex ratio within the litter, thus supporting Williams' (1979, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series BI 205, 567-580) hypothesis that mothers Should adjust both litter size and offspring sex.

AB Two experiments on chimpanzee gaze following are reported. In the first, chimpanzee subjects watched as a human experimenter looked: around various types of barriers. The subjects looked around each of the barriers more when the human had done so than in a control condition (in which the human looked in another direction). In the second experiment, chimpanzees watched as a human looked towards the back of their cage. As they turned to follow the human's gaze a distracter object was presented. The chimpanzees looked at the distracter while still following the human's gaze to the back of the cage. These two experiments effectively disconfirm the low-level model of chimpanzee gaze following in which it is claimed that upon seeing another animate being's gaze direction chimpanzees simply turn in that direction and look around for something interesting. Rather, they support the hypothesis that chimpanzees follow the gaze direction Of other animate beings geometrically to specific locations, in much the same way as human infants. The degree to which chimpanzees have a mentalistic interpretation of the gaze and/or visual experience of others is still an open question. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, are gregarious carnivores whose social lives share much in common with those of cercopithecine primates. We conducted playback experiments to determine whether free-living hyaenas are capable of identifying individual conspecifics on the basis of their long-distance vocalization, the 'whoop'. When prerecorded cub whoops were played to mothers and other breeding females (controls), mothers responded significantly more vigorously to whoops of their own cubs than did controls. We also tested the hypothesis that specific vocal recognition abilities are based on kinship in this species. Listeners that were related to the whooping cub responded more vigorously to recorded vocalizations than did unrelated individuals, with response intensity in some cases increasing directly with the size of the coefficient of relatedness (r). Our final goal was to determine whether control animals in these experiments can recognize third-party social relationships among other group members, an ability demonstrated by vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops, in similar playback experiments conducted by earlier investigators. In contrast to vervets, control females in the present experiments were no more likely to look at the mother of the whooping cub than at other control females after playback. This suggests that hyaenas may accomplish many of the same social feats as do vervets without possessing the ability to recognize third-party relationships. If confirmed in other domains of hyaena social life, our findings have important implications regarding selection pressures favouring the evolution of intelligence.

ID POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; ALLOMETRY; GAIT
AB The tiny harvest mouse, Micromys minutus, is skilled at climbing among grasses, Owing to the short lactation period of 15-16 days, young harvest mice need to achieve this climbing skill very rapidly. We examined the early development of five components of climbing behaviour and the final climbing pattern of harvest mice from birth to weaning. During the lactation period, the pups' climbing ability developed rapidly and they were able to climb a vertical bar by the time they first emerged from their nest. Climbing skills were acquired in the following order: hand grasping at 3-7 days; foot grasping at 6-9 days; quadruped stance at 6-11 days; tail prehension at 10-11 days; and righting at 10-12 days. The ratio of foot digit length to foot length was greater in harvest mice than in laboratory mice, Mus musculus, indicating a better grasping ability in the former.

AB Male Pacific treefrogs, Hyla regilla, use advertisement and encounter calls to regulate intermale spacing within breeding choruses. When either type of call produced by a neighbour is detected above a particular amplitude, a resident frog responds aggressively by producing encounter calls. These 'aggressive thresholds' differ for the two call types and are plastic: males rapidly resume advertisement calling (accommodate) following repeated presentation of these calls above their aggressive threshold. We tested the hypothesis that this plasticity is the result of female preference for the advertisement call over the encounter call. Female choice was tested in a two-speaker phonotaxis assay with alternating presentation of the two call types. Of the 12 females that met our criteria for demonstrating a phonotaxic response, each approached the speaker playing the advertisement call rather than the encounter call: This strong female preference for the advertisement call supports our hypothesis, and suggests that the-plasticity in male calling behaviour allows males to maximize the time spent in producing advertisement calls to attract a female by rapidly adjusting their aggressive behaviour to; changes in male spacing within choruses.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID CERVUS-ELAPHUS L; RED DEER; MODELS
AB Methods of ranking individuals in a dominance hierarchy that use transitivity of relationships may obscure irregularities. Furthermore, these methods use only a small proportion of the information available from dominance encounters. This paper presents an intuitively appealing and easily implemented alternative to existing methods for ordering dominance data, developed from the work of Batchelder et al. (1992, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 36, 185-212). The procedure presented here is based on a mathematical model of paired comparisons and it involves only simple estimation procedures. We illustrate its use with,data on dominance among red deer, Cervus elaphus, stags. The results indicate that dominance relationships are well characterized by the scale values that the model provides, and, because the method provides predictions for all pairings. of animals, dominance predictions also exist for pairs of animals that have yet to be observed. Moreover, the dominance outcomes predicted by the model using the order scale are highly correlated with actual dominance observations at all levels. Overall, the procedure described provides a solution to the problem of identifying an appropriate order for a near-linear dominance hierarchy.

AB To date, it has proven difficult to demonstrate mirror self-recognition in gorillas. However, gorillas display pronounced gaze aversion that may prevent them from spending a sufficient amount of time exploring their mirror images to understand that they are the source of their reflections. It has also been suggested that the presence of observers may inhibit gorillas from engaging in mark-directed behaviours. To overcome th problem of gaze aversion, we used an angled-mirror apparatus developed by Anderson st Roeder (1989, Primates, 30, 581-587) that prevented two gorillas at the National Zoological Park from making direct eye contact with their reflections. To counter the observer inhibition hypothesis, we conducted mark tests on these animals using video cameras. Despite addressing these and other concerns in a series of four experiments, the gorillas did not show compelling evidence of self-recognition, even after over 4 years of mirror exposure.

AB In birds, asynchronous hatching typically leads to lower growth and survival of last-hatched chicks. However, all crimson rosella, Platycercus elegans, chicks grow at the same rate, although first-hatched chicks can be as much as seven times heavier than last-hatched chicks at the end of hatching. We examined the delivery and distribution of food to 18 rosella broods by videotaping feeds and simultaneously recording mass changes in the nestbox using a digital balance. Parents visited the nest infrequently and delivered loads of up to 25% of their body weight during a feeding visit. Male rosellas consistently delivered larger loads and consequently had higher feeding rates (g/h) than females. Parents distributed food between chicks by direct regurgitation in a series of up to 51 food transfers. Overall, chicks of all hatching ranks received equal numbers of transfers, but parents differed in how they distributed food within the brood. Males fed first-hatched chicks more than last-hatched chicks, whereas females distributed food equally to all chicks. Selective feeding of small chicks might be costly to females since they delivered food more slowly than males and spent more time in the nestbox. Thus female rosellas may invest more in current reproduction than males. Parents also distributed food differently to male and female chicks. Large males were fed more than all other nestlings, while female nestlings were fed equally irrespective of size. This study confirms that complex patterns of parental allocation occur in wild populations. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examine data on copula duration in dung flies, Scatophaga stercoraria, in relation to female phenotype. We use a marginal value theorem approach based on the plausible mechanisms of sperm competition to predict the effect of female variation on optimal copula duration, t*, from the male perspective. Future fertilizations are expected to have a trivial effect on t* with fully gravid females, but an increasing relative effect on t* towards completion of oviposition, t* is expected to be affected by female size because of variation in (1) a female's egg content, which increases the maximum egg gain available from a mating, and (2) the female reproductive tract, which affects the rate at which sperm are displaced. In fully gravid females, t* was not dependent on egg number variation, but showed a positive relation with egg content in females that had laid a varying proportion of their mature egg load at the time of mating, and were therefore not fully gravid. Our models predict that if a male can estimate egg content only by the distension of a female's abdomen, t* should increase in a similar way to that seen with 'take-over' females. We predict t* for fully gravid females by assuming that males can monitor female size. The data showed that sperm displacement rate decreased, and average egg content increased, with female size. Under two models for a sperm displacement mechanism, one (which assumes indirect displacement at a rate proportional to the increase in spermathecal volume) predicts the observed relation between t* and female size almost exactly. Small males copulated for longer than large males (as predicted and reported previously). (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To study whether absolute (m/s) or relative (body lengths/s) speed should be used to compare the vulnerability of differently sized animals, we developed a simple computer simulation. Human 'predators' were asked to 'catch' (mouse-click) prey of different sizes, moving at different speeds across a computer screen. Using the simulation, a prey's chances of escaping predation depended on its speed (faster prey were more difficult to catch than slower prey of the same body size), but also on its size (larger prey were easier to catch than smaller prey at the same speed). Catching time, the time needed to catch a prey, also depended on both prey speed and prey size. Relative prey speed (body lengths/s or body surface/s) was a better predictor of catching time than was absolute prey speed (m/s). Our experiment demonstrates that, in contrast to earlier assertions, per unit body length speed of prey may be more 'ecologically relevant' than absolute speed.

AB This study examines the role of dissolved oxygen in modifying female mate choice in the common goby, Pomatoschistus microps. Experimental manipulations of nests showed that under normal (saturated) oxygen conditions, females preferred to spawn in nests with the most elaborate construction, that is, those with the most sand on top and the smallest entrance. Such manipulated nests proved less vulnerable to detection by an egg predator, the shore crab, Carcinus maenas, but these small entrances may reduce oxygenation of eggs. indeed, in a low oxygen environment females with a choice between nests of high build and nests of low build did not significantly prefer either. This may have been due tb weakened preference or perhaps detection of a mismatch between the male's parental quality and the increased ventilation needs of eggs when nest entrance sizes are small and ambient oxygen levels are low. When nests were not manipulated, those males that built small entrances fanned their eggs more often, such that hatching success in the absence of a predator was not related to the initial size of the nest entrance area. Thus, under normal oxygen conditions males may initially build nests with the smallest entrance they are capable of ventilating successfully, and females choosing such males gain from nest camouflage. Under low oxygen, the risk that manipulated males may be unable to compensate fully may outweigh such benefits, and females may use other criteria that signal willingness to provide parental care.

AB I used the meme concept to investigate patterns of cultural variation among the songs of eight, geographically distinct populations of savannah sparrows. Memes composed of only one syllable were geographically widespread and randomly distributed among populations, but memes of two-, three- and four-syllables became progressively more restricted in their geographical distribution. Thus, the populations were memetically more similar with respect to one;syllable memes and more divergent with respect to larger memes. These results, suggest that differences in memetic mutation rates and susceptibility to loss by memetic drift could be sufficient to create the observed pattern of greater divergence-among populations for large memes.

   INVESTMENT
AB In studies on mammalian parental investment, time spent suckling is often used as a predictor of the milk transferred from mother to infant. It is assumed that the rate of milk transfer is positively correlated with the time spent suckling. However, this assumption has not been tested and empirical studies show conflicting results. Nevertheless, in species in which suckling ran readily be observed, time spent suckling is still used to measure milk transfer, although an increasing number of workers recognize that the measure is potentially inaccurate. A meta-analysis on studies that have correlated measures of time spent suckling with milk intake estimates based on weight gain revealed a weak positive relationship and significant heterogeneity between studies. Isotope-labelling techniques for the measurement of milk transfer independent of behaviour have been in use since the 1970s, particularly in studies of species in which suckling is difficult to observe. Only one study has attempted to correlate behavioural measures with independent isotope measures, and it found no relationship between the two measures. I suggest that researchers have avoided such a test as it is unlikely that a strong relationship will be found between milk transfer and suckling behaviour, and I discuss the various factors that confound the relationship and contribute to high heterogeneity between studies. Consequently, the assumption that milk transfer can be measured by time spent suckling has inadequate empirical foundation, and needs to be tested using isotope-labelling methods.

AB The capacity for vocal recognition of individual conspecifics is well documented in many species, but the perceptual mechanisms that underlie this ability in oscines are less well understood. Using-operant conditioning, we trained three groups of European starlings on a baseline task to discriminate the Songs of one male starling from those of four others. Each subject heard songs from the same five singers, but the to-be-recognized individual varied among birds. We grouped the subjects. according to sex and their degree of previous exposure to the songs used as stimuli in this experiment. The first group (N=5 males) identified their own songs from those of four familiar males. The second group (N=5 males) was familiar with the song stimuli, but none of the songs was their own. The third group (N=4 females) was unfamiliar with the songs, after learning the baseline discrimination; the subjects were exposed to new natural and synthetic stimuli. The subjects maintained the ability to identify correctly an individual on the basis of novel song bouts, and showed differential responding on the basis of the sequence of song types in song bouts that were modelled using Markov chains. Based upon patterns of responding to these different stimuli, we conclude that European starlings are capable of individual vocal recognition, and that this process is mediated by mechanisms involving the memorization of individually specific song types, the sequential ordering of song types within different bouts of an individual, and perhaps by individually specific spectral (or voice) characteristics that generalize across song types.

AB The costs associated with initial conflicts could be reduced if animals can assess the fighting ability of possible future opponents by watching their contest success against other individuals. We tested this hypothesis by conducting repeated dyadic dominance trials on size-matched juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. In the first trial a dyadic contest was 'observed' by a single fish separated by a transparent divider. In the second trial, the observer was paired against either the 'familiar' dominant fish or an unfamiliar dominant fish from the first trial. We predicted that observers should settle conflicts with previewed opponents faster and with less aggression than those with unfamiliar fish. This prediction was supported for observers that lost against a previewed competitor, since these fish reduced their aggression more rapidly than did unfamiliar observers. Familiar observers that won, however, showed a more rapid increase in aggression compared with unfamiliar winning observers. This suggests that! regardless of whether an observer challenges the initial dominant, this 'decision' is taken more rapidly in conflicts with preassessed contestants, because of the a priori information about their fighting ability. Since preassessment could save energy and allow effort to be concentrated on contests with a high payoff/probability of winning, selection may favour preview strategies when contest competition over resources is important for fitness.

AB Shoaling behaviour provides antipredator benefits that rely, to some extent, on a high degree of phenotypic homogeneity between individuals within the shoal. Therefore, fish should have the ability to discriminate between potential shoalmates, choosing to associate with individuals of similar appearance to themselves. We studied the effects of a single phenotypic character, body coloration, on association choices made by black and white mollies (Poecilia latipinna). When given a choice between a group of mollies of similar coloration and an empty compartment, individual test fish (black or white) spent significantly more time near the fish group. When given a choice between a group of black mollies and a group of white mollies, individual fish (black or white) spent significantly more time near the group of mollies of similar coloration to their own. When given a choice between a group of mollies of dissimilar coloration and an empty compartment, black and white mollies reacted differently. Black mollies spent significantly more time on the side of the central compartment closest to the white mollies, while there was no significant difference between the time spent by white mollies on either side of the test tank. Our results indicate that fish can use visual cues to discriminate actively between potential shoalmates on the basis of body coloration. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examined the effect of food limitation on fitness trade-offs between macroptery and time spent calling in the wing-dimorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus. The results of previous studies have shown that, under optimal conditions, the Proportionate time that males spend calling (with respect to neighbouring males) is directly associated with female attraction, and that micropterous (short-winged: SW) males call longer than macropterous (long-winged: LW) males (Crnokrak & Roff 1995, Animal Behaviour, 50, 1475-1481). Because crickets were examined under optimal Conditions, these studies did not attempt to address how or whether fitness trade-offs change with the environment. In the present study, we allowed crickets ad libitum access to water, but restricted food intake to the minimum amount that would keep them alive for 20 days. On average, SW males called longer than LW males On 18 of 20 days in the stressed group, and 17 of 20 days in the control group. For both groups, SW males also attracted more females more often than did LW males. Although the absolute call durations decreased in the stressed group compared with the control group, the relative call durations remained approximately the same, as did the proportion of females moving towards the SW male. Cumulative call distributions showed that LW males called little after 10 days of adult life; the amount of time SW males spent calling seemed constant for the duration of the experiment.

AB Parental investment may be biased with respect to parental sex or offspring sex or there may be an interaction between parental and offspring sex. We investigated whether any of these types of bias occurred in great tits, Parus major. By sexing chicks using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers and subsequently moving chicks between broods, we were able to manipulate broods early in the nestling period to give all-male, mixed-sex and all-female broods. Provisioning behaviour (total feeding rate, proportion of feeding visits by the male, prey size, visit duration and proportion of visits in which a faecal sac was removed) was measured for broods aged 8-9 and 11-12 days. Nest defence behaviour was measured for 15-day-old broods. Parental weight, the occurrence of second broods and overwinter survival of the parents were also analysed, There were some differences in parental care between the parents: males made the majority of feeding visits and were more vigorous in nest defence. However, there was no evidence that parental care varied in relation to brood sex ratio. or that there was an interaction in parental tare between parental sex and brood sex ratio.

AB The size and asymmetry of male secondary sexual traits are believed to convey reliable information to females concerning the quality of potential mates. Experimental manipulations of male sexual traits provide a powerful approach to the study of preference evolution. Nevertheless, the majority of studies rely on correlational evidence for selection acting on secondary sexual traits. Here we report that, in three of four populations of the European earwig, Forficula auricularia, females mated sooner with males with longer forceps although there was no female preference based on forceps asymmetry. We isolated the potentially confounding influences of forceps length and asymmetry by independently manipulating each trait. Manipulations of forceps length confirmed that females preferred males with longer forceps. However, manipulations of asymmetry revealed that although females pay attention to forceps condition, they show no preferences based on asymmetry. No relationships were found between the length and asymmetry of forceps in field populations, and there were no differences in rendition between symmetrical and asymmetrical males. Our results are consistent; with the notion that female choice has contributed to the sexual dimorphism in earwig forceps. However, they refute the notion that fluctuating asymmetry plays a role in sexual selection. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Several adaptive explanations regarding the function of lengthy copulations in insects have been proposed. They may represent a form of mate guarding, where the male physically prevents the female from copulating with rival males. Alternatively, they may function to:ensure full insemination of the male's sperm when copulation duration covaries with the amount of sperm transferred and male fertilization success. Finally, lengthy copulations may serve to allow males to assess female quality in terms of mating status and body weight. In this study I examine these hypotheses for the function Of lengthy copulations in the Australian bushcricket Coptaspis sp. 2 (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae). Unlike most other bushcrickets, males of this species do not produce a large spermatophylax that the female feeds on during insemination, but remain attached to the female's genitals up to 6 h after spermatophore attachment. Experimental manipulation of the duration of spermatophore attachment showed it to be related to the amount of sperm transferred. This suggests that the main function of copulation duration is to ensure complete transfer of the male's ejaculate. Males also discriminated between females, and provided mated females with more sperm which resulted in longer copulations than with virgin females. It is possible that possession of a large spermatophylax has been lost evolutionarily in this species,with males themselves acting as a sperm protection device during insemination.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID HYMENOPTERA; APIDAE; PREFERENCES; COLONIES
AB Animals assess the quality and quantity of food and choose among different foods based on these assessments. We explored whether there was genetic variation for assessment of pollen quality by foraging honey bees, Apis mellifera. Honey bees derived from two genotypic strains foraged for pollen of varying quality from a petri dish placed inside an outdoor flight cage. The strains were the result of a colony-level, two-way selection on amount of stored pollen. We used the forager's round dance to quantify the assessments of pollen quality by individually marked worker bees. The dance rate (number of 180 degrees turns per minute) and the probability of dancing were each greater when bees foraged for pure pollen compared with a lower-quality mixture of pollen and alpha-cellulose (1:1 by volume). Bees from the high-pollen genotypic strain had a higher dance rate than those from the low-pollen strain, suggesting different assessments. Bees from the low-pollen strain, however, had a higher probability of dancing than did bees from the high-pollen strain. Dance duration was not affected by a bee's strain or by the quality of pollen. We conclude that the dance rate may be used to quantify a forager's subjective evaluation of pollen quality and that this evaluation has a genetic component. Our results also suggest that the dance may function at the colony level to recruit bees to more profitable pollen sources. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The effects of conspecific density (i.e. risk of intraspecific competition) on hoarding behaviour were studied in breeding pairs of bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus. I simulated high population density by using odours of conspecifics, to exclude the direct effects of exploitation or interference competition for food. The pairs of bank voles hoarded only at the end of their breeding season. Hoarding was not correlated with whether the voles had a litter during the experiment or their litter size, but was more likely at the high population density and for pairs with small females. This may indicate that smaller females especially make caches in the autumn, possibly to ensure better winter survival under high population density. I discuss the hoarding behaviour of bank voles in relation to their territorial behaviour and food resources during the breeding season End predictable population changes during winter.

AB I examined ecological and behavioural variables influencing the susceptibility of red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus, nests to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, in a prairie-nesting population of redwings in southern Wisconsin. I compared the following variables between parasitized and unparasitized nests: proximity of nests to trees and other prominent perches; physical characteristics of nests such as nest height and cover; and aspects of host behaviour, including vocal behaviour and aggression directed towards female cowbirds. I used these data to discriminate among four non-exclusive hypotheses for how brood parasites locate host nests: the perch-proximity, nest-exposure, nesting-cue and host-activity hypotheses. Parasitized nests were significantly closer than unparasitized nests to trees in the 2 years of the study. There was no evidence that nest height or nest cover differed significantly between parasitized and unparasitized nests, suggesting that cowbirds do not use nest exposure as a cue for locating redwing nests. The responses of both parasitized and unparasitized redwings towards a female cowbird mount decreased with increasing mount presentation distance from the nest. There were no significant differences in responses towards the mount between parasitized and unparasitized redwings, giving no support for the nesting-cue hypothesis. Female redwings whose nests were subsequently parasitized gave significantly more nest-associated (type I) vocalizations during the egg-laying period than did unparasitized females. These findings suggest that female brown-headed cowbirds in search of potential host nests use trees to search from, and that female redwing vocalizations may serve as a proximate cue for cowbirds to locate redwing nests at appropriate stages for parasitism, giving support for both the perch-proximity and host-activity hypotheses.

AB European fiddler crabs place mudballs around their burrow openings. Both males and females placed mudballs, but there were major differences between the sexes in mudballing behaviour, suggesting that the female's mudballs were a by-product of digging out the burrow whereas the male's may have additional functions. When the male's mudballs were removed experimentally, the number and intensity of male-male agonistic interactions increased significantly; Experimentally visually isolated males spent longer making mudballs and less time waving. In a binary choice test, females were more likely to approach dummy males with mudballs, spent longer near these males and were more likely to enter their burrows than dummy males without mudballs. The same pattern was apparent for males with 30 rather than 20 mudballs. These results are consistent with a dual function for mudballs in U. tangeri: to reduce the number and intensity of aggressive interactions between neighbouring males and to attract females.

AB We investigated song sharing and dispersion of song types in the wild in a colour-marked population of the non-migratory Nuttall's white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli. The songs of fathers, their male progeny (sons), and the neighbours of the sons at recruitment sites were analysed spectrographically and compared qualitatively and quantitatively. To determine whether a son's song more closely matched that of his father or a neighbour at the site settled, we subjected frequency and temporal characteristics of songs within each father-son-neighbour triad to multivariate cluster analysis. The songs of 14 of 16 sons clustered with their neighbours' rather than their fathers' songs, confirming that song matching of neighbours is an integral component of territory settlement by juveniles. Principal components analysis of frequency and temporal measurements of song within a dialectal area show that songs group into neighbourhoods and are non-randomly distributed. Multivariate analysis suggests that sons may entrain on frequency and temporal characteristics of a neighbour's song without matching phrases or complex syllables. Implications for models of instructive versus selective learning are discussed. The timing of closure of the sensitive phase, the length of the silent interval between the sensory phase and plastic song stage, and the time to song crystallization remain open questions in song ontogeny.

AB Studies of inbreeding depression have traditionally suffered from two weaknesses. First, they usually confound offspring deficiencies with parental ones; second, they neglect the possible role of behaviour in inbreeding depression. In the present study, I examined the relationship among parental inbreeding, offspring viability and parental behaviour in two subspecies of the monogamous oldfield mouse, Peromyscus polionotus. Parental inbreeding was separated from any offspring inbreeding effects through both experimental design and analysis. Dams performed more parental behaviour than did sires, and maternal behaviour had a stronger effect on offspring survival than did paternal behaviour. Maternal behaviour was more buffered to the effects of inbreeding than was paternal behaviour; that is, parental behaviour of inbred females was not compromised. In contrast, inbred males showed substantial deficits in parental behaviour, but this did not put their offspring at risk. Although inbred females had lower reproductive success than outbred females, this effect was not manifest in terms of lower offspring viability. Therefore, inbreeding depression manifests itself through deficits on traits of adult females other than maternal care. A possible physiological basis for these findings is hypothesized.

AB Hatchling sea turtles emerge from underground nests, crawl to the ocean, and swim away from the land. In shallow water near shore, hatchlings maintain offshore headings by swimming into oceanic waves; in deeper water, however, turtles appear to rely on different mechanisms to maintain their courses. To determine whether loggerhead hatchlings, Caretta caretta L., are able to transfer a course initiated on the basis of waves to a course maintained by a magnetic compass, we studied the orientation behaviour of turtles that had been exposed to waves for either 15 or 30 min before being tested in still water. Hatchlings that swam into waves for 15 min failed to continue swimming on similar courses when the waves were discontinued, but turtles that swam into waves for 30 min maintained similar mean headings after the waves stopped. Inverting the vertical component of the magnetic field during the test period reversed the direction of orientation of this latter group of turtles. Thus, hatchlings can transfer a heading induced by waves to a magnetic compass, and thereby continue to migrate away from land after contact with the coast is lost. Migratory orientation in turtles resembles that of birds in that both rely on multiple cues and an ability to transfer information between various cues and compasses at appropriate times during the journey.

AB Defence strategies of established, familiar rock pipit neighbours were studied in a population breeding at high density. Theoretical arguments suggest that an armistice and some form of cooperative defence should occur between familiar, territorial neighbours when an intruder tries to settle in an occupied area and owners risk losing part of their territories and renegotiating boundaries. Boundary displays were at a low and steady level after neighbours had been claiming their territories for 4 days and owners were then considered familiar and established. Familiar neighbours entered into an armistice when confronted with an intruder in border zones and also in the adjacent area, that is, inside the familiar neighbour's territory boundary. Neighbours were also involved in coordinated evictions of intruders in half of the encounters between two neighbours and an intruder within established territories. Hence, observational data on fighting behaviour of rock pipit neighbours show the existence of armistice and support the hypothesis of cooperative defence among established, territorial neighbours.

AB The establishment of mixed broods in populations of Canada geese, Branta canadensis, has been a subject of controversy. The possible adaptive significance of this behaviour was evaluated as it relates to the survivorship of goslings. Distance of goslings from the adults, gosling status (i.e. natural or adopted) and survivorship to 5 years were measured to predict the value of aggregation behaviour. Spatial data indicated that adopted goslings were further from female adults than natural goslings. Recapture data indicated that mixed broods improved the survivorship of natural goslings.

   CONFLICTS; GAME
AB Both agonistic and sexual animal displays often involve more than one performance of some specific display action. Since repetition is energetically costly there must be good reasons why a signaller should carry out such repetitive actions, rather than simply displaying once. We briefly review three different 'reasons' which arise from three different receiver assessment rules. when assessment is based on the average magnitude of all display actions so far, the reason for the repetition is to improve the accuracy of the estimate (model A); when the assessment is based solely on the action of greatest magnitude so far, the repetition is to replace the signal with one of greater magnitude (model B); when the assessment is based on the cumulative sum of all display actions so far, the repetition is to augment that sum (model C). We discuss how to characterize each case from an understanding of its expected optimal behaviour as predicted by formal models. For model A the mean magnitude of display actions should stay constant and the contest duration should depend on relative qualities. In models B and C the encounter duration depends only on the weaker participant. In model B each display action is greater than the previous, but only a small number of steps are expected. In model C the magnitude of display actions can either escalate, stay constant, or even decrease. The displays of cichlid fish, the roaring contests of red deer, Cervus elaphus, the calling of Blanchard's cricket frogs, Acris crepitans blanchardi, and the pheromonal exchanges of yeast gametes are used as illustrative examples.

AB In many cooperatively breeding birds and mammals, group size is positively correlated with reproductive success. In marmoset and tamarin monkeys, species that display cooperative breeding, the presence of helpers appears to be critical for offspring survival, and breeders might be expected to display social strategies that would regulate group size. This study investigated the association between group size and aggression towards strangers in Wied's black tufted-ear marmosets, Callithrix kuhli, from small groups (with no helpers present) and large groups (with helpers present). Residents were exposed to multiple presentations of male and female strangers. Breeding females from large groups spent more time in close proximity to strangers, showed higher levels of agonistic displays and engaged in higher levels of aggressive behaviour towards intruders than did breeding females from small groups. Breeding male behaviour did not dramatically differ as a function of group size. After the removal of the intruder, female breeders from large groups showed higher levels of scent-marking relative to baseline observations, and time spent in close proximity to the partner increased after exposure to female intruders in large, but not small, groups. The results reveal that breeders from small groups are tolerant of strangers, which may facilitate the recruitment of additional group members, whereas breeders from large groups, particularly females, are intolerant of strangers, which may inhibit immigration. These findings have implications for understanding mechanisms that regulate immigration in cooperatively breeding animals, and suggest of how breeders from small groups might reconcile the serious limitation of having few or no helpers.

AB The Cape ground squirrel, Xerus inauris, is a social species of ground squirrel inhabiting the arid areas of southern Africa. The high degree of sociality in this species is due to the occurrence of all-male social groups. This study used scan and all-occurrence sampling to investigate male grouping in this species. Several hypotheses concerning the cause and function of all-male groups were addressed: aggregations around oestrous females, assessment of competitors, enhanced thermoregulation, reproductive alliances, satellite males, information exchange and enhanced predator avoidance. Males were able to detect the onset of oestrus in females. Although oestrus influenced male group size, males continued to group beyond the breeding period. These groups persisted throughout the year, regardless of ambient temperature. Older males were better at finding oestrous females than younger males, but younger males did not preferentially associate with older males to follow them to females. Results best support the hypothesis that males benefit from enhanced predator detection and deterrence. Aggregations of males roaming between groups of asynchronously breeding females may persist beyond the breeding period because the benefits to survival outweigh the relatively minor costs of reproductive competition.

   DURATION
AB Paternity-defence behaviour in two congeners, violet-green swallows, Tachycineta thalassina, and tree swallows, T. bicolor, was compared to identify ecological factors that influence how males avoid being cuckolded. Measurements of the proportion of time that mates spent together, their following behaviour and the rate of within-pair copulations revealed that male violet-green swallows allocated more time to guarding mates than nests and copulated with their mates relatively infrequently, while male tree swallows had opposite patterns. Males of each species were temporarily detained to test whether they faced different levels of competition for nest sites and female mates. Detained male violet-green swallows were more likely to be cuckolded than to lose their nests. Numerous nonterritorial male floaters tried to gain access to each unguarded female violet-green swallow by following her, but they did not try to monopolize her nest. Detained male tree swallows suffered high risks of both nest loss and cuckoldry, because male intruders (usually territorial neighbours) tried to usurp the nest and copulate with the unguarded female when she was at the nest. Detained female violet-green swallows were not replaced by unmated female floaters, but detained female tree swallows were replaced. These results suggest that male violet-green swallows faced higher competition for females than for nest sites and benefited more by guarding mates than nests. The reverse was true for tree swallows. Paternity defence behaviour by males of the two species has diverged in response to these different challenges, at least in the populations studied.

AB Male wolf spiders, Schizocosa ocreata, possess tufts of bristles on the forelegs, which are used in visual courtship displays, but males of a closely related species, S. rovneri, lack tufted forelegs. In studies with live males, female S. ocreata showed receptivity more often to males with larger tufts than to males with smaller or shaved tufts. Male body size and/or shaving of tufts may affect male courtship behaviour, however, which could influence female receptivity. Manipulated video images of the same courting male were used to control for male behaviour and to test the hypothesis that these tufts influence female choice. Video images of S. ocreata, and images of S. rovneri males (control: without tufts; experimental: with tufts added) were shown to females of both species. Female S. ocreata showed lowered receptivity to a video of a male with tufts removed and equal receptivity to a video of a male with enhanced tufts compared to a control video of a conspecific male with typical tufts. Responses of female S. ocreata to heterospecific video male S. rovneri were significantly lower than to conspecifics. In contrast, female S. rovneri are more receptive to video images of conspecific males with tufts added and heterospecific male S. ocreata than to control images. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that tufts are apomorphic, and that S. rovneri is more basal within the dade than S. ocreata. Since female S. rovneri respond receptively to both conspecific and heterospecific males with tufts and/or active leg waving displays, these results may provide evidence of pre-existing bias and/or sexual selection for a novel trait.

AB Isolated adult male CFLP mice were exposed in their home cage to the odours of unfamiliar males and females. Their immunocompetence and resistance to subsequent experimental infection with Babesia microti were lower than those of control animals. Males that had held high social rank in previously established groups had a more severer infection than those that had been low rankers. The reduction in resistance among high rankers was most pronounced when female odours were combined with the odours of another male. Analysis of changing serum hormone concentrations over the period of exposure to odours suggested that hormone-related resistance reflected the degree of modulation of immunodepressive hormones in relation to current immune status. The results are interpreted in terms of adaptive trade-offs between immune function and competing metabolic demands. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The heritabilities of copula duration (h(2)=0.39, P<0.01), body size (h(2)=0.76, P<0.001) and development time (h(2)=0.23, P<0.05), plus their genetic covariances, in the yellow dung fly, Scathophaga stercoraria (L.), were assessed using full sibling analysis. The relative order of magnitude of the values agrees with that of other data: morphological>behavioural>life-history characters. Repeated measures of copula duration for each male revealed a general increase in copula duration with Julian date or age. The individual pattern of this change in copula duration (here termed 'flexibility'), an expression of phenotypic plasticity, was itself marginally heritable (h(2)=0.19, P=0.065). Significant positive phenotypic and genetic covariance was evident only between flexibility of copula duration and body size. All other correlations were not different from zero, including those between development time and body size and between copula duration and body size. It is suggested that in S stercoraria populations there is some averaging selection towards a mean optimal copula duration which can guide an individual's behaviour in a variety of environments. At the same time, there is selection for phenotypic plasticity which allows individuals to adapt their behaviour to their immediate environment. These effects together are consistent with both the assumptions of optimality models and the classic results on copula duration in yellow dung flies.

AB Like freshwater pulmonate snails in general, mature Physa heterostropha pomilia (Say) are hermaphroditic but cannot reciprocally inseminate each other simultaneously. One member of a pair assumes the male role and the other the female, after which swapping may occur. The tendency for a pair of prospective copulants to elect the same sexual role was defined as gender conflict, and distinguished from sexual conflict, the more widely noted tendency for females to reject low-quality males. Experiments assessed whether previous reproductive history affected the likelihood of mating and the sexual role assumed and evaluated the strength of gender and sexual conflicts. Snails were selected from isofemale lines fixed for albinism at two complementary loci. Ten pairings were made involving all combinations of four categories of reproductive history: previously selfing virgin, not previously selfing virgin, previously selfing mated, and not previously selfing mated. Encounter times, evasive behaviours, and polarity of mating were recorded. Results suggested that the probability of initiating copulation as male in any encounter increased with autosperm store, and that snails mounted as female may decrease the overall probability of mating by rejective behaviour when their reserves of allosperm are high. There was no evidence that snails ever use any mechanism to increase their likelihood of being mounted as female. Evasive behaviours observed in encounters between virgin snails were best attributed to male-male gender conflict, but such behaviour patterns seemed to derive from sexual conflict when virgin snails encountered previously mated snails. Male-male gender conflict did not, however, detectably lengthen contact times, lead to bouts of sperm trading or ultimately lower mating success.

AB At a colony of Gunnison's prairie dogs, Sciuridae: Cynomys gunnisoni, containing marked individuals of known genetic relationships, anti-predator calling was investigated in response to moving, stuffed specimens of a natural predator, the American badger, Taxidea taxus. Females with kin in the home territory called more often than females without nearby kin, and females with nearby offspring were especially likely to call. Male gunnisons commonly gave anti-predator calls as well, but male calling was unrelated to kinship of nearby listeners. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB A 7-year study of brown hyaenas of the Central Kalahari, Botswana, showed a-separate, linear dominance hierarchy within each sex. The highest-ranking female shared equal rank with the alpha male, and she had the highest feeding time of all dan members. The immigrant alpha male was dominant over all other dan females and all natal males. The advantages of high rank for dan females were (1) increased feeding time at carcasses, (2) the opportunity to remain in the dan and rear cubs in the communal den, where non-parental provisioning was highly developed and (3) more offspring surviving to maturity. The advantages of high rank for males were (1) increased feeding time at carcasses and (2) more observed copulations than nomadic males had with females. The primary mating system observed was uni-male polygyny. Other behaviour patterns that indirectly and directly augment reproductive success were also observed for both sexes. Intense competition between females may have led to reduced sexual dimorphism in brown hyaenas. The differences between the social behaviour of brown hyaenas of the Central Kalahari and those of the Southern Kalahari may be based on environmental factors and diet.

AB Vagrant, non-breeding common ravens, Corvus corax, inhabiting the forested mountains of Maine are specialized to feed on rich but ephemeral carcasses of large mammals during the harsh winter months. The foraging and roosting behaviour of free-ranging ravens were studied during the winters of 1988-1990. Ravens quickly assembled at carcasses, and into communal roosts. Six lines of evidence indicate that these roosts function as information centres. (1) Roosts comprised both knowledgeable and naive foragers. (2) Departures from roosts were highly synchronized, with most members departing in one direction. (3) Direction of departure often changed from day to day. (4) Birds made naive of food sources (by being withheld from the wild and then allowed to join roosts) followed roost-mates to new feeding sites, whereas control birds held and released outside of roosts rarely found the local food bonanzas. (5) Birds made knowledgeable of food sources (by being released at new carcasses) joined roosts and led roost-mates to the food on three of 20 occasions. (6) The same individuals switched leader and follower roles depending upon their knowledge of feeding opportunities. Although ravens may form roosts at traditional areas (near stable food sources) that are used for many years, the ravens in Maine frequently shifted roost sites to be near newly discovered carcasses. Information exchange at roosts principally occurred on the night of, or the night before, the roost shift. Social soaring displays assembled birds from a wide area and were associated with mass movements to new roosts formed at nearby food. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

TI SWIMMING SPEED AND ALLOCATION OF TIME DURING THE DIVE CYCLE IN ANTARCTIC
   FUR SEALS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID DIVING BEHAVIOR; ELEPHANT SEALS; PERFORMANCE; ECOLOGY; DEEP
AB During sustained bouts of diving, predators such as fur seals may adjust the time they spend diving to maximize the time they can spend foraging and minimize the time spent at the surface between dives. To examine this, swimming speeds and the time allocated to different parts of the dive cycle were measured in 10 adult female Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, while they were foraging at sea. Mean swimming speeds during diving ranged from 1.32 to 1.99 m/s and 90% of diving swimming speeds within individuals were between 1 and 2.5 m/s. This represented a narrower range of speed than was exhibited by animals when swimming at the surface. Swimming speeds were fastest during the descent and ascent phases of dives with a reduction in speed near the bottom of the dive, when the seals were assumed to be feeding on krill. Time spent at the surface increased as a curvilinear function of dive duration and was influenced by diving swimming speed. This relationship was, on average, close to that predicted by a model (Houston & Carbone 1992, Behav. Ecol, 3, 255-265) which suggested that the metabolic rate was greatest during the foraging phase of dives (5.9 times predicted BMR) than during the ascent or descent (3.6 times predicted BMR). Deep diving (>30 m) and high swim speeds also incurred costs in terms of reduced foraging time and may explain why mean dive depths for individuals were within the range of 12-33 m. These data broadly support the predictions of models of diving behaviour based on balancing the supply of, and demand for, oxygen and the principle that fur seals are attempting to maximize the time they spend within the foraging area.

   STARVATION; WORKERS
AB In social insects, the size, caste and reproductive capacity of adults is determined in part by nutrition during larval development. Among ants, workers bring food to immobile larvae, giving workers potential control over larval nutrition, and making social feeding a potential mechanism of individual and colony ontogeny. During each regurgitation (trophallaxis), workers feed larvae the same, small increment of liquid food, regardless of larval attributes and conditions. Therefore, differences in the total volume of food ingested by larval resulted from differences in the rates of trophallaxis to them, not from differences in the durations of trophallaxis. The rates of worker-to-larva trophallaxis (feedings/h) were examined to investigate the mechanisms by which liquid food is allocated to larvae by workers. The rate of trophallaxis increased with larval food deprivation. The magnitude of this increase depended upon the larva's size. When larvae were food-deprived, larger larvae were fed at significantly higher rates than were smaller larvae (13 feedings for each mu l of larval volume). Once larvae of all sizes were satiated, workers fed them at similarly low rates. Regardless of size, larvae required about 8 h of feedings to reach satiation; that is, small larvae did not become sated any sooner than did medium or large larvae. Rates of trophallaxis were independent of: (1) the size or hunger of adjacent larvae, (2) rates, of larval encounter by workers (larvae were encountered hundreds of times per h but were fed only tens of times); (3) larval location on the brood pile (top or bottom); and (4) larval body orientation (mouthparts up or down). These results provide the first quantitative evidence that an individual larval hunger cue directs the feeding of each larva, and that the strength of this cue, and therefore the feeding rate, varies with larval size and hunger.

AB In polygynous passerines, males of some species provide food for their nestlings, but male incubation seems to be rare. In the European starling both the mating system and the extent to which males help with incubation vary. This enabled the relationship between mating system and male incubation to be investigated. The extent to which males provided care to a particular nest depended on mating status: monogamous males incubated more than polygynous males did in any of their females' nests. On average, bigynous males incubated as much in their two nests as monogamous males did in their single nest, but polygynous males who invested in only one of their nests incubated less than monogamous males. Females partly compensated for the variation in male incubation, but still nests of polygynously mated females were attended less. Polygynous males invested more in the nests of the first females mated with (primary female) than in the nests of later settling females. Secondary females received less help the later they laid their eggs in relation to the mate's primary female. Bigynous males that incubated in both their nests invested more in the nests of their primary females the earlier these eggs were laid in relation to those of the secondary females. Male help with incubation may affect a female's fitness, both because increased attentiveness resulted in shorter incubation times and because females receiving less help may pay a higher cost in terms of energy expenditure. Hence, there will be a conflict between polygynously mated females over paternal incubation. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB More than 37 000 records of northern fur seals tagged at their natal areas and resighted during a recent mark-recapture study and past commercial harvests, were analysed to study the age and sex variation, and temporal dynamics of natal site fidelity in this highly polygynous, long-lived, migratory species. Data were available on males (2-6 years old) and females (2-20 years old). All ages and sex classes with sufficient sample sizes to allow statistical tests showed a significant tendency to return to the same area of the island where they were born. The proportion of young male and female seals found at their natal area during the breeding season increased significantly with age. Young females showed significantly greater age-specific natal site fidelity than young males (ages 2-6 years) and apparently exhibited their maximum site fidelity at a younger age than males. The increasing expression of natal site fidelity with age appears to be related to sexual maturation and reproductive activity, the latter beginning later in males than in females. Within a season, natal site fidelity of juvenile males increased with time since arrival on St Paul Island. This change in site fidelity implies that they may be less particular in selecting a landing site when they first arrive, then begin to orient more specifically towards their natal area. This behaviour may indicate a transition from a general homing goal while migrating (the island as a whole) to a more specific goal (the natal area) upon arrival.

AB Two species of insectivorous bats, Lasiurus cinereus and L. borealis, ate significantly more male than female moths in the wild. The observed bias was likely to be a consequence of sexual dimorphism in moth flight activity associated with sexual differences in mate acquiring mechanisms. Female moths flew less than males and their activity peaks occurred at different times. The peak of male activity coincided with a peak in bat activity in the middle of the night, while female activity peaked earlier in the night when bat activity was relatively low. The results of this study are interpreted in a sexual selection framework, and the conclusions about predation risk from bats that hunt airborne prey are applicable to all nocturnally flying insects that exhibit sexual dimorphism in flight activity.

AB Juvenile Anolis aeneus lizards were released into patches of microhabitat in the field, and their social interactions and space use recorded throughout the settlement period. Two hypotheses about the role of social interactions in space acquisition were tested: (1) settlers win space by winning contests and (2) settlers win space by persistence. Results supported the second hypothesis. Juveniles did not acquire the areas in which they won interactions with opponents, and in the vast majority of dyads, both the winner and the loser subsequently avoided the location of their first encounter with one another. A second set of analyses focused on 'space transfers', in which one settler gained possession of space that had been used by its opponent before they began to interact with one another. Subordinates were as successful as dominants at taking space from their opponent, and space transfers by dominants and subordinates were virtually identical with respect to estimates of the costs and benefits of space acquisition. Dominants acquired space by repeatedly chasing subordinates, and the amount of space that transferred from subordinate to dominant was positively related to the rate at which the dominant attacked the subordinate. Conversely, subordinates took space by persisting in the face of repeated attacks by dominants, and the amount of space taken by a subordinate was inversely related to the rate at which the subordinate was attacked by the dominant. Overall, dyads with space transfers interacted at higher rates for a longer period of time than dyads without transfers, and dyads with transfers were more likely to end up with overlapping activity areas than were dyads that resolved their disputes without taking space from one another. Two factors had independent effects on the probability that a dyad would engage in a transfer: (1) spatial overlap when the pair first encountered one another and (2) contender pressure in the patch of territorial habitat.

TI KINSHIP AND ASSOCIATION IN COMMUNALLY ROOSTING BLACK VULTURES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID HUMAN DNA; COOPERATION; BIRDS; FOOD
AB Black vultures, Coragyps atratus, spend each night in a communal roost, and individuals sleep at several different roosts over time. They feed in large aggregations at carcasses and engage in apparently cooperative behaviour within coalitions of individuals that co-occur predictably at both roosts and carcasses. Roost census data and DNA fingerprinting results were used to investigate whether black vultures tend to roost in the company of genetic relatives. Restricting the analysis to dyads of breeding adults that were the heads of known lineages and were not mated to one another, a positive correlation emerged between indices of the genetic similarity of individuals and their tendency to use the same roost on the same night. The results provide evidence of long-term associations between some closely related breeding adults, associations that appear not to be simply a consequence of natal philopatry but reflect the daily reassembly of coalitions at communal roosting sites. This social organization could facilitate the evolutionary stability of cooperation among communally roosting black vultures.

AB The spermatophore transferred by a male decorated cricket, Gryllodes sigillatus, at mating includes a large gelatinous spermatophylax, devoid of sperm, which the female removes and feeds on after copulation. Previous studies have shown that consumption of the spermatophylax keeps the female preoccupied while sperm from the remaining portion of the spermatophore is expelled into her reproductive tract; hence, the spermatophylax functions to ensure complete sperm transfer. To determine whether consumption of the spermatophylax also provides significant nutritional benefits to females and whether such benefits are contingent on food availability, female G. sigillatus were allowed to consume zero, one, or three spermatophylaxes per day and were either deprived bf food, fed 30% of ad libitum food demands, or allowed unrestricted access to food (Purina(R) cricket chow). The number of spermatophylaxes consumed by females had no significant effect on the mass of eggs or number of nymphs produced, and there was no significant interaction between the number of spermatophylaxes consumed and food availability. Although there may be other benefits to its consumption, the present study suggests that as a food 'gift', the spermatophylax is a sham.

AB Insects affected by parasitoids can alter their behaviour after infection; however, it is not always obvious whether the changed behaviour increases the fitness of the host or the fitness of the parasitoid. Workers of Bombus terrestris containing an endoparasitoid larva (Diptera: Conopidae) dug into the soil before they died. This digging behaviour resulted in the selection of a protected hibernation site for the parasitoid pupa and represented a selective advantage for the parasitoid, because hibernation in the soil led to larger and heavier adult flies, showing fewer malformations in wings than flies hibernating on the ground. The observed digging behaviour of parasitized bumblebee workers enhanced parasitoid fitness only, while its effects on host fitness were neutral.

TI VOCAL REGULATION OF TEMPERATURE BY AVIAN EMBRYOS - A LABORATORY STUDY
   WITH PIPPED EGGS OF THE AMERICAN WHITE PELICAN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When exposed to temperatures above or below normal mean incubation temperature, embryonic American white pelicans, Pelecanus erythrorhynchos, at the pipped egg stage called quickly and strongly in a graded fasion, then soon stopped calling when temperatures were returned to normal. The ability of pelican embryos to regulate their own body temperature by calling was examined by subjecting pipped eggs to an incubation temperature that was either above (50.degree. C) or below (20.degree. C) normal in a  surrogate incubation apparatus that automatically returned incubation temperature to near-normal levels for a brief 4-min period whenever an experimental embryo called in response to heating or cooling. Under these conditions, embryonic temperatures initially drifted about 2.degree. C from normal, then stabilized until the end of a 2-h experimental period. When a return to normal incubation temperature was controlled by calls of an embryo held in another room (yolked control), body temperature drifted erratically, and tended towards ambient, indicating that temperature regulation could not be achieved simply by random calling. Results show that late-stage pelican embryos are capable of vocal regulation of temperature provided a parent or surrogate responds appropriately to the embryo''s calls. Vocal regulation of embryonic temperature by calling to cooperative parents is potentially operative in a wide range of precocial and some altricial species of birds.

TI PLAY IN THE DOMESTIC CAT IS ENHANCED BY RATIONING OF THE MOTHER DURING
   LACTATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mothers of eight litters of domestic cats, Felis catus, were given a rationed diet after the birth of their kittens so that they received approximately 80% of the energy intake when given ad libitum food. Rationing of the whole family was maintained until the end of the period in which the family were observed. The subsequent play of the kittens was compared with that of litters of the same mothers when the families were given ad libitum food. When the mothers received rationed food,  their kittens played with objects significantly more than when the mothers received ad libitum food. This was a specific effect and was not due to a general increase in the activity of the rationed kittens. Over the first 18 days after birth the extent to which mothers were unavailable to their kittens when rationed was strongly correlated with the object play of their kittens 70-84 days after birth. While the kittens in the rationed condition were well buffered from the effects of rationing,  they nuzzled significantly more than those in the ad libitum condition in apparent attempts to reach their mothers'' nipples.

TI ALTERNATION OF HEMIPENIS USE AS A BEHAVIORAL MEANS OF INCREASING SPERM
   TRANSFER IN THE LIZARD ANOLIS-SAGREI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male lizards and snakes possess two functionally independent intromittent organs termed hemipenes, only one of which is intromitted into the female''s cloaca during copulation. In the lizard Anolis sagrei, a significant proportion of males alternate in the use of the left and right hemipenes when the intercopulatory interval is 24 h or less but not when it is 72 h. This study investigated whether the observed alternating pattern of hemipenis use in A. sagrei is a behavioral means of  increasing sperm transfer to females in succesive copulations. Males that were experimentally prevented from alternating in the use of the hemipenes in two copuations separated by 1- or 24-h intercopulatory intervals transferred significantly fewer sperm in the second copulation than did males that were permitted to alternate. This difference was not observed when the intercopulatory interval was 72 h. Males that were prevented from alternating in the use of the hemipenes in a series of three  copulations, which were separated by 24 h, delivered significantly fewer sperm in the second and third copulations that did males that were permitted to alternate. These results support the hypothesis that alternation of hemipenis use is a behavioral means of increasing sperm transfer when the interval between copulations is relatively brief.

TI MALE CHARACTERISTICS, VIABILITY AND HAREM SIZE IN THE PHEASANT,
   PHASIANUS-COLCHICUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A population of pheasants was studied for 4 years in southern Sweden to determine how sexual selection operates among males. Morphological characters, viability, dominance, territory quality, date of territorial establishment, harem size and reproductive success of males were measured; 81 males and 101 females were radio-tracked. The spur length of males was the most important predictor of harem size. Phenotypic condition and viability were significantly related to spur length, the best single predictor of the reproductive success of males. These are the first data to show that a sexually selected male character correlates significantly with male viability. The results support models suggesting that viability-based processes can contribute to the evolution of mate choice and secondary sexual characters.

TI MATE CHOICE AND PAIR FORMATION IN TIMOR AND AUSTRALIAN MAINLAND ZEBRA
   FINCHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mate choice and pair formation of captive zebra finches from the Australian mainland, Taeniopygia guttata castanotis, and from Timor, T. g. guttata, were compared. In the multiple mate-choice test, an individual could show a preference for perching near a particular bird but could not form a pair bond (e.g. by clumping together). In the pair-formation test, individuals in a flock in an aviary were allowed to form pairs freely. The two subspecies preferred members of their own subspecies in mate-choice tests and mated assortatively in the aviary. When females were presented with Timor males, half of whom had been painted to resemble Mainland males, Timor females both preferred and paired with unpainted Timor males whereas Mainland females approached both unpainted and painted Timor males but paired with the latter. When Mainland males were introduced into the aviary only three out of 10 of these Mainland females re-paired with Mainland males, reflecting the stability of the pair bond. Males and females generally paired with the bird that preferred in the initial mate-choice tests, if that individual was not already paired. In mate-choice tests conducted after pair formation, most birds preferred the individual they had already paired with. However, those that paired last and had not laid eggs preferred the bird they had chosen in the first mate-choice test rather than the individual they paired with in the aviary.

TI A COMPARATIVE-STUDY OF CACHE RECOVERY BY 3 CORVID SPECIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The cache recovery behaviour of Clark''s nutcrackers, Nucifraga columbiana, pinyon jays, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus, and scrub jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens, was studied following each of two types of caching sessions. During one caching session, the birds could place about eight caches in any of 15 sand-filled holes available in the floor. During the other caching session, cache site selection was less restricted, with 90 holes available in the floor. Seven days after each caching session,  recovery accuracy was tested with 90 holes open. All three species cached and then recovered their caches with accuracies greater than expected by chance. Pinyon jays had a strong tendency to place their caches close together, especially when 90 holes were available for caching. The recovery accuracy of nutcrackers and pinyon jays was higher than that of scrub jays. These results indicate important behavioural differences among these birds that may correlate with differences in natural history. They also suggest that there may be differences in spatial memory ability among these species.

TI SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION AND MATING SYSTEM OF FREE-RANGING, GREATER
   WHITE-TOOTHED SHREWS, CROCIDURA-RUSSULA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Indirect evidence from trapping suggests that Crocidura russula is less solitary and territorial than other shrews. To study the social organization and mating system, free-ranging adult and juvenile C. russula were tracked simultaneously throughout the year using a radioactive tracking technique. Coincident rest, coincident activity and home range overlap were measured. During winter, all individuals used the same communal nest and spent on average 84% of their total rest in coincident rest. This led to a large home range overlap (52% on average). Coincident activity was low (2% on average). At the onset of the reproductive season the females became territorial and shared their nest with only one male. During pair formation, coincident activity and home range overlap were significantly greater between than within sexes. The social organization of C. russula appeared to be strongly influenced by season and differed in this respect from the other species in the genus Sorex which are territorial throughout the year.

TI THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF ANTLION PITS - SLOPE ASYMMETRY AND
   PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Larvae of the antlion, Myrmeleon crudelis, build conical pitfall traps in sand that are asymmetric, with lower-sloped walls in the part of the pit where the antlion. The front walls also tend to be lined with a higher density of fine sand. Simulation of movement at the pit bottom showed that this asymmetry can result from movement by the antlion. If asymmetry reduces prey capture efficiency, antlions should shift their position in the pit, and thereby reduce the impact of their movement on any given wall. Alternatively, if asymmetry is a design feature, antlions can maintain this feature by remaining in the same position for extended periods of time. Observations support the later hypothesis. Sixty-one per cent of 41 antlions tested remained in the same orientation for the entire observation time (9-14 days), and 20% remained in the same orientation for at least 5 days, then maintained a different orientation for the remainder of the experiment. Ant escape behaviour was analysed in relation to the asymmetry of the pit walls. The initial escape direction was random, but if ants moved to another part of the pit after their initial escape attempt (66% of escapes), they tended to travel to a steeper wall. The opposite occurred when ants escaped from artificial pits containing no antlions. Thus by constructing an asymmetric pit, the antlion compensates for its inability to efficiently capture prey that escape to the front of the pit. The antlion can throw sand directly at prey that attempt to escape in the back of the pit; they can also reach over their backs to capture prey, and can walk after prey in this direction. None of these behaviours is available if prey try to escape forward in the pit. A change in pit design with antlion size is discussed in light of these results.

TI USE OF VIBRATORY CUES FOR DETECTION OF INSECT PREY BY THE SANDSWIMMING
   LIZARD SCINCUS-SCINCUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sandfish lizard, Scincus scincus, inhabits the Sahara Desert [Africa] and spends most of its time buried in the sand. Laboratory experiments were performed to determine if Scincus can respond and orient to insects on the sand surface by detecting vibrations produced by movements of the insects. When buried, Scincus can detect and respond to crickets and mealworms moving over the surface at distances up to about 15 cm. These responses were guided by vibratory cues, not olfactory cues, as the lizards responded much less frequently to dead insects placed on the surface at equal distances. The lizards obtain directional information from the vibrations, and can localize the insects, orient toward them, and emerge from the sand to capture them. When walking on the surface of the sand, Scincus often displays a peculiar behaviour of plunging its head into the sand. Experiments determined that this behaviour aid lizards in detecting vibrations produced by insects moving through the sand, and presumably facilitate transmission of sand-borne vibrations to the inner ear.

AB Fighting between male natterjack toads, Bufo calamita, for access to females was studied in relation to both the influence of male and female density each night and the operational sex ratio. Fighting males were larger than other males and were present in the breeding area on more nights but their average mating success was the same. Fighting between males was associated with not strongly male-biased operational sex ratios. The density of breeding individuals, however, was irrelevant. Take-over rate was very low with an insignificant effect on mating success.

AB When feeding on non-swarming waterflea prey, sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, selected larger items. However, when feeding on swarming prey, the fish fed mainly at the edges of the swarms and smaller items were consumed. This selection of small prey items can be explained by the fact that when attacked by a stickleback the waterfleas escaped towards the center of the swarm, larger individuals more quickly than smaller ones, thus leaving the stickleback with smaller than average prey at  the edge of the swarm.

TI QUEEN SELECTION BY WORKER GROUPS OF THE ANT MYRMICA-RUBRA L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Normal queens in a colony of Myrmica rubra L. were not necessarily more attractive to the workers than strange ones grafted into the colony. Workers chose the best queens using those they already had as a standard. After winter dormancy, workers in colonies with queens were less tolerant for queen variety. One week at 20.degree. C was enough to cause them to reject still-dormant queens, even those of their own colony, though they accepted alien queens. However, after 2-3 weeks culture queens were  acceptable only if they belonged to the same colony as the natural ones or to the same colony as those queens that had been artificially implanted. To re-open the group, it was essential to remove all the resident queens; then after 2 days the workers took any queen offered, rather than remain queenless, but when offered a choice between one of their originals and an unfamiliar one, they still took the former. Three queenless weeks were required before they lost their preference for an  ex-nestmate. Queens from a single colony, isolated in separate groups of workers, remained acceptable to the workers with them indefinitely, but when these queens were transferred to identical collateral groups of workers, they were rejected even after only 2 weeks'' separation. Some groups of workers were less tolerant than others and some queens were more attractive than others, but their compatibility diminished with time if they lived in isolation. A group with an attractive queen was more likely to resistant other queens.

TI THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PLUMAGE VARIABILITY IN WINTERING TURNSTONE
   ARENARIA-INTERPRES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Wintering turnstone, Arenaria interpres, have individually variable plumage. This paper examines the possibility that individual differences in plumage signal differences in dominance status (status signalling hypothesis) and/or allow individuals to be recognized by conspecifics (individual recognition hypothesis). The status signalling hypothesis was rejected on the basis of several lines of evidence: (1) differences in status between males and females, and between adults and juveniles, were not reflected by significant differences in plumage charcteristics; (2) features of the plumage of adults remain the same from year to year yet the status of the adults probably changes; (3) in two flocks of wild turnstones dominance rank orders were not correlated with rank orders predicted by individual differences in three plumage variables. The individual recognition hypothesis was supported by tests showing that when the plumage of captive turnstone was experimentally altered, flock mates acted more aggressively towards them, irrespective of the form of the alteration.

TI RECONCILIATION FOLLOWING AGGRESSION IN PATAS MONKEYS, ERYTHROCEBUS-PATAS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB Following intra-group aggression, obvious conciliatory displays are absent from the behavioural repertoire of patas monkeys, Erythrocebus patas, while many other Old World primate species show special reconcilation gestures. When 10-min focal-animal samples that began after spontaneous aggression were compared with matched-control samples, captive adult female patas followed up on aggressive interactions, interacting sooner and more often with former opponents during post-conflict observations than during matched-control observations. Almost one-third of post-conflict observations included affiliative behaviour between former opponents, which is termed reconciliation. Matrilineally related opponents were more likely to reconcile with one another than were unrelated animals. No effect of the dominance hierarchy on tendency to reconcile was found. Thus, patas monkeys showed general patterns in post-conflict behaviour that were similar to those seen in other primates previously investigated.

TI BEHAVIOR AND SEASONAL-VARIATION IN HEART-RATE IN DOMESTIC SHEEP,
   OVIS-ARIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three major causes of heart rate variation in undisturbed adult ewes were identified: behaviour, season and individual identity. Heart rate was 8 beats/min lower when the ewe was lying than when she was standing. It was increased by ruminating by 2 beats/min above the value for idling, and by a further 6 beats/min when the ewe changed to grazing. It seems that the increases in heart rate when the ewe was standing were simply added to those associated with ruminating or grazing. Heart rate  declined slightly during bouts of unchanged behaviour. It varied seasonally from a minimum in December to a maximum some 50% (46 beats/min) higher in June. This variation was closely linked with daylength, basal metabolic rate, food availability, food consumption and the reproductive cycle, although it also occurred in non-breeding animals. Changes in heart rate associated with daylength may be the secondary result of the effects of daylength on metabolic rate. After taking all these effects into account, there remained variation between five ewes of 16 beats/min.

AB A group of dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, caged during spring and summer on their wintering site of previous years, showed normal spring hyperphagia and fattening, migratory restlessness and post-nuptial moult, but the birds failed to fatten and become normally restless during the ensuing autumn migration season. A second group, treated similarly but not on their individual wintering sites, behaved as the first group except that they did become fat and restless at the appropriate time in autumn. It is probable that perception of the migratory destination suppressed normal autumn behaviour of the birds held at that destination. Experience may therefore play an important role in the regulation of the avian migratory state.

TI ALLOCATION OF INCUBATION FEEDING IN A POLYGYNOUS MATING SYSTEM - A STUDY
   ON PIED FLYCATCHERS FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The way in which male pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca allocated their incubation feeding efforts to their mates was studied. The overall rate of male incubation feeding was negatively correlated with the ambient temperature and positively correlated with the physical condition of the males. Polygynously mated females received significantly fewer feeds than did monogamously mated females. No difference in the food delivery rates to primary and secondary females was found. The pattern of  investment by polygynous males was unrelated to the time-lag between completion of the different clutches and to any difference in clutch size. The reduction in the delivery rate to polygynously mated females had a negative effect on their incubation efficiency, since they spent a greater proportion of the time off the nest and the duration of the incubation period was prolonged compared to that of monogamously mated females. Male feeding behaviour is discussed in relation to the reproductive  value represented by the nests and to the costs and benefits of incubation feeding.

TI QUEEN WORKER CONFLICT AND SOCIAL PARASITISM IN BUMBLE BEES (HYMENOPTERA,
   APIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Psithyrus ashtoni (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is an obligate, workerless bumble bee social parasite which invades nests of Bombus affinis. Although parasites are limited by host worker defence to invading very small colonies, there is considerable flexibility in the way parasites control host broad bionomics once they are accepted inside the nest. A study of 46 parasitized and 22 nonparasitized laboratory colonies of B. affinis showed that P. ashtoni females cohabited with host queens and workers while the worker force increased, but not to the maximum normally achieved in non-parasitized nests. While colony reproductive success was correlated with the number of workers reared, parasites risked being killed or ejected from the comb by workers, after the queen had lost dominance. Host bees usually succeeded in rearing offspring, and Psithyrus reprodutive success was related to the ability of parasites to control proportional investment in the two species. In addition to displacing P. ashtoni females, host bees ate the eggs of parasites and ejected their larvae. These behaviours were also exhibited by workers in the later stages of development of non-parasitized colonies. These results indicate that social parasites are at least pratially subject to the conflict of genetic self-interest between the queen and her workers which is believed to influence the control of reproductive investment in haplodiploid Bombus societies.

TI SONG TUTOR CHOICE IN ZEBRA FINCHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study considers the question of song tutor choice in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Males selectively learned song elements from one tutor when give a choice of two. In zebra finches raised by their mother alone behavioural differences between song tutors appeared to be important in tutor choice: youngsters preferred to learn from the tutor who was most aggresive towards them. Paternal influence was also extremely important and normally raised youngsters selectively learned from tutors with similar songs to their father. This could provide a cue for optimal outbreeding if females were to select mates on the basis of song similarity to their father.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Defence of food cups by males of the fruitflies Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans was examined in the laboratory. Individuals differed in the number of territorial encounters they participated in and the number they won. The outcome of encounters depended on resident status and, to a lesser extent, body weight. Encounters with escalated fighting were less frequently won by resident that non-escalated encounters, and the success of residents in the former could be accounted for by the body weight asymmetry. A display involving erect wings was more common in escalated encounters, but provided no information on body weight or resident status. Escalation in D. simulans depended on the difference in body weight between winners and losers. D. melanogaster had shorter encounters than D. simulans, and a lower incidence of escalated fighting. Fewer D. melanogaster males participated in territorial defence. Territorial males were more successful in mating than non-territorial males.

TI SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION OF THE SPOTTED HYENA CROCUTA-CROCUTA .2. DOMINANCE
   AND REPRODUCTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A 4-year study of the social organization of spotted hyaenas in a clan of 60-80 individuals showed that there is a separate dominance hierarchy within each sex. One female and her descendants dominated all others; matrilineal rankings were stable over time because maternal rank is inherited. Cubs of higher ranking females were able to feed at kills in competition with adults more successfully than other cubs, and male offspring of the alpha female were the only males able to dominate adult females. The mating system is highly polygynous: only the behaviourally dominant male was seen to mate, though all other resident males regularly courted females. Among females, there was no correlation between reproductive success and age, size, or social rank. It is postulated that the unusually aggressive sons of the alpha female would probably be highly successful competitors in the context of a polygynous mating system. A primary consequence of female dominance over males is that females and their young have priority of access to food in a highly competitive feeding situation. This competition may have been the selective force that produced female dominance and the associated syndrome of female virilization that is characteristic of the species. Cooperation among related females may be the basis for the matrilineal system, as has been suggested for certain primate species.

TI DETERMINANTS OF MATING SUCCESS IN THE GOLDEN-HAMSTER
   (MESOCRICETUS-AURATUS) - SOCIAL-DOMINANCE AND MATING TACTICS UNDER
   SEMINATURAL CONDITIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB We tested the hypothesis that high social status leads to high levels of copulatory behaviour and increased number of offspring in hamsters. When paired with albino female golden hamsters, males of three genotypic strains showed differences in the frequency and temporal patterning of some measures of copulatory behaviour but did not differ in general fertilization success. The results of two-male, one-female tests in which mating order and ejaculation frequencies were controlled indicated only relatively small differences in differential fertilizing capacity among these genotypes. Males of the genotypic strains displayed an equal probability of achieving alpha status in three-male, one-female competitive mating tests in which animals were habituated to semi-natural enclosures. Alpha males often slept in the female''s nest box the night before she became receptive, were the first to mate on the following morning, achieved higher scores for all measures of sexual behaviour including ejaculation frequency and subsequently sired more young than did lower ranking males. However, the differential reproductive success of alpha males was not simply a function of higher ejaculation scores since they obtained more than twice as many young per ejaculation as subordinate males. Alpha males continued to copulate with long intromissions after exhausting their supply of ejaculates. Although females mated with several males, mating preferences were evidenced by their flank-gland and vaginal marking patterns on the day before receptivity and in their initial choice of mates during tethered male tests. The behaviour of alpha males is consistent with previous findings regarding the effects of mating order and prolonged copulation on sperm competition and suggests that sperm utilization patterns and mating tactics have coevolved.

In a situation combining a passive outward journey with the elimination of visual and various other exteroceptive cues, the subjects continued to return to their nest site and were not influenced by alterations of the earth''s magnetic field. Experiments in which the animals started their hoarding trips from a changing point of departure, or were transferred to an unfamiliar experimental space, suggest that they orientate by path integration and that they assess the angular, but not the linear component of a passive outward journey.

TI NEST DEFENSE IN THE AMERICAN GOLDFINCH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the American goldfinch (Carduelis tristis), vocalizations during nest defence consist largely of two different types of calls: either ''sweet'' (SWT) or ''bearbee'' (BB). By recording call rates and behaviour during controlled experiments, it was demonstrated that: (1) SWT calls have a rallying function and attract more goldfinches than BB calls; (2) goldfinches attempt to distract potential predators away from their nests; (3) BB calls cause a decrease in nestling conspicuousness, both  audibly and visually; (4) call rates show a positive relationship with increasing conspicuousness of nestlings; (5) call rates of BB and SWT calls vary inversely with danger to the nest; (6) high call rates are given by parents with successful nests whereas low call rates are associated with failures caused by nest predation; (7) call rates show a positive relationship with clutch and brood size; (8) call rates and types did not vary with different potential predators; and (9) call rates and types used by males and females are related to their respective roles in the nesting cycle. Several hypotheses are discussed that might explain changes in call rates through the nesting cycle.

TI WINTER FEEDING STRATEGIES OF INDIVIDUALLY MARKED HERONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The winter feeding behaviour of individually marked herons was studied in an estuarine habitat with adjacent streams in north-east Scotland. Feeding rates in the estuary were highest around low tide, and no feeding took place 3 h before and after low tide. Feeding rates at streams were significantly lower than in the estuary, but were constant throughout the day. Individual herons fed consistently with one of the following strategies: (1) feeding in a stream only: (2) feeding in the estuary only; or (3) switching between stream and estuary. The feeding rate was measured as a basis for a comparison of the benefits of alternative feeding strategies. A comparison between the three feeding strategies showed that herons that switched between estuary and streams achieved a significantly higher food intake than birds that used a stream site only. The timing of arrival on the estuary and departure from the estuary to the streams was consistent with an energy maximization hypothesis. In  mid-winter, switchers, were significantly heavier than non-switchers.

The pika acoustic repertoire more closely resembles in size and form the repertoires of many rodent species rather than those of other lagomorphs. The evolution of an elaborate acoustic repertoire has been influenced both by the pikas'' atypical social organization and the visually disruptive environment in which they live.

TI FLIGHT SPEEDS OF CENTRAL PLACE FORAGERS - FEMALE LAPLAND LONGSPURS
   FEEDING NESTLINGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB According to a recent model (Norberg 1981), birds feeding nestlings should fly faster than Vmr, the speed which minimizes the cost of transport over the ground. The flight speeds of female Lapland longspurs (C. lapponicus) feeding nestlings were not significantly different from the predicted Vmr under various wind conditions. They were, however, significantly higher than the speed that minimizes the rate of energy expenditure (i.e. minimum power speed, Vmp) and significantly lower than  the optimal speed (Vopt) predicted from Norberg''s model. Thus, maximizing the distance traveled per unit energy expenditure appears to be the most important energetic factor affecting their flight speeds. There may be no benefit to increasing above Vmr when brood size is smaller than the maximum number that parents can successfully nourish, or when travel time makes up a small proportion of the total foraging time.

DT Article
AB The characterization and frequency of occurrence of ultrasonic vocalizations produced by female rats (R. norvegicus) during copulation were investigated. By devocalizing 1 member of a male-female pair, it was demonstrated that female rats produce complex, brief 40-70-kHz vocalizations during copulation. These calls shared common structural characteristics with those produced by males and occurred with similar frequency. The female-produced vocalizations were controlled by a hormone-sensitive mechanism; ovariectomized females exhibited few, if any, vocalizations without exposure to ovarian hormones. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to previous results and to the role of these vocalizations in rodent communication.

TI GULLS AND PLOVERS - HOST VIGILANCE, KLEPTOPARASITE SUCCESS AND A MODEL
   OF KLEPTOPARASITE DETECTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Much interest has focused on the conflict between feeding and vigilance. However, because predator attacks are rarely observed, the adaptive value of time spent vigilant (or non-vigilant through feeding) is difficult to ascertain. On the assumption that the tactics used by plovers (lapwings, Vanellus vanellus and golden plover, Pluvialis apricaria) to avoid attack by kleptoparasitic black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus) and predators are similar, we develop a model predicting the  probability of a gull being detected over any distance. The assumptions of the model are that (a) plovers are attacked while non-vigilant (crouching and handling prey) and (b) attacts lasting longer than the target plover''s non-vigilant period will be detected. Over many distances there was a fairly close match between the observed and expected risk of the gull being detected. The match was better when the model assumed gulls waited 1 s prior to attacking plovers with large profitable worms. The risks of kleptoparasitism and predation are compared and the adaptive value of the close match between observed and expected curves is discussed.

TI PAIR FORMATION IN THE MONGOLIAN GERBIL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The initial phase of social organization in Mongolian gerbils, M. unguiculatus, in large outdoor enclosures is described. These conditions offer a comparatively free choice for the establishment of bonds and social structure. In 5 replicate 20-day studies, the only social unit that formed was the male-female pair. The order of events was related to 4 sequential 5-day periods: males established territories by male-male competition (1st-2nd period); females visited more than 1 male initially  (1st and 2nd period), but developed a preference for 1 male or territory (3rd to 4th period); as the females developed a preference, they also challenged other females having a preference for the same male or territory (approximately the 3rd period); as 1 female became locally dominant, some territorial males started chasing all but the dominant female. Males remained more active in territorial defense throughout the study. The defense became more intense as the females became strongly attached to 1 male and/or territory only. Females, after having established themselves in 1 particular male territory, spent significantly less time in the preferred area during the day of estrus compared with the days before and after. Copulatory behavior patterns did not occur exclusively in interactions between territorial mates.

TI POLYGYNY AND NEST SITE SELECTION IN THE PIED FLYCATCHER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Nest site choice, and its influence on mating and breeding success, were studied in a population of individually marked pied flycatchers (F. hypoleuca) for 7 yr. Some nest boxes were used more frequently than expected from random choice of nest site. Flycatchers bred more successfully in such attractive boxes, irrespective of whether the brood was attended by the male or not. Arriving males and females settled at boxes in descending order of attractiveness. Boxes accepted by females were more attractive than alternative boxes advertised simultaneously by males. Secondary nest boxes of polygynous males tended to be more attractive than boxes at which monogamous males displayed, without success, for secondary males. Returning males with local breeding experience started to sing at nest boxes earlier in spring than first season males, settled at more attractive boxes, and mated polygynously more often. Male mating success should be closely dependent on the male''s ability to monopolize attractive nest sites.

AB A genetically-isolated herd of 14 Camargue horses left unmanaged for 6 yr produced 58 living foals and developed a social system similar to that of wild horses. Paternity of the foals was determined by blood-typing. Inbreeding coefficients were calculated and were lower than expected on the hypothesis that mating was random with respect to relatedness. The horses showed reduced levels of sexual behavior with members of their entourage as juveniles, mother, herd stallion and maternal siblings.

TI PROCESSING OF SUN-AZIMUTH INFORMATION BY HONEY BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The dance language of honey bees (A. mellifera) indicates accurately the distance and direction of a food source. When the direction of a food source is moved, the dances of returning foragers indicate the former location rather than the new direction just visited. After subsequent trips the dancers slowly accommodate to the change, and full compensation is achieved only after about 40 min. These and other results suggest that a running-average processing system may be at work in honey bee navigation.

TI VIGILANCE AND SCANNING PATTERNS IN BIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A new approach to the analysis of scanning patterns in feeding birds, was presented. The probability of a bird detecting a predator from the frequency distribution of inter-scan intervals and the proportion of time spent scanning were estimated. This method avoided several unrealistic assumptions implied in earlier analyses of vigilance data and accommodated predators attacking randomly or using prey behavior to time an attack. The practical application of this approach is illustrated using data for feeding and vigilance in the ostrich (Struthio camelus). The analysis was discussed with reference to the hunting tactics of predators and Pulliam''s model of feeding and vigilance in birds.

TI BROOD REDUCTION AND BROOD DIVISION IN COOTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The probability of starvation of chicks increases through hatching order in broods of the coot, F. atra. After hatching chicks accompany and are fed by parents as they swim around the territory. The time that chicks are able to spend outside the nest increases rapidly with age, so that the earlier hatching chicks gain a feeding advantage over the later. Starvation of chicks occurs within 4-5 days of hatching. Even after this initial mortality large differences persist in the parental feeding  rates of individual chicks within a brood. These do not correlate with age and do not seem to be the result of sibling competition. Instead, the parents regulate which chicks accompany them on foraging trips and thus actively maintain feeding differences within the brood. Chicks cannot counter this parental regulation and the least fed of the brood grow more slowly in spite of an increased self-feeding effort. The possible functions of this parental behavior are discussed.

   THE GREGARIOUS PARASITOID, TRICHOGRAMMA-CHILONIS (HYMENOPTERA,
   TRICHOGRAMMATIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of sex-controlling behavior at oviposition in generating primary sex ratios and the effect of larval competition on secondary sex ratios were studied in the gregarious endoparasitoid, T. chilonis. The production of a fertilized (female) egg is indicated by the incorporation of a pause in abdominal movements during oviposition; the absence of it indicates the production of an unfertilized (male) egg. During each ovipositional bout, the 1st male egg is deposited at the 2nd oviposition  and thereafter at intervals of about 8 eggs. This simple pattern enables the wasps to adjust their progeny sex ratios under local male competition to a wide range of host size. Inexperienced wasps do not distinguish between parasitized and healthy hosts. Immature mortality is not significantly different between the sexes when a host is attacked by a single wasp; females suffer higher immature mortality than males when superparasitism occurs.

AB The takeover of a pride of lions by a new coalition of adult males synchronizes the reproductive states of the females because the females'' dependent offspring either die or are evicted at the takeover. Using data on the consequences of male takeovers on female reproductive parameters in wild lions, but without allowing for any interaction between females, the reproductive histories of 100 female lions were simulated for the first 2 yr after a male takeover. They were then cast into simulated prides of varying sizes. The simulations produced levels of estrus synchrony similar to those observed in prides of wild lions.

AB The mechanism of worker kin discrimination in the paper wasp, Polistes fuscatus, was investigated using workers reared by unrelated foundresses. Nests containing worker-destined larvae were switched between unrelated foundresses before worker eclosion. Subsequently eclosing workers were isolated for 20 days and then placed together in triplets of 2 sisters and a non-sister. Workers can discriminate sisters from non-sisters without previous exposure as adults to adult kin. Sibling discrimination depends upon cues, presumably odors, that are learned at the natal nest.

AB Three naturally occurring Polistes exclamans nests in Austin, Texas [USa] for 139 h through a succession of 13 queens. Nine of the 13 replacement queens were the oldest individuals on the nest, forming a system of queen replacement that may be described as a gerontocracy. Before becoming queen, replacement queens foraged more and were more aggressive than females who never became queen. This system of old forager supersedure was simliar to that found in other temperature species but contrasted with that reported for tropical species of wasps in which younger females who are not workers occupy the higher ranks just beneath the queen.

TI HOW VERVET MONKEYS PERCEIVE THEIR GRUNTS - FIELD PLAYBACK EXPERIMENTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Free-ranging vervet monkeys grunt to each other in a variety of social situations: when approaching a dominant or subordinate individual, when moving into a new area of their range, or when observing another group. Like other nonhuman primate vocalizations, these grunts have traditionally been interpreted as a single, highly variable call that reflects the arousal state of the signaler. Field playback experiments suggest that what humans initially perceive as 1 grunt the monkeys perceive as at least 4. Each grunt carries a specific meaning that seems to depend more on its acoustic properties than on the context in which it occurs. The vocalizations given by monkeys during social interactions may function in a rudimentary representational manner, as if to designate objects or events in the external world.

Temporary burrows are built and used as a refuge by non-breeding crabs during high tide periods and at night when crabs cease feeding in the intertidal zone. Breeding burrows are constructed and defended by courting males and are the site of mating, oviposition and the incubation of eggs by females. Up to 3 ovigerous females may be accommodated in a single breeding burrow, each female sequestered in a separate terminal chamber. The construction and defense of burrows specialized for breeding may be an adaptive response by males to the preferences females exhibit when selecting a breeding site.

   CONTRASTING REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS IN ADULTHOOD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Young gorilla [Gorilla gorilla] males can be divided into those that leave their natal group to find mates elsewhere and those that remain to inherit leadership and mating rights within it. This study of the relationships between 4 adolescent males and their group leaders in 2 gorilla groups indicates that a close relationship with the leading male in infancy and subsequently in adolescence could predispose a young male to stay in the natal group. Dissimilarities in ontogeny might thus be related to differences in reproductive tactic used in adulthood. Studies of intraspecific variation in reproductive tactics will be incomplete without accompanying investigation into associated variation in the course of social development.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB A series of 4 related experiments on guppy, P. reticulata, juveniles indicates that eye color is related to motivational state. In juveniles of this species 2 distinct eye color states are easily discernible, with a transient intermediate state infrequently seen. These states are dark, light and intermediate. In aggressive interactions involving both dark- and light-eyed fish, dark-eyed fish won 98.6% of the encounters (n = 222 encounters). Eye colors are significantly correlated with bout lengths of certain behaviors (aggressive encounters, swimming, substrate biting); total time spent in certain behaviors (swimming, aggressive encounters); and type and intensity of aggressive encounters. Eye color may be related to motivational state and may serve a signal function.

D. merriami sandbathed and groomed at higher frequencies and over a longer time period than D. microps. Comparison of hair lipids revealed that D. merriami produced more oils. The data support the hypothesis that lipids in the hair are removed by sandbathing and suggest that D. merriami requires more pelage maintenance than D. microps. Three hypotheses about the function of lipids in the pelage of kangaroo rats are discussed.

TI FLOCK FEEDING AND TIME BUDGETS IN THE HOUSE SPARROW (PASSER-DOMESTICUS
   L)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A winter population of house sparrows at a farm fed on barley seed in 2 distinct types of habitat: cattlesheds and open fields. The risk of predation was apparently higher in the fields where birds scanned more frequently than in the cattlesheds and where scanning was negatively influenced by flock size but positively influenced by distance from cover. Individual time budgets were more influenced by flock size than by seed density in the fields but more influenced by seed density than by flock size in the cattlesheds. Higher rates of scanning resulted in greater flock vigilance and longer flight distances in the fields but flight distance was negatively influenced by the density of seeds on which birds were feeding.

TI AN ETHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF OPEN-FIELD BEHAVIOR IN CHICKENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two salient but previously unacknowledged aspects of open-field testing involve contact with a potential predator, due to placement in the open field by a human, and separation from imprinted companions. Open-field behavior in chickens (G. gallus) probably represents a compromise between opposing tendencies to reinstate contact with conspecifics and minimize detection in the face of possible predation. Five experiments were conducted to test various implications of this model. Manipulations designed to enhance the predatory overtones of open-field testing postponed reinstatement behaviors (e.g., distress calling and escape attempts) and prolonged behaviors that serve to minimize detection (e.g., freezing). Unlike the more traditional view of open-field behavior as an index of general emotionality, this model suggests that the principal reason for movement is based on attempts to reinstate social contact. In support of the model, birds tested in the presence of cagemates showed significantly longer durations of freezing than those tested individually. The same was true for birds maintained in social isolation for 2 days prior to testing. The applicability of this approach to conceptualizing the behavior of chickens in the open field is discussed, and the supposed relationship between fear and distress calling is critically evaluated.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB The slave-raiding behavior of H. americanus and L. duloticus is compared. In both species, raids follow scouting by individuals or small groups of slave-makers. Single scouts return to their nest to lead a raiding party. Groups attack host-species nests at once, with or without recruiting additional raiders. Raiders usually guard the entrance to the raided nest, preventing workers from escaping with the brood. L. duloticus raiders kill most adults in raided nests, but H. americanus raiders kill very few such individuals. H. americanus raiders always and L. duloticus raiders usually transport the raided colony''s brood back to their own nest. L. duloticus colonies sometimes emigrate into raided nests.

AB The organization of underwater foraging behavior by mink (M. vison) was examined using multivariate analyses, enabling the role of fish density and the effect of cover in shaping the mink''s hunting effort to be clarified. The effect of the mink''s O2 limitation was more strongly linked to the availability of cover for the prey than to the density of fish provided. Foraging economics accounted for approximately 51% of the variance in behavior pattern while O2 constraints took out a further 23%. Open waters are deemed unsuitable hunting grounds for this predator because mink lack the underwater endurance necessary for effective pursuit of detected prey.

TI EFFECT OF COLONY SIZE ON INDIVIDUAL ALERTNESS OF PRAIRIE DOGS
   (SCIURIDAE, CYNOMYS SPP)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB From 1974-1976, individual alertness of 2 spp. of squirrels (Sciuridae): loosely colonial white-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys leucurus) and densely colonial black-tailed prairie dogs (C. ludovicianus) was examined. By observing single adults for 30 min periods and recording various measures of alertness, the effects on individual alertness of 4 variables, all of which are directly related to ward (subcolony) size and ward density, were investigated. Conclusions were based on data from 188 white-tail observations and 280 black-tail observations. Individual alertness consistently correlated negatively with effective increases in ward size and ward density. Decreased individual alertness is an important benefit of prairie dog coloniality.

TI MODELS OF PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT .3. INTRA-BROOD CONFLICT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A genetic model of parent-offspring conflict is developed for the situation where conflictors cause the parent to redirect resources from contemporaneous siblings to themselves by increased solicitation. There is no restriction on the spread of genes causing such conflict if there is no direct cost associated with it. The effect of imposing on the conflictors a cost of the extra solicitation when the cost is felt by the individual conflictor only and by all members of the brood equally is examined. The evolutionarily stable strategies for the 2 situations allow a greater degree of solicitation when its cost is borne by the whole brood. Multipaternity of broods also increases the degree of conflict.

TI COST OF CHANGING FROM ONE ACTIVITY TO ANOTHER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When there is a cost of changing from one activity to another it affects the temporal organization of behavior. The cost of changing should be allocated by an animal to the cost of the behavior about to be performed. This hypothesis is confirmed for the Barbary dove (Streptopelia risoria) changing between feeding and drinking in an experimental room. The double interruption method is used to determine the position of dominance boundaries in food and water deficit space. Boundary rotation is used to determine how a cost of changing affects motivational state and how the cost is allocated. Results obtained in the room experiments are comparable to results obtained in Skinner boxes in which the double interruption and dominance boundary methods were previously used, supporting their validity.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A radio-tracking study of the foraging behavior of the Jamaican fruit bat (A. jamaiciensis) in a Panamanian forest revealed that searching and feeding flights were timed as if to minimize flying in bright moonlight. On nights 1 wk before and after the new moon, foraging activity was continuous from dark to dawn. On nights 1 wk before and after the full moon radio-tagged individuals interrupted their feeding activity to return to their day roosts for the 1-7 h of the night when the moon was highest, even on nights when the moon was obscured by heavy clouds. Long flights in search of new fruit trees were observed only during the new moon half of the lunar month. Lunar phobia may have both endogenous and exogenous components that evolved to reduce losses to visually oriented predators.

TI FLIGHT BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUAL PASSERINE NOCTURNAL MIGRANTS - TRACKING
   RADAR STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Nocturnal passerine migrants were tracked with a small automatic tracking radar during spring migration in eastern New York [USA]. Climbing, descending and markedly non-linear tracks were selected for analysis because they may reveal relationships not evident in normal straight and level tracks. Climbing individuals ascended at 1-2 vertical m/s by heading into the wind and increasing their ascent angles while air speed tended to remain constant. Within individual tracks, birds flew slower when flying downwind than when flying into the wind and changes in air speed were performed over periods of a few seconds. Some data suggested that this behavior did not occur under overcast skies. Both the direction and speed of the wind force were important in predicting air speed. Multiple regression analysis indicated that faster flying birds were more likely to fly in winds of high speed and at large angles into the wind.

AB In view of previous studies showing that testosterone increases persistence of food searching in chicks, a single factorially-designed experiment using a runway test was carried out to investigate whether a similar phenomenon occurs in male mice. Testosterone, injected into castrated mice, did increase persistence. Intact males resembled more the testosterone-injected than control-injected castrates, and females resembled neither intact males nor either group of castrates. A larger number of training trials affected feeding latencies in a similar way to testosterone. Comparison of 2 strains differing in emotional reactivity (BALB/c and Porton) showed differences consistent with their reactivity levels.

When placed on a polythene sheet approximately 60 cm below a 60 W bulb, L grossui will follow mucus trails, either its own or those of a member of the same species. Individuals follow trails further and more frequently than would be predicted on a random basis. The direction in which the trail is followed is related to the angle at which the trail is approached. L. grossui will not follow the trails of Deroceras reticulatum or Milax budapestiensis but has a high frequency of turning onto the trails of L. flavus with which it is sympatric in domestic sites in Coleraine, Co. Derry [Northern Ireland]. L. grossui will follow a L. flavus trail for only a short distance before it turns off. The feature of trail following in L. flavus are similar to those of L. grossui.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Flycatchers switched between different foraging streategies and selected prey so as to maximize energy intake. Changes in diet were influenced by the absolute abundance of the preferred prey and not by that of alternative prey. Adults could recognize wasps (Vespula) and bees (Bombus) and removed their stings before swallowing them. The differences between adult and nestling diet and factors influencing capture success of prey are described. The flycatchers'' behavior in leaving perches and their choice of a giving-up time was consistent with the view that they were maximizing the number of prey they caught in a given time. Flycatchers often search for and select prey on the basis of maximizing energy intake. Reasons are given for not expecting them always to do so.

AB The threespot damselfish, E. planifrons, defends differently sized territories against individuals of different species. Tests were conducted in the field to determine the mechanism(s) by which this interspecific recognition occurs. It is based largely on visual cues, the most important of which was body form. Both color and movement had different effects for intraspecific and interspecific intruders. Based on these data, it is proposed that different mechanisms underlie the recognition of and territorial defense against the 2 groups. Further, interspecific territoriality need not be an accidental form of intraspecific territoriality nor a transitional phase in the divergence of already established species, but may be a stable system based on the simple need to defend an area against non-related competitors.

TI INTERRUPTED ONGOING BEHAVIOUR IN 2 SPECIES OF VOLE (MICROTUS AGRESTIS
   AND CLETHRIONOMYS BRITANNICUS) .I. RESPONSE AS A FUNCTION OF PRECEDING
   ACTIVITY AND CONTEXT OF AN APPARENTLY IRRELEVANT MOTOR PATTERN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Microtus agrestis and Clethrionomys britannicus were maintained under different home pen conditions and tested in a large alley. Ongoing behavioral sequences were continuously recorded and interrupted at set intervals by an overhead moving object. Two main problems were examined. First, does an animal''s response to the experimental stimulus vary as a consequence of different ongoing behavior? Secondly can systematic increases as well as decreases in a seemingly irrelevant (i. e. ''displacement'') behavior be observed? Consequences of the differences in temperament between the 2 species, of the different home pen conditions, and of different intensities of the experimental disturbance were also explored. When locomotor activity preceded the stimulus presentation, fleeing rather than just freezing was most likely to occur. The role of an underlying activity tendency which need not be expressed in overt locomotion was suggested by the fact that the more docile Microtus was generally more active in the experimental alley, and also fed more than Clethrionomys even when the 2 species were matched for behaviors preceding the stimulus. This hypothesis was supported by the subsequent finding that locomotor behavior which had ceased several seconds before the stimulus presentation also increased flight probability. Home pen cover plus trial number influenced flight probability and appeared to combine in their effect with one another and with ongoing locomotion. Other ongoing activities such as grooming appeared on occasion to be momentarily accelerated by the stimulus presentation, but were soon suppressed. Microtus groomed more after the stimulus presentation than during control trials. Clethrionomys groomed less. Microtus also groomed more and Clethrionomys less following a high intensity compared with a low intensity disturbance. The animals were most likely to groom when optimally aroused. A temporal analysis of grooming supported the basic model. A single unitary process, however, could not be assumed. The disinhibition hypothesis was partly supported by the data for grooming, but possible limitations were noted. The relevance of these findings to problems of behavioral integration, and most particularly to the issue of specific versus general motivational systems, is discussed.

AB Effects of varying decrements of socialization of the dog with its own species were studied in 3 groups from 12 wk. of age: hand reared from 3 days of age (II), weaned early at 3 1/2 wk. (CI) and weaned at 8 wk. (CCI). Marked deficits in intraspecies social reactions in II''s, while CI''s tended to be intermediate, but all groups were attracted to man. A battery of tests showed both qualitative and quantitative differences between the 3 treatment groups, indicating the importance of early social experience on subsequent development of behavior and social relationships.

TI FUNCTION OF ECHONAVIGATION AMONG SWIFTLETS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sensitivity of the echo-navigating system of 17 Javan edible-neat swiftlets, Collocalia f. fuciphaga, was tested by their ability to detect a barrier of vertical wooden bars, 1 cm square in cross-section, raised under cover of darkness in a test chamber in which the birds were already flying. Observations indicated that, although able in total darkness to detect and avoid collision with the walls and ceiling of the flight chamber itself, the birds had difficulty in detecting the barrier. One glossy swiftlet, Collocalia esculenta was also detected and in darkness was apparently unable to detect or avoid collision with the walls of the flight chamber. The echonavigating species of swiftlets do not detect their insect prey by echolocation, but obtain selective advantage from the exploitation of cave interiors as nesting and roosting sites, and also from their ability to fly freely in darkness outside the cave.

AB Four populations of planaria, P. gracilis, were observed under heterogeneous and homogeneous light conditions. Aggregations were formed in the area of reduced illumination under heterogeneous light conditions. A dark condition resulted in the rapid formation of aggregations and within 24 hr equally large aggregations were also evident under dim and bright levels of illumination. An explanation in terms of photokinesis was rejected; the results were not inconsistent with a chemotactic hypothesis.

AB The relationship between accessability of feed, inter-member peak frequencies and disruptions occurring in the pecking order of 3 stable flocks of cockerels was examined. In all flocks inter-member peck frequencies increased as accessability to feed became restricted. In 2 of the flocks the order remained linear upon the introduction of feed until the limiting condition, a point source, was reached. At that point in all flocks dramatic, but temporary, disruptions occurred. The relationship between induced high density and accessability of feed is also discussed and further research is indicated.

TI INTERSTRAIN FIGHTING IN MALE MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Interstrato fighting between males of the ST/J (albino) and the CBA/J (black-agouti) strains was studied under 3 different sets of conditions: contests terminated after first victory using males isolated since weaning; 30 min.contests with males isolated since weaning; contests terminated after first victory using socially experienced mice. It was found that: under all 3 sets of conditions, the CBA males achieved fighting superiority; the CBA superiority to fighting was not evident to the first contests but developed rapidly thereafter; when the contests are conducted for a 30 min. period, rather than until first submission, the conditioning of the ST males to defeat occurs more rapidly; social experience before fighting has different effects on the 2 types of males. It drastically reduces all aspects of aggressiveness of the ST males. Its only effects on the CBA males is to increase their attack latency and to extend the number of contests required to achieve their superiority in fighting. The dependency of fighting ability upon the situation to which the behavior is elicited is discussed.

TI BEHAVIOUR OF AUSTRALIAN PTEROPODIDAE (MEGACHIROPTERA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pteropus poliocephalus and P. gouldi form 2 types of camps, summer camps occupied from September to April or June, and winter camps occupied from April or June to September. The young are born in October, and during this and the following month the sexes are segregated within the camps. The newborn are essentially heterothermic, and for the 1st 3 weeks are dependent on the female to maintain their body temperature within the normal adult range. At 3 weeks,although they cannot fly, they are left in the camps at night while the females fly out to feed. The females recognize their own young by smell, and occasionally by sound. By 3 months the young can fly and leave the camps to feed. They are mature by 18 months. The selection of a mate is made during December and January when the adult population within the camps is maximal. The territories are marked by the males with their scapular glands, which are maximally developed at this time, and are defended by both males and females. The camp becomes organized into recognizable groups: guard groups on the edge, and monogamous groups, polygamous groups, and juvenile packs in the centre of the camp. The members of each group apparently recognize each other by smell. After conception in late March the sexes segregate within the camp, and during April leave the camp in small groups to disperse throughout the range of the species. The juvenile packs move to winter camps in which the young from a number of summer camps mix, and in which the young extend their social bonds and learn the conventions of their society. The importance of grooming and olfaction is discussed. Suggestions are made on the benefits of the social organizations. P. scapulatus forms summer camps which are occupied for shorter periods than those of P. poliocephalus and P. goudi. In these, the selection of a mate, territoriality and conception occur. The young in contrast to the other species are not born in the large camps, but presumably in small groups when the species is dispersed throughout its range.

AB The effect of the social environment on the proinflammatory immune response may mediate the relationship between social environment and fitness but remains understudied outside captive animals and human populations. Age can also influence both immune function and social behaviour, and hence may modulate their relationships. This study investigates the role of social interactions in driving the concentrations of two urinary markers of proinflammatory immune activation, neopterin and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), in a free-ranging population of rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta. We collected 854 urine samples from 172 adult monkeys and quantified how urinary suPAR and neopterin concentrations were related to affiliative behaviour and agonistic behaviour received over 60 days. In females, but not in males, higher rates of affiliative interactions were associated with lower neopterin concentrations, while conversely, experiencing more agonistic interactions was associated with higher neopterin concentrations. The association between affiliation and neopterin concentration was modulated by age, with older females experiencing a stronger negative association between affiliative behaviour and neopterin concentration. There were no associations between suPAR concentration and social environment for either sex. This study demonstrates that proinflammatory immune activity is a potential mechanism mediating the association between social environment and fitness under naturalistic conditions and that age can be an important modulator of the effect of social environment on the immune system.

AB The emotional reactivity hypothesis predicts that reduced fear and aggression in domesticated animals improves their social cognitive abilities towards humans. However, no studies in dogs, Canis familiaris, have shown that individual temperament is associated with higher social cognitive abilities, such as response to human pointing. In this study, we first trained dogs to learn correct responses in a twochoice task using a compound stimulus consisting of social (human pointing) and nonsocial stimuli (printed figures on paper) as cues. Social and nonsocial stimuli were presented alone to examine whether the social stimulus overshadowed the nonsocial stimulus. We also examined the correlation between temperament scores (based on the Canine Behavioral Assessment & Research Questionnaire, C-BARQ) and task performance. The results showed that social stimuli overshadowed nonsocial stimuli in most dogs, indicating that dogs used social stimuli from humans more frequently than nonsocial stimuli. Strong positive correlations were observed between attachment scores from the C-BARQ and correct response rates to nonsocial stimuli, but there was no correlation between aggression/fear and correct response rates to social stimuli. We considered that positive correlations between attachment scores and correct response rates to nonsocial stimuli indicate the degree of individual attentiveness to various environmental stimuli, and that responses to human pointing are likely to be reinforced from an early age. In addition, individual fear and aggression and social cognitive abilities can vary separately. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

AB Behavioural consistency and plasticity can both benefit fitness. Repeatability in behaviour within a specific context, termed temperament or trait-like behavioural responses, fosters adaptive responses to stimuli. Behavioural plasticity, on the other hand, enables state-like responses, aligning behaviour with internal and external conditions. The nutritional state of an organism significantly impacts behaviours and may interact with temperament. However, the specific contributions of trait- and state-like responses to stimuli remain poorly understood. Using a long-term data set on mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus, elk, Cervus canadensis, and bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, we assessed the interplay of temperament and nutritional state in behavioural responses during handling. We measured the repeatability of kick rates across multiple capture events over time, investigating its association with temperament, nutritional condition, age and capture frequency. Bighorn sheep and mule deer exhibited high repeatability in kicks during capture, while elk did not. State-dependent factors, such as body fat, minimally influenced kick rates during capture. In bighorn sheep and mule deer, trait-like responses were likely related to temperament, whereas elk demonstrated neither state- nor trait-like behavioural responses. Trait-like responses in these species may reflect adaptations to specific ecological niches and site-specific evolutionary pressures. Our findings advance our understanding of these mechanisms, shedding light on the complex interplay between temperament, nutritional state and behaviour. Nevertheless, our results highlight the need for caution when predicting or extrapolating behavioural responses to stressors across closely related species. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Natural visual stimuli are typically complex. This presents animals with the challenge of learning the most informative aspects of these stimuli while not being confused by variable elements. How animals might do this remains unclear. In this study, we tested bumble bees' ability to learn multicomponent visual stimuli composed of a simple constant bar element and a grating element that was consistent in orientation but varied in width, number of gratings and position. Bees rapidly and successfully learnt these compound stimuli. Tests revealed learning of the consistent single bar was more robust than learning of the grating element. This study highlights how even small-brained invertebrates can rapidly learn multicomponent stimuli and prioritize the most consistent elements within them. We discuss how the learning phenomena of generalization and overshadowing may be sufficient to explain these findings, and caution that complex cognitive concepts are not necessary to explain the learning of complex stimuli.

AB Climate change is characterized by extreme climatic events and unpredictable environmental conditions, increasing the probability of condition mismatch during the lives of animals. Mismatched conditions between development and adulthood can negatively affect traits, especially those subjected to developmental programming. Thus, an environmental mismatch between song acquisition during development and song production during adulthood could affect the song quality and reproductive success of birds. In this study, the effects of temperature variability and condition mismatch on song learning and production in captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia castanotis, were investigated. Males developed in either stable or variable temperatures, and then experienced a mismatch in thermal conditions at independence. Their crystallized song was recorded at adulthood, and their song learning and quality traits were evaluated. Condition mismatch affected only song traits acquired during development, with a decrease in the proportion of syllables copied from the tutor and a trend towards decreasing repertoire size. The syllable learning accuracy also tended to be lower for birds experiencing variable temperatures. Other song learning and quality traits were unaffected by temperature variability or condition mismatch. Collectively, our results indicate that climate change can negatively affect song learning and quality in songbirds. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Human presence and urbanization alter many species' vulnerability and perceived risk, but little research has investigated how anthropogenic impacts affect behaviour in dynamic defensive mutualisms. As human activities continue to expand in marine communities, it is important to understand how they may affect risk assessment in behaviourally dependent symbionts. Shrimpgobies (Ctenogobiops spp.) and snapping shrimp (Alpheus spp.) in Mo'orea, French Polynesia participate in an obligate, symbiotic relationship in areas where humans recreate. We quantified hiding time, flight initiation distance and time allocated to different behaviours to first describe this defensive mutualism, then determined whether human activity directly impacted it. We found that goby behaviour significantly explained variation in shrimp behaviour. Specifically, shrimp varied in how long they remained in their burrow, how long they remained in their burrow after their goby partner(s) emerged, the rate at which they excavated their burrows and the time spent outside their burrows as a function of goby behaviour. Our findings suggest this dynamic mutualism was selectively affected by humans. Human activity, measured by both presence and abundance, explained some variation in multiple goby behaviours that directly influence variation in shrimp behaviour. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB While wildlife tourism may impact the animals it targets, it plays a critical role in public education and conservation awareness. Understanding changes in animal behaviour in response to tourism activities can inform the trade-offs between negative impacts and socioeconomic benefits. There are public claims that cage-diving activities may condition white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, to interact with boats, and may potentially increasing risk of shark bites. We tracked the fine-scale movements of 73 white sharks in relation to cage-diving boats using acoustic telemetry between 2018 and 2022 at Neptune Islands, Australia, to investigate associative behaviour and factors potentially influencing residency and time spent in proximity to the cage-diving boats. White sharks spent gradually less time near cage-diving boats throughout their residency at the tourism site. This behaviour was consistent across individuals, years, sexes and sizes. Sharks, however, resumed their natural behaviours (i.e. initial amount of time near the cage-diving boats) each time they returned to Neptune Islands, suggesting that the observed habituation (i.e. loss of response to the stimulus used to attract sharks) did not last for long periods. These trends support the lack of long-term learnt behaviour of white sharks increasingly interacting with boats. Our results indicate that current management strategies such as regulating the number of days the industry can operate at the site and the amount of food-based attractant used, and reducing the amount of bait consumed can limit associative behaviour between white sharks and boats, while enabling continued opportunities for white shark tourism. Understanding how wildlife associate with humans can help ensure that best practices are in place for both the targeted animals and the people involved, particularly in the case of threatened and potentially dangerous species.

AB Aggressive interactions can strongly influence an animal's performance in subsequent contests. Winners of aggressive contests are more likely to win successive contests and losers are more likely to lose successive contests. Such winner and loser effects can significantly influence an animal's dominance status, ability to acquire resources and reproductive success. Thus, quantifying the magnitudes of winner and loser effects across taxa is important for our understanding of hierarchy formation, life history tradeoffs and reproductive tactics in different species. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the magnitude of winner effects differ from that of loser effects. Finally, experimenters often employ one of two distinct methods for quantifying the strength of winner and loser effects: self-selection and random assignment. Due to selection bias, it is possible that self-selection protocols overestimate the magnitude of winner and loser effects. We therefore systematically searched the literature to conduct a comprehensive metaanalysis of winner and loser effects. We analysed a total of 168 effect sizes from arachnids, crustaceans, fishes, insects, mammals and reptiles. We found that prior winners tend to win approximately two-thirds of their subsequent fights, while prior losers tend to lose approximately two-thirds of their subsequent fights. While we did not find that studies using self-selection generated effect size estimates that significantly differed from random assignment protocols, future studies should still avoid self-selection protocols. Overall, our study highlights the ubiquity of winner and loser effects across the animal kingdom and suggests several avenues for future research to unravel the evolutionary origins and mechanistic underpinnings of such experience effects.

AB The role of plumage ornamentation as a signal of parasite infection is a key issue in the evolution of animal behaviour. Despite the undeniable role of host-parasite interactions in sexual selection, it is still unclear how parasites influence the variance in the expression of females displaying multiple ornaments. Here, by taking advantage of a long-term and individual-based, monitored population of pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, in a Mediterranean area, we investigated the variation in the expression of wing patch (size) and forehead patch (occurrence and size) in relation to infections with haemosporidian parasites in breeding adult females. Haemosporidian infection was related to wing patch size, and this association varied in direction and magnitude depending on the origin of birds (locally born versus immigrant) and the type of breeding habitat (oakwood versus pine plantation). Specifically, differences in wing patch size were most evident among immigrant females breeding in the pine plantation, with noninfected females expressing larger wing patches than infected ones. Regarding the forehead patch, its occurrence was also modulated by haemosporidian infection through two-way interactions with bird origin (lower occurrence in locally born females) and breeding habitat type (lower occurrence among infected than uninfected females in the oakwood, whereas the opposite was true in the pine plantation). Only bird age predicted forehead patch size. Therefore, in addition to haemosporidian infection, the expression of these ornaments was related to extrinsic (breeding habitat) and intrinsic (age, origin) factors, which suggests the existence of trade-offs between physiological responses to infection and the expression of secondary sexual traits. Overall, our results suggest that plumage ornaments provide independent and reliable information on the haemosporidian infection status of female pied flycatchers. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB We present a high-resolution, densely sampled data set of wild bird songs collected over multiple years from a single population of great tits, Parus major, in the U.K. The data set includes over 1100 000 individual acoustic units from 109 963 richly annotated songs, sung by more than 400 individual birds, and provides unprecedented detail on the vocal behaviour of wild birds. Here, we describe the data collection and processing procedures and provide a summary of the data. We also discuss potential research questions that can be addressed using this data set, including behavioural repeatability and stability, links between vocal performance and reproductive success, the timing of song production, syntactic organization of song production and song learning in the wild. We have made the data set and associated software tools publicly available with the aim that other researchers can benefit from this resource and use it to further our understanding of bird vocal behaviour in the wild.

AB In group -living animals, between -group relations are often revealed during intergroup encounters, which may be intolerant (competitive), affiliative (cooperative) or neutral. We investigated factors that predict different encounter types in blue monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni , where intolerant encounters predominate but neutral encounters also occur. Using data from nine groups monitored over 24 months in equatorial forest, we first examined whether availability of fruit, a preferred and important food, predicted encounter rates. Fruit availability related positively only to the rate of intolerant encounters, suggesting that energetic costs of aggression and attractiveness of large fruiting trees influence contest rates. We then examined how fruit availability and time of day influenced the odds of intolerant versus neutral encounters, finding no evidence for an effect. We examined additional social factors for a subset of encounters between groups with well-known histories. The odds of intolerant versus neutral encounters declined when group sizes were more disparate and when groups had split from each other longer ago. We found no evidence that the odds of intolerant intergroup encounters were related to the proportion of females with infants or the encounter's location on edge -centre axes for both groups. Finally, we examined how ecological and social factors predicted group behaviour (aggressive, fleeing, neutral) during encounters. Encounter location, group size, group size differential and the time since two interacting groups split from each other all influenced group behaviour. Unexpectedly, aggressive behaviour was less likely at the start and end of the day. There was no evidence for an effect of fruit availability. Overall, while some evidence implicated ecological factors affecting rates of intolerant encounters, social factors seemed more important in predicting intolerant versus neutral encounters and aggressive or fleeing versus neutral group behaviour. More detailed measures of contested resources may improve evaluation of ecological effects on types of intergroup encounters. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Optimal cache spacing theory predicts that scatter-hoarding animals cache seeds at a density that balances the gains of reducing cache pilferage with the costs of transporting seeds over larger distances. Animals cannot indefinitely reduce the density of cached seeds and should distribute seeds within a convenient range. The hypothesis is that scatter-hoarding animals can optimize cache size and distribution to reduce cache pilferage without increasing transport effort. In this study, we used artificial caches of Chinese Armand pine seeds to investigate whether cache distribution patterns and cache sizes could impact cache loss in a pine plantation in southwest China. Artificially created caches of three different sizes (one, two and four seeds) and two distribution patterns (uniform and random) were laid out and their pilferage was assessed. Cache distribution and size had an interactive effect on the survival time of caches. The cache and seed survival times for randomly distributed one- and four-seed caches were found to be longer than those for uniformly distributed caches, whereas for the two-seed caches, we detected no significant difference in cache and seed survival time between uniform and random distribution caches. Although larger randomly distributed caches were more likely to be discovered, the seeds in these caches may survive longer. In contrast, for caches with a uniform distribution, two-seed caches and their seeds were less likely to be discovered than one- and four-seed caches. Our findings in this study indicate that cache size and distribution pattern significantly affected the probability of caches and seeds being discovered. We propose that by optimizing cache size and distribution, scatterhoarding animals can reduce the likelihood of cache pilferage. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In conditions of poor visibility, animals can determine their location using sounds. If there are sound sources with a relatively fixed location in their environment, these might be used as landmarks with respect to which the individual could locate new sound sources. However, unlike visual orientation, surprisingly little is known about the use of acoustic landmarks. We studied the use of calling neighbours for orientation in the corncrake, Crex crex, a highly territorial species that calls in long sequences in loose and stable groups at night and in tall grass. In two experiments with remote multichannel playback, we mimicked artificial interactive networks. In the first experiment, we tested whether the number of neighbours affects the accuracy of locating an intruder and we showed that males are more efficient at locating new intruders when there are more vocally active neighbours in their vicinity. In the second experiment, we tested the influence of the amplitude of neighbours' calls on the assessment of the distance to the intruder. We showed that the response to an intruder depends on the ratio of the amplitude of the intruder's calls to the amplitude of the neighbours' calls. Our results therefore indicate that corncrakes orient themselves in the environment using calling neighbours as landmarks and we suggest that the use of the communication network as a network of acoustic landmarks can be an alternative mechanism of orienting using sounds in conditions of limited visibility.

AB The spatial distribution of flowers has important impacts on pollinator movement and foraging decisions. For example, it is well established that bumble bees typically visit larger plants at a higher rate per plant, but the visit rate per flower typically declines as the number of flowers increases. However, much less is known about how honey bee foraging patterns are influenced by plant size and flower number, despite honey bees' importance as agricultural pollinators and their strong competitive impact on other bees. Using a combination of field observations and manipulative experiments with two different wild plant species, we confirmed that honey bees visit larger plants at a higher rate, not only per plant but also per inflorescence. This foraging pattern seems surprising, because it means that there is greater forager density and thus competition for resources on larger plants. We examine three hypotheses to explain why honey bees might nevertheless preferentially visit floral resources on larger plants: (1) larger plants are more salient, making them easier to find and advertise; (2) larger plants offer greater nectar rewards, making visits to them more worthwhile; (3) larger plants have more densely packed flowers, so they are less costly to navigate. We found that honey bee visit rates were indeed influenced by the costs and rewards of their local foraging experience, but the total number of flowers on the plant still positively affected visit rate even when controlling for those local factors. We suggest several ways that the collective foraging strategy of honey bees could lead to an aggregation of foragers on plants with more flowers and discuss the potential implications for agricultural pollination and wild bee conservation as well as foraging theory.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although social group size and stability are key areas of interest for studying the evolution and main-tenance of animal societies, the evolution of group membership control and how that affects the resulting group size have not been fully explored. Here we develop a game-theoretical model that considers how social and ecological factors jointly affect the resolution of conflict over group size be-tween current group members (insiders) and potential joiners (outsiders). Our model predicts that group size will more closely approach the optimum for insiders when the potential conflict between insiders and outsiders is large, as well as when the cost of engaging in social conflict is high. We also show that the joining effort, repelling effort, cost of selfishness and genetic relatedness have interacting effects on conflict resolution between insiders and outsiders and, thus, on expected group size and structure. Our model further predicts that the expected group size will increase as genetic relatedness between insiders and an outsider increases, assuming that the direct fitness cost for insiders to accept an outsider is relatively large or that the benefit to the outsider joining is small. Ultimately, our model synthesizes previous insider-outsider conflict models to generate a framework for understanding the evolution of both group membership control and the size and structure of the resulting social groups.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Endogenous circadian clocks coordinate a variety of temporal behavioural aspects in animals, including the daily foraging timing, which is among the most prominent factors that dictate an animal's daily activity patterns. Learning about consistent spatiotemporal patterns in food availability can be advantageous, as it may increase foraging efficiency. Time-place learning abilities have been demonstrated in teleosts but has yet to be studied in chondrichthyans. Understanding time-place learning in sharks will help us understand how anthropogenic factors, including wildlife tourism, may affect shark behaviour. Here, we investigated the ability of sharks to learn time-place associations in a semicontrolled environment. We fed juvenile lemon sharks at two different locations at two distinct times of day inside 45 m2 enclosures for 41 days, and monitored their learning along with untrained, control individuals. We used time-lapse recordings to assess a shark's position relative to the upcoming feeding location. Based on the mean distance to the feeding location and the time sharks spent within three body lengths of it we concluded that they did not learn the association. Sharks in the treatment pens displayed distribution patterns similar to those of the control sharks throughout the experiment. The position of the sharks inside the pens appeared to be significantly affected by the tidal cycle. We were unable to detect time -place learning within the limited time of the experiment possibly due to the small size and space between the enclosures, and the influence of the tidal cycles. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In group-living species, evolution puts a premium on the ability of individuals to track the state, whereabouts and interactions of others. The value of social information might vary with the degree of competition among individuals, however. We investigated male monitoring of female location in wild Guinea baboons, Papio papio. Guinea baboons live in socially tolerant multilevel societies with one-male units comprising one to six females and young at the core. Using field playback experiments, we first tested whether male Guinea baboons responded more strongly to playbacks of associated versus nonassociated females, which was the case. In the second and core experiment, we tested whether males keep track of the whereabouts of associated females by playing back unit females' calls from locations that were either consistent or inconsistent with the actual position of the female. Contrary to predictions, males responded equally strongly in both conditions. While males seem to recognize unit females by voice, they might lack the attention or motivation to track their movement patterns. These results reinforce the view that the value of social information may vary substantially with the distribution of power in a society. While highly competitive regimes necessitate high attention to deviations from ex-pected patterns, egalitarian societies allow for a certain degree of obliviousness.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Individuals can exhibit strong consistencies in behaviours across time and contexts, referred to as animal personalities. Yet studies linking personality differences measured in captivity to ecologically relevant social behaviours in the wild are sparse and contradictory. Here, we used wild superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus, to investigate whether two personality traits measured in short-term captivity (exploration and aggressiveness) predicted aggressiveness in the wild (measured as territory defence). We first identified behavioural phenotypes within our study population by temporarily capturing adult birds to measure their (1) emergence, activity and sector visits in a novel environment (exploration) and (2) aggression in response to mirror image stimulation (aggressiveness). We later simulated two conspecific intrusions within their territory using playback of vocalizations (female or male chatter song) within their territory, in a pairwise design. Both exploration and breeding status (breeder/dominant versus helper/subordinate) influenced the birds' response to the simulated intrusions. Dominant individuals and individuals with extreme exploration phenotypes (i.e. fast or slow explorers) responded more strongly to playback compared to helpers or those with intermediate exploration phenotypes, respectively. However, aggressiveness measured in short-term captivity (mirror response) did not correlate with our measure of aggressiveness in the wild (playback response during territory defence). The personality matching of breeding pairs (whether their partner had a matching or mismatching exploration phenotype) also influenced playback response, as pairs with mismatching exploration phenotypes responded more strongly to conspecific intruders than pairs with similar phenotypes. Our results support a growing number of studies showing the importance of animal personalities for response strategies and social behaviours.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Recently, biologists have become increasingly interested in cognitive variation among individuals and how it relates to differences in fitness. However, very few studies so far have studied the long-term repeatability and heritability of cognitive performance in wild animals. This is nevertheless crucial in-formation to fully understand the potential ecological and evolutionary impact of individual variation in cognitive performance. In 2019, we assessed exploration, problem solving and spatial and reversal learning in 66 Aegean wall lizards, Podarcis erhardii, then released them in seminatural enclosures consisting of either simple or complex habitat. One year later, we recaptured and retested the surviving lizards and their offspring to estimate the long-term repeatability and heritability of these behavioural and cognitive characteristics. We found that exploration and spatial learning were moderately repeat-able, but reversal learning only marginally and learning flexibility and problem solving not at all. Reversal learning ability declined over time in lizards kept in simple habitat, but not in those kept in complex habitats -suggesting habitat-dependent cognitive plasticity. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating (long-term) consistency in cognitive traits within a nonavian reptile. The combination of modest repeatability and low heritability does suggest that, within our study species, personality and cognitive variation among individuals and populations is mostly moulded by environmental effects.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Multimodal communication signals consist of two or more distinct components produced in different sensory modalities and transduced by receivers using multiple sensory systems. One evolutionary tra-jectory by which incipient multimodal signals may arise is when receivers are selected to attend both to a well-established signal and a cue in a different sensory modality associated with that signal's production. Previous studies of frogs suggest movement of the male's vocal sac, which is inextricably tied to vocal production in most species, functions as the dynamic visual component of a multimodal mate attraction signal that modulates female responses to sexually advertising males. Most of this work, however, has presented multimodal stimuli using video playbacks or artificially illuminated robots in laboratory set-tings, which leaves open the question of whether the vocal sac functions in multimodal signalling under more natural nocturnal illumination. In this study of Cope's grey treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, a nocturnally breeding species, we tested the hypothesis that vocal sacs are a dynamic visual component of a multi -modal mate attraction signal that influences female responses to sexually advertising males. Using ro-botic frogs as stimuli, we performed multimodal playback experiments outdoors under nocturnal illumination. We found no evidence that vocal sacs were attractive to females or that they influenced the responses of females when acoustic information was rendered less certain due to a degraded signal structure or background noise. While these negative results may reflect genuine species differences, they also corroborate a negative result from one of the only previous studies conducted under natural nocturnal illumination to investigate frog vocal sacs as the visual component of a putative multimodal mate attraction signal (Taylor et al., 2007, Animal Behaviour, 74, 1753-1763). We consider possible proximate and ultimate explanations for our results and critically review previous research on multi -modal mate attraction in nocturnal frogs.

AB Bats are highly social animals, and the interactions between individuals are likely to be important to their ecology and conservation. Social structures are affected by the physical environment (spatial factors), as well as varying over time and seasons (temporal factors). Compared with many other taxa, individual bats are capable of moving large distances, so experience a range of spatial locations. They have long life spans, providing opportunities to interact with others over a long period, and are often highly gregarious. Using a long-term data set, we examined the social behaviour, along with spatial and temporal influences, of greater horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, during hibernation using social network approaches. Across 17 years, 2808 individuals were monitored, yielding a total of 5952 records at 21 roost locations. We investigated how individuals' life history traits (sex, age and breeding status of females) and the frequency of observation affected social associations and identified factors that influenced the movement of individuals between locations. Older and male animals were significantly more central in the social network, and adult males may act as a link between socially separate individuals within the society. The social network had high nonrandom dyadic structuring, with assortment by age stronger in females than males, and this was likely to be influenced by spatiotemporal factors. In general, higher weighted betweenness scores were recorded in a noncore hibernaculum, suggesting that these sites, despite low numbers of bats being present, may act as locations to connect less-connected individuals, as well as communities. Finally, movements between hibernacula were only associated with the frequency of observation rather than any life history trait. These results illustrate the interconnectivity across sites, stressing the need for appropriate cross-jurisdiction species management plans to be created for species that utilize and move between multiple sites within the landscape.

AB Seasonal environments challenge animals, increasing the complexity of locating resources. Navigation may rely on 'habitual routes' or 'Euclidean' maps: following established routes or computing novel paths, respectively. Folivores are presumed to rely on evenly distributed resources and thus have a reduced reliance on navigation. We tested whether the navigation strategy of southern bamboo lemurs, Hapalemur meridionalis, a primarily folivorous strepsirrhine that periodically consumes fruit, varies across seasons. We recorded behaviour and location of three social groups during full-day, focal follows during January-December 2013. We analysed the macronutrient components of food items. Bamboo lemurs travelled through habitual routes during periods of food scarcity but relied on nodes (i.e. intersections where directional decisions are made) to navigate throughout the year. Likely, habitual route navigation promoted an energy-saving strategy during lean periods by easing lemur locomotion across the forest. In contrast, lemurs relied on Euclidean navigation during food abundant periods. The continuous use of nodes suggest that nodes may act as cognitive anchors to support efficient directional decisions across seasons. Linearity increased during periods of resource abundance when feeding on energy-rich items and during periods of scarcity to reach latrines. By travelling increasingly linearly towards energy-rich items, lemurs maximized energy intake during periods of food abundance. Overall, bamboo lemurs' combination of both Euclidean and route-based navigational strategies demonstrates a cognitive adaptation for coping with seasonal resource variability in a way that challenges previous research postulating constrained spatial skills in folivorous strepsirrhines.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Reproductive seasonality is the norm in mammals from temperate regions but less common at lower latitudes, where a broad diversity of reproductive phenology strategies is observed. Our knowledge of the evolutionary determinants shaping this diversity remains fragmentary and may reflect high phenotypic plasticity in individual strategies. Here we investigated the ecological determinants and fitness consequences of variation in birth timing across the annual cycle in a social primate endemic to the Congo basin, the mandrill, Mandrillus sphinx, which breeds seasonally. We further examined traits that modulate this variation within and across individuals. We used 9 years of ecological, life history and behavioural data from a natural population to characterize patterns of environmental and reproductive seasonality. We then investigated the consequences of variation in birth timing for pre-and postnatal offspring survival and maternal interbirth intervals. Finally, we studied the influence of within (reproductive history and age) and between-individual (social rank) traits on variation in birth timing. We found that mandrills' daily foraging time varied seasonally, with greater fluctuations for subordinate than dominant females. Birth timing was plastic, as females gave birth year round without detectable consequences for postnatal offspring survival. Giving birth within the birth peak, however, decreased interbirth intervals and probability of miscarriage. Finally, reproductive history and social rank mediated within-and between-individual variation in birth timing, respectively. Specifically, females that experienced a previous reproductive failure gave birth early in the next birthing season and dominant females bred less seasonally than subordinates, which may reflect their more even access to resources across the year. Overall, the selective pressures shaping mandrill reproductive seasonality differed from a classical scenario of seasonal fluctuations in resources limiting offspring survival. A complex interplay between social and ecological factors may thus determine within-and between-individual variation in phenology strategies of tropical and gregarious mammals.

AB Sexual displays can be energetically taxing, power-limited tests of endurance that favour the vigorous. Therefore, these displays may reliably indicate the ability to pay the energetic costs of sustained motor performance. Field cricket calling song involves the repeated mechanical movement of wings to produce pulses of sound grouped into species-specific chirp patterns, often sustained for long periods across nights. We quantified variation and repeatability of cricket calling song phenotypes and determined how age and body size impacted this variation. All our experiments involved tightly controlled signalling environments, but there was a great deal of interindividual variation in behaviour. Although there were species differences, most traits associated with signalling vigour exhibited mean level declines with age and conditional repeatability (individual*age interactions). These results suggest that males differing in quality may differ in their ability to buffer themselves against age-related changes in signalling vigour. Furthermore, the repeatability of calling traits itself changed with age, declining slightly in some species but increasing in others. We also challenged motor performance by altering dietary carbohydrate and protein; we predicted that increased carbohydrate would enhance signalling vigour and increased protein would decrease it. Although diet influenced the probability of calling and time spent calling in a predictable manner, these effects were not profound. Our findings confirm the scope for sexual selection to act on motor performance and point to ways in which constraints and trade-offs may yield variation within and among species in how vigour is signalled.

AB Hamadryas baboons, Papio hamadryas, differ from almost all other primate species in that males separate female kin by aggressively coercing females into joining their one-male units. Male behaviour thus appears to be the sole determinant of social structure, shaping patterns of relatedness. However, recent genetic studies have found that female relatedness within one-male units (OMUs) is higher than across OMUs, contrary to expected results of male behaviour. This has caused some researchers to speculate that female hamadryas baboons have some influence over dispersal. In this study, we used an agent-based model to parse how the hamadryas social system influences OMU female relatedness. We hypothesized that (1) the multilevel social structure in hamadryas baboons leads to greater-than-random relatedness in OMUs and that (2) subtle female preference leads to even higher relatedness, similar to the pattern observed in genetic data. Our agent-based model of hamadryas baboon society and dispersal was based on available field data and ran for 150 years in discrete 6-month intervals. To test hypothesis 2, we implemented manipulations mimicking female kin attraction, which increased females' chances of being transferred into a unit containing closely related females. As output of every simulation, pedigree relatedness of adult female dyads within and across OMUs was calculated. We validated our model by comparing patterns of group size, population size, adult sex ratio and dispersal rates with available field data. The results of our simulations supported both hypotheses. Relatedness within OMUs was slightly higher than across OMUs when females had no influence over dispersal. When we implemented our scenarios of female influence on dispersal, the relatedness within OMUs increased even more, approaching the effect size of genetic data from the field. We conclude that, despite conflicting interests, a combination of male and female behaviour create a complex pattern of gene flow in this unique multilevel social system.

AB Organisms that colonize new habitats may gain fitness advantages from changes in habitat selection including oviposition behaviour. Variation in oviposition site selection may contribute to ecological differentiation in response to novel ecological conditions. Both inherited and environmentally induced or learned differences may contribute to variation in preoviposition search behaviour and oviposition site selection. We addressed this issue with the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria. Over recent decades, this species has expanded its habitat use by colonizing anthropogenic environments with populations that show differences in several phenotypic traits (i.e. ecotypes). Here we tested whether preoviposition search behaviour and oviposition site selection differ between field-derived females from forested and agricultural ecotypes, and whether prior experience would change their behaviour differently. We used F1-offspring reared under common garden laboratory conditions and observed individuals of both ecotypes repeatedly in an indoor experimental arena. The arena offered compartments with host plants under simulated open and woody landscape conditions, as well as control compartments. In contrast with predictions, ecotypic differences in preference were found not for a particular microhabitat, but rather for oviposition site versus control compartment. Nevertheless, exploration and microhabitat use differed between females of agricultural and forest ecotypes. Furthermore, we provide evidence of short-term (i.e. a few hours after initial exposure) learning in the context of preoviposition search behaviour, pointing at the often ignored role of habitat familiarization. Our study sheds new light on behavioural changes that relate to habitat use in novel environments for a species that thrives successfully in landscapes under rapid human-induced environmental change.

AB Extended ground level structures like roads or field edges can be important cues for navigating animals, seen for example in road-following pigeons. In a landscape devoid of skyline cues but with a rectangular grid of pathways and roads, we used harmonic radar to track free-flying bumble bees, Bombus terrestris. Individual bees consistently used ground level linear features for navigation in a wide range of behav-ioural contexts. Bee exploration flights, search behaviour and foraging routes were shaped by linear features, with bees frequently flying along and parallel to pathways and roads. Comparisons of flight trajectories across these behavioural contexts show that individuals modulated their use of linear fea-tures strategically with respect to their individual goals and experience. Bees searching for a feeder used linear features to target their search, while foragers often followed pathways to return to their hive without overshooting. These findings on a major pollinator have important implications for the place -ments of bee colonies for agriculture and floral resources for conservation. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Most research on reciprocal cooperation aims to either investigate the conditions that allow its evolution or to document actual cases of reciprocity, while the study of its proximate mechanisms is often neglected. Here, we report on an experiment aimed at testing one of the proximate mechanisms that have been proposed to underlie reciprocal cooperation. We tested 'calculated reciprocity', according to which animals behave cooperatively towards conspecifics driven by the expectation of a return of the favour. We examined food sharing in pairs of tufted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus spp., tested in three different experimental conditions. In the first condition (Reciprocity), we gave the subject some less preferred food that could be shared with the partner and, in a following phase, we gave the partner some preferred food that could be shared with the subject. In the second condition (Control), we gave the subject some less preferred food that could be shared with the partner, but the partner did not have the opportunity to reciprocate. In the third condition (Rewarded Cooperation), we gave the subject some less preferred food that could be shared with the partner, and then we gave the subject a quantity of preferred food proportional to the amount shared with the partner during the test. There was no difference between the three experimental conditions in the amount of food transferred from the subject to the partner. However, in the Rewarded Cooperation condition, capuchin monkeys increased the amount of food shared over successive test sessions. Although it remains undemonstrated whether the subjects understood the differences between the three experimental conditions, our results suggest that the expectation of reciprocation did not motivate capuchin monkeys to share their food. Capuchin monkeys seemed, however, able to learn that sharing can lead to a reward. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Variance in the quality of food sites exploited by group-living animals should allow dominant individuals to gain feeding advantages. In some cases of eating in large patches, however, the amount of agonism can be puzzlingly low. We studied this problem in wild adult chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, eating ripe fruits in large tree crowns, a context in which little aggression has previously been recorded. Observations were conducted from within the same tree crown as feeding chimpanzees, which allowed us to obtain high-quality data on food distribution, feeding behaviour and aggression. We assessed energy availability and chimpanzee behaviour in relation to their feeding depth. Deeper food sites were associated with less metabolizable food energy (kcal/m3) and lower energy intake rates (kcal/min). Energy availability also varied by tree type (higher in drupe trees than in fig trees) and fruit ripeness (higher in riper fruits). Males were dominant to females, and within both sexes aggressive interactions conformed to a linear hierarchy. Overall higher-ranking individuals used aggression and dominance to access superior feeding sites and achieve higher rates of energy intake, but the effects of dominance varied according to tree type, sex and party composition. Our study shows that covert contest competition over feeding sites gave dominant individuals an important advantage even in very large patches.

DE cleaning interaction; dominance hierarchy; social behaviour; social

AB Social species often show intraspecific variation in the size and composition of their social units, i.e. the social organization. This variation represents a challenge for comparative studies trying to understand evolutionary transitions in social organization complexity. Most studies on intraspecific variation in social organization (IVSO) have focused on the environmental factors selecting for variation in social organization but the mechanisms underlying such variation remain relatively unexplored. Here we investigated the potential mechanisms giving rise to IVSO in the Caribbean cleaning goby Elacatinus prochilos. This small reef fish typically exhibits two types of social organization, pair living or group living, which not only differ in group size but also in feeding strategy and social behaviour. Pair-living gobies cooperatively feed on ectoparasites removed from larger visiting fish, while group-living gobies feed on microinvertebrates living inside sponges and aggressively defend the best feeding spots against each other. We tested how flexible the social organization, social structure and competition over a food source of E. prochilos are by experimentally manipulating group composition, habitat structure and feeding condition of pair-living and group-living wild adult gobies in laboratory. Despite having different original social organizations in the wild, both pair-living and group-living gobies formed dominance hierarchies and exhibited affiliative behaviours in our group manipulations. This indicates that IVSO in this species is not driven by pre-determined or early-developed mechanisms, but rather a consequence of flexibility in social organization, also known as social flexibility.

AB In resource defence mating systems where males control nest sites, complex interrelationships between nest characteristics and nest advertisement are likely to influence female mate choice. Surprisingly, however, we know little about the influence of such relationships on female mating decisions. In terrestrial-breeding oviparous species, one character likely to have a major influence on female nest site selection is nest moisture. In addition to influencing the susceptibility of eggs to desiccation, nest moisture also stands to influence nest pH and offspring fitness, as well as the hydration state of resident males, and their potential to advertise. Together, such interrelationships could strongly influence female mating decisions. The aim of this study was to use a long-term field study combined with a multivariate approach to investigate the combined influence of nest moisture, nest pH and male acoustic advertisement on female nest site selection in a wild population of red-backed toadlets, Pseudophryne coriacea. We found that females deposited more eggs in wetter and less acidic nests, and that these variables were positively correlated. Moreover, nest moisture and pH in combination were positively related to the calling potential of resident males, and nests that were advertised more often received more eggs. These results suggest that nest site selection in red-backed toadlets is influenced by a complex interplay between covarying nest characteristics that together influence male sexual signalling and nest advertisement. More broadly our findings highlight the potential for nesting behaviour to be mechanistically intertwined with mate choice. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Urbanization rapidly alters the environment, often leading to decreased biodiversity. One abiotic selection pressure uniquely associated with urbanization is the urban heat island (UHI) effect-wherein built structures (e.g. paved surfaces) capture heat during the day, retain it through the dark cycle and result in significantly elevated night-time temperatures. Relatively few studies have asked what effects the UHI might have on the development and behaviour of urban animals, and even fewer have asked this question of urban arthropod pests who rely on external heat sources and can experience explosive urban population growth rates. In particular, behavioural plasticity is often cited as a critical phenotype for organisms to thrive after rapid environmental change such as urbanization. Here, the relationship between elevated urban temperatures and behaviour was examined in the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. With regard to the UHI, young spiderlings raised at urban, elevated temperatures showed significantly reduced life span, reduced body mass, elevated web building, heightened voracity towards heterospecific prey and sibling cannibalism. In contrast, males studied later in the final pre reproductive moults and raised at urban, elevated temperatures showed reduced life span, decreased adult body condition and increased voracity towards prey. We found no effects of temperature on late stage male web building or courtship behaviour. UHI temperatures simulated in the laboratory present black widow spiders with a myriad of developmental problems, but our data suggest these spiders use temperature-sensitive behavioural plasticity to attempt to accommodate this stressor.

TI Ontogeny of vocal learning in a hummingbird
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
DE learning; parallel evolution; Psittacopasserae; song; Trochilidae;
   vocalization
AB Hummingbirds have evolved to learn song from conspecifics independently of other bird clades that show this behaviour, such as parrots and oscine passerines. Little is known about how vocal learning occurs in hummingbirds. To determine the conditions necessary and sufficient for learning, we raised young Costa's hummingbirds, Calypte costae, in isolation in two experiments. The first experiment tested whether three pairs of males, raised either in silence or with only acoustic exposure to song, would produce wild-type song. They did not: each pair instead produced 'isolate' songs dissimilar to wild-type song. Each pair produced a unique isolate song with subtle differences from other pairs. Thus, exposure to song alone is insufficient to trigger learning. The second experiment tested whether individually housed males would learn songs when exposed to a live male model plus playback of song (1 h/day, 3 days/week, for 3 months). Seven of eight birds that heard Costa's-like songs learned to sing their tutor song. Each individual produced song that matched idiosyncratic features of the individual songs played to them, demonstrating attention to, and learning of the exact acoustic stimuli received. Two control birds exposed to acoustically dissimilar Anna's hummingbird, Calypte anna, song developed isolate song. Thus, exposure to species-specific song with a conspecific male is sufficient to trigger learning. The sensory phase began after fledging, around 23 days posthatch, and the sensorimotor phase began around 50 days posthatch, when singing also began. Song crystallization occurred approximately 125 days posthatch. Costa's also appear to be statistical learners; they learn to sing the songs they hear most often. Hummingbird song ontogeny appears to be similar to song ontogeny in passerines, despite its convergent origin.

AB Eavesdropping on vocal signals allows animals to gather information about conspecifics. For males, eavesdropping can be a low-risk method for determining the dominance status (e.g. territorial or subordinate) and motivation (e.g. mate seeking) of rivals. Adult southern white rhino males, Ceratotherium simum, are territorial and, in addition to other vocalizations, use contact and courtship calls when communicating with females. Although male territories are exclusive, the owners may tolerate up to three resident subordinate males. However, rival males sometimes intrude. Moreover, these intrusions may lead to rivals interacting with females. We investigated whether territorial males eavesdrop on vocal signals directed towards females by intruding males to determine their dominance status (territorial or subordinate) and motivation (contact calling an anoestrous female or approaching a female in oestrus during courtship). To do this, we first recorded and analysed contact and courtship calls of adult southern white rhino males and determined that these calls signal the males' dominance status and motivation. Playback trials revealed that territorial males differentiated between the calls of subordinate and other territorial males, showing a shorter latency to approach and longer searching behaviour (i.e. walking and running) after the playback of a subordinate's call. The reason for this response could be that the intruding subordinate male might be looking to challenge the territorial male for his territory. However, subordinates probably pose the lowest risk to the resident male in terms of fighting ability. In contrast, the reactions of the territorial males to the calls of other territorial males suggest that the presence and not the motivation of an intruding male was the most important factor influencing the male's reaction. We conclude that territorial males eavesdrop on the acoustic signals of trespassing males to gather information about these rivals, which can help them to better defend their territory.

   EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR
AB When disturbed, animals use various modes of communication to alert conspecifics about the source of danger. Some species have evolved graded or continuous signals specific to the type of threats. African elephants, Loxodonta africana, are known to differentiate between threats from bees and humans by changing the energy concentrations of their alarm calls. However, the mechanism by which Asian elephants, Elephas maximus, use vocalizations to alert conspecifics about imminent danger remains poorly explored. To understand disturbance-induced communication in free-ranging Asian elephants, we compared two call types, 'rumbles' (low-frequency calls) and 'trumpets' (high-frequency calls), produced in disturbed (by humans or other animals) and undisturbed (social interaction) states. We then analysed acoustic characters for both call types: absolute frequency parameters including fundamental frequency (F0), mean, minimum, maximum and range; temporal parameters including call duration, time to minimum F0, time to maximum F0, peak time and minimum time; and filter-related parameters including mean, minimum and maximum of first (F1) and second (F2) formant locations. We found that under disturbed conditions, Asian elephants increased the duration of rumbles and decreased the duration of trumpets. Similarly, the mean F0 and mean positions of F1 and F2 of rumbles decreased compared with the undisturbed condition; among trumpets, no significant differences were observed in mean F0 or formant position in either F1 or F2 between the two contexts. We also found that the duration of rumbles was influenced by an interaction between group size and context: smaller groups produced longer rumbles when disturbed. These results suggest that when disturbed Asian elephants can modify vocal signals whose likely function could be to alert conspecifics about potential threats.

AB Animals may gather information from multiple sources, and these information sources may conflict. Theory predicts that, all else being equal, reliance on a particular information source will depend on its information content relative to other sources. Information conflicts are a good area in which to test such predictions. Social insects, such as ants, make extensive use of both private information (e.g. visual route memories) and social information (e.g. pheromone trails) when attempting to locate a food source. Importantly, eusocial insects collaborate on food retrieval, so both information use and information provision may be expected to vary with the information content of alternative information sources. Many ants, such as Lasius niger, are active both day and night. Variation in light levels represents an ecologically important change in the information content of visually acquired route information. Here, we examined information use and information provision under high light levels, equivalent to a bright but overcast day, moderate light levels, simulating dusk, and darkness, equivalent to a moonless night. Ants learned poorly, or not at all, in darkness. As light levels decreased, ants showed decreasing reliance on private visual information, and a stronger reliance on social information, consistent with a 'copy when uncertain' strategy. In moderate light levels and darkness, pheromone depositing increased, presumably to compensate for the low information content of visual information. Varying light levels for cathemeral animals provides a powerful and ecologically meaningful method for examining information use and provision under varying levels of information content.

AB Miniature animals have tiny brains and should therefore face cognitive limitations. There is little supporting evidence for this expectation, however. We focused on memory information content and retention time, which likely subtend a broad range of cognitive abilities. Our study species, a web spider, allowed us to use a simple assay of working memory: how spiders search for prey they have captured and lost. We used an ontogenetic approach, taking advantage of variation in body size and the concomitant variation in brain size across instars in a single species. This approach eliminates possible confounding variation from species differences in ecology. Small spiders were the most highly motivated to search for lost prey and made the clearest discrimination of prey size. However, when we introduced a delay between memory formation and memory use, search time decreased more steeply in small spiders than in large spiders. Small spiders also performed less additional searching after their primary bout. Thus, the retention of working memory, but not its content, was limited in small spiders with small brains. We suggest that animals that evolve miniature sizes sacrifice not the ability to perceive and acquire information, but rather the ability to retain information over time in working memory. This may, in turn, limit their ability to relate behavioural decisions to their consequences. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social dominance hierarchies are a common system of within-group social ranking. Animals occupying subordinate and dominant ranks within these hierarchies differ in their access to food and mating opportunities. Thus, these animals often have different levels of stress, energy reserves and metabolic activity, leading to distinctive behavioural and physiological phenotypes. We hypothesized that phenotypes associated with social rank would affect the gut microbiome, a community of microbes intimately involved in host physiological and metabolic processes. Using male Astatotilapia burtoni, a well-studied species of cichlid, we implemented noninvasive sampling techniques to track microbial variation within individuals occupying different ranks. Our results indicated a lag between the behavioural and physiological changes and microbial community shifts associated with rank change. Given this, subordinate males had higher levels of pathogenic clades and decreased overall community diversity (alpha diversity) while dominant males had higher levels of protective clades and increased alpha diversity. The distributions of several differentially abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were highly correlated with alpha diversity, suggesting that these clades might be involved in structuring the community as a whole. Taken together, our results indicate that behavioural and phenotypic states associated with social rank induce dynamic, population-level shifts in microbiome composition, an effect putatively mediated by the presence of certain bacterial clades. This study is one of the first to evaluate and track the effects of social rank on teleost microbiomes and highlights the importance of integrating microbiome-derived physiological effects into future studies of behaviour.

AB A sex difference in mating optima generates antagonistic traits that impose costs on the opposite sex. This conflict can be mediated by food that increases mutual benefits. Although current understanding of sexual cooperation involving food is based exclusively on mating systems with male food control, recent studies have suggested universal female food control across taxa. However, there have been no empirical studies testing food's role in facilitating sexual cooperation in this scenario. Here, we examined the interplay of food availability and mating in the pea leafminer, Liriomyza huidobrensis, the males of which feed on the exudates from the leaf punctures created by female ovipositors. Given the association between female oviposition and food production, we infer that food controlled by females may alter male optima in mating and thus modulate male courtship strategies for mating. Mating stimulated females to produce abundant punctures, which benefited male feeding and survival. When males were deprived of the punctures, they adopted an elaborate dancing behaviour, leading to increased receptivity of females. However, when males adopted an alternative strategy of directly approaching females, they obtained fewer punctures. After preferential mating with dancing males, females significantly prolonged their life span and increased offspring numbers. Sexual cooperation in leafminers can be explained by the nutritional composition of plant exudates, which we found contain abundant sugars and amino acids. The plant exudates are vital food for males, but their nutritional value and availability rapidly declined with time. Our study reveals that the food produced by females can provide mutual benefits to male survival and female reproduction. Our study of food control by females extends our understanding of evolution in sexual cooperation. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Parental care is widely assumed to be costly, and life-history theory predicts that individuals that invest more in parental care should benefit in terms of number of offspring produced but that increased parental care might come at a cost in terms of decreased future fecundity and/or survival. However, the notion that parents that work 'harder', commonly measured by the rate at which parents visit the nestbox to provision their chicks, produce more, fitter chicks is surprisingly poorly supported. One potential reason for this apparent lack of relationship between measured workload during parental care and breeding productivity is that nest visit rate does not provide a good measure of foraging effort. Here, we used an automated radiotelemetry system to measure activity of individual female European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, during breeding, combined with a handicapping experiment (combination of radiotransmitters and wing clipping) and measures of foraging metrics, current breeding productivity, future fecundity and return rate. Handicapping decreased current breeding success due to higher abandonment and nest failure, but among successful birds (fledging >= 1 chick) there was no effect of handicapping on brood size at fledging for the current breeding attempt. Handicapping decreased future fecundity, the probability of initiating a second brood, and return rate, but there was no evidence for additive costs of reproduction in wing-clipped females. Handicapping had no effect on provisioning rate but automated tracking data showed that, during chick rearing, wing-clipped females had 22% lower activity compared to females with radios only. Our data provide an explanation for the often contradictory effects of handicapping reported on reproductive effort and costs of reproduction: individuals can use behavioural flexibility - decreasing overall activity while maintaining provisioning rate - along with changes in mass and nestling diet to mitigate putative effects of increased workload imposed by handicapping.

AB Multimodal signals are used by many animals for intraspecific communication and can provide information about sex identity as well as quality of the signaller. In diurnal geckos of the genus Cnemaspis, chromatic colour patches in males evolved after chemical secretions, providing us with an opportunity to examine the utility of evolving multimodality. We quantified signal components and receiver responses in Cnemaspis mysoriensis to determine the relative importance of chemical and visual traits for intraspecific communication. Digital imagery and spectrophotometry of lizards revealed the presence of two distinct male morphs (yellow-gular and white-gular) and one female form (white-gular). All males, but no females, had yellow eye rims. Characterization of chemical secretions from the ventral precloacal and femoral glands of all lizard forms revealed no differences between male morphs. However, all males differed from females in a few key compounds. We then exposed lizards to only chemical stimuli, only visual stimuli, or both chemical and visual stimuli of conspecific males and females. We found that females were responsive to the chemical stimuli alone as well as the multimodal stimuli of males, whereas males were only responsive to the multimodal stimuli of other males. Neither chemical or visual components of females elicited a response from conspecifics. Thus, while the chemical secretions of males are sufficient for females to elicit a response, multimodal stimuli are necessary for males to respond. Based on variation in signalling traits and receiver responses, we conclude that: (1) chemical secretions signal both sex identity and male quality; (2) eye rim colour encodes information about sex identity; and (3) gular colour in males is probably not a redundant trait, providing some information to males, but not females. We conclude that the secondary evolution of visual signals in C. mysoriensis therefore enhances male-male social interactions and not communication in general.

AB Some animals are thought to exhibit cognitive specialization, as they have specialized cognitive modules that solve specific social or ecological problems instead of one general-purpose mechanism that addresses diverse problems. Although there are many examples of specialized cognition, little is known about whether specialization develops through experience or is produced by innate, species-specific differences. Previous work has shown that Polistes fuscatus wasps use face recognition to individually identify other wasps and that P. fuscatus are specialized for learning conspecific faces. Here, we test how experimentally altering face experience in three Polistes species influences the development of face specialization. We show face learning is influenced by both experience and innate, species-specific differences. In P. fuscatus, experience with conspecific faces is not required for the development of face specialization. In two related Polistes species that naturally lack individual face recognition, Polistes metricus and Polistes dominula, experience has different effects on specialization. Polistes metricus, a close relative of P. fuscatus, develops face specialization with experience. However, P. dominula, a more distant relative, uses general pattern recognition to learn faces regardless of experience. Therefore, some species have innate mechanistic architecture that facilitates the development of face specialization, while other species do not. These results suggest that selection shapes animal minds in a modular manner. The capacity for specialized cognitive skills evolves in response to specific ecological or social demands, such as social benefits associated with accurate individual face recognition.

AB We model the evolution of a pursuit-deterrent signal of 'perception advertisement' for the case in which a predator can travel among many patches, each of which contain two prey. We consider a signal that is difficult for prey to fake, such as approaching the predator, and assume that the signal also alerts other prey in the patch, thereby reducing the overall value of that patch to the predator. We analyse the model using evolutionary game theory and adaptive dynamics on prey and predator fitness-generating functions to determine convergent stable equilibrium solutions for the behaviour of prey and predator. We consider the effects on equilibria of the probability of predator detection, signalling cost, predator travel time and the chance of killing the prey. Depending on the parameter values, we find stable equilibria at pure signalling, nonsignalling and mixed evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs). For example, prey are more likely to signal when they have a low probability of detecting the predator, and when the predator's missed opportunity costs are higher. We also find that there are two basins of attraction such that the system evolves towards one of them depending on the initial strategy values. This is the first two-prey pursuit-deterrent signalling game we are aware of, providing a novel theoretical basis for the evolution of signalling in group-living prey.

AB Many organisms show a reduced tendency to investigate unfamiliar objects as they age. Although the phenomenon could arise for a range of reasons, it is possible that this age-related increase in conservatism is adaptive. In particular, we propose that novel objects encountered late in life will be perceived as being relatively rare, so the value of information from investigating their properties will be estimated to be low. In addition, agents that investigate novel objects late in their lives will have little time left to exploit this information should the objects turn out to be profitable. We formalize the above arguments by developing an exploration-exploitation ('bandit') model. In this model, agents must decide whether to explore or ignore a novel object that it has just encountered at a given stage in its life, despite uncertainty regarding the commonness of the object in the environment and the likelihood that the object is profitable/unprofitable. We assume that, as agents encounter (and possibly investigate) unfamiliar objects, they use Bayesian inference to update their beliefs about the objects' commonness and profitability. Dynamic programming is concurrently used to identify the conditions under which the agent should explore or ignore these objects. If the benefit/cost ratio of investigating novel objects is high, then all individuals will be selected to explore regardless of their age. Likewise, if the ratio is low, then all individuals should ignore novel objects. Under intermediate conditions, young individuals that encounter novel objects should investigate their properties, while older ones should ignore them. The optimal switch in strategy arises as a consequence of age-dependent variation in both the novel object's perceived abundance and the future value of information regarding the object's profitability. We highlight several additional testable predictions of the model and discuss alternative adaptive explanations. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Local warning colour polymorphism, frequently observed in aposematic organisms, is evolutionarily puzzling. This is because variation in aposematic signals is expected to be selected against due to predators' difficulties associating several signals with a given unprofitable prey. One possible explanation for the existence of such variation is predator generalization, which occurs when predators learn to avoid one form and consequently avoid other sufficiently similar forms, relaxing selection for monomorphic signals. We tested this hypothesis by exposing the three different colour morphs of the aposematic wood tiger moth, Arctia plantaginis, existing in Finland to local wild-caught predators (blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus). We designed artificial moths that varied only in their hindwing coloration (white, yellow and red) keeping other traits (e.g. wing pattern and size) constant. Thus, if the birds transferred their aversion of one morph to the other two we could infer that their visual appearances are sufficiently similar for predator generalization to take place. We found that, surprisingly, birds showed no preference or aversion for any of the three morphs presented. During the avoidance learning trials, birds learned to avoid the red morph considerably faster than the white or yellow morphs, confirming previous findings on the efficacy of red as a warning signal that facilitates predator learning. Birds did not generalize their learned avoidance of one colour morph to the other two morphs, suggesting that they pay more attention to conspicuous wing coloration than other traits. Our results are in accordance with previous findings that coloration plays a key role during avoidance learning and generalization, which has important implications for the evolution of mimicry. We conclude that, in the case of wood tiger moths, predator generalization is unlikely to explain the unexpected coexistence of different morphs.

AB Fission-fusion dynamics allow for individuals to deal with spatiotemporally changing food resources, with groups from a community fusing together when resources are abundant and splitting away when competition for resources is high. Such fissione-fusion dynamics are often modulated by seasonal changes in resources. We examined the seasonal variation in group size and social structure of female Asian elephants, which show high fission-fusion dynamics, in a population in southern India. Females in this population form many distinct communities or clans in both the dry and wet seasons. At the population level, females were sighted in larger group sizes and associated with more uncommon females in the dry season. However, when associations among common females were considered, a greater number of stronger associations were observed in the wet season. There were no consistently significant seasonal differences in group sizes or associations at the clan level. Thus, population-level results, obtained by a combination of results from different clans, may sometimes be misleading. Female associations showed some temporal stability, with association indices being moderately correlated across consecutive seasons and years. Interestingly, average group sizes were similar across clans of different sizes, indicating a restriction on group size, possibly due to resource distribution. In spite of this restriction, most clan-mates showed low, non-zero associations amongst themselves rather than very strong associations with a small set of individuals. The resulting fluid rather than fixed groups suggest a benefit to socializing with other clan-mates. Thus, unlike the pattern usually seen, fission-fusion dynamics here is a means to maintain multiple associates under conditions of relatively constant but constrained group size, rather than being a means of increasing or decreasing group size in response to ecological factors.

   MECHANISMS
AB Direct reciprocity can establish stable cooperation. Nevertheless, the significance of this mechanism is yet unclear. A frequent assumption is that both commodity and context should be the same when help is exchanged between social partners. Yet, an exchange of different favours appears more likely in a natural setting. This is assumed to be cognitively demanding, however, because experienced help in one context needs to change the motivation to help by different means or in a different context. We tested whether Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, transfer help from one cooperative task to another. Individuals could provide food to previously either cooperating or defecting partners by using a different mechanism to produce food for their partner than the partner had used to help them. Test subjects indeed helped previously cooperative partners more often than defecting ones by using a different provisioning mechanism. This implies that rats realize the cooperative propensity of social partners, which they consequently reward by help of a different kind; hence, they do not merely copy experienced helping behaviour. Our results suggest that animals other than primates are capable of transferring help between different contexts, which highlights new possibilities for the occurrence of reciprocal altruism involving different commodities and services in nature.

AB Birdsong is the most widely studied example of vocal learning outside human language and shares important parallels with it, including the importance of social factors during development. Our understanding of how social factors affect song learning, however, remains surprisingly incomplete. Here we examine the possible role of aggressive interactions in determining song 'tutor' choice in song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, a songbird in which individuals display song learning strategies ranging from learning primarily from one tutor, to learning a few songs each from a number of tutors. We test two hypotheses: the competition hypothesis suggests that young birds learn more from tutors with whom they compete especially intensely and predicts that tutees will respond with high aggression to tutor songs. In contrast, the cooperation hypothesis suggests that song learning reflects a cooperative relationship between the tutor and the tutee and predicts that tutees will respond with low aggression to tutor songs. In a playback experiment we found that birds responded more aggressively to songs of their tutors than they did to songs of strangers and that the strength of aggressive response correlated positively with how much they had learned from that tutor. These results provide the first field evidence for the hypothesis that young males preferentially learn their songs from adult males with whom they compete most intensely during the song-learning phase, and perhaps afterwards.

AB The act of predation often comprises multiple sequential steps whereby prey can employ defences at all or some of these stages to deter predation. However, investment in defences is costly unless they are outweighed by conferring some benefit to the bearer. One system that employs multiple defences is that of the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and its symbiotic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens. This nematodeebacterium complex infects and kills soil-dwelling insect larvae, in which they then reproduce and juveniles emerge 2 weeks later. Predation of the infected host cadaver at any point during infection is fatal for the parasitic colony inside. Infected individuals, however, turn red, produce a chemical defence, bioluminesce and smell strongly at various stages of the infection process. We tested whether these colour and scent cues conferred a benefit to the infecting nematodeebacterium complex, utilizing feeding trials of nematode-infected waxworms, Galleria mellonella, with wild-caught great tits, Parus major. We tested for multimodality, as the cues are in different sensory modalities, and found no overall benefit in terms of initial attack on the first prey item, although this does not rule out the possibility of multimodality within this system. We then examined the first five prey attacked and found that scent overshadowed colour at various stages of infection, in terms of reducing levels of attack, but not when both signals were in concert in terms of consumption of infected individuals.

AB Male ornaments, commonly explained as being a result of sexual selection, are typically more elaborate than female ornaments. Interestingly, the bright and showy sexually selected traits of some female ornaments, like those of males, might be variable and condition dependent, and hence relate to individual quality. Ultraviolet (UV)-induced fluorescence is one such ornament known to be intricately involved in intraspecific communication in several animals; however, the role of fluorescence in signalling individual quality is unknown. The ornate jumping spider, Cosmophasis umbratica, exhibits female-specific UV-induced fluorescence on its palps to facilitate effective intersex communication but whether the fluorescence informs males of the female's condition and individual quality is unknown. We tested the prediction that UV-induced fluorescence in adult female C. umbratica depended on postmaturation age, mating status and feeding regime. We found that postmaturation age and feeding regime, but not mating status, affected female fluorescence. Middle-aged females were brighter than younger and older females, but the older females had a greener hue; well-fed females were brighter than starved females. We conclude that the UV-induced fluorescence of female C. umbratica is highly condition dependent, highlighting the importance of considering female as well as male ornamentation, particularly when this may have implications for mate choice and the maintenance of coloration in animals.

AB Predator mimicry occurs when prey resemble their predator to gain protection. We explored the relative importance of the morphological and locomotor signals that spider-mimicking moths use to deceive their jumping spider predators. Two hypotheses explain why animals use multicomponent signals for communication: the 'back-up signal' hypothesis which suggests that multiple traits increase accuracy, and the 'multiple message' hypothesis which suggests that the different traits serve different purposes or target different signal receivers. We conducted predation tests using the putative spider-mimicking moths Brenthia coronigera (visual and locomotor mimicry) and Choreutis hyligenes (only locomotor mimicry) and a control moth species displaying no mimicry. We found that B. coronigera used multicomponent signals, i.e. pattern, display posture and jumping behaviour, to deceive its jumping spider predators, and thus experienced lower predation rates and more time for escaping. Spiders suffered a decreased predation rate when they encountered B. coronigera, relative to the other two moth species. Spiders displayed leg-waving behaviour (which is used in courtship and territorial display) to both live and lure B. coronigera, suggesting that the spiders considered the moths to be another jumping spider. When the eyespots of B. coronigera were erased, the predation rate increased. In addition, the latency of first attacks was significantly longer in live B. coronigera moths than in lures fixed in the display posture. This suggests that the eyespots, the 'peacock-like' display position and the jumping movement all add to the similarity with jumping spiders. Our results support the 'back-up signal' hypothesis: that multiple signals can deceive the predators better. Our experimental paradigm enabled us to explore the recognition ability of predators, and gave insight into the ways evolution shapes the mimicry system.

AB When using signals to attract mates or defend resources, animals often overlap the voices of other individuals in close proximity. In such contexts signal masking is likely and animals would benefit by adopting behavioural strategies that modify the timing of signals to minimize the negative effects of masking or take advantage of its signalling value. Indeed, temporal coordination has been commonly described in a wide variety of taxa, but compelling evidence demonstrating that it arises as an active process is scarce. Here we investigate the degree of coordinated singing by lekking long-billed hermit hummingbirds, Phaethornis longirostris, in the Neotropics, using randomization tests to study the timing of vocal signals. We first demonstrate that a randomization statistical approach is robust at detecting coordinated singing in simulated data. Then, we show that long-billed hermits engage in vocal interactions in which either song alternation or song overlap is used. Furthermore, we show that singing behaviour varies with the distance between singers: hermits alternate their songs when they are in close proximity, and they overlap songs at farther distances. Birds achieve these two behaviours by modifying the time intervals between signals. The association between pattern of coordination and distance is not fully explained by any of the current hypotheses for song overlap and suggests that multiple context-dependent singing strategies could be involved. Our findings provide compelling evidence on vocal coordination as an active process in this species and validate an analytical approach that could be extended to investigate similar patterns in other taxa.

AB Sexual dimorphism is common but evolutionarily labile in vertebrates. While it is well established that gonadal hormones exert considerable influence on the development and expression of sexual traits, studies of animals with exceptional sexually dimorphic neural or neuromuscular phenotypes are limited. We studied the extent to which androgen treatment of female golden-collared manakins, Manacus vitellinus, activates specific elements of the elaborate, acrobatic courtship behaviour characteristic of males. After 1 week, nonbreeding females and juvenile males given implants containing testosterone (T) were observed for 3 weeks in an outdoor aviary situated in the middle of Panamanian rainforest. T-treated males performed the full suite of documented masculine courtship behaviours, whereas T-treated females performed only a few of these behaviours and then at much lower rates than males. T-treatment did increase aggressive behaviour to a similar degree in both males and females. These results suggest that neuromuscular systems encoding elements of male courtship as well as aggressive behaviour experience unique patterns of development from complete to limited to nonexistent sexual differentiation. The basis of these patterns represents a unique opportunity for study. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB As dispersal is a dangerous part of an individual's life, its timing is important to increase the chances of survival and successful establishment of a territory. We investigated factors affecting the timing of natal dispersal in the Eurasian beaver, Castor fiber, a territorial, monogamous, long-lived mammal, using data from an 18-year individual-based study (1998-2015). We tested hypotheses about the causes of dispersal onset, namely competitive ability, kin competition (sibling competition and offspring-parent competition), population density and intolerance by an incoming, unrelated dominant individual. Only 9% of individuals remained philopatric and became dominant after both of their parents disappeared. Average age at dispersal was 3.5 years, with some individuals delaying dispersal up to age 7 years. Beavers dispersed more frequently with increasing age (i.e. with increasing competitive ability and possibly experience) and when population density was lower. Further, both females and males delayed dispersal with increasing same-sex parental age. Older parents were either more tolerant towards philopatric subordinates, or subordinates awaited the disappearance of their senescing parents to take over the natal territory. From comparisons with other populations, we conclude that the high population density in our area was possibly the ultimate driver of dispersal with individuals delaying dispersal to increase their competitive ability.

AB Differential predation risk between habitats, or 'the landscape of fear', can have profound impacts on foraging strategies of prey. Few studies, however, have described the landscape of fear in the wild, in relation to predator densities. Using giving-up density experiments, and vertebrate surveys, we described the landscape of fear for two rodent species in relation to actual predator abundances in a tropical savannah. We offered native eastern chestnut mice, Pseudomys gracilicaudatus, and introduced house mice, Mus musculus domesticus, food in the open, and under the cover of grass. When eastern brown snakes, Pseudonaja textilis, were absent, both eastern chestnut and house mice consumed more food items under grass. In habitats where snakes were abundant, however, eastern chestnut mice changed their foraging behaviour, and consumed more food items in the open than under grass. In contrast, non-native house mice reduced their foraging activity under cover, but showed no increase in foraging in the open in the presence of snakes. Thus, native eastern chestnut mice have the ability to change their foraging tactics to adjust their antipredator behaviour to remain successful in the presence of native eastern brown snakes, whereas introduced house mice did not exhibit this behaviour.

AB Previous studies have shown that domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, trained in a competitive foraging condition would subsequently develop a high degree of impulsiveness in an intertemporal choice paradigm. Competition inevitably causes variance in the amount of food that the foragers gain. However, it is not known whether the food variance is causally linked with the impulsiveness. In experiment 1, we compared four groups of chicks trained in combinations of two social conditions (pseudocompetition or isolated) and two food conditions (variable or constant food). The food variance was introduced by varying the number of grains in each trial according to a binomial distribution. The subject chick was separated from the competitors by a transparent wall, and no actual interference occurred. Chicks were subsequently tested in binary choices between a small reward after a short delay (SS) and a large reward after a long delay (LL) in an isolated and constant food condition. If chicks had been trained under the pseudocompetition and variable food, they chose LL significantly less frequently than the other three groups. The effect disappeared when the LL delay was omitted, suggesting that chicks accurately memorized the food amount. The food variance is thus a necessary condition for the stronger temporal discounting. Otherwise, the observed effect could be ascribed to a paradoxical risk proneness associated with the variable option. In experiment 2, we compared four groups of chicks in which food amount varied either in SS or LL, or both. The subsequent binary choice tests revealed that the chicks chose SS irrespective of whether SS or LL had varied. These results cannot be explained in terms of a greater risk-prone choice of the variable option. Coincidence of perceived competition and food variance, at least in one option, is sufficient for chicks to develop choice impulsiveness. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Dominance relationships are a defining feature of the social organization of many animal species. Populations structured by absolute dominance usually maintain a generally linear hierarchy, while relative dominance occurs, for example, within territorial populations where an animal is likely to be dominant within its territory. Because relative dominance is dependent on social context, the traits associated with it are often unclear. Green anole lizards, Anolis carolinensis, are an ideal system in which to determine dominance-related traits, as anoles use territorial defence in most natural environments, but establish a dominance hierarchy at high densities such as those that occur in captivity. We hypothesized that anoles use similar morphological and behavioural traits to determine social status under both forms of social organization. To test this, we studied a natural population of anoles to determine the traits most predictive of male territory size and quality (as measured by the number of females overlapping a male's territory). While these measures of territory may be related, they measure different components of territorial success. We then used mathematical ranking algorithms to quantify dominance in a tournament of paired arena trials, and identified traits associated with rank. Our results showed that lizards with wider heads had higher social rank, while those with longer heads were more successful at territorial defence. We also found that, independently of morphology, lizards who behaved more aggressively ranked higher in dominance trials, although behaviour did not predict measures of territory. Together, our results indicate that different traits may determine absolute and relative dominance in the green anole. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Evolutionary change in one trait can elicit evolutionary changes in other traits due to genetic correlations. This constrains the independent evolution of traits and can lead to unpredicted ecological and evolutionary outcomes. Animals might frequently exhibit genetic associations among behavioural and morphological-physiological traits, because the physiological mechanisms behind animal personality can have broad multitrait effects and because many selective agents influence the evolution of multiple types of traits. However, we currently know little about genetic correlations between animal personalities and nonbehavioural traits. We tested for associations between personality, morphology and locomotor performance by comparing zebrafish (Danio rerio) collected from the wild and then selectively bred for either a proactive or reactive stress coping style ('bold' or 'shy' phenotypes). Based on adaptive hypotheses of correlational selection in the wild, we predicted that artificial selection for boldness would produce correlated evolutionary responses of larger caudal regions and higher fast-start escape performance (and the opposite for shyness). After four to seven generations, morphology and locomotor performance differed between personality lines: bold zebrafish exhibited a larger caudal region and higher fast-start performance than fish in the shy line, matching predictions. Individual-level phenotypic correlations suggested that pleiotropy or physical gene linkage likely explained the correlated response of locomotor performance, while the correlated response of body shape may have reflected linkage disequilibrium, which is breaking down each generation in the laboratory. Our results indicate that evolution of personality can result in concomitant changes in morphology and whole-organism performance, and vice versa.

AB The ability of individuals to distinguish conspecifics from similar-looking congeners has important evolutionary consequences, yet few studies have determined which specific visual characteristics are used for species recognition, and whether closely related species use the same characteristics. In particular, sympatry with similar-looking congeners may influence which traits are important in species recognition. We presented elegant trogons, Trogon elegans, and black-headed trogons, Trogon melanocephalus, with models that closely resembled conspecifics and models that differed in either the colour of the belly, the colour of the upperparts or the tail-barring pattern, while broadcasting species-specific songs. Elegant trogons showed significantly more aggression towards the conspecific and tail models, suggesting that belly and back colour, but not tail-barring pattern, are important for species recognition in this species. In contrast, the black-headed trogon approached all models very closely, except for the conspecific model. We interpret this counterintuitive behaviour as reluctance to approach an unknown conspecific, suggesting that all three plumage traits are important for species recognition in black-headed trogons. Because the elegant trogon is not sympatric with a similar-looking congener, we argue that they may lack the ability to discriminate fine-barring tail differences or overlook this trait. Sympatry with the similar-looking violaceous trogon may have influenced species recognition in black-headed trogons, favouring the use of all three plumage characteristics, including tail-banding patterns, which differ between these species. Alternatively, it is possible that incongruent stimuli are attended to differently, with elegant trogons focusing on the acoustic traits and black-headed trogons focusing on visual cues. Nevertheless, our study provides the first experimental evidence that specific plumage patches are used for species recognition and that closely related species may use different traits for species recognition. Our findings also suggest that the presence of a similar-looking congener can influence which traits are important in species recognition. (c) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The solar day-night rhythm imposes a strict diel activity pattern on many organisms. Among birds, most species are generally either active during the day and rest during the night, or vice versa. However, many waterbird species can be active during both daylight and darkness. Hence, these species are much less limited by an external clock to allocate their activities over time than species showing a strict day or night pattern. Before miniaturized data-logging systems became available, it was difficult to follow animals day and night. Therefore, few details about short-term activity budgets are available for free-living animals. To study the activity budget of mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, in relation to time of the day, season and external factors, we used tags containing an accelerometer providing detailed activity information. We observed a relatively constant diel pattern with more activity during daylight than at night and peak activities during twilight. Activity over the season (September-April) was remarkably constant. Compared to the average activity per half-day, excess activity alternated every 12 h, suggesting an increased need for rest during daylight after a night with excess activity, and vice versa. Between days, activity was allocated to half-days in a very flexible manner: Either day or night activity was increased for a number of days, before increased activity gradually switched to the other half-day. We observed no synchrony in this pattern among individuals, highlighting the behavioural flexibility of this generalist species. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Ants use the panoramic skyline in part to determine a direction of travel. A theoretically elegant way to define where terrestrial objects meet the sky is to use an opponent-process channel contrasting green wavelengths of light with ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Compared with the sky, terrestrial objects reflect relatively more green wavelengths. Using such an opponent-process channel gains constancy in the face of changes in overall illumination level. We tested the use of UV wavelengths in desert ants by using a plastic that filtered out most of the energy below 400 nm. Ants, Melophorus bagoti, were trained to home with an artificial skyline provided by an arena (experiment 1) or with the natural panorama (experiment 2). On a test, a homing ant was captured just before she entered her nest, and then brought back to a replicate arena (experiment 1) or the starting point (the feeder, experiment 2) and released. Blocking UV light led to deteriorations in orientation in both experiments. When the artificial skyline was changed from opaque to transparent UV-blocking plastic (experiment 3) on the other hand, the ants were still oriented. We conclude that UV wavelengths play a crucial role in determining direction based on the terrestrial surround. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Dominance hierarchies emerge when individuals must compete for access to resources such as food, territory or mates. Here, using traditional and network social hierarchy analysis, we show that 10 groups of 12 male laboratory CD1 mice living in large vivaria consistently form extremely linear dominance hierarchies. Within each hierarchy we determine that every individual mouse has a unique social rank and behaves with a high degree of consistency in their agonistic behaviour towards other individuals. Using temporal pairwise comparison Glicko ratings and social network triangle transitivity measures, we demonstrate that these hierarchies emerge rapidly, and that initial aggression is not predictive of later dominance. We also show that groups vary in how unequally power is distributed over time as social networks stabilize. Our results demonstrate that an ethologically relevant housing paradigm coupled with extensive behavioural observations provides a strong framework for investigating the temporal patterning of mouse dominance hierarchies and complex social dynamics. Furthermore, the statistical methods described establish a strong basis for the study of temporal dynamics of social hierarchies across species.

AB The vast majority of social animals exhibit sex-biased dispersal as a strategy to reduce kin competition and avoid inbreeding. Piscivorous 'resident' killer whales, Orcinus orca, of the eastern North Pacific, however, are unusual in that both sexes remain philopatric throughout life, forming highly stable, multigeneration matrilines that are closed to immigration. We conducted a 12-year study documenting extensive cooperative prey sharing within these matrilines, and hypothesized that extreme natal philopatry in resident killer whales arose due to inclusive fitness benefits gained by provisioning maternal kin. We found that prey sharing was nonreciprocal, and even though whales routinely foraged in mixed associations containing multiple matrilines, prey sharing among individuals belonging to different matrilines was very infrequent. Furthermore, maternal relatedness was a significant predictor of the frequency of prey sharing between individuals, with close maternal kin sharing more often than distant relatives or nonkin. Adult females were much more likely to share prey than adult males or subadults, probably because they mainly provisioned their offspring. However, food sharing was not limited solely to maternal care; all age-sex classes engaged in this behaviour by sharing with close maternal relatives, such as siblings and mothers. We also investigated the frequency of prey sharing between mothers and their offspring as a function of offspring sex and age, and found that maternal food sharing with daughters declined after daughters reached reproductive maturity, which could help to explain matriline fission events. The evolution of kin-directed food sharing requires the ability to reliably discriminate kin, which resident killer whales likely achieve through social familiarity and vocal dialect recognition. We propose that lifetime philopatry of both sexes has been selectively favoured in this population due to the inclusive fitness benefits of kin-directed food sharing, a cooperative behaviour that may also inhibit dispersal by reducing resource competition among kin.

AB In long-distance migrants, it has been hypothesized that re-pairing in spring is facilitated if, on the wintering grounds, formerly mated individuals maintain close proximity or occupy ecologically similar habitat, which then results in more synchronized spring migration schedules. For songbirds, pair members have long been thought to migrate independently, but only recently has it been possible to directly track start-to-finish migration to test this prediction. We used light-sensor geolocators to track paired versus nonpaired purple martins, Progne subis subis, that breed in North America and winter in South America. In 6 of 12 pairs, pair members departed on autumn migration within 4 days of each other, but pairs rarely occupied nearby stopover sites in Central America and were separated by an average of 560 km upon arrival in Brazil. Formerly paired birds were not significantly more similar in autumn or spring migration timing, or winter roost location, compared with nonpaired birds tracked from the same colonies and years. Formerly mated pairs who were closer together in Brazil, or who occupied regions with similar amounts of forest cover, did not have more synchronized spring migration schedules. Only 1 of 12 pairs that were tracked remated after migration. Intense competition for nesting cavities combined with disparate spring migration schedules of former pairs probably contributes to the high divorce rate.

   BIRD; VOCALIZATIONS; POPULATION
AB Birdsong in temperate zone passerines is a trait under sexual selection in males. Female song is still thought to be rare in this group. Here we show that female song is common in a temperate zone population of house wrens, Troglodytes aedon, and we provide evidence for its functional role in defending against male and female conspecifics. We observed that females sang most frequently at the onset of egg laying, with song becoming less common as incubation approached. Thus, females sang most during the time when eggs were left unguarded and susceptible to conspecific attack. We also conducted playback experiments to test whether conspecific stimuli would induce female song in focal individuals. Playback from both male and female conspecifics elicited strong song responses from resident females, who often vocalized independently from their partners. However, females were more physically aggressive towards female songs than male songs. Finally, females that sang more during these simulated conspecific intrusions ultimately lost fewer eggs to house wren ovicide. These results suggest that female house wren song may have evolved, at least in part, for use in intra-and intersexual competition. These results also highlight how investigating these traditionally male behaviours in female animals can lead to key insights regarding the evolution of sexual dimorphism.

AB Behavioural correlations between mating behaviour and antipredator behaviour are expected when sexual behaviour increases predation risk. However, the correlation would be different between males and females, particularly when the sexes experience different levels of predation risk. Here, we tested this idea using a water strider species, Gerris gracilicornis (Heteroptera: Gerridae). G. gracilicornis males employ an unusual intimidating courtship strategy capitalizing on predator behaviours and female response to predators. Since mounted females are more vulnerable than males to predatory attacks from below, we predicted that changes in female mating behaviours across predation contexts (boldness in a mating context) should be associated with female antipredator behaviours (boldness in a nonmating context), but that the correlation would be weaker for male mating behaviours. In a series of behavioural assays, we measured water striders' (1) mating behaviour in the absence of predators, (2) mating behaviour in the presence of predation risk, (3) boldness in the mating context (changes in female mating behaviour after predator attacks) and (4) boldness in the nonmating context. We found that females behaved more cautiously around predators in both the mating and nonmating contexts. We also found that females' boldness in the mating context was significantly correlated with their boldness in the nonmating context. In contrast to females, antipredator behaviour of males in the nonmating context did not correlate with their boldness in the mating context. Thus we suggest that sex differences in boldness across predation contexts appear to cause sex-specific behavioural syndromes. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While a growing number of animals demonstrate avoidance of areas associated with conspecific death, the extent to which wild populations may use these experiences to learn about novel predators remains unclear. Here we demonstrate with experiments that wild American crows, Corvus brachyrhynchos, respond to dead conspecifics by mobbing, increasing the time to approach food in areas associated with these events, and learning new predators based on their proximity to dead crows and hawks. Avoidance of either dead conspecifics or areas associated with them is not shared by another urban bird, the rock pigeon, Columba livia. Crows mobbed and increased the time to approach food over the next 72 h after observing novel humans paired with a dead crow, a red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis, or a hawk with a dead crow. The sight of a dead pigeon did not elicit these responses. These findings suggest that, for crows, dead conspecifics, but not dead heterospecifics, represent a salient danger akin to the observation of a predator. On the day the stimulus was presented, the number of trials that resulted in mobbing and avoidance of the food was strongest when crows were presented a hawk with a dead crow. In addition, we demonstrate that crows use the proximity of a human to predators, to dead conspecifics and to predators with dead conspecifics as cues to learn to recognize and subsequently scold the associated human after only one training event, and that this association can last 6 weeks. Together, our results support previous findings that crows learn places associated with conspecific death, and further demonstrate that crows can learn and remember people who appear complicit in these events.

AB Colour signals arise in a variety of sexual contexts, including advertising reproductive status. Despite potentially attracting negative attention from unrelated competitors, bright pregnancy coloration may communicate gestation to kin and potential fathers, thereby garnering aid during agonistic encounters and reducing the overall amount of aggression received by pregnant females. To establish whether this 'pregnancy sign' influences rates of aggression in the presence versus absence of maternal kin, we conducted behavioural observations of wild olive baboons, Papio anubis, in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, in groups composed of maternal kin and nonkin, and of captive baboons at the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC, San Antonio, TX, U.S.A.), in group enclosures that were unlikely to include close kin. At SNPRC, we also experimentally obscured the coloration of the pregnancy sign, and we performed playback experiments to measure male responses to the distress calls of pregnant females. Free-ranging female baboons experienced significantly less aggression from nonkin females after the onset of the pregnancy sign compared to the pre-pregnancy sign. In contrast, captive pregnant females whose pregnancy coloration was obscured with paint experienced significantly lower aggression rates from female conspecifics compared to pre-painting. Male aggression towards females did not differ in the presence versus absence of the pregnancy sign in either the wild or the captive population, although captive fathers paid significantly more attention to distress calls of pregnant cage-mates than they did to those of cycling cage-mates, suggesting a willingness to aid mothers that were carrying their unborn offspring.

   FORAGING BEHAVIOR; INDIVIDUAL TRAITS
AB Social, ecological and environmental factors all influence how much time animals allocate to different behaviours. Here, we investigated whether parasites affect behavioural time allocation in a free-ranging ungulate that must apportion time to multiple competing activities crucial for maintenance, survival and reproduction. We examined how experimental removal of gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes influenced the relative amounts of time that female Grant's gazelle, Nanger granti, allocated to core behaviours including foraging, vigilance, moving and resting. The anthelmintic treatment reduced female parasite load for similar to 120 days, and during this period, females relieved of their parasitic nematodes adjusted their daily time budgets. At the group level, parasite removal resulted in an increase in foraging time and a decrease in vigilance. This effect was also apparent at the individual level, where treated females allocated more time to foraging at the expense of vigilance. In addition to treatment, group size was a significant predictor of the relative time spent foraging versus vigilant, where females in larger groups allocated more time to foraging at the expense of vigilance. Our results suggest that parasites may induce changes in host behaviour that are of similar magnitude to some of the most commonly studied social drivers of behavioural time allocation.

AB Song divergence between populations of a species can lead to reproductive isolation and speciation. However, birds may have different singing styles used in distinct social contexts, and songs of each style may change at different rates over time and space. Here, we tested whether song divergence between subspecies of reed bunting, Emberiza schoeniclus, differs with singing style, by comparing song traits of its three singing styles among three subspecies breeding in northern and western Europe. We show that the two singing styles under sexual selection (dawn and fast songs, related to obtaining extrapair and social mates, respectively) diverged significantly more than the slow songs (used as an all-clear signal to nest-attending social females). Multiple song traits differed significantly between the subspecies in all singing styles, with E. s. lusitanica generally being intermediate between E. s. schoeniclus and E. s. witherbyi, and the pattern of song complexity opposing the expected latitudinal gradient (of increasing complexity with increasing latitude). Cluster analyses of populations indicate that sexually selected singing styles are better for discriminating subspecies, describing a scenario of a major split in song features between the migratory, northern E. s. schoeniclus and the two resident, southern subspecies, rather than a clinal variation. The greater song divergence in fast and dawn singing styles suggests that sexual selection may be playing an important role in the incipient speciation of reed buntings.

AB When reproductive success is limited by mate search costs, males can reduce costs by eavesdropping and initiating displays if conspecific courtship is detected. Here, we examine eavesdropping by male Schizocosa ocreata wolf spiders, with field studies, laboratory studies using video playback and live exposure studies. In field enclosure experiments, introduced males responded with increased courtship signalling behaviour in the presence of a courting male. In the laboratory, field-collected males spent more time engaged in interaction behaviours and performed more bouts of courtship activity in response to a courting video male stimulus than did laboratory-reared males, suggesting that eavesdropping might arise as a consequence of field experience. To explore this further, we conducted associative learning studies on naive, laboratory-reared males, pairing video playback of male courtship with sensory cues indicating female presence. Results showed that males with no prior exposure learned to associate courtship of other males with cues indicating the presence of females. In subsequent video playback experiments, field-collected males recognized differences in male behaviour, responding with courtship more often and for longer periods to video stimuli of courting male spiders than to walking males or an empty leaf litter background (no spider). Additional studies showed that males spent significantly more time in courtship displays when presented with two to three live or video male stimuli simultaneously. Together, these findings confirm that male wolf spiders meet assumptions of eavesdropping behaviour, and suggest that social experience arising from exposure to courtship interactions of conspecifics may impact male eavesdropping and subsequent courtship behaviour.

AB In two experiments, we investigated whether chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, can use self-experience to infer what another sees. Subjects first gained self-experience with the visual properties of an object (either opaque or see-through). In a subsequent test phase, a human experimenter interacted with the object and we tested whether chimpanzees understood that the experimenter experienced the object as opaque or as see-through. Crucially, in the test phase, the object seemed opaque to the subject in all cases (while the experimenter could see through the one that they had experienced as see-through before), such that she had to use her previous self-experience with the object to correctly infer whether the experimenter could or could not see when looking at the object. Chimpanzees did not attribute their previous self-experience with the object to the experimenter in a gaze-following task (experiment 1); however, they did so successfully in a competitive context (experiment 2). We conclude that chimpanzees successfully used their self-experience to infer what the competitor sees. We discuss our results in relation to the well-known 'goggles experiment' and address alternative explanations. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In one of the first formulations of the social complexity hypothesis, Humphrey (1976, page 316, Growing Points in Ethology, Cambridge University Press) predicts 'that there should be a positive correlation across species between social complexity and individual intelligence'. However, in the many ensuing tests of the hypothesis, surprisingly little consideration has been given to measures of the independent variable in this evolutionary relationship, that is, social complexity. Here, we seek to encourage more rigorous measures of social complexity. We first review previous definitions of this variable and point to two common flaws; a lack of objectivity and a failure to directly connect sociality to the use of cognition. We argue that, rather than creating circularity, including cognition in the definition of social complexity is necessary for accurately testing the social complexity hypothesis. We propose a new definition of social complexity that is based on the number of differentiated relationships that individuals have. We then demonstrate that the definition is both broadly applicable and flexible, allowing researchers to include more detailed information about the degree of differentiation among individuals when the data are available. While we see this definition of social complexity as one possible way forward, our larger goal is to encourage researchers examining the social complexity hypothesis to carefully consider their measurement of social complexity.

AB To resolve the share of limited resources, animals often compete through exchange of signals about their relative motivation to compete. When two competitors are similarly motivated, the resolution of conflicts may be achieved in the course of an interactive process. In barn owls, Tyto alba, in which siblings vocally compete during the prolonged absence of parents over access to the next delivered food item, we investigated what governs the decision to leave or enter a contest, and at which level. Siblings alternated periods during which one of the two individuals vocalized more than the other. Individuals followed turn-taking rules to interrupt each other and momentarily dominate the vocal competition. These social rules were weakly sensitive to hunger level and age hierarchy. Hence, the investment in a conflict is determined not only by need and resource-holding potential, but also by social interactions. The use of turn-taking rules governing individual vocal investment has rarely been shown in a competitive context. We hypothesized that these rules would allow individuals to remain alert to one another's motivation while maintaining the cost of vocalizing at the lowest level.

AB Communication is vital to the survival and reproductive success of organisms. There is growing evidence that anthropogenic noise interferes with acoustic communication. While recent studies have tested whether signallers behaviourally modify their signals to prevent masking from noise, studies have only recently begun to test whether noise in fact interferes with the perception of acoustic signals. In this study, we investigated how road noise affects both male signalling and female phonotaxis in Oecanthus tree crickets. Acoustic signals of tree crickets, which are relatively low amplitude and composed primarily of low frequencies, are likely to be masked by road noise. To determine whether males alter their calls in the presence of road noise, we assessed how a playback of recorded road noise changed four male calling characteristics: dominant frequency, call amplitude, total time spent calling and latency to begin calling. We then used response trials to test the ability of females to localize and respond to male calls in the presence of road noise. Unlike studies in other organisms, which detected quantifiable differences in male signal characteristics, male tree crickets were less likely to call but did not change signal characteristics. Surprisingly, female response to male signals was not affected by the presence of road noise, despite the potential masking effects of road noise. Because tree crickets often communicate in environments with many species of calling insects, tree crickets may be adapted to tolerate novel sources of acoustic interference. This study presents a case where male signals and female responses are not affected by road noise. Since species are differentially affected by noise, detailed understanding of behaviour and sensory systems may be necessary for predicting the effect of acoustic interference on trophic interactions and population dynamics.

AB Colour signals play a major role in social and sexual communication in a broad range of animal species. Previous studies on nonhuman primates showed that intense female skin coloration attracts male attention. We investigated (1) whether sexually active male Japanese macaques are attracted by intensely coloured female skin, (2) whether a preference for intense skin coloration results from the increased colour contrast between the skin area and its surroundings irrespective of the red chromaticity, and (3) whether the endocrine status of sexually active males affects their attentional selectivity (or preference) for salient female sexual skin coloration. We conducted two behavioural experiments in two consecutive mating seasons. First, we presented two female face images coloured in a natural range of red skin coloration on monitors. Second, we presented the same faces dissociated from the red chromaticity while maintaining their initial colour contrast properties. In both experiments we analysed male selective visual attention and approaches as a function of stimulus type. Faecal samples were collected after each experiment to analyse focal males' cortisol and testosterone excretion rates. We found that female facial skin coloration triggered selective behaviour in social-living male Japanese macaques. Variances in colour contrast also triggered males' selective orienting towards an intensely coloured face image but the red chromaticity remained essential to induce prolonged male interest. Furthermore, elevated cortisol facilitated male preferences for the intensely coloured female faces, sociosexual stimuli that are presumably highly relevant during the mating season. Future studies may pursue the principle of colour contrast in male attentional behaviour with respect to subtle colour changes expressed by females throughout the reproductive cycle. Cortisol-related physiological processes should be considered in studies on mating-relevant selective attention. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The evolution of group living in animals has been linked both to ecological and phylogenetic drivers or constraints. However, available evidence supporting each factor remains equivocal. In this study, we evaluated the influence of both scenarios across 98 species of hystricognath rodents using phylogenetic approaches that included a statistical model of trait evolution. We first estimated the hypothetical ancestral forms of several clades within the hystricognath phylogeny. Secondly, we examined evolutionary correlations between habitat conditions in terms of vegetation cover and group living to determine general macroevolutionary trends on social behaviour. Given the contrasting modes of life that characterize these rodents, we also examined whether subterranean habits influence group living. Our results support the hypothesis that group living in Old World Phiomorpha and New World Caviomorpha had an early origin. The best-fitted and well-supported model of evolution for group living was the equal rate model, implying an equal rate of gains and losses of group living. Logistic regression analyses that included phylogenetic relationships revealed significant correlation between habitats used (i.e. vegetation cover) and absence or presence of group living. The loss of group living across the phylogeny was associated with the use of closed habitat conditions. No association was found between changes in group living and subterranean mode of life. We conclude that ancestoredescendant relationships mediate the effect of changes in habitat use on the evolution of group living across -hystricognath rodents.

AB Sperm competition theory predicts that males should allocate sperm prudently in response to perceived return on investment. It is predicted that males should invest in greater sperm stores and allocate more sperm to females in response to increased risk of sperm competition (absence versus presence of competitors), but allocate fewer sperm when intensity of sperm competition (number of competitors) is high, owing to diminishing returns. We tested these predictions in Gammarus duebeni, an amphipod with precopula mate guarding. Contrary to predictions, we found no difference in sperm allocation to females in response to increased risk or intensity of sperm competition. In addition, we observed a decrease in both sperm numbers and sperm length when males were kept with potential competitors for extended periods of time, particularly in larger males. We suggest that G. duebeni invests in mate guarding over sperm production/allocation in response to sperm competition, and we discuss whether competition for resources may also affect investment in ejaculate production.

AB Given the deleterious consequences associated with chronic stress, individual differences in stress susceptibility can have important fitness implications. These differences may be explained in part by dominance status because high rank is typically associated with decreased aggression and improved nutrition. Here, we examined the relationship between dominance and social stress in lactating chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We did so by pairing daily demographic and behavioural data with faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations collected over 37 months. While there was no main effect of rank, interesting differences emerged by adult subgroup size and adult sex ratio (males/females). We found that differences in FGM concentrations between high-and low-ranking females were most pronounced as adult subgroup size and sex ratio increased. Low-ranking females had higher FGM concentrations in larger subgroups and in subgroups biased towards adult males; we observed no comparable change in FGM concentrations amongst highranking females. Because low-ranking females were the recipient of significantly more male aggression relative to females of high rank, these patterns may be driven by psychosocial stress in low-ranking females. There was no significant change in diet quality across subgroup sizes; this finding suggests that nutritional stressors were not driving differences in female FGM concentrations. Being susceptible to social stress has important fitness implications as it may constrain low-ranking females from `choosing' optimal subgroups to take advantage of food resources and/or for the socialization of their offspring.

AB Foraging animals are expected to adapt their movement patterns to their environment in a way that maximizes efficiency. The search strategies they rely on to achieve this is an enduring question in ecology. Scale-free Levy and Brownian search strategies have received particular attention as both strategies are considered effective when prey are abundant and Levy search is thought to optimize success when prey are patchy. Environmental context has been shown to explain Levy and Brownian movement patterns for various marine predators, but potential effects of habitat structure and cognitive skills are often overlooked. We used bird-borne global positioning sensors (GPS) and temperature depth recorders (TDR) to assess flight paths and dive profiles of foraging parental common murres, Uria aalge. Movement patterns while flying and diving were best approximated by Brownian motion even though their primary prey, capelin, Mallotus villosus, are patchily distributed. Contrary to expectations, there was virtually no support for Levy flights. Further analyses revealed that murre foraging activities are not random, but are rather more deterministic. Murres repeatedly returned to previously visited sites (within similar to 2 km), indicating a role of memory, and they focused foraging activities using small-scale area restricted search (ARS; <2 km radius). Such behaviour appears to induce movement patterns that reflect the distribution of capelin. These findings highlight the efficacy of assessing deterministic search behaviour when interpreting the movement patterns of animals that may be informed about their environment.

AB Traits subject to ecologically based divergent selection that also affect nonrandom mating (i.e. 'magic traits') may hasten incipient speciation. In this study, we investigated whether nonrandom mating results from ecological divergence between swamp sparrow, Melospiza georgiana, subspecies. As a by-product of adaptive divergence in bill morphology between populations of swamp sparrows, there is a corresponding divergence in features of song shown to be salient to females, potentially providing a mechanism of reproductive isolation. Thus, female mating preferences for song could result in prezygotic isolation that prevents gene flow between subspecies. In this study we tested the hypothesis that female preferences for song provide a mechanism of reproductive isolation that limits gene flow between subspecies. Using copulation solicitation assays, we found that female coastal plain swamp sparrows showed a significant preference for consubspecific songs over heterosubspecific songs. We further tested whether mating preferences in coastal populations explain observed differences in song between subspecies. We found evidence that mating preferences in coastal females may explain the evolution of some acoustic features of song. We suggest that the bill may be an example of a 'magic trait' that contributes to continued divergence of swamp sparrow subspecies. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Faeces are a major vehicle for transmission of parasites among ungulate hosts. Avoiding feeding in proximity to faeces has been shown to be an antiparasitic strategy in experimental settings with domestic and semidomestic ungulates. However, few studies have tested the faecal avoidance hypothesis in wild herbivores. We tested the faecal avoidance hypothesis in a wild population of Alpine ibex by comparing the quantity of faeces in grazed and avoided areas. We counted faecal pellets within a plot around a grazing individual and a plot around a spot actively avoided by the same individual. As predicted, grazed plots had lower densities of faecal pellets than avoided plots. Fresh faeces were avoided more often than medium-aged and old faeces. We found consistent differences in the level of faecal avoidance among individuals, but this was not related to the level of gastrointestinal parasite infection or to the age of the host. Our results suggest that wild Alpine ibex actively avoid foraging near faeces but the antiparasitic value of this behaviour is not evident. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Anthropogenic noise can have serious implications for animals, especially when they communicate acoustically. Yet, the impacts of noise may depend not only on noise characteristics but also on an individual's coping style or personality. We tested whether noise is more disturbing if it masks communication signals, and whether characteristics of both the noise and the individual affect its impact. Using a unique population of personality-typed great tits, Parus major, we tested whether the kind of noise and parental personality affect parental nestbox visits and nestling begging. Nestboxes were exposed to automated noise playbacks, differing in spectral composition (noise masking begging calls, nonmasking noise or no noise). Parental nestbox visits were recorded using RFID transponders. Video and audio recordings were used to quantify nestling begging. Nestlings mainly begged in silence and in the presence of parents. Parents reduced nestbox visits during noise treatments regardless of the kind of noise and initially reacted more strongly to nonmasking noise. Moreover, slower explorers took longer to enter the nestbox during noise than faster explorers. Total visit rates during noise depended on parental sex and personality. In females, bolder individuals, but in males shyer individuals, reduced total visits during noise. These results extend previous findings in showing experimentally that the disturbance effects of noise do not depend on whether or not the noise directly interferes with information exchange by masking signals. Moreover, personality- and sex-specific responses to noise indicate that anthropogenic disturbance can differentially affect individuals within populations, which will influence mitigation strategies.

AB While the relationship between aggression and resource value in competitions for discrete resources is well established, the relationship between aggression and territory quality is less well understood. Territoriality imposes spatial structure on social interactions: if spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality leads to clustering of high- and low-quality territories, and if consistently more aggressive individuals are more likely to obtain higher-quality territories, the resulting clusters of territory holders of similar aggression are likely to influence a wide array of social dynamics in territorial species, particularly when aggressive behaviour is consistently associated with variation in other behaviours, such as boldness. Using 8 years of historical nesting data in a northeastern population of song sparrows, we here determine (1) whether historical nesting success (defined both as clutch size and survival) is spatially clustered; and (2) whether aggression or boldness in first-year territorial males is correlated with the historical clutch size or nest survival of each male's territory. We found significant clustering of both predation risk and large clutch sizes, even when controlling for the identities of historical territory owners. The aggressive behaviour of new territorial males was correlated with historical clutch size, but not with historical nest survival; in contrast, boldness was not correlated with either historical clutch size or nest survival. Thus, spatial variation in habitat quality is correlated with territorial aggression, but territory holders may either prioritize or be unable to assess all variables contributing to territory quality. In addition, a boldness-aggression syndrome does not necessarily result in both behaviours covarying with territory quality. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Reproductive interference includes any interspecific interaction that reduces the fitness of one or both species involved. There are several types of reproductive interference, but they normally involve the direct cost of interacting or mating with heterospecifics. An indirect cost of interacting with heterospecific individuals is a consequent reduction in successful interactions with conspecifics. We tested the hypothesis that being aggressive towards a heterospecific individual will diminish sexual responses towards conspecifics in later encounters. We used two species of Mesocricetus hamsters (Syrian and Turkish hamsters), whose interspecific interactions have previously been determined. We exposed or both exposed and paired Syrian hamster females with a conspecific or a heterospecific male. Five minutes later, we paired all females with a conspecific male and measured the latency to lordosis, the duration of lordosis and any incidence of aggression. We found that (1) interactions with heterospecific males did not affect how females responded to conspecific males in later encounters and (2) previous pairing of female subjects with either conspecific or heterospecific males promoted a faster sexual response by females in subsequent interactions with conspecific males. Thus, aggressive interactions of Syrian hamster females with heterospecific males, contrary to our initial hypothesis, had a positive effect on subsequent interactions with conspecific males.

AB The ecological and evolutionary consequences of variation in behaviour between individuals are well studied, yet the causes of such variation remain poorly understood. Parents can generally exert a great deal of influence on the early life of their offspring, so one possibility is that the mode of parental investment determines subsequent offspring behaviours. In birds, hatching asynchrony occurs when females begin incubation prior to clutch completion, and the subsequent hatching regime creates phenotypic disparities between early and late-hatched offspring. By experimentally manipulating hatching patterns in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, we examined the influence of hatching asynchrony on subsequent exploratory behaviour during adulthood. Late-hatched birds from asynchronous broods explored the novel environment more than their siblings which hatched earlier or came from synchronous broods, although there were no differences in exploratory behaviour towards a novel object. Additionally, females were bolder towards a novel object than were males, independently of hatching regime, but there were no sex differences in exploration of the novel environment. Our results support the idea that both hatching asynchrony and sex have previously underappreciated influences on offspring behaviours, and highlight the importance of variation in parental investment in generating and maintaining behavioural variation.

AB Chemical communication is used by diverse organisms in a variety of contexts and can have strong fitness consequences for the individuals involved. However, despite the extensive use of birds as models for many research areas in biology, avian olfaction has been poorly investigated. Studies on bird species that lack well-developed olfactory organs and those investigating responses to predator odours are particularly scarce. We investigated behavioural responses of the domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, a ground-living species with intermediate olfactory bulb size, to several predator and nonpredator faecal odours. We found that the birds spent less time foraging and were more vigilant when exposed to predator faecal odour compared with nonpredator faecal odour. Individuals showed a similar response when exposed to increased amounts of faeces. Taken together, our results demonstrate that domestic fowl can distinguish between herbivore and predator faecal odour, and respond to predator olfactory cues alone, without prior experience. Our results have implications for the understanding of predator-prey interactions and responses to olfactory cues in general, and for chemical communication in avian species more specifically.

   INFORMATION
AB The binding problem is the brain's fundamental challenge for advanced sensory processing: objects in the outside world possess multiple features, which must be bound into a cohesive perceptual representation. Although there is suggestive evidence that nonmammalian vertebrates (and possibly insects) may support it, this rudimentary form of sensory syntax is ascribed primarily to cortex or similarly complex avian structures. The experiments reported here provide evidence that a small vertebrate lacking cortex supports visual feature binding for social behaviour. Zebrafish, Danio rerio, displayed spontaneous preference for images of other zebrafish in which the visual attributes of form and motion were paired in a meaningful fashion, while each attribute in isolation was rendered ineffective as a cue for discrimination. The ability to conjoin the two features was robust and remarkably flexible. These results challenge the notion that feature binding may require cortical structures and demonstrate that the nervous system of small vertebrates can afford unexpectedly complex computations.

AB The harvested mangrove crab Ucides cordatus exhibits conspicuous cycles of searching for mates en masse. This phenomenon, called andada, always occurs at the syzygies, but the particular moon phase, full, new or rarely both, varies for unknown reasons. The presence and absence of andada activities of a Northeast Brazilian crab population was assessed by boat between 2006 and 2011. In 2008 crabs were additionally collected in sampling plots to determine the duration and intensity of andada events and in 2010 the timing of andada with respect to the light: dark cycle and tidal cycle was studied by observations from platforms. We found that andada occurred during the day and night and that the rhythm of mate searching was linked to the syzygy tide inequality cycle (STIC). Andada shifted between new and full moon, depending upon which moon phase had the higher amplitude tides. The ultimate cause of andada is likely to be increased larval survival after synchronous release at highest amplitude spring tides 1 month later. Such anticipatory behaviour is probably under endogenous control. The results of this study can help to improve temporal placements of capture bans for this harvested species and reduce current conflicts between fishers and regulatory agencies.

AB Site and mate fidelity are important aspects of animal mating systems and have implications for animal population structures. In birds, they are often related to the age, breeding experience, prior residence, pair duration or breeding performance of individuals. These variables are often correlated, and site and mate fidelity may also be associated with each other. Most previous studies focused on either site fidelity or mate fidelity, and the relationship between them remains to be explored. In this study, we used path analysis to examine the correlates of site and mate fidelity of Lanyu scops owls, Otus elegans botelensis, and to investigate the relationship between site and mate fidelity. Site fidelity of female owls was related to previous breeding success, following a 'win-stay, lose-switch' model. Site fidelity of male owls increased with both previous breeding success and years of prior residence. Mate fidelity was related to female site fidelity and pair duration. Although mate fidelity was higher after successful breeding attempts, it was a result of the breeding success-dependent site fidelity of the owls. Many studies used the positive correlation between previous breeding success and mate fidelity to support the better option hypothesis or the incompatibility hypothesis of divorce. Our study identified the most likely causal pathway for the complex site and mate fidelity pattern in the Lanyu scops owl, and demonstrated that it is important to identify the underlying driving forces to avoid erroneous conclusions.

ID WILD BIRDS; SURVIVAL; MIMICRY
AB A wide range of animals possess conspicuous eye-like markings on their bodies, commonly called 'eyespots'. These markings are generally thought to serve an antipredator function, particularly in lepidopteran caterpillars where eyespots may mimic the eyes of their enemies' predators. Despite this, the protective value of caterpillar eyespots remains unclear and has yet to receive empirical study. Moreover, most eyespot caterpillars are otherwise cryptically coloured, suggesting that the efficacy of eyespots may depend on additional aspects of prey coloration. We assessed the protective value of caterpillar eyespots with and without a form of countershading by pinning artificial caterpillars to tree branches in the field and monitoring their survival over 90 h. Eyespot and countershading treatments were arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial design, allowing us to quantify both main and interactive effects. We also photographed attacked prey to determine whether eyespots affected the area of the prey's body that was attacked (i.e. pecked by an avian predator). We observed no main effect of eyespots or countershading on survival; instead, countershading and eyespots acted synergistically to reduce predation, although whether this interactive effect reflects a countershading mechanism or different background matching when prey are viewed from above is unclear. Importantly, bird pecks were directed both towards eyespots and towards the body section furthest from the eyespots. This is the first field experiment to examine the protective value of eyespots on caterpillar-like prey and demonstrates that the extent of protection depends on additional factors, including body colour and possibly behaviour.

AB The behaviour of animals, particularly ectotherms, occurs in the context of daily and seasonal fluctuations in temperature and year-on-year increases in temperature associated with global climate change. Despite the importance of mating rate as a determinant of the intensity of male/female conflict over reproduction, the effects of ecological factors such as thermal environment on this process are poorly understood. We examined how temperature affects female remating rate in Drosophila melanogaster. The mating behaviour of D. melanogaster shows a circadian rhythm, and we partitioned thermal environment effects into those experienced at the point of courtship and those experienced outside courtship bouts. Temperature during and outside courtship both affected female remating rate, and did so in an approximately additive fashion. We found that female remating rate was more sensitive to thermal environment at the point of courtship than that encountered outside courtship periods. Elevation of temperature during courtship increased male courtship intensity, and we hypothesize that this directly increased a female's likelihood of remating. Our results highlight the importance of thermal conditions during and after courtship in determining mating rate in Drosophila and we discuss its implication for rates of polyandry in natural populations in terms of daily, seasonal and spatial variation, and changes that may be associated with climate change.

AB Males of the spider Pisaura mirabilis offer prey items as nuptial gifts to females. While gift giving in this species has received attention in captivity, the ecological context of these gifts remains largely unknown. First, we examine the occurrence of gift carrying by males in nature. Field data reveal that gift-carrying males are frequent in nature (40% of captured males), and that all gifts contain fresh arthropod prey. Gift mass was positively correlated with the longest diameter of the gift. Thus, males do not appear to 'cheat' by inflating their gifts with inedible items, air or loosely wrapped silk. Second, we examine two ecological costs to gift-carrying males: the effects of gifts on male running speed and male fighting success. Gift carrying reduced male running speed, but did not affect male fighting success in male-male contests. The former result is the first demonstration of a transportation cost associated with gift carrying in an arthropod. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When an individual is repeatedly observed or tested in the same context, it does not always express the same behaviour. Intraindividual variability (IIV) refers to the short-term, unpredictable, reversible variation in behaviour that often occurs in this situation. Although individual differences in IIV have been well documented in humans, this topic has been virtually ignored by researchers studying other animals. Here, we review evidence from humans and animals that IIV can vary in important ways across individuals (e.g. as a function of age or prior experience) and that individual differences in IIV may be related to differences in performance. However, most statistical models currently used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals rely on the assumption that IIV does not vary across individuals. Using 'boldness' data for hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, and Ward's damselfish, Pomacentrus wardi, we show how to measure IIV when behaviour systematically changes over a series of observations (e.g. as a result of habituation), and how to avoid the adverse effects of censored data on estimates of IIV. After controlling for systematic changes in behaviour over time, we observed strong, significant individual differences in IIV in both species. That is, some individuals were much more predictable in the same situation than were others. We conclude by discussing proximate and ultimate factors that might have contributed to interindividual variation in IIV in these species, and the implications of our findings for methods currently used to study individual differences in behaviour in animals.

AB Burst speed, a common metric of locomotor performance, is typically measured on horizontal surfaces. Studies of locomotor performance in spiders have examined vertical and horizontal locomotion, but not the effects of intermediate inclines. We measured the effect of angle of incline, body size, relative leg length (variation not explained by body size) and relative body mass (variation not explained by body size or leg length, often interpreted as 'condition') on maximum running speed in two Australian spiders differing in habitat architecture and foraging strategy. Males of a ground-dwelling jumping spider, Jacksonoides queenslandica, and an orb-web spider, Nephila plumipes, were forced to run on raceways inclined at +0 degrees, +30 degrees and +60 degrees. At the population level, maximum running speed decreased on inclined compared to level raceways for both species, but the effects of slope varied substantially between individuals. While speed was not influenced by body size or relative mass in either species, it was influenced by leg length in both. In J. queenslandica, relative leg length did not influence horizontal running speed but was positively related to speed on slopes, principally because relatively short-legged spiders were slowed whereas relatively long-legged spiders were not affected. In N. plumipes relative leg length was related negatively to running speed on horizontal surfaces but positively to running speed on slopes. Unlike J. queenslandica, N. plumipes was little affected by slopes of 30 degrees but slowed markedly on slopes of 60 degrees, irrespective of relative leg length. We suggest that performance advantages on inclines may promote relatively longer legs. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB How animals in groups coordinate their movements to produce cohesive collective patterns has been the subject of many models but remains poorly documented empirically in the field. I investigated waves of escape in flocks of a shorebird roosting on beaches to pinpoint factors that influence coordination in the initiation of group movements. In roosting flocks of semipalmated sandpipers, Calidris pusilla, the escape of a single alarmed bird triggered similar responses in nearby companions, eventually propagating through the whole flock as a wave. Among flocks, wave speed through the whole flock increased with size but decreased with density over nearly three orders of magnitude in size and density. Large flocks are attacked more often by predators, and individuals in such groups may therefore respond more quickly to the escape of companions. The negative effect of density suggests that birds escaped more slowly in denser flocks to avoid collision. This interpretation is bolstered by the fact that wave speed increased with density at the edges of the flock, where the risk of collision is reduced. Waves propagated faster at the edges of the flock than through the whole flock, suggesting a selfish herd mechanism whereby edge individuals try to avoid being left behind or overtaken by others. Findings suggest that birds can integrate a host of factors to adjust escapes in a coherent fashion very rapidly. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male fighting frequently results in the evolution of traits used as weapons. These are often coupled with correlated modifications in other somatic traits (hereafter referred to as supportive traits), which are thought to support the weapon functionally. No previous studies have investigated whether supportive traits themselves affect fighting success. We evaluated this possibility in two armed insects, the beetle Gnatocerus cornutus and the bug Riptortus pedestris. Using a principal components analysis, we identified a subset of supportive traits that were associated with weapons in both species. The patterns of supportive structures differed between the two species, probably reflecting differences in the use of weapons during fights. In both species, fighting success was higher in males with enhanced supportive traits. It appears that weapon-supportive structures develop as the result of selection that favours coordination among multiple traits associated with fighting behaviour. Thus, our results provide rare evidence of the benefit of a supportive trait that is a clear example of phenotypic integration. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social insect colonies are self-organized systems that respond to changes in environmental conditions by altering the relative proportions of certain castes or individuals engaged in specific tasks. While termites are known to regulate the ratio of morphologically specialized soldiers in response to the proportion of nestmate castes, the soldier differentiation process requires a relatively long time to be accomplished. Consequently, termites are thought to employ other plastic and flexible mechanisms for colony defence. We quantified the defensive behaviours of soldiers, pseudergates (workers) and reproductives (neotenics) of the damp-wood termite Hodotermopsis sjostedti. When individuals of the caste were exposed to an intruder, soldiers exhibited the most vigorous defensive behaviour, followed by pseudergates and then reproductives. While the aggression levels of soldiers and reproductives were independent of the accompanying castes, pseudergate aggression was more plastic and depended on the other castes present. When paired with reproductives, pseudergates exhibited high levels of aggression towards enemies. However, pseudergate aggression levels remained low when they were paired with soldiers, suggesting that pseudergates moderated their defensive behaviour depending on social context. Plasticity with respect to social behaviours may facilitate rapid and flexible responses required for colony defence. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Foraging behaviour has the potential to impact interactions among species in a community and is influenced, in part, by individual condition and fear of predation. These relationships are exemplified by white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, in mixed hardwood forest communities of the northeastern U.S.A., whose foraging behaviour can influence the population ecology of several prey items and the disease ecology of human Lyme disease and its tick vector. We examined whether dosage of an immunogen influenced foraging behaviour in wild white-footed mice at foraging arenas. Low-dose mice preferentially favoured safe (covered) food patches over risky food patches, whereas high-dose mice showed no preference based on patch safety. Immunochallenge did not alter foraging time in patches of equal risk. The results reveal fitness costs of an immune response, namely that immunochallenged mice favour increased energy consumption over safety from predation, presumably leading to greater mortality. Acceptance of risky patches for foraging by immunochallenged mice suggests that mice mounting this immune response will forage in a greater proportion of their home ranges and encounter a greater number of patchily distributed prey items and ticks carrying pathogens.

AB Birdsong is an important model in the study of evolutionary processes. Vocal amplitude, a song trait that has received little attention to date, varies considerably between individuals, and this variation is important in both female choice and male-male competition. To understand the function of a trait, it is often insightful to look at its origin and ontogeny. Like human speech, birdsong is a learned behaviour, and song amplitude may be adopted from the tutor during vocal ontogeny. However, vocal amplitude may also be bound to song phonetics owing to production constraints. We addressed these ideas with song-learning experiments in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, a widely used species in vocal-learning studies. The songs of young males were compared to the songs of their genetic fathers and to those of their tutors. We found that the amplitude of tutee song elements was strongly related to the tutor element amplitude, indicating that amplitude is affected by song learning. Therefore, song amplitude could be learned and/or be related to the acoustic structure of song elements owing to production constraints. In line with the latter hypothesis, element amplitude varied with structural element properties (duration and pitch). Mean element amplitude of the genetic father was not related to tutee element amplitude and our heritability estimates of song amplitude were not significant (but statistical power was low). Our findings indicate that the ontogenetic development of adult song amplitude is based on interplay between vocal production learning and physiological constraints.

AB Dip listening refers to our ability to catch brief 'acoustic glimpses' of speech and other sounds when fluctuating background noise levels momentarily decrease. Exploiting dips in natural fluctuations of noise contributes to our ability to overcome the 'cocktail party problem' of understanding speech in multitalker social environments. We presently know little about how nonhuman animals solve analogous communication problems. Here, we asked whether female grey treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis, might benefit from dip listening in selecting a mate in the noisy social setting of a breeding chorus. Consistent with a dip-listening hypothesis, subjects recognized conspecific calls at lower thresholds when the dips in a chorus-like noise masker were long enough to allow glimpses of nine or more consecutive pulses. No benefits of dip listening were observed when dips were shorter and included five or fewer pulses. Recognition thresholds were higher when the noise fluctuated at a rate similar to the pulse rate of the call. In a second experiment, advertisement calls comprising six to nine pulses were necessary to elicit responses under quiet conditions. Together, these results suggest that in frogs, the benefits of dip listening are constrained by neural mechanisms underlying temporal pattern recognition. These constraints have important implications for the evolution of male signalling strategies in noisy social environments. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Males of the plant bug Lygus hesperus prefer to court virgins over recently mated females. Because a male delivers a large spermatophore mass to the female during copulation that contains more than just sperm, we investigated whether males transferred an odorant molecule rendering females less attractive. We found that topical application of homogenates of the spermatophore, or of the male accessory glands (AG) from which this mass is derived, made virgin females less acceptable as potential mates. Additionally, we found that the fatty molecule myristyl acetate is present in male accessory glands and in the seminal receptacles of recently mated females, but is absent in virgin females. The same distribution of myristyl acetate was also found in Lygus elisus and Lygus lineolaris. We hypothesized that myristyl acetate has a repellent effect on L. hesperus males seeking an appropriate mate. Using topically applied synthetic myristyl acetate at biological concentrations, we found that myristyl acetate was as effective as the AG homogenate at reducing the attractiveness of virgin females. Collectively these results indicate that males use myristyl acetate as a seminally transferred antiaphrodisiac for passive mate guarding, and usage of the compound may be widespread among Lygus bug species.

AB The formation of waves is a vivid example of collective behaviour occurring in insects, birds, fish and mammals, which has been interpreted as an antipredator response. In birds a quantitative characterization of this phenomenon, involving thousands of individuals, is missing and its link with predation remains elusive. We studied waves in flocks of starlings, a highly gregarious species, by both direct observation and quantitative computer vision analysis of HD video recordings, under predation by peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus. We found that waves originated from the position of the attacking predator and always propagated away from it. We measured their frequency and velocities, the latter often being larger than the velocity of the flock. A high positive correlation was found between the formation of waves and reduced predation success. We suggest that the tendency of a prey to escape, when initiated even by a few individuals in a cohesive group, elicits self-organized density waves. Such evident fluctuations in the local structure of the flocks are efficient in confusing predators. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Females often base their mate selection on multiple male traits. Different cues may be weighted differently in mating decisions, and play different roles such as indicating species identity or condition. The ontogeny of preferences for each cue can differ, which may offer a proximate explanation for the differential female evaluation of multimodal traits of males. We investigated whether female preferences for the multimodal male cues of Xiphophorus birchmanni swordtails are learned for traits in both olfactory and visual sensory modalities. We reared X. birchmanni females with either conspecific adults or adults of a closely related species, Xiphophorus malinche. We found that both olfactory and visual preferences were learned, and that the timing of olfactory learning was different from that of visual cues.

AB Whether learning plays a role in nest building in birds is largely unknown. Here we investigated whether the colour of nest materials used to build a first nest affected the subsequent nest material choices made by male zebra finches when building a second nest. Males were tested for their preference for green or brown nest material and then were provided with either their preferred or nonpreferred colour with which to build their first nest. The success of this nesting attempt was manipulated such that half of the breeding pairs had their eggs removed, while the other half were allowed to keep their eggs and fledge chicks. Males were then retested to determine which colour of nest material they now preferred. Males had strong initial preferences for one or other of the two colours of nest material. Males that built a nest with their preferred colour of nest material continued to prefer that colour after nesting, regardless of their breeding success in that nest. However, of the males that built a nest with material of their nonpreferred colour, those that raised and fledged chicks from it subsequently preferred that colour of material for their second nest, while males that suffered a failed breeding attempt did not. Thus breeding experience can influence decisions relating to nest material choice in nest construction in the zebra finch. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A rich theoretical framework exists for understanding animal conflict. When two opponents fight over a resource, the duration, intensity and outcome of the fight ought to be determined in large part by the relative difference in resource-holding power between contestants. While our understanding of onetime conflict resolution is excellent, our knowledge is still limited of how these rules scale up when contests occur in a social context where individuals have long-term interactions. Here, we use a convenient model system, Neolamprologus pulcher, a small cooperatively breeding cichlid fish, to explore decisions in pairwise contests over resources in a species where two individual contestants are likely to remain in the same social group, and regularly and repeatedly interact. Contests began after approximately 1 min, with a short display phase, and continued in an aphasic manner for an average of 10 min before a clear winner emerged. Information about opponents' body size was important when deciding on the giving-up point, but contestants' own body size was not, suggesting that assessment of opponent size is paramount in contest decision making. No sex differences were detected in contest structure, duration or intensity, and contests between males or between females were indistinguishable. These results offer an important window on conflict in a cooperative breeder and shed insight on rules of engagement within hierarchical social groups.

Spider orb webs are an example of a flexible foraging trait in a predator, as web architectural components vary in response to exposure to different prey types and prey traits. The cues used by orb web spiders to initiate changes in web architecture are not known. Current research predicts that prey nutrients and vibratory stimuli are potential candidates, but how they combine to affect spider foraging decisions is not clear. We performed experiments exposing the giant wood spider, Nephila pilipes, to different prey nutrients and vibratory stimuli. Spiders were fed either large profitable prey with high kinetic energy (crickets) or small prey with low kinetic energy (flies). In two treatments the prey nutrients and vibratory cues came from live prey, but in the other two treatments spiders received dead crickets with webs stimulated by flies and vice versa. The spiders fed on live flies built larger webs with more radii that were less stiff and had greater vibration damping. These web characteristics did not differ between the other three treatment groups. Our results show that in the absence of nutrient and vibratory cues from profitable prey, spiders alter their web architecture to build webs better able to capture the less profitable prey at a cost of more material investment, greater web visibility and reduced vibratory signal clarity.

AB Predatore-prey interactions are regulated by the ability of individuals to detect, and then approach or avoid, each other. In visually guided organisms, the prevalent view is that predators have large binocular visual fields and high acuity, whereas prey have wide lateral areas and low acuity, which could affect vigilance behaviour. We characterized the configuration of the visual system (visual fields, retinal topography, visual acuity) and vigilance behaviour (head movement rate) of two ground-foraging avian prey (white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys, California towhee, Pipilo crissalis) with laterally placed eyes. We found that the binocular field of both species (45 degrees) was actually wider than those of some of their avian predators. Both species also had a single retinal specialization (high ganglion cell density area) located in the centro-temporal sector of the retina, which projected into the lateral and frontal part of the head. Wide binocular fields may increase binocular contrast to detect and visually guide the bill towards prey items. Both species had wider lateral visual fields and faster head movement rates than some of their predators, probably to enhance detection and visual tracking of predators. California towhees made faster sideways movements of the head than did white-crowned sparrows, probably to cover visual space more quickly with their retinal specialization because of the comparatively lower spatial resolution of their retinal periphery. Alternatively, California towhees might move their heads more rapidly to monitor for potential risks (e. g. competitors, predators), as they rely mostly on personal information because of their degree of territoriality. Our findings suggest that the visual system and vigilance behaviour of these two avian prey species combine traits to enhance predator detection through large visual coverage and fast head movements, but also to enhance food detection at close range through enhanced binocular vision. 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A central question in social evolution is what processes regulate the number of breeders in each social group. Here, we tested whether differences in the rate of acceptance of new queens by resident workers could be a proximate cause explaining the coexistence of single- and multiple-queen colonies in an ant population. We found that Formica selysi workers discriminated against foreign (non-nestmate) queens, which contributes to maintaining the genetic integrity of the social group essential to kin selection. All the young and newly mated foreign queens introduced into experimental groups of workers died within 48 h. In contrast, workers frequently accepted young newly mated nestmate queens. The survival of nestmate queens was not significantly lower in groups of workers originating from single- queen colonies than in groups of workers originating from multiple-queen colonies. Finally, virgin queens had significantly higher survival than mated queens. Together, these results show that the maintenance of single-queen and multiple-queen colonies in the same population is unlikely to be caused by strong differences between the two types of colonies in their rate of acceptance of new queens by workers. They also suggest that the discrimination of queens by resident workers restricts the dispersal of foreign queens among colonies, but not the acceptance of additional nestmate queens.

AB We studied the dynamics of paw preference learning in unbiased symmetrical test chambers where mice, Mus musculus, could freely choose which paw to use. When compared to nonlearner model mice, three strains exhibited different degrees of learning within and between two training sessions 1 week apart. While paw preference was probabilistic, positive autocorrelation between paw choices made by individual mice in a training session showed that bias in paw preference changed gradually with successive paw reaches and was concordant between sessions. Within a session, the degree of positive autocorrelation between consecutive paw choices differed between strains and decreased faster with increasing lag between reaches in stronger than in weak learners, suggesting that the degree of learning is the genetic variable in mice. We propose that strong biases in individual mice result from weak biases that appear by chance early in training and increase by a positive feedback mechanism because of learning during training. This explains how individual mice of each strain were strongly biased when there was almost no bias at the population level. The decrease in autocorrelation with lag shows that constitutive behaviours play a minor role and, hence, paw preference can adapt to environmental changes. We conclude that paw preference learning in mice is genetically dependent on past experience, changes gradually within training sessions, and is based on short-term memory; it also has long-term effects, provided there is time for memory consolidation.

AB Nonreproductive workers of many eusocial Hymenoptera 'police' the colony, that is, they attack reproductive sister workers or destroy their eggs (unfertilized; developing into haploid males). Several ultimate causes of policing have been proposed, including (1) an increase in colony productivity, applicable if reproductive workers work less, or (2) an increase in worker-to-male relatedness, applicable if within-colony relatedness is low. To explain the distribution of policing across taxa, the explanatory power of these and other potential ultimate causes should be assessed separately. One of the few species for which this can be done is the leafcutter ant Acromyrmex echinatior. We previously demonstrated that colony productivity incentives (and sex ratio incentives) are minimal here, while relatedness incentives are strong because queens are highly multiply mated. Overcoming technical difficulties peculiar to leafcutter ants, we introduced reproductive versus nonreproductive workers and batches of queen-laid versus worker-laid eggs into experimental colony fragments and observed their fate. Our main finding was that workers policed by selectively destroying worker-laid eggs, but without attacking reproductive workers. We infer that relatedness incentives are the most likely ultimate cause of the evolutionary maintenance of worker-egg policing in A. echinatior.

AB In birds, parent-offspring recognition is crucial for directed parental care, and is often based on acoustic cues. The strength and the time of onset of this recognition process depend on ecological factors that constrain parental care. For instance, parent-offspring recognition generally appears earlier in nidifugous than in nidicolous species. We investigated whether fledglings in a nidicolous species, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, recognize their parents and the fate of this recognition process once the parents had stopped their food provisioning. Zebra finches are gregarious passerines that provide parental care to chicks up to 20 days after fledging. In playback experiments, fledglings preferentially responded to parental calls over other adult calls and thus recognized both their father's and mother's distance calls. However, at 2 months, motivation to respond to parental and other adult calls became sex specific, with sons no longer reacting preferentially to their father's calls, whereas daughters did. This pattern may be linked to the development of sexual traits and mate-searching behaviours. The persistence of parent recognition at the age of pair formation may also be of critical importance during mate choice. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The risk and intensity of sperm competition can influence male adaptations that ultimately affect male fertilization success, for example investment in sperm production and strategic sperm allocation patterns. Previous studies have examined male behavioural responses to variation in immediate levels of sperm competition. Here we quantified the evolutionary responses of male adaptations resulting from long-term manipulation of the level of sperm competition. By varying the adult sex ratio of populations of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, we successfully altered the frequency of male and female copulations, and thus the level of sperm competition experienced by males. As predicted by theory, males evolving under higher levels of sperm competition increased investment in sperm production and differed in their sperm allocation patterns across matings, compared to males evolving under intermediate and low levels of sperm competition. However, we found no evidence for trade-offs between ejaculate components, or between total sperm production and male body size in this species.

AB Consensus decisions about the nature and timing of group activities allow animals to maintain group cohesiveness, but also entail costs because individuals often differ with respect to their optimal activity budgets. Two mechanisms whereby animals reach a consensus include 'consistent leadership', in which a single dominant individual makes the decision, and 'variable leadership' in which several group members contribute to the decision outcome. Sharing of consensus decisions is expected to reduce consensus costs to most group members. Both patterns are thought to emerge from the complexity of social relationships of group members. We investigated the distribution of leadership during group departures in two packs of free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris, and tested how its distribution between individuals was affected by dominance rank-related affiliative and agonistic relationships. Although leadership was not entirely concentrated on a single group member, both packs had a limited number of habitual leaders. In the largest pack, the pattern of leadership changed from 'variable' to nearly 'consistent' after its size had shrunk. Habitual leaders were usually old and high-ranking individuals. However, high-ranking dogs that received affiliative submissions in greeting ceremonies were more likely to lead than dominant dogs receiving submissions only in agonistic contexts. During resting times, habitual followers associated more closely with habitual leaders than with other followers.

AB Reproductive interference between species with incomplete mate recognition can disrupt the process of mate acquisition. Accordingly, reproductive interference can reduce female and male fitness and lead to sexual exclusion. Here, we tested the hypothesis that flexible mating behaviours could mitigate the fitness-reducing effects of reproductive interference between reproductively incompatible biotypes of the haplodiploid whitefly Bemisia tabaci. We show that females of the globally distributed and invasive B biotype respond to reproductive interference from the Q biotype by increasing their acceptance of copulation attempts from B males. This behavioural plasticity increases the ability of B females to mate successfully and maintain a constant sex ratio in their offspring despite reproductive interference. In contrast, females of competing biotypes have invariant behaviour and produce fewer female offspring because of reproductive interference from the B biotype. Heuristic simulation models incorporating data on behavioural and life history traits of the B and Q biotypes obtained here, and published data on other biotypes, show that this plasticity in mating behaviour of B females could contribute to sexual exclusion of closely related biotypes. Our results demonstrate a powerful link between mating behaviour, reproductive interference and sexual exclusion, suggesting that variation in mating behaviour could determine the effects of reproductive interference and drive sexual exclusion among closely related species or among biotypes of a species.

AB The way in which prey animals respond to predators is crucial in shaping direct and indirect interactions in ecosystems. Here, we investigated how a change in turbidity would affect the ability of fathead minnows to recognize potential predators. Minnows were taught to recognize the sight of predatory brown trout and were subsequently tested for their responses to brown trout, rainbow trout or yellow perch in either clear or turbid conditions. In clear water, minnows exhibited an antipredator response towards the brown trout, but they also generalized their recognition to a novel rainbow trout. In turbid water, however, the responses of minnows towards brown trout were lessened and they did not exhibit an antipredator response to the sight of a rainbow trout. None of the minnows displayed a response upon presentation of yellow perch. These results indicate that turbidity alters the quality and quantity of visual information received by the minnows, eliminating their ability to generalize learned recognition of some predators.

AB In the parthenogenetic ant Platythyrea punctata policing behaviour is not expected on relatedness grounds as workers are normally clonemates and thus equally related to all offspring in the colony. Nevertheless, colonies usually contain only a single reproductive and other workers that begin to lay eggs are attacked by their nestmates ('policing'). We found that those individuals that most actively engaged in policing later themselves had activated ovaries when the old reproductive was removed from the colonies. This suggests that police workers, through attacking and eliminating others, increase their own chances of becoming reproductive themselves. Because regular parthenogenesis leads to a clonal colony structure, individuals are not expected to invest energy in dominance and policing. On the assumption that physical dominance reflects an individual's reproductive potential, aggression among workers might ensure that the most fecund individual becomes the next reproductive, which would benefit the colony as a whole. Furthermore, aggression among nestmates may be maintained in this species despite predominant clonality, because infrequent sex, recombination or the adoption of alien workers may introduce genetic heterogeneity into the colony.

AB Homosexual mounting is a common behaviour in bed bugs as male sexual interest is directed towards any newly fed individual. The only mode of copulation in the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, is by traumatic insemination, where the male pierces the female abdomen with his needle-like penis. Homosexual mating would result in abdominal injuries in mounted males, as males lack the female counteradaptive spermalege structure. I here show that bed bug alarm pheromones, previously hypothesized to be a predator chemical defence, can be used by newly fed males to signal their sex and reduce the risk of homosexual mating. Mechanical blocking of the male pheromone glands significantly increased homosexual mounting duration compared to control males, while applying male extracts containing mainly alarm pheromone onto male-female mating pairs completely interrupted or shortened mating duration and reduced sperm transfer. Males confined with other males received piercing scars, demonstrating that homosexual mating occurs. The focal males in the all-male confinement experiment had reduced longevity compared to singly held males, but why this reduction in longevity occurred is not clear. Mounted males thus benefit from being able to discharge alarm pheromones, while mounting males consider the alarm signal a major sex identification cue, suggesting that male bed bugs use alarm pheromone communication to avoid homosexual harassment and mounting.

AB Mirror usage has been taken to indicate some degree of awareness in animals. Can pigs, Sus scrofa, obtain information from a mirror? When put in a pen with a mirror in it, young pigs made movements while apparently looking at their image. After 5 h spent with a mirror, the pigs were shown a familiar food bowl, visible in the mirror but hidden behind a solid barrier. Seven out of eight pigs found the food bowl in a mean of 23 s by going away from the mirror and around the barrier. Naive pigs shown the same looked behind the mirror. The pigs were not locating the food bowl by odour, did not have a preference for the area where the food bowl was and did not go to that area when the food bowl was visible elsewhere. To use information from a mirror and find a food bowl, each pig must have observed features of its surroundings, remembered these and its own actions, deduced relationships among observed and remembered features and acted accordingly. This ability indicates assessment awareness in pigs. The results may have some effects on the design of housing conditions for pigs and may lead to better pig welfare.

AB Some spiders build conspicuous silk decorations, or stabilimenta, on their orb webs. The decorations are thought to function as visual signals, and there is evidence to support both prey attraction and predator defence hypotheses. This study was designed to test both hypotheses simultaneously in Cyclosa argenteoalba by examining whether spiders change web decorations according to perceived levels of prey availability and predation risk. Spiders built their webs with more thread when prey was experimentally supplied, but with less thread when exposed to the vibrating tuning fork that mimicked the wing beat of flying insect predators. The results indicate that spiders invest more in foraging activity in the presence of available prey, but invest less in response to perceived high levels of predation risk. Web decoration, on the other hand, was only affected by the perceived level of predation risk and not prey availability. Spiders built longer decorations when exposed to the tuning fork vibrations. The results indicate that silk decoration has a predator defence function, but not a prey attraction function in C. argenteoalba. They also suggest that orb web decoration by C. argenteoalba does not involve a trade-off between deterring predators and being avoided by prey.

AB The 'many-wrongs principle' predicts that animal group cohesion can cause groups to navigate more accurately than singletons. Recent theoretical work using individual-based simulations and several empirical studies of bird flock behaviour support this principle. However, for real animal groups it remains unclear what key factors are involved and whether group cohesion alone can act to produce the effect. We tested model predictions using human participants in a large circular arena. They were tested alone and in groups of two, three, six and 10, in three trials. For each trial, individuals were instructed to stay together and approach a preset but unmarked target on the arena perimeter. The target instruction included a degree of directional uncertainty of 22.5 degrees, 67.5 degrees or 112.5 degrees. Individual directional uncertainty was equal for each group member within a trial, but differed between trials. As expected, we found that groups comprising individuals with lower directional uncertainty navigated more accurately. Group navigational accuracy increased with group size but only between singletons and groups of 10 and only when individuals had a high directional uncertainty of 112.5 degrees. This study provides evidence in human groups that group cohesion can increase navigational accuracy but that this effect is restricted to larger group sizes and when individual directional uncertainty is high.

AB Eyespots have evolved in many lepidopteran insects, which suggests their adaptive value. One of their hypothesized functions is that predators are intimidated by prey with large and conspicuous eyespots and hence refrain from attacking them. Recent experiments have shown that a combination of eyespots and intimidating behaviour can increase survival. We tested whether the mere presence of conspicuous eyespots can thwart attacking birds, that is, when the eyespots are displayed constantly, without any intimidating behaviour. We used prey that consisted of wings of the peacock pansy butterfly, Junonia almana, glued onto a piece of cardboard so as to resemble a butterfly with its wings open. A mealworm was placed between the wings in place of the body. Great tits, Parus major, were used as the predator in the study and were offered a choice between two model prey, one with intact eyespots and one without. Prey with eyespots were attacked significantly fewer times than those without. The time between the first and second attack was longer when the prey without eyespots was attacked first. These results support the hypothesis that naturally occuring butterfly eyespots can increase survival even when they are constantly displayed and motionless.

AB Sperm production carries costs and males frequently tailor their ejaculates to maximize their reproductive success. Previous work shows that males are sensitive to variation in female quality, and to the risk and intensity of sperm competition, and adjust their ejaculates accordingly. Males and females of many species are sensitive to the relatedness of their mating partners and may forego mating with related individuals altogether to avoid the costs of inbreeding. In addition, in polyandrous species, females can potentially invoke postcopulatory mechanisms to avoid using related males' sperm, but to date no study has demonstrated that males also discriminate against related females at the level of the gamete. In this study on the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, males provided unrelated females with more fertile and nonfertile sperm than their sisters. These results indicate that male moths can minimize the potential costs of inbreeding by carefully managing their limited sperm supplies in relation to partner relatedness.

AB In mixed-species foraging flocks of forest birds, one or a few nuclear species frequently produce alarm calls and are followed by other species in the flock. We tested the hypothesis that similar asymmetries may exist in a second interspecific social context, multispecies mobbing behaviour. We examined mobbing behaviour evoked by an eastern screech-owl, Megascops asio, model and playback in two nuclear species, Carolina chickadees, Poecile carolinensis, and tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor, and in a species that follows them, the white-breasted nuthatch, Sitta carolinensis. Asymmetries in mobbing were not the same as those in mixed-species flocks. Nuthatches and chickadees mobbed with greater frequency and intensity compared to titmice, which remained at greater distances from the owl model and vocalized less frequently. We also tested for the existence and nature of potential interspecific vocal information flow during mobbing. Chickadee and nuthatch calling rates were positively correlated, as were chickadee and titmouse calling rates. Nuthatches and titmice rarely mobbed simultaneously. These results suggest the existence of positive feedback among species' mobbing intensity during a multispecies mobbing association as opposed to heterospecific vocal interference or a lack of heterospecific influence. However, randomization simulations showed that this positive feedback was not driven by a particular 'nuclear' species during mobbing, suggesting that the correlations may result from a mutually interdependent escalation of mobbing intensity.

AB One of the classic studies in animal behaviour is that by Niko Tinbergen on the stimuli that elicit begging behaviour in young herring gull, Larus argentatus, chicks. Tinbergen examined which features of the beak induced chicks to peck by using various cardboard models of herring gull heads in different shapes and colours. Leiden University, home university to Tinbergen at the time, still has a summarizing overview of the data of the initial experiment of the study. In that experiment, models with a yellow beak with patches in various colours and different positions were presented to young chicks. In this essay, I relate those earliest data to the various publications in which Tinbergen discussed them over the years. Subsequent publications became more and more detached from the original data, resulting in sizeable discrepancies between the original study and later descriptions of when and how the experiment was done and its outcome. I first sketch the scientific context of the herring gull study. Next I present the original data and document the subsequent changes. I discuss what might have led Tinbergen to modify his account of the study over the years, relating it both to its historical context and to the issue of 'expectancy biases'.

AB Caddisfly larvae secrete silk to line the inner walls of their portable cases to create smooth surfaces that enhance their respiratory efficiency. In this study, Goera japonica Banks larvae were allowed to repair their portable cases using artificial mineral particles with different surface textures to compare the conformation and quantity of silk secreted on the inner case surface. Three types of particles with different surface roughness were used in the experiments; surface roughness was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Particle selection experiments were conducted for every possible pairing of the three particle types. Thick silk layers were secreted on cases built using rough particles, hardly any silk layers on cases built using smooth particles and brindled thin silk layers were deposited over intermediate particles. The mean silk secretion rate was much higher (244%) with rough particles than with smooth ones, while the rate was somewhat higher (60%) with intermediate particles. In addition, smooth particles were strongly preferred to rough particles, while smooth particles were slightly more preferable than intermediate particles. These results suggest that G. japonica larvae preferred particles with smoother surfaces as case-building materials, because silk production can be decreased as surface texture becomes smoother. Also, there may be a trade-off between the costs of material selection and silk secretion for case construction by caddisfly larvae; saving energy by secreting less silk on smoother particles allows more energy to be spent on selecting smoother particles or on other activities.

AB Morphology may affect behavioural performance through a direct, physical link or through indirect, secondary mechanisms. Although some evidence suggests that the bill morphology of songbirds directly constrains vocal performance, bill morphology may influence vocal performance through indirect mechanisms also, such as one in which morphology influences foraging and thus the ability to perform some types of vocal behaviour. This raises the possibility for ecologically induced variation in the relationship between morphology and behaviour. To investigate this, I used an information theoretic approach to examine the relationship between bill morphology and several measures of vocal performance in Lincoln's sparrows. I compared this relationship between two breeding seasons that differed markedly in ambient temperatures, phenology of habitat maturation and food abundance. I found a strong curvilinear relationship between bill shape (height/width) and vocal performance in the seemingly less hospitable season but not in the other, leading to a difference between seasons in the population's mean vocal performance. Currently, I do not know the cause of this annual variation. However, it could be due to the effects of bill shape on foraging and therefore on time budget, energy balance, or some other behavioural or physiological response that manifests mostly under difficult environmental conditions or, alternatively, to associations between male quality and both vocal performance and bill shape. Regardless of the cause, these results suggest the presence of an indirect, ecologically mediated link between morphology and behavioural performance, leading to annual variation in the prevailing environment of acoustic signals.

AB Provisioning visits by helpers are normally assumed to confer positive fitness effects on nestlings, but few studies have actually examined the nutritional value of items helpers fed to offspring. In the cooperatively breeding bell miner, Manorina melanophrys, helpers deliver large proportions of 'lerp', a sugary secretion of psyllids (Hemiptera; Psyllidae). Although lerp is a major food type of adults, its nutritional value is uncertain, especially since nestlings in other nectarivorous species are usually fed only protein-rich arthropods. Helpers in this system are predominantly male and are often unrelated to broods they aid, suggesting helping might be a sexual display, with any nutritional benefits to nestlings being of secondary importance. Detailed observations revealed that the proportion of lerp delivered increased with nestling age, but that it did not differ between helpers and parents, or between related and unrelated helpers. Variation in delivered biomass (lerp+arthropods) had a positive effect on nestling condition, but variation in the proportion of prey constituted by lerp had no measurable effect on nestling mass or condition. Finally, the total amount of food, nestling body mass and condition were all positively related to the number of helpers provisioning broods. These results are consistent with helping in bell miners operating as cooperative investment in brood fitness. Given that lerp was as effective as invertebrate prey in promoting growth, these results also suggest a valid nutritional role for this easily procured food, presumably facilitated by the unusually early development of nestling digestive tracts to utilize these simple sugars.

AB Patterns of group social structure are often linked to the competitive regime within a social unit and to the availability of kin. In line with this, many studies have shown that the dispersing sex, which is considered to have fewer kin around, is less social, while the philopatric sex has strong social bonds. Chimpanzees were considered to fit well into this scheme with highly social and competing philopatric males and generally asocial and solitary dispersing females. However, recent data suggest that chimpanzee females can indeed be highly social, even though they are unlikely to be related to each other. We studied female sociality in a long-term habituated group living in the Tai Forest, Cote d'Ivoire. Female social relationships as measured by association and grooming preferences were well differentiated and long lasting. Association (and to a lesser extent grooming) bonds were associated with reduced aggression between social partners. In addition, the competitive regime as indicated by group size had a strong effect on female social networks, which were more centralized and less clustered in smaller groups, suggesting that competition may play a major role in shaping female chimpanzee sociality. These findings suggest that strong social bonds can occur even in the absence of a strong network of kin relationships. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Males of many songbird species use song repertoires that contain multiple song types. A commonly encountered evolutionary explanation for this trait and its recurrent appearance among songbird species is that repertoires have arisen in response to widespread female preference for mates with larger song or syllable repertoires. To assess whether the available evidence supports this hypothesis, we reviewed the literature on the relationship between mate choice and song repertoire size. Our review revealed an array of results that was ultimately inconclusive with regard to the generality of the mate choice hypothesis. Given the ambiguity of these results, we also examined patterns of song use and development and found that some patterns ( e. g. overproduction during song ontogeny, repertoires of non-interchangeable songs, hidden repertoires and the prevalence of small repertoires) are at odds with outcomes expected if female preference for larger repertoires were common. We conclude that these cross-species patterns of song use suggest that female preference for larger repertoires is not widespread. We propose that song repertoires have generally arisen not through selection for repertoire size per se, but rather as a by-product of social conditions that favoured the evolution of complex signalling systems.

AB In lek mating systems, sexual selection is thought to operate through two main mechanisms: endurance rivalry and female choice. We investigated the role of these mechanisms in explaining variation in male mating success in a typical lekking anuran, the Italian treefrog, Hyla intermedia. The results suggested that both chorus attendance and calling quality may affect male mating success, and that selection on these traits may indirectly result in selection for males with higher-than-average body condition. Both generalized linear models (GLM) and cubic-spline regressions (CSR) showed a monotonic relationship between mating success and chorus attendance, suggesting open-ended directional selection on male chorus tenure. GLMs on call acoustic properties showed a significant association of mating success with several highly intercorrelated call temporal properties (i.e. call rate, pulse rate and call duration), but not with call spectral properties. In both cases, however, CSRs provided evidence that the relationships of the call properties with mating success are unimodal, with peaks close to ( spectral properties) or above (temporal properties) the population means. As often observed in anurans, chorus attendance explained much more variation in mating success than did calling quality. However, contrary to what is often assumed, we argue that the important role of endurance rivalry does not reduce, but rather emphasizes, the role of female choice in sexual selection.

AB Information on the phenotypic correlates of male reproductive success can provide important insights into the operation of sexual selection, and the nature of evolutionary forces on phenotypic traits such as male body size. We combined results from a long-term mark-recapture field study with genetic analyses for identifying paternity of offspring to quantify male reproductive success in a colubrid snake species from tropical Australia. Because previous work has shown that male slatey-grey snakes, Stegonotus cucullatus, attain larger body sizes than do conspecific females, we predicted that larger males would have higher reproductive success. Our paternity assignments of 219 offspring ( 24 clutches) supported this prediction: larger males fathered more offspring, not because they obtained more matings, but because they fathered a higher proportion of offspring within the clutches to which they did contribute. Multiple paternity was common ( mean of 2.3 fathers per clutch, range 1-5). Our results demonstrate the utility of molecular approaches to clarify mating systems in field populations of snakes, and suggest that the evolution of extreme male-biased sexual size dimorphism in this species is attributable to enhanced reproductive success afforded by larger body size in males.

AB Crayfish form social hierarchies through aggressive dyadic interactions. During hierarchy formation, individual crayfish emerge as dominants or subordinates, and continue to express status-specific behaviours once the hierarchy has stabilized. We found that by briefly introducing a single larger crayfish to a pair of juvenile crayfish with established social ranks, the dominance relationship between the initial pair was quickly disrupted and reversals of ranks were common. The intruder crayfish repeatedly defeated both opponents, and, after the intruder was removed, initial subordinates emerged as new dominants and former dominants became new subordinates in half of all pairs. Dominance relationships always remained stable over the entire observation period in control pairs without intruders. Our results show that social status in crayfish is a highly transient and reversible condition. Since agonistic encounters with changing opponents are commonly observed under natural conditions, subordinate crayfish will have numerous recurrent opportunities to gain more preferred social status and dominant crayfish may only hold preferred status for brief periods. Thus, stability of social status depends on social context, and the negative and positive consequences associated with different social ranks may be less permanent than previously assumed.

AB Social grooming is a commonly observed affiliative behaviour in primates. Grooming has been suggested to represent a service in a biological marketplace, exchanged either for grooming or for other social commodities or services. Accordingly, grooming is predicted to be approximately reciprocated within a dyad when no other services are being exchanged, but it should be more asymmetrical if partners have different quantities of other services to offer. We analysed 412 grooming bouts observed in four groups of free-ranging redfronted lemurs to test this prediction. Grooming in this species seems to take place in a highly reciprocal manner because partners usually alternate in the roles of groomer and gromee within a grooming bout. However, within dyads there were asymmetries in the duration of grooming given and received. In both sexes, more grooming was directed from low-ranking towards high-ranking individuals than vice versa, and in males this asymmetry became more pronounced as the number of subordinates per group increased. Grooming in bisexual dyads was generally skewed in favour of males, but patterns of grooming between the sexes were less clear than within the sexes. In addition, aggression occurred at high frequencies between classes of individuals that were characterized by nonreciprocal grooming, suggesting that grooming may serve as a means to reduce aggression in dyads with a high potential for conflicts. Taken together, our results indicate that a strict reciprocation of grooming can be offset by power differentials between partners, where grooming appears to be traded by subordinates in exchange for the tolerance of dominants.

AB Choosing a mate to maximize fitness underlies all sexual selection theories. Key to understanding mate choice is the inheritance of particular traits. Using family photos, we evaluated the predictions made by sexual selection theories for human mate choice concerning the inheritance of facial characteristics and assortment in facial appearance of parents. We found that both fathers' and mothers' attractiveness predicted the facial attractiveness of daughters: 'sexy daughters'. Fathers and sons were related to each other in facial masculinity but not attractiveness, providing only partial evidence for 'sexy sons'. Mothers and sons did not relate in masculinity-femininity; neither did fathers and daughters. Parents were similar in attractiveness but masculine men were not partnered to feminine women. Our findings support some predictions of Fisherian selection processes and 'good genes' theory but are less consistent with 'correlated response theory' and the immunocompetence handicap principle.

AB In chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, females transfer from their natal group shortly after sexual maturity to permanently join another group. A conflict of interest exists between female and male residents over the immigration of new females: additional females increase female feeding competition but provide new mating opportunities for males. Resident females express their interests by directing high rates of aggression towards immigrants, and males could protect their interests by intervening in these conflicts. We studied the Kanyawara chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda over 10.5 years to assess whether (1) resident female aggression is costly to immigrants, (2) males are effective in protecting immigrants from aggression and (3) immigrants seek out male protective services. Results showed costs of resident aggression on two levels. Immigrants held low dominance ranks and experienced higher physiological stress than natal residents, as indexed by urinary cortisol. Males were found to be effective protectors for immigrants. They intervened aggressively to curtail female conflicts, more often when conflicts involved immigrants and occurred during periods of heightened female competition. When intervening, males nearly always supported immigrants over residents. As a result, females, especially immigrants, experienced less intrasexual aggression in the presence of males than when males were absent. Immigrants took advantage of male protective services. They associated with males more often than resident females and, unlike residents, did not greatly decrease their level of association outside of oestrus. We suggest male protection is an important strategy used by immigrants to integrate themselves into their new group. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) can be found on the cuticle of insects and they primarily serve to reduce desiccation. Additionally, they constitute important cues for species, kin and nestmate recognition. In paper wasps, these CHCs can also be found on the nest material and facilitate nestmate recognition. We analysed whether the nest material of a solitary digger wasp, the European beewolf, Philanthus triangulum ( Hymenoptera, Crabronidae), also contains CHCs and whether these might provide cues for the host search of a specialized cuckoo wasp (Hedychrum rutilans). Ejected nest material contained 3.6 +/- 2.1 mu g of CHCs/g. The composition of these nest hydrocarbons (NHCs) was very similar to the CHC composition of the cuticles of beewolf females. In particular, there were two distinct chemomorphs occurring in the European beewolf that could be unambiguously distinguished by means of the NHCs. Because of these large amounts of NHCs, females of the specialized parasitoid H. rutilans ( Hymenoptera, Chrysididae) may use these NHCs as kairomones to locate and identify the host nest. Bioassays showed that females of this cuckoo wasp are able to recognize nest mounds of their host visually and are able to discriminate between host and nonhost nest material by using qustatory cues. Furthermore, in olfactometer assays, H. rutilans females stayed significantly longer in the segment supplied with an airflow that passed over beewolf nest material than in a control segment. Our results suggest that the beewolf NHCs provide important olfactory cues for a chrysidid parasitoid for host localization. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In a series of three experiments, we examined the prediction from formal theories of the evolution of social learning that, all else being equal, animals should be more likely to learn socially from familiar individuals or kin than from unfamiliar individuals or nonkin. In all three experiments, contrary to prediction, naive Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, were marginally more likely to learn to prefer a food eaten by an unfamiliar than by a familiar conspecific demonstrator. The finding that, when given a choice, naive rats spent more time near unfamiliar than near familiar demonstrators offers a possible explanation for the observed greater influence of the former compared to the latter on the food choices of their observers.

AB Female-limited colour polymorphisms occur in a variety of species, where often one female morph (androchrome) resembles the body coloration of the conspecific male, whereas the other (gynochrome) does not. We tested predictions of two frequency-dependent hypotheses that are commonly invoked to explain the maintenance of these polymorphisms for multiple populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans: (1) that males prefer mating with the most abundant female morph (LMR) or (2) that androchromes are functional male mimics (MM). We also asked whether variation in social and abiotic environments account for interpopulation variation in female morph frequencies. Contrary to predictions of the LMR hypothesis, morph mating frequency was not lower than expected based on morph frequency when a morph was uncommon or higher when a morph was most common. In support of the MM hypothesis, androchrome mating frequency was lower than predicted based on population morph frequency. In addition, as predicted, androchrome mating frequency increased with increasing ratio of androchromes to males, but we could not disentangle whether this was a consequence of the changing mimic/model ratio or because of rising androchrome frequency. Although variation in female morph frequencies between populations was not random across our study area, this could not be explained by geographical variation in frequencies and densities of males and females. Androchrome frequencies were higher in populations to the north and west where ambient temperatures were lower. Abiotic conditions such as temperature may need to be considered for understanding the maintenance of female-limited polymorphisms.

AB In animal societies, contrasts in reproductive skew among females are caused by variation in the frequency of reproduction by subordinates. However, despite widespread interest in the extent and causes of reproductive skew, few empirical studies have investigated the factors affecting the frequency of successful reproduction by subordinates. We tested the prediction that the extent to which dominants restrict the reproductive success of subordinates should increase as group size rises and the marginal benefits of additional helpers falls. In a long-term study of wild meerkats, Suricata suricatta, we found that dominants were more likely to evict subordinates in large groups than small ones, and that the frequency of breeding by subordinate females declined with group size, largely as a result of increases in abortion rate. The breeding frequency of subordinate females was also influenced by their age and weight, which probably reflects the capability of subordinates to breed and their ability to resist the attempts of dominants to suppress them. These findings highlight the importance of investigating variation in the benefits to dominants of controlling subordinate reproduction as well as variation in the benefits of breeding to subordinate females when attempting to understand variation in subordinate breeding success.

AB Males can affect the number of times females mate by inducing resistance to remating. We investigated the associations between male courtship behaviour and female remating frequencies using three species of the parasitoid wasp Nasonia. We tested females for remating at 10 min and 24 h after the first copulation and found that species differences in female remating frequencies were associated with different first male behaviours. Nasonia vitripennis females showed the highest average frequency of remating, greater than 75% for all tests, and females that did not remate had experienced long first courtships, suggesting that they were generally resistant to courtship. In N. longicornis, the two populations tested had a two-fold and significant difference in female remating frequency, from 45 to 90%, but we could not identify any first-male behaviour that was significantly associated with this difference. Fewer than 35% of N. giraulti females remated 10 min after the first copulation, but remating increased to about 70% in the 24 h tests. In N. giraulti longer postcopulatory displays by the first male were associated with a higher chance of female remating. These three species are closely related, but male behaviours that appear to manipulate female remating differ between them. The divergence may have evolved as a consequence of sexual conflict over different reproductive optima for each species. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Seminal compounds variously affect female receptivity, fitness and longevity. Typically, they are delivered simultaneously with sperm. Thus, for most species, it is difficult to disentangle their relative contribution in altering female physiology and/ or behaviour. However, the timing of seminal compound delivery is known for a few species, allowing direct manipulation and assessment of their effect on female reproduction. We examined the effect of seminal compounds on female fitness and longevity in the almond moth, where seminal compounds are delivered before the transfer of the sperm-containing spermatophore. We permitted females either one or two matings and manipulated the dose of seminal compounds received by interrupting half the copulating pairs after seminal protein transfer, but before spermatophore transfer. Females that received a double dose of seminal compounds laid more eggs regardless of whether they also received a spermatophore, suggesting this effect is independent of any effects of sperm on oviposition. The dose of seminal compounds did not affect female receptive behaviour, but females that received seminal compounds copulated less frequently than virgins. Moreover, females that received an entire ejaculate remated less frequently than females receiving only seminal compounds, and larger females were more likely to remate. Thus, the mechanical distension of the female reproductive tract may provide a proximate mechanism for inducing nonreceptivity in this species. Finally, females receiving an entire ejaculate lived longer when they received an additional dose of seminal compounds. We discuss factors promoting the development of seminal compounds and their role in the maintenance of monandry. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many sonic fishes appear to produce advertisement calls at a lower rate than insects, frogs and birds (song). Fish sonic muscles in many species rank among the fastest in vertebrates, suggesting that acoustic signalling is a costly activity. Surprisingly however, sound production in the oyster toadfish Opsanus tau requires negligible oxygen consumption. Male toadfish produce a long-duration tonal advertisement call, the boat-whistle, and both sexes produce short-duration agonistic grunt calls. The question of what limits the calling activity in fishes has not been addressed. We tested the hypothesis that calling in the oyster toadfish is limited by fatigue of the sonic muscles by stimulating them intermittently at the most rapid rate evoked by playbacks of the courtship boatwhistle call (100 ms every 4 s at 200 Hz = 1.5 s stimulation/min) for 5 min and measured swimbladder movement, sound production and glycogen use. Muscles in both sexes showed almost complete fatigue by 5 min (7.5 s of stimulation), although rested control muscles contained over twice as much glycogen in males as in females. Glycogen use was similar in both sexes, but males used 10.8% of their glycogen and females used 23.2%. Glycogen would support muscle contraction at this rate for 15 min in males during mating call production. It appears that sound production in the oyster toadfish is fatigue limited, which dictates a low rate of spontaneous calling that can be elevated for brief bursts of activity.

AB Bird flocking is a striking example of collective animal behaviour. A vivid illustration of this phenomenon is provided by the aerial display of vast flocks of starlings gathering at dusk over the roost and swirling with extraordinary spatial coherence. Both the evolutionary justification and the mechanistic laws of flocking are poorly understood, arguably because of a lack of data on large flocks. Here, we report a quantitative study of aerial display. We measured the individual three-dimensional positions in compact flocks of up to 2700 birds. We investigated the main features of the flock as a whole (shape, movement, density and structure) and we discuss these as emergent attributes of the grouping phenomenon. Flocks were relatively thin, of various sizes, but constant proportions. They tended to slide parallel to the ground and, during turns, their orientation changed with respect to the direction of motion. Individual birds kept a minimum distance from each other that was comparable to their wing span. The density within the aggregations was nonhomogeneous, as birds were packed more tightly at the border than the centre of the flock. These results constitute the first set of large-scale data on three-dimensional animal aggregations. Current models and theories of collective animal behaviour can now be tested against these data.

AB Behavioural diversity in the predation pattern of army ants (Dorylus spp.) by different populations of wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, has been proposed to reflect different cultural traditions. Chimpanzees use either stick tools (known as ant dipping) or simply their hands to prey on two groups of army ants (epigaeic and intermediate species). A recent analysis has shown that, contrary to the cultural hypothesis, the tool length and associated harvesting technique used by chimpanzees in different populations is to a large extent influenced by characteristics of the ants themselves. However, in line with the cultural hypothesis, chimpanzees at two long-term study sites in West Africa (Bossou, Guinea, and Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire) prey on the same five army ant species but adopt different strategies to do so. We conducted controlled human simulations of ant dipping and an ant survey at these two sites to evaluate alternative ecological explanations related to ant behaviour and ecology that could account for the observed differences in chimpanzee predation behaviour. Ant speed explained differences in tool length within Bossou but not between Bossou and Tai. Our results do not support an ecological basis underlying the lack of dipping at ant trails in Tai chimpanzees. Finally, neither ant aggressiveness (measured as speed and persistence) nor yield when using tools could explain why, unlike Bossou chimpanzees, Tai chimpanzees do not use tools to harvest epigaeic species. We conclude that an interaction of cultural and ecological factors shapes the differences in army ant predation between Tai and Bossou chimpanzees.

AB The evolution and maintenance of elaborate secondary sexual characters in males have been the subject of intense interest since Darwin's time. Parasite-mediated sexual selection (PMSS) suggests that elaborate ornaments serve as honest indicators of male health and parasite resistance. Studies testing this key prediction of PMSS have largely focused on ornaments, with the role parasites might play in the maintenance of elaborate weapons being relatively understudied. Here, we tested whether weapon (horn) size was an indicator of health status in male and female African buffalo, Syncerus caffer. We examined whether individuals with larger horns were less likely to be infected with parasites, and had lower parasite loads and stronger immune systems. In males, horn size was significantly negatively correlated with the number of different parasites infecting an individual (parasite richness), the likelihood of infection with strongyle nematodes and coccidia, and strongyle intensity. In females, horn size was significantly negatively correlated with parasite richness, occurrence of coccidia infection, coccidia intensity and white blood cell count. These findings were robust when the effects of body condition, age and season were controlled for, consistent with the idea that horns function as honest indicators of health in both sexes. Our study provides new insight into the evolution and maintenance of elaborate weapons in mammals, suggesting a role for PMSS in both males and females.

AB Male harassment of females can be one form of premating sexual conflict, which can impose fitness cost on females. We measured the cost of male harassment on female fitness in the adzuki bean beetle, Callos obruchus chinensis, by using impotent males whose aedeaguses were ablated. These males harassed females but could not copulate with them. We measured the fitness of the females that received neither harassment nor additional copulations ( cl females) and those that cohabited with ablated males ( can harass but cannot copulate) ( ab females). The fitness of the ab females was 18.6% lower than that of the cl females, indicating that the females incur a large fitness cost of the male harassment. Additionally, to examine whether females can avoid the fitness cost of harassment by accepting copulation ( convenience polyandry), we compared the rate at which the females were harassed and the fitness of the females that cohabited with normal males ( can harass and copulate) ( nl females) with those of the ab females. The harassment rate and fitness of the nl females did not differ significantly from those of the ab females. These results did not positively support the convenience polyandry hypothesis.

AB As predicted by Conditional Sex Allocation Theory, females of the solitary bee Osmia cornuta exposed to scarce. oral resources biased their progeny sex ratio towards males, the least costly sex, and produced smaller-than-average females. Surprisingly, nesting females also produced a number of 'tiny' offspring, which contrasted with regular-sized offspring within the same nest. Developmental and wintering mortality are strongly size dependent in O. cornuta, and a high proportion of tiny offspring did not survive. This result is in disagreement with Optimal Allocation Theory, according to which resources should be allocated in portions that maximize fitness returns. I ask why did O. cornuta females build tiny provisions and why did they lay female eggs (with lower survival probability than male eggs) on these provisions. I argue that egg maturation rates and selective pressure to avoid kleptoparasitism and provision desiccation in cells left unsealed for long periods may impose a limit to the time available for cell provisioning. Under low food availability, this limit will be reached before provision sizes resulting in maximum fitness returns are attained. I also argue that the decision to fertilize an egg (and thus produce a female) is made at the beginning of the cell-provisioning process, so that females cannot adjust offspring sex to provision size. At the same time, altering the female-male cell sequence within a nest would result in fratricide because of protandric emergence. I provide evidence supporting these ecological and physiological constraints on resource allocation decisions in O. cornuta. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Explaining sexual ornamentation in the limiting sex, usually females, requires information on the proximate background of ornaments and their consequences for sexual selection. Phenotypic variation within individuals has received little attention in either of these research directions. We used 6 years of data to examine the information content and potential role of white wing patch size in female collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis. Female wing patch size differed among years. Yearling females had smaller wing patches than older females. The negative effect of original patch size on intraindividual patch size change was stronger in yearling than in older birds, which may reflect an age- dependent trade- off. Change in wing patch size was strongly positively related to the summer North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO) index. Clutch size laid in the previous breeding season had a negative effect on patch size change, but only in high- NAO years. Thus, the immediate effect of poor climate during moult apparently overrode the more indirect influence of reproductive effort. Two sexually selected ornaments of mates were unrelated to female wing patch size at the population level, but intraindividual changes of female wing patch size significantly predicted differences in wing patch size between mates obtained in the 2 years. Our data suggest that significant mating advantages to more ornamented females may not be detected from population- level mating patterns. Research on potential female ornaments should also pay more attention to age- dependent phenotypic plasticity, the trade- off between current and future ornament size and the costs of reproduction to apparent future attractiveness.

AB Among the wide repertoire of vocalizations produced by social species, perhaps the most frequently heard are the 'close' calls (those of short duration and low amplitude). Despite their prevalence, and the many studies focusing on their function in primate societies, little work has been conducted on close calls in avian species. We used a combination of observations, supplementary feeding and playback experiments to investigate the function of one particular close call, the 'chuck', in group-living pied babblers, Turdoides bicolor. There was no evidence that the chuck call is used to recruit conspecifics to a food source or to reduce the likelihood of an individual becoming separated from the group. Instead, there was good evidence that it is used to regulate spacing between potential foraging competitors. Although the chuck call is not used aggressively to deter competitors that attempt to share an individual's foraging patch, it appears to indicate the forager's current position and thus minimize the likelihood of another group member approaching closely in the first place. Foragers increased their call rate in larger groups and when their nearest neighbour was closer (i.e. when foraging competition was potentially higher), and playbacks of chuck calling caused individuals to stay further away from the speaker than did background noise. Maintenance of spacing was beneficial because individuals suffered a decrease in foraging efficiency if they shared a foraging patch. This study represents one of the first experimental tests of the function of avian close calling. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Socially acquired predator avoidance is a phenomenon in which individuals acquire an avoidance response towards an initially neutral stimulus after they have experienced it together with the antipredator signals of social companions. Earlier research has established that alarm calls used for intraspecific communication are effective stimuli for triggering acquisition. However, animals produce a large range of other antipredator responses that might engage antipredator learning. Here, I examine the effects of conspecific distress calls, a signal that is produced by birds when restrained by a predator, and that appears to be directed towards predators, rather than conspecifics, on predator avoidance learning in Indian mynahs, Acridotheres tristis. Distress calls reflect high levels of alarm in the caller and should, therefore, mediate robust learning. Experiment 1 revealed that subjects performed higher rates of head movements in response to a previously unfamiliar avian mount after it had been presented simultaneously with playbacks of conspecific distress vocalizations. Experiment 2 revealed that increased rates of head saccades resembled the spontaneous response evoked by a novel stimulus more closely than it resembled the response evoked by a perched raptor, suggesting that distress calls inculcated a visual exploratory response, rather than an antipredator response. While it is usually thought that the level of acquisition in learners follows a simple relationship with the level of alarm shown by demonstrators, the present results suggest that this relationship may be more complex. Antipredator signals with different functions may have differential effects on learners. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Our longitudinal study explored the role of socially biased learning in the acquisition of a novel foraging task that could be solved in two ways in captive juvenile cottontop tamarins. We trained parents to adopt a single solution (pole or ceiling strategy). We tested 13 different juvenile offspring-parent pairs on the task over the course of 11 weeks. Our objective was (1) to investigate the extent to which juveniles match their parent, and (2) to analyse the influence of behavioural feedback between parent and juvenile offspring on learning trajectories, behavioural acquisition and performance. Although not all juveniles matched the modelled solution, both groups of juveniles significantly spent more time at the targeted location being modelled for them. Parent and offspring correlated well in time spent at the demonstrated location. We investigated predictors of performance and success by analysing data prior to first success. Juveniles' exploration of the apparatus was important in dictating their success at the task, whereas observation of the parent had no influence. Both juvenile scrounging and adult food calling, which encouraged begging, drew the attention of the juveniles away from the task and impeded learning. High adult refusals per beg predicted task success in young. Adults monitored their offspring's performance and increased their refusals per begs upon the first success of their offspring. Cottontop tamarins also showed some behavioural scaffolding. Solving the task did not simply reflect a maturational change in juveniles, but was rather influenced by an intricate behavioural feedback between parent and offspring.

AB In primate sexual relationships, males and females can cooperate through social trade. Market-like trading of sexual activity has been theorized, but no data have yet been presented that clearly show its existence. I collected data to test whether biological market theory could account for exchanges of male-to-female grooming and sexual activity in longtailed macaques. I explored male-to-female grooming, rates of sexual activity, and grooming - mating interchanges, which were male-to-female grooming bouts that directly involved mating. Male-to-female grooming mainly occurred when females were sexually active, and males groomed females longer per bout when mating, inspection, or presentation of female hindquarters was involved. Moreover, male-to-female grooming was associated with an increase in female rates for all forms of sexual activity, where in contrast, female-to-male grooming was associated with decreased rates of mating in the groomed males. Males did not preferentially mate with swollen females or invest more grooming in them during grooming - mating interchanges, as swellings did not seem to be a reliable indicator of female fertility. Rank status was correlated with grooming payment during grooming - mating interchanges in favour of higher-ranked males and females. In support of a biological market interpretation, the amount of grooming a male performed on a female during grooming - mating interchanges was related to the current supply of females around the interaction. The results provided evidence of a grooming - mating trade that was influenced by a mating market. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB 'Successful' introduced species are often thought to cause declines or extinctions of native species through competitive superiority. In western North America, introduced rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, have completely replaced many native cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarkii, populations; however, few studies have identified the mechanisms that may allow rainbow trout to outcompete cutthroat trout. We raised Yellowstone cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri, rainbow trout, and their first generation hybrids in a common environment and conducted pairwise contests to test for differences in aggression, ability to defend a feeding station, and amount of food captured between these species and their hybrids. We did not detect a difference in number of aggressive acts conducted between cutthroat, rainbow and hybrid trout; however, cutthroat trout had the lowest success in occupying the feeding station and captured a lower proportion of food than rainbow and hybrid trout. Furthermore, hybrid crosses and rainbow trout had highest success at holding the feeding station and capturing food items when competing against cutthroat trout. Our study suggests that juvenile Yellowstone cutthroat trout are less successful at maintaining pro. table feeding territories and capturing food items when competing against rainbow trout and first generation hybrids.

AB Interactions between organisms can lie anywhere along the spectrum from fatal conflict to total cooperation. To understand this variation, knowledge of the strategies that individuals use to acquire their resources is required. We tested theoretical predictions relating to conflict behaviour in a species of parasitoid wasp, Melittobia acasta, in which males compete for mates in their closed, natal patches. They engage in lethal combat to gain access to the females developing in their host. Environmental factors and individual traits both influenced conflict behaviour and contest outcome: fighting behaviour increased with the density of competitors and larger contestants were more successful. Our results also indicate that opponent assessment did not influence conflict behaviour and contests were always resolved by fighting.

Most biologists equate game theory with the notion of an evolutionary stable strategy ( ESS). Maynard Smith's definition of an ESS formalized an intuitive concept of stable population equilibria in game theory models. This has proven extremely useful, both to formal modelling efforts, and to a much wider range of biologists in general. The formal definition of an ESS often cannot be met for an entire class of games, extensive form games with nodes off the supported path. Games of this form are the most reasonable models for a great many animal behaviours. This means that formal ESSs will not exist for these games, even though evolutionary stable strategies, in the intuitive sense, do exist. More powerful analytical solution concepts, such as evolutionarily stable sets ( ES sets), are required to describe stable endpoints formally, but finding such solutions can be extremely difficult. In this paper we use genetic algorithms as an alternative method of searching for such solutions in a well-studied game of biological communication. Using this technique, we show a previously unknown solution to this game. We discuss the properties of biological communication that make it a particularly difficult subject to model using ESSs as the solution concept, and suggest that these issues also apply to a larger class of social models.

AB Co-orientation with others by using their gaze direction is considered to be adaptive for detecting food or predators or monitoring social interactions. Like the great apes, common ravens are capable of following human experimenters' gaze direction not only into distant space but also behind visual barriers. We investigated the ontogenetic development of these abilities by confronting birds with a human foster parent looking up ( experiment 1) and behind visual barriers ( experiment 3) and their modi. cation by habituation ( experiments 2 and 4). We tested a group of 12 hand-reared ravens during their first 10 months of life. Ravens responded to others' look-ups soon after. edging but could track their gaze behind a visual barrier only 4 months later, at the age they usually become independent from their parents. Furthermore, ravens quickly ceased responding to repeated look-ups by the model, but did not habituate to repeated gaze cues directed behind a barrier. Our findings support the idea that the two modes of gaze following reflect different cognitive levels in ravens and, possibly, have different functions.

AB Animal groups can gather disproportionately more information and often outperform solitary individuals in ecologically important activities. Collective decisions, however, may involve costly mechanisms for reaching a consensus. Nest building is a prime example. In a previous study on foraging for building materials by the ant Temnothorax albipennis, we showed that colonies prefer larger building blocks ( bigger sand grains) at all distances but always collect some smaller building blocks too. Walls made of mixtures of big and small grains are stronger and more compact. Here we study colonies with marked individuals to look at the foraging decisions of individuals that underlie the collective outcome for the colony. We found that at short distances some foragers preferred big grains and others small grains. However, at longer distances the proportion of foragers preferring big grains increased, whereas no foragers preferred small grains at the greatest distance. We found no evidence of an effect of individual morphology or foraging experience on preference. At all three distances foragers assessed grains before making a choice and were more likely to choose a big grain as a consequence. This likelihood increased with increasing distance. However, even at the greatest distance ants included small grains in the final wall after their initial preference for big grains. Therefore, we conclude that individual decisions to retrieve small grains are not simply errors. Instead, the construction itself may provide cues for the organization of the foraging activity of individuals into the collective building of an approximately optimal mixed wall by the colony.

AB Parents should adjust parental care if the costs and benefits of that care vary. Traditionally, the benefit of care has been assumed to be increased offspring fitness, yet increasing evidence indicates that care can also increase mating success. We examined male behaviour and reproductive success across environments in flagfish, Jordanella floridae, a pupfish found across a range of salinities in Florida, U. S. A. Care may be more beneficial to offspring in freshwater habitats than in brackish ones. If so, female preferences for care- giving males should be stronger in fresh water. We quantified male behaviour in fresh and brackish water for four populations and examined whether male behaviour influenced the probability of spawning or the number of eggs spawned. A male's behaviour influenced his reproductive success, but did so differently in fresh and brackish water. In fresh water, the male's behaviour prior to spawning was a strong predictor of whether or not he would spawn, whereas in brackish water, postspawning behaviour of males predicted additional spawning success. These results suggest that the traits that females use to assess potential mates differ depending on the salinity of the environment. Despite the importance to a male's spawning success of different activities in different salinities, male behaviour did not differ consistently between salinities. We discuss possible benefits to females of a phenotypically plastic mate choice criterion and examine explanations for why male behaviour does not covary with the strength of sexual selection across environments.

AB In 1956, Margaret Bastock published the first demonstration that a single gene could change a behaviour pattern. A Ph.D. student with Niko Tinbergen, Bastock's work was partly inspired by discussions between Tinbergen and the American evolutionary biologist, Ernst Mayr. In this essay, the genesis of Bastock's work is outlined, including reference to archival correspondence between Mayr and Tinbergen, and she is given the credit for developing the study of how a mutation can affect a behaviour pattern. Her paper is described and put into contemporary context, including an analysis of its impact in the 1960s and beyond. Finally, the implications of this study for modern investigations into the genetic bases of behaviour, from behavioural ecology to neuroscience, are discussed.

AB Many species show considerable variation in behaviour among individuals. We show that some behaviours are largely deterministic and predictable with mathematical models. We propose a general differential equation model of behaviour in field populations and use the methodology to explain and predict the dynamics of sleep and colony attendance in seabirds as a function of environmental factors. Our model explained over half the variability in the data to which it was fitted, and it predicted the dynamics of an independent data set. Differential equation models may provide new approaches to the study of behaviour in animals and humans. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sexual differences in body size are widespread among animals, and various explanations for the evolution and maintenance of sexual size dimorphism have been proposed. We investigated the effects of sexual selection and fecundity selection on the sizes of males and females, respectively, in American rubyspots, Hetaerina americana. Males are larger than females and have large red spots at the base of each wing that are sexually selected via male-male contests. Mating success is determined by the ownership of a territory. Large males held territories for longer and sustained longer territorial fights than small males. Territorial males obtained more copulations than nonterritorial ones. Large males also had more wing pigmentation and mated with large females. Large territorial males had high energy reserves, whereas nonterritorial males appeared to have depleted reserves. Selection analyses of body size showed disruptive selection acting on male body size, suggesting that both small and large males may be favoured in terms of mating success. We also tested whether fecundity selection acts on female size. However, female body size was unrelated to the number of eggs carried. Taken together, our results suggest that in this territorial damselfly species male-biased size dimorphism is driven by large male size in male-male competition being selectively advantageous in territory acquisition and/or maintenance. We also suggest that small size is advantageous in nonterritorial males to improve their agility in courting (or subduing) females.

AB Space use and ranging patterns of individuals have traditionally been used to identify social systems, and the amount of overlap in the home ranges of individuals can provide indirect information about the likelihood of social interactions. We compared data on foraging and roosting range overlap of the tent-roosting bat Artibeus watsoni to assess how environmental and demographic factors may affect movement patterns and social interactions. We estimated the overlap of foraging and roosting ranges among simultaneously radiotagged dyads and calculated a simple association index among these individuals. We then used these data to determine whether relative population and roost abundance, as well as sex class, affected spatial and social patterns. Our results show that range overlap in A. watsoni significantly determines the degree to which individuals interact with each other. We also found that roosting range overlap may be a greater determinant of daytime social interactions than foraging range overlap, because roosting range overlap showed a stronger correlation with association patterns. In addition, the differences that we observed in roosting range overlap and association among dyads were a consequence of the effects of population and roost density. Bats sampled in areas of high-population abundance had significantly higher roosting range overlap than bats in areas of low-population abundance, and roosting ranges of bats sampled at sites with few roosting resources (i.e. tents) overlapped more than those of bats living in areas with more tents. Finally, we observed no overlap in roosting range and no association among adult males, supporting the hypothesis that males defend tents or roosting areas against other males to gain exclusive mating access to females using these structures.

AB Consolation is a triadic postconflict interaction between a conflict participant and an uninvolved third party. The term consolation implies stress alleviation. Consequently, consolation may be an effective mechanism to alleviate postconflict stress. However, this assumption has not been tested. We tested whether consolation alleviates postconflict stress in captive chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. In addition, we examined whether consolation is a substitute postconflict interaction for reconciliation. We collected 643 postconflict-matched control pairs on aggressees and 576 on aggressors. Consolation occurred equally frequently with aggressees and aggressors. However, we found no evidence that consolation alleviated stress, regardless of the identity of the consoler. In addition, consolation was also directed to conflict participants with no evident postconflict stress. Furthermore, we found no evidence for consolation being a substitute for reconciliation. The occurrence of consolation did not depend on the occurrence of reconciliation and consolation was not more prevalent with the sex class that reconciled less often or had the highest postconflict stress levels. We conclude that consolation is a postconflict interaction in its own right, the function of which is not likely to be connected to stress alleviation of the consoled individual. We propose that the function of triadic postconflict affiliation, previously labelled as consolation, should be reassessed with regard to the third parties' reasons to affiliate with conflict opponents.

AB In many bird species, pairmates sing together, forming duet songs. Studies on duetting songbirds consistently report nonrandom associations between the male and female song types that constitute duet songs. Previous research has demonstrated that when female black-bellied wrens, Thryothorus fasciatoventris, answer male song to form a duet, they abide by individually specific, temporally stable duet codes linking discrete acoustic stimuli (male song types) to discrete vocal responses (female song types). The present study builds on this finding with the goal of understanding the behavioural mechanisms in both males and females that result in nonrandom song type associations. I recorded duets from free-living pairs, and isolated four transitions from male song type to female song type in the duets of each pair. These transitions served as predicted links in the females' duet codes. The male and female song types from the transitions were played to the pair from which they had been recorded. Both males and females 'duetted' with playbacks of their mates' songs. Females' answers adhered very closely to the predictions, supporting previous findings. Mates also answered according to the predictions at a level exceeding chance, demonstrating that they abide by the same duet codes as do their mates. Stimulus type was a strong predictor of response type in females, but a relatively weak predictor of response type in males. When presented with chimerical male song stimuli, females typically answered with one of the predicted responses for the songs composing the chimera. The song fragments constituting the beginning and end of chimerical stimuli were equally influential in determining female responses, but longer fragments were more influential than shorter fragments. Overall, the findings are consistent with the hypothesis that answering according to a unique duet code communicates the singer's identity to the mate, facilitating cooperative defence of the pair's shared resources.

AB A male bowerbird visual signal includes his own plumage, a structure he constructs out of plant material and coloured objects (ornaments) he places on or near the structure to make up the bower. Plumage and bower together are used to attract females for mating. Ornaments are known to contrast with plumage, bower structure and visual backgrounds in seven Australian bowerbird species (Endler et al. 2005, Evolution, 50, 1795-1818). We estimated the colour preferences in a wild population of great bowerbirds using artificially coloured objects widely spaced in bird colour space. We found that these birds prefer colours that contrast with their own plumage, the bower structure and the visual backgrounds adjacent to the bower, and that they have very strong dislikes for colours that are similar to their own plumage and to the visual backgrounds. The range of disliked colour hues was much narrower than the range of preferred hues, suggesting that the word 'preference' may be misleading. Preferences for colour are inherently multidimensional and should be studied in the context of their function. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Birdsong is a sexually selected trait that serves in territory defence and mate choice. Individual song traits can be affected by the body condition of the male and thus may reflect his quality. Such relations between male quality and general singing performance raise the question whether differences in male quality also affect response strategies used in dyadic interactions. To address this question, we studied the relation between pairing success of male common nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos, and their responses to rivals posing different levels of threat. Using interactive playback, we exposed males prior to mating to either aggressively or moderately singing rivals (by song overlapping and song alternating, respectively). Males that remained unpaired throughout the season (bachelors) interrupted their singing significantly more often after being overlapped than after alternating playback, whereas subsequently mated males kept the number of singing interruptions more constant across playback treatment. This suggests that subsequently paired males are less discriminative than are bachelors when challenged by rivals varying in aggressiveness. Regardless of playback treatment, males that later became paired responded significantly more strongly than did bachelor males. Thus, an increase in singing after a vocal interaction prior to mating predicted future mating success. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We studied olfactory learning in two ant species, Camponotus mus from Argentina and Camponotus fellah from Israel. To this end, we established an experimental laboratory protocol in which individual ants were trained to associate odours with gustatory reinforcers. Ants were trained individually to forage in a Y-maze in which two odours had to be discriminated. One odour was positively reinforced with sucrose solution and the other was negatively reinforced with quinine solution. After a training session of 24 trials, ants of both species learned to differentiate the two odour pairs, the structurally dissimilar limonene and octanal, and the structurally similar heptanal and 2-heptanone. In nonreinforced tests, ants consistently chose the odour previously reinforced with sucrose solution and spent more time searching in the arm of the maze presenting this odour. Learning performances were more robust in the case of limonene versus heptanal. These results thus show for the first time that individual ants perceive and learn odours in controlled laboratory conditions. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Condition-dependent mate choice in females, whereby condition or attractiveness influences preferences for markers of male quality, is seen in both fish and humans. Such effects may be explained by (1) genetic linkage between trait and preference, (2) poor-condition females having energetic constraints limiting their choosiness, and (3) females of low mate value benefiting from avoiding high-quality males, based on the differential behaviour of high-quality males towards mates of low and high value. We used a contrast effect in women, showing attractive and unattractive same-sex individuals to induce a change in self-rated attractiveness as seen in previous studies, to test the validity of the last explanation. The first two explanations predict that preferences should remain constant across manipulations of self-perceptions of attractiveness, whereas the last predicts preferences should change in line with an individual's perceived mate value. Exposure to attractive same-sex images resulted in lower self-rated attractiveness and preferences for male facial masculinity, whereas exposure to unattractive images resulted in higher self-rated attractiveness and preferences for masculinity. As facial masculinity may be an attractive trait, these results imply that, at least in humans, condition-dependent mate choice may be better conceived as 'market-value-dependent mate choice'.

AB We conducted two experiments with Temnothorax albipennis ant colonies. In the first, we assessed their ability to select the best nest, in terms of entrance size, among an array of mediocre ones. Small and large ant colonies were equally adept at solving this best-of-N choice problem. However, large colonies were faster than small ones at finding the best nest probably because they could deploy more scouts. As a result, large colonies in nature probably find more of the available nests more quickly than small colonies. Thus larger colonies may have a greater tendency to split than small colonies. Large colonies, however, used larger quorum thresholds to make collective decisions than smaller colonies. Higher quorum thresholds should help to reduce splitting by large colonies. Large colonies also used more reverse tandem runs, a process for recruitment of more active participants into emigrations. More reverse tandem runs may help large colonies to reunite if they do split. In a second experiment, large and small colonies had almost identical preferences for nests with a floor area that would ideally accommodate a fully grown colony. Thus, small colonies behaved in a way that seemed to anticipate their future needs, when they would have grown to fill a larger space.

AB Hygienic behaviour in honeybee colonies involves the recognition and removal of diseased brood by worker byes. This task is further partitioned into subtasks of uncapping cells with diseased brood and removing the cell contents. Worker bees that express hygienic behaviour remove diseased brood from the colony before the pathogen reaches the infectious stage. Although all honeybees are capable of uncapping and removing diseased brood, only those colonies with hygienic bees, the genetic specialists, do so rapidly and hence efficiently limit disease transmission. Colonies with nonhygienic bees, however, uncap and remove diseased brood only after it becomes infectious, resulting in the handling and transmission of pathogens. To understand the behavioural repertoire of individual nonhygienic bees and how the performance of the behaviour is influenced by the presence of hygienic bees as nestmates, we observed nonhygienic bees that were maintained in colonies with varying proportions of hygienic and nonhygienic bees. Our results indicated that nonhygienic bees in mixed colonies were not stimulated to perform hygienic behaviour to a higher extent in the presence of hygienic bees. The rate, duration and probability of uncapping and removing dead brood by nonhygienic bees was significantly reduced in the presence of hygienic bees. In mixed colonies, as compared to a colony of hygienic bees, a higher proportion of uncapped cells were subsequently recapped, resulting in delayed removal of dead brood. This inefficient task partitioning would allow the pathogen to reach the infectious stage and increase the probability of disease transmission.

AB Conflict between males and females over reproduction influences the evolution of numerous aspects of reproductive behaviour, including how frequently individuals mate. Typically, females optimize the benefits of mating with a limited number of copulations, whereas males may benefit from increasing the number of copulations, leading to a sexual conflict over female mating rate. While this conflict is theoretically straightforward, empirically much less is known about how commonly it is realized. We quantified the costs of mating for females from two populations of the promiscuous Lygaeus equestris seed bug. By varying the number of males kept with a female, we found that increased matings led to decreased longevity and fecundity, and that the detrimental effects of mating varied between the two populations. When females mated only once, male weight positively influenced egg production, as did copulation duration for lighter females, suggesting that females may benefit from mating with certain males, albeit a limited number of times. Our results show that degree of promiscuity may not be a good predictor of mating costs (i.e. how costly the sexual conflict over mating actually is) and that life history differences between populations have the potential to influence the extent to which the sexes come into conflict.

AB I used a simulation model to study how individual responses to predation risk and vigilance strategies may lead to departure in a foraging bird flock. The model incorporates risk dilution and, to some extent, collective detection of predators. A major factor influencing birds' behaviour is individual perception of predation risk. In the model, this perception is partly based on the observation of the other birds in the flock. It increases when these birds reveal their anxiety by becoming vigilant or taking flight. In general, the model describes birds' departure as a contagious phenomenon, which quickly spreads over the whole group. However, isolated flights involving only a few individuals may also occur. The model predicts that flock size and reliance on social information will strongly affect the moment that birds decide to stop feeding and take flight, even in the absence of any predator attack. In general, birds in small flocks leave the food patch sooner, and having accumulated lower energy reserves, than birds in larger groups. When disturbed, a flock may take flight instantaneously, simply because the high level of vigilance in the group increases anxiety. As a consequence, the model predicts that high levels of disturbance may have important effects on the mean level of energy reserves in the flock.

AB There has been considerable discussion of the factors that influence the hunting behaviour of male chimpanzees. Explanations invoking social benefits hinge upon the potential for males to share meat with sexually receptive females in exchange for mating ('meat for sex'), or to share meat with other males in exchange for social support ('male social bonding'). Ecological factors may also affect hunting: chimpanzees may hunt more frequently (1) in response to food shortages ('nutrient shortfall'); (2) when energy reserves are high ('nutrient surplus'); (3) in habitat types with good visibility and increased prey vulnerability; and/or (4) when ecological factors favour cooperative hunting. We used 25 years of data on chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, to examine the relative importance of social and ecological factors in the decision to hunt red colobus monkeys, Colobus badius. The presence of sexually receptive females was associated with a significant decrease in hunting probability, suggesting that males face a trade-off between hunting and mating ('meat or sex' rather than 'meat for sex'). Hunting by specific males did not vary with adult male party size, providing evidence against the male social-bonding hypothesis. After controlling for the effects of party size, diet quality was not associated with the probability of hunting or hunting successfully. Hunts were more likely to occur and to succeed in woodland and semideciduous forest than in evergreen forest, emphasizing the importance of visibility and prey mobility. Finally, per capita meat availability decreased with adult male party size, suggesting that hunting was not cooperative. These results provide evidence against social explanations for hunting in favour of more simple ecological alternatives. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Based on theoretical considerations, neighbour-stranger discrimination in territorial contexts is predicted and has been reported in many passerine birds. It has seldom been investigated in territorial nonpasserine species. We experimentally investigated neighbour-stranger discrimination in a year-round territorial nocturnal raptor, the little owl. We used playback of hoots to investigate whether territory owners discriminated neighbours from strangers when playback occurred at the usual location for the neighbour or at an unusual location. Male little owls responded significantly less to their neighbour's hoots played back from the usual location. However, responses to playback of a neighbour from an unusual location were similar to responses to playback of a stranger's hoots from either location. We conclude that little owls can discriminate between the hoots of neighbours and strangers. This study provides the first experimental evidence in owls for this level of neighbour-stranger discrimination, which is comparable to results found for passerines.

AB A number of group foragers are known to engage in a producer-scrounger (PS) foraging game in which only individuals in the producer strategy search for food; the scroungers wait for opportunities to join. Prey exploited by predators engaged in a PS game could gain by evolving predator evasion tactics that shift the PS equilibrium of their predators towards a larger number of nonsearching scroungers. Prey can achieve this by imposing foraging costs that are specific to predators engaged in the producer strategy. Ye tested whether prey crypsis, a trait that has evolved as a demonstrably efficient strategy against solitary predators, imposed a producer-specific cost to group foragers that shifts PS equilibria towards more scrounging. We exposed four flocks of six nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata, small granivorous passerines that have been documented to play PS foraging games, to clumps of white millet seeds placed against one of two backgrounds that made them either cryptic or conspicuous. In three of four flocks, foraging under crytic conditions required more time to find food, resulted in more detection errors, had no effect on vigilance but significantly increased the frequency of scroungers at equilibrium. Having socially foraging predators may provide prey with an extra incentive to evolve producer-specific costs such as cryptic coloration.

TI What makes information valuable: signal reliability and environmental
   uncertainty
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB We investigated the roles of signal reliability and environmental uncertainty in animal signal use. We developed a simple model that predicted when animals should switch between choosing the most common option (which we call environment tracking) and following a signal. The model predicts signal following when signal reliability exceeds environmental certainty. We tested this model experimentally using captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata. During each trial, the jays had to choose between two stimuli; one option was correct and led to food, and the other was incorrect and provided no reward. In addition, a third stimulus, the signal, provided information about which choice stimulus was correct. Using this procedure, we manipulated signal reliability (the probability that the signal matched the correct stimulus) and environmental uncertainty (the background probability that a given stimulus was correct) in a factorial experiment. Signal reliability and environmental uncertainty influenced signal use roughly as predicted. Jays used the signal when the signal was reliable and the environment was uncertain, and they ignored the signal when it was unreliable and the environment was predictable. Quantitatively, we observed a bias in favour of environment tracking. Jays sometimes ignored the signal when it could have helped them, and they ignored the signal in conditions where signal following and environment tracking produced equal payoffs. We discuss the implications of these findings.

AB Female Polistes paper wasps can initiate colonies either solitarily or in cooperative groups. Reproduction is often distributed unequally in groups, even to the point of complete monopolization of breeding by the dominant group member. Transactional models of reproductive skew predict the degree of reproductive partitioning, assuming that the dominant controls group membership and will yield a proportion of reproduction to a subordinate as an incentive to stay peacefully in the group. Using a combination of demographic, genetic and morphological data from a population of R dominulus, we test predictions of 'classical' two-person skew models as well as more complex 'N-person' models. This is the most comprehensive study of skew in this species to date, and the results generally do not support transactional models. We found no relationship between skew and relatedness for dyads, and complete skew was observed in unrelated groups despite the prediction for this population that such groups should not occur. In contrast to N-person model predictions, group size tended to increase with relatedness. Although we did find the predicted positive correlation between group size and skew for groups of nonrelatives, this relationship was weak. The zone of conflict between the predicted minimum and maximum staying incentives often spans the entire possible range of reproductive skew, suggesting that a 'tug-of-war' scenario may be more appropriate than a transactional framework for understanding within-colony dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that transactional skew models have little predictive power and are therefore unlikely to yield further insight into Polistes wasp societies.

AB In the common goby, Pomatoschistus microps, males compete aggressively for nest sites when these are in short supply. I investigated whether prior information about the opponent influenced aggression levels during nest competition. Males that, through a one-way mirror, had been observing two other males compete for a nest were placed together with either the winner or the loser. The new male pairs also received nest sites to compete for, and their behaviour was videorecorded. As a control, naive males, which had not been watching the earlier contest, were also recorded when competing with previous winners or losers. Both bystanders and naive males acquired the nest more often when competing with a loser than with a winner. The male that got the nest was generally more aggressive than his opponent. However, in trials with bystanders and losers, the male obtaining the nest was less aggressive than in contests between bystanders and winners and in contests between naive males and losers. Furthermore, when bystanders competed with losers, they were less aggressive than were naive males competing with losers. There was no difference in aggression between bystanders and nalve males competing with winners. Information about the opponent did not increase the probability of obtaining the nest, but the benefit, when applicable, might instead have consisted of a decrease in aggression, and thus a lowered energetic cost of nest competition.

AB We investigated allofeeding (feeding of offspring by adults other than their own parents) in the king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, a long-lived pelagic bird that faces severe food shortages during its reproduction and in which parents leave their fasting chick in dense creches. A 1-year monitoring of 103 breeding pairs and 70 chicks was carried out in a colony in the Crozet Archipelago. We examined whether allofeeding was common enough to alter survival costs or benefits for both the allofed chicks and the allofeeders. Twenty-two per cent of marked adults allofed more than 65% of all the chicks without repeatedly feeding the same chick. Allofeeding in king penguins benefited allofed chicks by increasing their survival, yet little or no fitness cost was detected among allofeeders. We identified proximal factors affecting allofeeding: (1) the breeding conditions of the population were not unusual; (2) allofeeding occurred mostly when parental provisioning was low; (3) alloparents did not respond to increased begging by regurgitating more meals; (4) allofeeders were mostly failed breeders, although successful breeders occasionally allofed; (5) when the colony was no longer organized into breeder territories, allofeeders preferentially fed chicks that had been reared by close neighbours at the time of brooding.

AB Previous research has revealed profound effects of prenatal interactions among littermates on the subsequent fecundity and behaviour of female Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus. Here, we determined whether interlitter competition for maternal resources similarly affects female phenotypes. We found that, when adult, female Mongolian gerbils whose dams were both nursing while gestating them and pregnant while suckling them (twice-challenged dams) were less likely to affiliate with their mates and less fecund than their peers reared by dams neither suckling a prior litter while gestating focal daughters nor pregnant with a subsequent litter while suckling them (not-challenged dams). Daughters of twice-challenged dams had smaller, more female-biased litters than did daughters of not-challenged dams, and the difference in behaviour of daughters of twice-challenged and not-challenged gerbil dams when choosing between their respective mates and unfamiliar males was as great as that seen in nominally monogamous and polygamous species of vole observed in similar circumstances. Our results suggest that the reproductive phenotype of females can be profoundly affected by naturally occurring variation in access to maternal resources that results from conflict between successive progeny in mammalian species where dams are sometimes both pregnant and nursing and sometimes neither pregnant with nor nursing one litter while rearing another.

LA English
DT Article
ID DISPERSAL SYNDROME; GERMINATION; PREFERENCES; EVOLUTION; SURVIVAL
AB Rodents selectively cache acorns of red oak species (subgenus Erythrobalanus; RO) over those of white oaks (subgenus Quercus; WO) because of perishability of early-germinating WO acorns. On occasion, at least three species of tree squirrels also will cache white oak acorns, but only after they excise acorn embryos, thereby preventing germination. Failure to observe embryo excision of acorns in several other mammal species led us to hypothesize that tree squirrels may have an innate tendency to perform embryo excision and possibly the differential caching of RO and WO acorns. To test this, we evaluated the hoarding decisions of eight captive-reared (naive) eastern grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, with no previous experience with acorns and Four wild-caught squirrels. Squirrels were presented individually with pairs of dormant RO and nondormant WO acorns (two species) and pairs of dormant and nondormant RO acorns over a 2-month period. Both naive and wild-caught squirrels selectively cached dormant RO acorns more often than those of one WO species (Quercus alba), but showed a much weaker response to other pairs of dormant and nondormant acorns. Naive squirrels also removed the radicles of germinating acorns, and on occasion, attempted to excise embryos of germinating acorns. We conclude that there is a strong innate basis for some of the hoarding decisions made by tree squirrels, strengthening an emerging argument that tree squirrels show specific behavioural adaptations to the oaks.

AB The common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, is a brood parasite that monopolizes parental care of its host species: soon after hatching, the chicks remove the host offspring. Although cuckoo chicks trick their foster parents into providing enough food, it is unknown whether cuckoo begging behaviour represents an advantage over that of the host chicks in a hypothetical competitive scenario. We studied the feeding behaviour of rufous bush robins, Cercotrichas galactotes, when rearing their own and parasitic chicks in natural and in experimental nests where a cuckoo and a host brood were presented simultaneously to parents. In natural parasitized and nonparasitized nests, the feeding rate for cuckoo chicks did not differ from that of a single host chick of the same age, but cuckoos were fed with a different diet and with larger prey. Thus, cuckoo chicks received a similar amount of food to that received by a whole host brood. Cuckoo chicks in experimental nests did not receive a diet, prey size or feeding rate different to that received by a single host chick and thus received considerably less food than cuckoo chicks in unmanipulated nests. These results suggest that cuckoo chicks could not outcompete host chicks, at least when parasitizing this host species, and thus that their eviction behaviour is beneficial. We discuss various explanations for the inability of cuckoos to outcompete host chicks. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MACAQUES MACACA-MULATTA; CHIMPANZEES; PREFERENCES; QUANTITY; QUALITY
AB Brown capuchins give distinct calls upon encountering food. Based on studies on other species that point at divisibility of food and audience as critical variables, we predicted that capuchins would adjust their food calling for both the amount of food and the nature of their audience. We predicted that the food-associated call serves to attract conspecifics in certain conditions. Twelve female capuchins were tested in two food-quantity conditions (large and small) and four audience conditions with a control (higher-ranking female, lower-ranking female, high-ranking male, entire group and alone). All subjects called more for larger than smaller amounts and the highest-ranking females called less than others. Subjects called more in the presence of a group than for any other audience, and this applied most strikingly to high-ranking subjects. This result may be related to the presence of kin rather than group size. We also analysed the acoustic parameters of the calls, predicting that, under conditions where call production rose, those acoustic variables associated with heightened arousal would rise in value. However, call production and those acoustic features were not always correlated. These results suggest that food calls in this species do not solely reflect arousal caused by food and are influenced by multiple audience effects.

TI Battle of the sexes: forcibly inseminating male garter snakes target
   courtship to more vulnerable females

AB In communal dens of garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis, in Manitoba, males obtain copulations forcibly, by inducing hypoxic stress in females. Females emerging from their 8-month winter inactivity are weak and slow, but recover strength and speed within a day or two of emergence. Thus, males may benefit by targeting newly emerged females that are too weak to resist, and by courting females under conditions that maximize the male's physical advantage. Fieldwork at a Manitoba den supported these predictions. Both in the field and in outdoor enclosures, males focused courtship on to newly emerged (weak) rather than dispersing (postrecovery) females. Experimental trials showed that males based this choice on female skin lipids (pheromones) that predict time since emergence, rather than correlates of recent emergence that reflect female physiological state per se (low body temperature, low resistance to hypoxia, high breathing rates during courtship). Male superiority in locomotor speed was maximal at high temperatures, and males targeted courtship to hotter females. The postemergence recovery of females in this system substantially shifts the balance of power in physical encounters between males and females, and provides a fitness benefit to male ability to recognize and exploit more vulnerable females. Male ability to discern and exploit differentially vulnerable females is likely to be widespread, but less overt, in many other populations.

AB Alternative mating strategies occur in many animal lineages, often because males adopt tactics best suited to their own phenotypes or to spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the distribution of females. Garter snakes near a communal overwintering den in Manitoba show courtship in two contexts: competition from rival males is intense close to the den, but weak or absent when males court solitary dispersing females in the surrounding woodland. Larger size enhances male mating success near the den, but not mate location rates in the woodland. As predicted by the hypothesis that males match their tactics to their competitive abilities, our mark-recapture data show that larger, heavier individuals remained near the den, whereas smaller and more emaciated males moved to the woodland. To locate mates, woodland males relied upon substrate-deposited pheromonal trails and visual cues (rapid movement), whereas males in the crowded den environment ignored such cues and instead tongue-flicked every snake they encountered to check for sex pheromones. In arena trials, den males adjusted their courtship intensity to the presence of rival males, whereas woodland males did not (perhaps reflecting the lower probability of interruption by a rival). Thus, male garter snakes adjust the times, places, form and intensity of their reproductive behaviours (mate-searching tactics, intensity of courtship) relative to both their own competitive abilities and spatial heterogeneity in mating opportunities.

   VIGILANCE; BIRDS; PREY; DISTANCE; BEHAVIOR; RISK
AB Variation in escape response delays can be explained by at least two, nonmutually exclusive hypotheses: (1) the perceptual limit hypothesis, where delays result because of physical constraints related to predator detection and alarm signal transmission, and (2) the economic hypothesis, where delays are adaptive because they help to avoid superfluous, or to optimize essential, escape responses. We explored the relative importance of these effects in determining first response delays (the time elapsed between the 'detectors' leaving and the start of the rest of the flock's escape) and main response delays (time taken for all nondetectors to escape) among redshank flocks to three stimuli that posed different levels of risk (an attacking hawk, an approaching harmless species and a stimulus that did not involve any obvious external threat). There was strong support for the economic hypothesis because first response delays increased with flock size during responses to low-risk stimuli, when we assume the cost of not escaping immediately was lower because of increasing benefits from the dilution and confusion effects. There was also strong support for the perceptual limit hypothesis because main response delays were explained entirely by spacing and got quicker as flock size increased. This suggests that, once the rest of the flock started to respond to the detectors, benefits gained through the dilution and confusion effects decreased rapidly, so that immediate escape was the optimal response. Escape response delays can therefore be explained by both hypotheses and we discuss the implications of our results for group-living theory.

AB We evaluated hypotheses suggesting that play behaviour in, free-living juvenile Belding's ground squirrels, Spermophilus beldingi, helps to regulate energy balance and promotes development. of motor skills. We also examined the possibility that play behaviour and motor development influence important early life events in S. beldingi. We regularly measured body fat of juveniles using nondestructive methods, observed their behaviour, conducted motor skills tests, monitored dispersal status of males, and evaluated weaning success of females during their first effort to reproduce as yearlings. Rates of feeding were greater among juveniles who engaged in both social and nonsocial play behaviour at low compared to high rates, suggesting that play does not help young animals expend excess energy that they consume. By contrast, body fat was greater among juveniles who engaged in social play at high compared to low rates, supporting the idea that energetic variables such as body fat limit the expression of play behaviour. Motor skills of juvenile S. beldingi improved throughout the period in which juveniles engaged in play behaviour. improvement in motor skills was greater in juveniles who engaged in social play at high compared to low rates, suggesting a link between social play and motor development. Motor skill levels at the end of the play period were greater among males who dispersed by the end of the juvenile summer than among males still residing in their natal areas. Rates of social play and improvement in motor skills over the course of the play period were greater in females who successfully weaned a litter as yearling than in females who did not. These last two results raise the possibility that play behaviour and motor development during the play period influence important events in the early lives of S. beldingi, which may ultimately influence-long term reproductive success.

AB Members of the family Canidae are distinguished from other carnivore families by pair bonding and male care of the young. Because of the importance of food provisioning and territorial defence by males, social structure among canids is shared or even dominated by males. However, small, insectivorous species of canids show little male parental care, although whether social structure differs from other canids is unknown. We combined data from three independent research projects on a small canid, the swift fox, to help elucidate the social organization of this species. Based on data on movements of 35 adult mated pairs and the fate of litters, we found that adult females maintained territories and family structure, whereas adult males tended to emigrate. This is the first evidence of a female-based social organization among any canid species. This type of social organization probably resulted from the decreased importance of territorial defence and food provisioning by males, as their diet is primarily insectivorous during summer when young are weaned. Our results, along with others, indicate that variations in social structure among canid species are strongly influenced by the importance of food provisioning and territorial defence by males.

AB Primates are unique among eutherian mammals for possessing trichromatic colour vision. It is generally proposed that trichromacy evolved to aid detection of ripe fruits against mature foliage. However, while trichromacy is routine in all Old World monkeys and apes (the catarrhines), a cone opsin polymorphism in New World monkeys (the platyrrhines) results in foraging groups with mixed capacities for chromatic distinction. Although 50-66% of female platyrrhines are trichromatic, all males are dichromatic. Here, we test the hypothesis that trichromatic platyrrhines use visual cues to detect fruit rewards more successfully than do males. Specifically, we ask whether female emperor tamarins, Saguinus imperator imperator, and saddleback tamarins, S. fuscicollis weddelli, are the first members of their foraging group to locate food patches; and, furthermore, whether they are more successful than males in using colour, shape and size cues to discriminate between sham and reward feeding sites. Our results show that females and males do not differ in their ability to locate or discriminate between feeding sites. We conclude that trichromatic vision in female tamarins does not confer an advantage for detecting yellow fruit rewards against mature foliage.

AB Both body size dimorphism and sex differences in the relative costs and benefits associated with acquiring energy for reproduction have been advanced to explain the evolution of sex differences in foraging behaviour. We examined the extent to which these factors influenced sex differences in the diving behaviour of a size-dimorphic, capital breeder, the grey seal, Halichoerus grypus. Using time-depth data loggers, we examined the diving behaviour of 46 male and 49 female grey seals for 7 months before parturition and mating. Males and females showed significantly different seasonal patterns in the characteristics of individual dives and dive effort. Compared with males, females showed significantly higher levels of dive effort immediately following moult and in the 3 months before parturition. Females also had longer dives (5.5 versus 4.9 min) and spent more time at depth (3.4 versus 2.7 min), whereas males dived deeper (57 versus 49 m). Males dived consistently throughout the day, whereas females showed strong diurnal patterns in dive depth, duration and frequency. The diving behaviour and rates of mass gain by females suggested a pattern of foraging consistent with early accumulation of body energy to support pregnancy and the subsequent lactation period during which females fast. Males, on the other hand, showed diving behaviour and rates of mass gain consistent with a more gradual accumulation of energy stores. Our results suggest that sex differences in the seasonal patterns of diving behaviour reflect sex differences in the costs and benefits of stored energy for reproduction rather than the influence of body size dimorphism alone.

AB The bold colours of reef fish probably serve various functions ranging from crypsis to advertisement. The presence of UV-sensitive vision in many reef fish demands that we explore these functions beyond the range of human vision. Current knowledge of the transmission of UV and visible radiation through clear ocean water, and knowledge of the likely spectral sensitivity of predatory and prey fish suggest that contrasting UV signals should be selected for social communication. For many juvenile reef fish, close-range detection and being noticed by predators may be much more important than long-range detection. Dascyllus aruanus (three-bar damsel) and D. reticulatus (two-bar damsel) juveniles are boldly coloured white fish with black bars that shelter in mixed-species groups in finely branched corals. Predators on the reef are probably well schooled in the location of their residence coral heads and the major threat is being noticed by a predator when making a defensive error. I took video images of the fish in the field through a series of narrow-band-pass filters from 340 to 600 nm, which spans the probable range for visual sensitivity in fish. With the help of colour reference standards and spectral irradiance data, I applied video pixel intensity measures to a model of colour vision to quantify luminance contrast when viewed by both conspecific fish and various predators. The two-bar damsel had a highly UV-reflective colour patch on its flag-like dorsal fin that was lacking in the three-bar. This result, taken together with their longer wavelength coloration, indicates that the two-bar is better adapted for short-range social communication, which would be difficult for predators to detect.

AB As foraging becomes more unpredictable animals should increase their body reserves to reduce the risk of starvation. However, any increases in reserves may increase the risk of predation because extra mass probably compromises escape ability. Because of differences in foraging ability not all individuals will be affected in the same way by changes in foraging conditions. Relatively poor foragers will have more unpredictable foraging success for any given availability of food and therefore should carry larger body reserves. The mass-dependent predation hypothesis then predicts a negative correlation between levels of body reserves and foraging ability, although this may be modified by state-dependent compensation. I measured foraging rates and body masses of wintering European blackbirds, Turdus merula. Individuals with the lowest foraging rates had the largest gain in mass for the winter and had relatively high mass overall, independently of age and sex. That foraging rate determined mass rather than the reverse was demonstrated because foraging rate was independent of daily and seasonal mass change. Foraging rate within the experimental system was also independent of predation risk (as measured by distance from protective cover) and so the relation between mass and foraging rate was unlikely to have been confounded by any changes in vigilance to compensate for increased mass-dependent predation risk. The results suggest that blackbirds with high relative foraging rates have lower body reserves during the winter. Therefore there is probably a direct link between overwinter condition and fitness at least in blackbirds.

AB In a comparative study of neophilia, innovation and social attentiveness we exposed individuals in seven callitrichid species, from three genera, to novel extractive foraging tasks. The results revealed consistently shorter response latencies, higher levels of successful and unsuccessful manipulation, and greater attentiveness to the task and to conspecifics in Leontopithecus (lion tamarins) than in both Saguinus (tamarins) and Callithrix (marmosets). This is consistent with the hypothesis that species dependent upon manipulative and explorative foraging tend to be less neophobic and more innovative than other species. Furthermore, Callithrix appeared to be less neophobic than Saguinus; if Callithrix is regarded as the greater specialist, this result is inconsistent with the hypothesis that neophobia is associated with foraging specialization. We consider the relevance of our findings to taxonomic relationships, and to technical and Machiavellian intelligence hypotheses and discuss the implications for captive breeding and reintroduction strategies.

AB Capuchin monkeys were tested in five experiments in which two individuals competed over food. When given a choice between retrieving a piece of food that was visible or hidden from the dominant, subordinate animals preferred to retrieve hidden food. This preference is consistent with the hypotheses that either (1) the subordinate knew what the dominant could and could not see or (2) the subordinate was monitoring the behaviour of the dominant and avoiding the piece of food that it approached. To test between these alternatives, we released subordinates with a slight head start forcing them to make their choice (between a piece of food hidden or visible to the dominant) before the dominant entered the area. Unlike chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, subordinates that were given a head start did not preferentially approach hidden pieces of food first. Therefore, our experiments provide little support for the hypothesis that capuchin monkeys are sensitive to what another individual does or does not see. We compare our results with those obtained with chimpanzees in the same paradigm and discuss the evolution of primate social cognition. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We assessed the roles of visual and olfactory cues in female-tadpole communication in Chirixalus eiffingeri. The mean cumulative time that at least one tadpole was active or begged for food was significantly longer when a female C. eiffingeri was present than when a plastic frog was introduced and when no frog was present. Tadpoles did not respond visually to a female frog physically separated from them by transparent Plexiglas. However, tadpoles were more active in water conditioned by female frogs than in unconditioned water. Tadpole activity was further elevated by water conditioned by a female frog and tadpoles. Tadpoles were more active in water conditioned by male frogs than in unconditioned water, but water conditioned by a male frog and tadpoles did not further elevate tadpole activity. Thus, water conditioned by adults of either sex contains substances that increase tadpole activity, but only females show a synergistic effect with conditioning by tadpoles.

   SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; SPECIES RECOGNITION; NATURAL-SELECTION; GENETIC
   VARIANCE; MATE CHOICE; DROSOPHILA; MODEL
AB Sexual selection for divergent female preferences has been proposed to stimulate speciation. We tested this basic model by selecting for divergence in the courtship repertoire of the house fly Musca domestica L. Specifically, we subjected replicate strains to artificial selection for differentiation along the first two principal components of the phenotypic intercorrelation structure of five courtship traits. Highly significant differentiation in courtship repertoire resulted, and the magnitude of the selection response was highest along the first principal component (representing the 'size', or general intensity, of courtship). Videotaped matings of the crosses between divergent lines (i.e. males of one strain mating with females from a different line) showed that the selection responses in the intensities of male performances were due to shifts in female preferences. In particular, the males were able to accommodate the demands of 'foreign' females (as well as their own) in the no-choice situation (i.e. only one male and one female per mating chamber). In contrast to this plasticity of the males, the females were consistent in their differential resistance responses, regardless of the type of male involved in the courtship. Multiple-choice mate choice tests revealed significant reproductive isolation among some lines, although the effect was asymmetrical. The patterns of nonrandom mating were largely due to females from more genetically healthy lines (i.e. with overall high mating propensity) discriminating against males from populations with more inbreeding depression. We suggest that the inability to achieve true (symmetrical) reproductive isolation could have been due to low evolutionary potential in the 'shape' of courtship, as defined by the second principal component.

AB Male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are well known for affiliating and cooperating in a variety of behavioural contexts. Prior field research indicates that maternal kinship does not affect patterns of affiliation and cooperation by males in the same social group. Two questions remain unclear from this finding. First, why do male chimpanzees not bias their behaviour towards maternal kin? Second, what factors account for who affiliates and cooperates with whom? We conducted behavioural observations of an unusually large community of chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, to test the hypothesis that demographic constraints limit the number of maternal kin with whom male chimpanzees can cooperate, and thereby lead them to form selective bonds with nonkin of similar age and status. Results indicated that male age and rank are significantly associated with four measures of social behaviour. Members of the same age class and individuals close in rank were more likely to affiliate and cooperate than males that belonged to different age and rank classes. Additional analyses replicate earlier findings and show that males who affiliated and cooperated were not closely related through the maternal line, as assayed by mtDNA haplotype sharing. These results add to our growing understanding of the important role demographic and social constraints play in animal behaviour. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Communication between flowering plants and their pollinators involves innate, learned and deceptive sensory signals. Nocturnal, hawkmoth-pollinated flowers are among the most reflective and strongly scented known, suggesting the potential for multimodal sensory communication with pollinators. We measured the relative importance of these overstated signals, both alone and in combination, to nectar feeding by naive male hawkmoths, Manduca sexta. In the absence of fragrance, moths hovered and repeatedly passed (in flight) within 1 m above arrays of model paper flowers. The presence of plant odours elicited significantly more hovers and close passes, as well as three additional behaviours: approaches to the paper flowers, approaches to the hidden odour source and nectar feeding. However, approaches to odour sources never resulted in proboscis extension or probing in the absence of a visual target. Nectar feeding increased six-fold when paper and natural flowers were presented in mixed arrays, but moths did not show preferential visits or constancy to either type of flower. Significantly ordered behavioural sequences were observed when both visual and olfactory stimuli were present, but not when fragrance was absent. The largest conditional probabilities indicated a chain of responses beginning with hovering and leading to floral approach and nectar feeding. As single modality cues, both floral fragrance and visual display are innately attractive to male M. sexta, but the combination thereof is required to elicit proboscis extension and feeding.

AB Previous work on food-provisioning behaviour in blue tits suggested that the parents could gather larger prey items only by making longer foraging excursions, for example, by being more selective or by reaching more distant (and less exploited) feeding sites. Here, I show that within-nest, within-day variation in size of prey delivered by the parent could be explained by the time since its last visit. In unmanipulated conditions, size of larvae tended to increase with the time spent away from the nest. A significant positive relationship was more likely at high provisioning rates, suggesting that periods of intense feeding limited the size of prey delivered to the brood. To assess the effect of less intense feeding on prey size, I experimentally increased food availability to the tits. The parents could decide whether to eat the extra food or feed it to the nestlings. In both cases, food supplementation could result in longer time lags between natural feedings. Food-supplemented parents consumed the extra food and fed it to their nestlings, made longer foraging trips and delivered larger natural larvae than controls. In this group, size of larvae was more constant during the observation period and was independent of the time since the parent's last visit. This suggests that, below some value of visit rate, prey size is no longer limited by the duration of the foraging trip. The results support the view that tits continually vary visit rate and prey size. There is some evidence that these adjustments are made by changing food selectivity in response to changes in the state of the brood and of the parents.

AB Podarcis sicula of Italian origin has expanded its range along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, apparently replacing the autochthonous species P. melisellensis by competitive exclusion. We used an experimental approach on newborn lizards to test the hypothesis that direct behaviouvral interference occurs between P. sicula and P. melisellensis, whereby the former obtains an advantage over the latter. Brief encounters between P;, sicula and P. melisellensis were more aggressive and more likely to result in clear dominant-subordinate relationships than were brief encounters between pairs of conspecific P. melisellensis. When they cohabited for 3 weeks, individuals in heterospecific pairs were less likely to occupy a thermal microhabitat simultaneously than individuals from homospecific pairs. Contrasts of individuals in heterospecific. pairs showed that behavioural interference was asymmetric. in favour of P. sicula. During brief encounters P. sicula were more. aggressive and dominant than P. melisellensis opponents. When the two species cohabited for longer periods P. sicula used better, and P. melisellensis poorer, thermal microhabitats than when reared in isolation In addition, P. sicula grew faster, and P. melisellensis slower, than in isolation. These within-species shifts in microhabitat use and, growth were not evident for homospecific pairs living together. Thus, our observations indicate that asymmetric aggressive interactions between hatchlings of our study species reduce an important fitness component (i.e. growth rate) of P. melisellensis. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that direct behavioural interference by P. sicula is the mechanistic basis of the competitive exclusion of P. melisellensis.

AB Unmated male whitethroats court females with a special display in which the male dives towards the female while singing a quiet and complex song, the diving song. Observations of natural interactions suggest that females can affect males' courtship behaviour by making dscharp-calls or ze-calls and by making short jumps towards the diving males. We tested this in an interactive experiment where jumps and calls were presented in different combinations to unmated territorial males. Jumps were presented by means of a stuffed female mounted on a remotely controlled device, and calls were played back from a speaker placed beneath the stuffed female. Female calls and jumps had a strong but differential effect on male courtship, Playback of dscharp-calls attracted the attention of males and hence caused them to perform courtship sooner and jumps increased the number of diving songs, whereas ze-calls resulted in more males attempting copulation with the stuffed female.

AB We investigated how queens share parentage (skew) in the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, a social insect with multiple queens (polygyny). Overall, maternity of 546 male and female sexuals that mated successfully was determined with microsatellites in 26 colonies consisting of two queens and workers. The first main finding was that queens all contributed to sexual production. However, there was a significant departure from equal contribution to male and female sexual production in a notable proportion of colonies. Overall, reproductive skew for sexual (male and female) production was relatively low but higher than reproductive skew for egg production. The second interesting result was that there was a trade-off in the relative contribution of queens to male and female production. The queens contributing more to male production contributed significantly less to female sexual production. Finally, there was no significant association between colony productivity and the degree of reproductive skew. The relatively low reproductive skew is in line with predictions of the so-called concession models of reproductive skew because, in the Argentine ant, relatedness between queens is low and ecological constraints on dispersal nonexistent or weak.

AB Cleaning symbioses in the marine environment have long been held to be mutualistic interactions in which cleaners glean food from the surface of their fish clients while client ectoparasite load is reduced. However, there is limited evidence to show that clients benefit from being cleaned. We investigated the nature of a cleaner-client relationship by quantifying the costs to territorial longfin damselfish, Stegastes diencaeus, of being cleaned by cleaning gobies (Elacatinus evelynae and E. prochilos) in terms of travelling time, aggression and territorial intrusions incurred while seeking cleaners, and the benefits in terms of reduction in ectoparasite load. Travelling time to seek cleaners increased with distance from a damselfish's territory, as did the number of aggressive attacks by other territorial fish sustained by the travelling damselfish. The number of intrusions by fish on to the unguarded territory also increased, although not significantly, with time spent away from the territory. As a result, damselfish visited cleaning stations less as the distance between its territory and cleaning station increased. This variation in visit rate was related to a slight but significant reduction in the number of parasitic gnathiid isopod larvae per damselfish, suggesting that cleaning gobies significantly reduce client ectoparasite load. Longfin damselfish appeared willing to pay only limited costs to be cleaned. They travelled much further and staved away longer from their territories to perform reproductive and social activities than they did to seek cleaners. Distance-dependent variability in the costs of seeking cleaners allows damselfish to scale these costs in relation to the benefits gained and ensure that their relationship with cleaners remains mutualistic.

AB Previous experimental studies have established that shoaling fish forage more effectively in large than small groups. We investigated how shoal size affects the foraging efficiency of laboratory populations of the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, exposed to different foraging tasks. Experiment 1 confirmed the prediction that in open water the first fish and focal fish of larger shoals locate food faster than in smaller shoals. However, a second experiment, in which shoals of fish were required to swim through a hole in an opaque partition to locate food, found the reverse pattern: smaller shoals learned to complete the task faster than large shoals. Experiment 3, in which shoals of various sizes were exposed to a transparent maze partition, clarified the apparent contradictory results of the first two experiments, with larger shoals again learning to complete the task faster than small shoals. The findings of experiments 2 and 3 can be explained in terms of positive frequency-dependent social learning, or conformity. This facilitated social learning in large groups in experiment 3 where visual contact could be maintained through the partition, but hindered it in experiment 2 where visual contact was lost once a fish had passed through the partition. The findings raise the possibility that novel behavioural innovations, particularly those that require individuals to break contact with the group, may be more likely to spread in smaller than larger groups of animals.

AB We investigated the functional aspects of active shoal choice behaviour and its role in generating body length assortative fish shoals. We presented single European minnows with a choice between two conspecific shoals of equal number, one of which consisted of fish of similar body length and the other of fish that were smaller or larger than the focal fish. The preference of the focal fish for the matched shoal increased with increasing difference in body length between itself and the unmatched shoal. To test a potential function of this, we used feeding trials to investigate the competitive ability of a focal fish in a shoal of smaller or larger conspecifics. As body length differences between the focal fish and its shoalmates increased, the focal fish took fewer prey items and took longer to take the first one. Collection of free-ranging fish shoals at the study site showed a within-shoal variation of body length consistent with the preference behaviour observed in the laboratory. We discuss the importance of this work in the context of body length distributions in free-ranging shoals. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Leaf caching in the leafcutting ant <i>Atta colombica</i>::
   organizational shift, task partitioning and making the best of a bad job
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID LOAD-SIZE DETERMINATION; CUTTING ANT; POLYMORPHISM
AB Leafcutting ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) sometimes form piles or caches of leaves on foraging trails. Laboratory experiments have shown that leaf caching at the nest entrance by Atta cephalotes and Atta colombica is adaptive because it occurs when a colony's leaf delivery rate exceeds its leaf-processing rate and serves to increase the probability that a dropped leaf is eventually recovered. We examined the occurrence and adaptive value of leaf caching on foraging trails in field colonies of A. colombica in Panama. The probability of leaf caching was positively related to trail traffic with cache locations being frequently associated with changes in gradient or terrain along the trail. Artificially blocking foraging trails resulted in caching behaviour but only when the blockage was near the leaf source or the nest entrance. This mirrors individual leaf dropping on trails and bottleneck-induced nest entrance caching in the laboratory. Leaves were recovered, more rapidly from caches but because leaves were not selected according to forager size they were transported back to the nest more slowly than normally foraged leaves. Thus, whilst caching provides benefits, by increasing the likelihood of leaf recovery, it imposes a cost through mismatching forager and load size. Leaf caching is an example of an organizational shift (from direct foraging to foraging with task partitioning) and we provide a minimum estimate of the cost of this shift. Leaf caching encompasses two behaviours, leaf dropping and cache formation. Leaf dropping, and therefore the switch to task partitioning, is not in itself adaptive and cache formation has costs as well as benefits. We propose that leaf caching is making the best of a bad job if for some reason it is necessary for foragers to put down their leaf. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI To copulate or not? The importance of female status and behavioural
   variation in predicting copulation in a bumblebee
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID COURTSHIP BEHAVIOR; MATING PLUG; HYMENOPTERA; COMPETITION
AB Qualitative variation in female reproductive status and quantitative variation in courtship behaviour may both be important in determining whether copulation occurs after a mating interaction. However, integrated studies of these factors are rare. We examined whether female behaviour, male courtship behaviour and female reproductive status affect, on their own or together, the outcome of mating trials in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We used insemination techniques to manipulate the status of females, enabling us to dissect the relative roles of previous behavioural experience and actual reproductive status of females. Despite quantitative variation in male and female behaviour, the main predictor of copulation was female reproductive status. While two behaviours, female rejection of males and male attempts to copulate, explained 9% of the variation between trials in whether copulation occurred, on their own they could not predict whether mating occurred. Nonbehavioural factors, such as colony of origin and animal age, had no predictive power with respect to the occurrence of copulation. Our results suggest that, despite potential selection on males for courtship behaviour, quantitative within-species variation in the precopulatory behaviours we observed had little or no effect on whether copulation actually occurs. Rather, the reproductive status of females seems to be the most important determinant of copulation. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We analysed the use of three-dimensional space by 13 freely diving ringed seals, Phoca hispida, to distinguish between local search, presumably within prey patches, and travel or exploration between prey patches. We subdivided the three-dimensional home ranges of ringed seals into 3 x 3 x 3 m grid cells. For each dive, we determined the time spent swimming through each grid cell and the frequency of grid cell revisits. The seals generally spent 1-3 s in each cell and rarely revisited cells. During 34% of all dives, however, ringed seals focused their effort within a reduced volume, suggesting local search within patches of prey. The disproportionate effort within restricted volumes resulted from seals revisiting cells (18% of dives), reducing speed within cells (9% of dives), or both reducing speed and revisiting cells (7% of dives). Ringed seals searched locally in less than 10% of descents and ascents but did so in 41% of bottom phases (time spent at depth between the end of descent and the beginning of ascent).

AB Although colony size and nest number are believed to influence competitive ability in social insects, experimental studies testing this idea are rare. Here, we experimentally manipulated worker number and nest number in laboratory colonies of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, to test how these attributes, working alone or in combination, affected different components of exploitative and interference ability. As expected, every measure of competitive performance tested increased with worker number. In contrast, the influence of nest number was more complex, with colony-level performance increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant depending on the type of competition-related test or colony-size category being considered. In the exploitation of randomly distributed food items, retrieval rates decreased with nest number for 50-worker colonies yet increased with nest number for 2500-worker colonies. In contrast, retrieval rates decreased with nest number across all colony sizes when resources were clumped. In two experiments on interference competition, only colonies with more than 1000 workers and that occupied single nests were able to maintain more than 10 workers, on average, at baits in the presence of a competitor, Forelius mccooki. Argentine ant workers initiated a majority of pairwise fights against F. mccooki workers but often lost (i.e. either retreated or were injured), in part because their pre-emptive attacks left them vulnerable to chemical defensive compounds used against them by Forelius. These findings promise to promote a better understanding of the causes of invasion success not only for the Argentine ant but for other invasive ants as well, given that most have colony structures resembling that of L. humile.

AB It is usually assumed that communication between forest birds is costly in terms of predation. However, there is no direct empirical evidence of these costs. I examined whether contact calls of crested tits, Parus cristatus, could attract predators during the nonbreeding season. I compared attack rates on life-like stuffed specimens with and without playbacks of trilled long-range calls and high-pitched, short-range calls. Crested tit models without playbacks were used as controls. Crested tit models with playbacks of long-range contact calls were attacked significantly more often by sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, than the models with playbacks of high-pitched sounds and those without playbacks. These results suggest that calling increases the risk of predation for wintering tits and provide support for the assumption that conspicuous long-distance calling is costly in terms of predation. That models with playbacks of high-pitched signals were attacked at lower rates may indicate that predators cannot hear short-range communication calls as well as the long-range calls.

AB Although group foragers have the potential to enhance their patch choice decisions by observing the sampling behaviour of competitors (i.e. using 'public information'), empirical support for such an ability is sparse and conflicting. We examined whether wild blackbirds, Turdus merula, were more likely to choose the richer (20-fold) of two seminatural food patches if they had seen other blackbirds (demonstrators) feeding in them beforehand. There was no evidence that birds having such preharvest public information preferentially selected the richer patch, even if their choice was not limited by the continuing presence of dominant demonstrators. Nor did patch selectors favour the patch occupied by a demonstrator (or just vacated by one) despite an above-average probability that these patches were the richer. Instead, our birds often showed preferences for one or other of the otherwise identical patch locations, were more likely to select the rich patch if it had not changed location since their last visit, and avoided dominant conspecifics. We conclude that preharvest public information has little or no influence on blackbird patch choice decisions. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many studies have concluded that buzzards, Buteo buteo, are strongly territorial but a minority have suggested that some buzzards can share ranges. We radiotracked 146 buzzards from fledging for up to 4 years. In their first year, distances of buzzards from the nearest nest were least if it was their natal nest. To determine if this represented positive association with their own nest, or avoidance of strange nests by birds that had dispersed, we compared observed buzzard locations with random locations within a predefined distance from nests. There was strong association of buzzards with their own nests in their first autumn and winter; dispersed birds did not avoid other nests significantly but spaced themselves between them. In their first autumn, neighbouring sibling buzzards had closer activity centres and had a greater tendency to overlap their home ranges than nonsiblings, irrespective of distance from the natal nest. However, both effects disappeared with age: core ranges, which included the densest 90% of locations, become strongly exclusive in older buzzards. These results show that buzzards are able to share territories with their parents and siblings in their first year, but not when older. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although much is known about individual recognition, little is known about the representations that individual animals have of other individuals. We examined the nature of this knowledge in golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus, using habituation-discrimination techniques. Male hamsters were first familiarized with two females; they were later habituated to one type of odour (vaginal secretions, flank gland, urine or ear scent) from one of these females and tested for cross-habituation (generalization) to another odour from the same female. Cross-habituation was shown across three of these odours (vaginal secretions, flank gland and ear scent). This effect did not occur if the males had not been familiarized with the female scent donors. These results show that males generalized between two scents from the same individual, presumably because the two odours had the same meaning. The results suggest that males formed integrated, multicomponent representations of females. Additional experiments showed that the cross-habituation effect requires interaction between individuals; mere exposure to the odours of an individual in its home cage is not sufficient. Cross-habituation between different odours did not occur when urine was used as one of the stimuli, even though urine was individually distinguishable. We suggest that the reason for this is that urine is too costly to be used for communication in this species because of selection for conservation of water.

AB Studies dealing with spatial orientation in mammals have mostly dealt with surface-dwelling species. We studied the ability of a subterranean rodent to orient in space and compared it with two species of rodents that spend most of their lives above ground. The solitary blind mole-rat, Spalax ehrenbergi, inhabits an extensive, branching tunnel system that it digs itself and in which it spends its entire life. We examined its ability to learn and remember a winding path towards a goal in a multiple labyrinth and compared it with Levant voles, Microtus guentheri, and laboratory rats, Rattus norvegicus. The mole-rats learned significantly faster than the rats and voles. Furthermore, their ability to remember the maze was significantly better than that of the rats after 2, 7, 30 and 60 days from the end of the learning experiment and significantly better than the voles after 120 days. The mole-rats still retained ca. 45% of their optimal performance at the end of the learning experiment after 4 months compared with 20% for the voles after 4 months and less than 20% for the rats after 2 months. Despite having lost its vision, the mole-rat was thus more able to orient in a complex maze than the surface-dwelling vole and laboratory rat. We-suggest that the mole-rat compensates for the sensory limitations imposed by the subterranean niche and for its loss of vision by relying on the Earth's magnetic field and internal cues to steer its course efficiently. We discuss the possible mechanisms of orientation. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Initial interactions with prey may affect a predator's subsequent foraging success. With experience, second-instar Misumena vatia spiderlings (Thomisidae) that had recently emerged from their egg sacs oriented faster to fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) than naive individuals. Orientation time of these spiderlings decreased rapidly for the first two to three runs (every third day) in a simple laboratory setting, and then remained low and relatively constant. Time to capture a fly also declined initially, but subsequently became extremely variable, increasing prior to moult. Increase in capture time and the failure to capture prey appeared associated with impending moult, rather than satiation. Spiderlings oriented to prey more rapidly at the beginning of the third instar than at the start of the second instar, suggesting that experience still enhanced performance after a moult cycle. Overall capture times at the beginning of the third instar, decreased from those at the end of the second instar, but did not differ significantly from the beginning of the second instar, although spiderlings gaining the most biomass had the shortest mean capture times. In a second experiment, time to orient and time to capture prey did not differ in naive, second-instar siblings run 1 and 3 days after emergence from their egg sacs. However, 3-day individuals that had captured prey each day (confiscated before they could feed) oriented faster than naive 3-day-old siblings, but did not differ in the time taken to capture prey. Experience, rather than age or energetic condition, best explains these changes in performance. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many species, females can improve their fitness by preferring particular males over others. In Palaearctic water frogs of the Rana lessonae/R. esculenta complex the consequences of such mate choice are particularly pronounced. To produce viable offspring, the hybrid R. esculenta (genotype RL) must mate with the parental species R. lessonae (LL); but R. lessonae should avoid mating with R. esculenta, because the resulting hybrid offspring will eliminate the L genome from the germline (hybridogenesis). Hence, there exists a conflict between the sexual parasite (RL) and its sexual host (LL) over the best mating partner. Previous studies have shown a preference for LL males in LL and RL females; but they have also shown that females cannot usually realize their choice when in close proximity to males, because the males forcefully and indiscriminately amplex them. We tested whether females use male vocalizations as a long-distance signal to increase their chances of mating with the preferred LL males. We exposed female R. lessonae and R. esculenta to playbacks of single LL and RL mating calls (experiment 1) and to choruses with a 3:1 excess of LL and RI, calls, respectively (experiment 2). In experiment 1, both female types were attracted more by the LL than by the RL calls. In experiment 2, no discrimination between LL- and RL-dominated choruses was observed. The results suggest that females do not use distant male vocalization to approach preferentially ponds or arenas within a pond that hold an excess of LL males. But once they have arrived in a chorus, mating calls from nearby males can direct them to the preferred LL mates. We discuss possible reasons for the failure to discriminate between choruses and the chances for successful choice between individuals within choruses.

AB The way in which novel learned behaviour patterns spread through animal populations remains poorly understood, despite extensive field research and the recognition that such processes play an important role in the behavioural development, social interactions and evolution of many animal species. We conducted a series of controlled diffusions of foraging information in replicate experimental populations of the guppy, Paecilia reticulata. We presented novel foraging tasks over 15 trials to mixed-sex groups, made up of food-deprived and nonfood-deprived adults (experiment 1) or small, young fish and old, large adults (experiment 2). In these diffusions, knowledge of a route to a feeder could spread through the group by subjects learning from others, discovering the route for themselves, or, most likely, by some combination of these social and asocial learning processes. We found a striking sex difference, with novel foraging information spreading at a significantly faster rate through subgroups of females than of males. Females both discovered the goal and learned the route more quickly than males. Food-deprived individuals were faster at completing the tasks over the 15 trials than nonfood-deprived guppies, and there was a significant interaction between sex and size, with a sex difference in adults but not young individuals. There was also an interaction between sex and hunger level, with food deprivation having a stronger effect on male than female performance. We suggest that information may diffuse in a similar nonrandom or 'directed' manner through many natural populations of animals. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   CONFIDENCE; EVOLUTION; BIRDS; COPULATIONS; CUCKOLDRY
AB Extrapair paternity is common among many songbird species yet few studies have quantified male extraterritorial foray (ETF) effort and examined potential trade-offs. One potentially important constraint for males is the need to provide parental care. Current models of male extrapair mating tactics propose that males reduce extraterritorial foray effort:later in the breeding season because they face a trade-off between feeding nestlings versus pursuing extrapair matings. However, detailed field studies examining the trade-off between paternal care and male extraterritorial forays are lacking. We used radiotelemetry to quantify male extraterritorial foray effort in hooded warblers, Wilsonia citrina, to test the widely held predictions that: (1) males make significantly fewer and shorter forays during the nestling stage relative to other stages (i.e. fertile and incubating stages); and (2) male extraterritorial foray effort is negatively correlated with parental effort. Males made 0.87 +/- 0.09 forays/h and spent on average 12.2% of their time foraying off territory. Results were equivocal; some data suggested male foray effort decreased in relation to parental care, while other data suggested otherwise. Pairwise tests controlling for (1) extrapair mating opportunity among males and (2) male, territory and social mate quality revealed a possible trade-off between the mean duration and percentage of time in extraterritorial foray versus providing parental care. Conversely, results also revealed (1) no difference in foray rate, foray duration or percentage of time spent off territory over the various stages of the breeding season, (2) no relationship between male foray effort and male feeding rate, and (3) no difference in foray rate in pairwise comparisons, controlling for variability in extrapair mating opportunity and male quality. Overall, the trade-off between providing male parental care and pursuing alternative mating tactics may not be as strong for male hooded warblers as once hypothesized because males dedicated relatively little time to seeking extrapair copulations off territory.

TI Leaf caching in <i>Atta</i> leafcutting ants:: discrete cache formation
   through positive feedback
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID SOCIAL INSECTS; ORGANIZATION; WORK
AB We examined the occurrence, mechanism and costs and benefits of leaf caching in laboratory colonies of two species of leafcutting ants, Atta cephalotes and A. colombica. If foragers returning to the nest are unable to enter because of a temporary bottleneck caused by leaves building up they may deposit their leaf pieces outside the nest entrance, forming a leaf cache. Similar leaf caches occur in the field at foraging trail junctions, obstacles on the trail and within nest entrance tunnels. Foraging ants carrying leaves were presented with different-sized leaf caches and the number dropping their leaves on the cache was recorded. The probability of a forager dropping her leaf was positively correlated with the size of the cache that she encountered. Therefore, positive feedback played a role in the formation of nest entrance caches. Cached pieces were more likely to be retrieved than noncached pieces but the time taken to retrieve leaf pieces from a cache was greater than from scattered groups of leaves. We suggest that the strategy of flexible nest entrance caching is an adaptive response to fluctuating food availability and collection. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male and female Elephantodeta nobilis duet with the female responding to the male's long and complex call. The duetting male's call consisted of four parts, described here as parts A, B, C and D. We found that the female replied 570 ms after the male's D pulse, which followed the extended part B and short click of part C. Noncalling males were attracted to the duet and often used satellite tactics by inserting a volley of clicks 200 ms before the alpha male's D pulse. Satellite males used part C of the alpha male song to cue their own call and this inserted call induced females to reply earlier compared with the alpha male call alone. Alpha males often extended their calls with additional D-type calls and so we examined the effectiveness of these calls as countermeasures to satellite,calling, There was no influence of this alpha strategy on the satellite's propensity to call although more calls from the alpha male did cause the female to reply more frequently. We also examined the effect of relative intensity of alpha and satellite calls on the female's reply. Reduced satellite intensity increased the variance in the timing of the female response. Finally, we tested the effectiveness of the satellite's call on female phonotaxis within a two-speaker arena. Although females preferred the alpha male they were nevertheless attracted to the satellite calls regardless of the latter's relative intensity. We discuss the possible role of satellite calling as a novel conditional Strategy. (C) 2000 The Association for thr Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB There is no information on whether the daily foraging movements of fish shoals are the result of chance, the collective will of all shoalmates, or the leadership of a few individuals. This study tested the latter possibility. Shoals of 12 golden shiners, Notemigonus crysoleucas, were trained to expect food around midday in one of the brightly lit corners of their tank. They displayed daily food-anticipatory activity by leaving the shady area of their tank and spending more:and more time in the food corner up to the normal time of feeding. Past this normal time they remained in the shade, even on test days when no food was delivered. Most of these experienced individuals were then replaced by naive ones. The resulting ratio of experienced naive fish could be 5:7, 3:9 or 1:11. On their own, naive individuals would normally spend the whole day in the shade, but in all tests the experienced individual(s) were able to entrain these more numerous naive fish out of the shade and into the brightly lit food corner at the right time of day. Entrainment was stronger in the 5:7 than in the 1:11 experiment. The test shoals never split up and were always led by the same fish, presumably the experienced individual. These results indicate that in a strongly gregarious species, such as the golden shiner, a minority of informed individuals can lead a shoal to food, either through social facilitation of foraging movements' or by eliciting following behaviour.

AB In large mating aggregations of red-sided garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, in Manitoba, male courtship is directed not only to females, but also to other males with female-like skin lipids ('she-males'). We show that 'she-maleness' is an intrinsic property of:a male rather than an artefact of lipid transfer from females, and that male-male courtship is very common in the field. She-males were distinctive in terms of appearance (they were heavier than other males and more often covered with mud), behaviour (they were inactive and rarely courted females) and performance (they were slow crawlers, ineffective courters and easily outcompeted by other males in mating trials). 'She-maleness' was not a characteristic of a particular subset of males, as envisaged in previous. work; instead, it was a transitory phase that most (perhaps all) male snakes passed through soon after they first-emerged from the winter den. Recently emerged males spent their first day or two relatively inactive, while restoring physiological functions (including locomotor performance and courtship ability). Experimental application of female skin lipids on to males dramatically decreased courtship levels of the recipient snakes. Thus, recently emerged males may derive two kinds of benefit from mimicking female skin lipids. First, female mimicry 'switches off' the male's own (energetically expensive) courtship at a time when that courtship would be unproductive. Second, it may disadvantage his rivals by distracting:them from females, and increasing their energy expenditure. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The higher metabolic rate of dominant individuals, found in different species, has been interpreted as the cost that prevents subordinates from cheating by adopting large badges of status. However, an alternative prediction for status-signalling species, in which subordinates may recognize dominants, is that subordinates have the higher metabolic rate because of the greater stress of locating and actively avoiding aggressive interactions with them. In this study, the size of the black bib of the siskin, Carduelis spinus, which is a badge of dominance, was negatively correlated with metabolic rate in daylight, even when controlling for the bird's activity level in the respirometer chamber and its body mass. The size of the black bib, however, was not correlated with metabolic rate in darkness. This suggests that the difference between dominance classes is not related to intrinsic physiological differences, but that subordinates are more susceptible to stressful conditions. When controlling for metabolic rate, a positive correlation appeared between dominance status and body mass. This stresses the importance of knowing the effects of social status on energy requirements for understanding the relationship between body mass and dominance. We conclude that maintaining a high social status may be more stressful to subordinates than to dominant birds. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Wild Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana, of Tai forest, Ivory Coast, are preyed upon by leopards, Panthera pardus, and chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. These two predators differ in their main hunting tactic and Diana monkeys attempt to avoid predation with two distinct antipredator strategies: conspicuous alarm-calling behaviour to leopards and silent, cryptic behaviour to chimpanzees. However, the Diana monkeys' choice of the appropriate antipredator strategy is complicated by the fact that chimpanzees themselves also fall prey to leopards. Chimpanzees give loud and conspicuous alarm screams when they detect a leopard. When these chimpanzees' leopard alarm calls were played back to different groups of Diana monkeys, in about half of the cases recipients switched from a chimp-specific cryptic response to a leopard-specific conspicuous response, suggesting that some individuals assumed the presence of a leopard. Groups whose home range was in the core area of the resident chimpanzee community were more likely to respond this way than more peripheral groups, indicating between-group differences in semantic knowledge. In a follow-up experiment, the monkeys' understanding of the chimpanzee alarm calls was further assessed with a prime-probe technique. Monkeys were primed with chimpanzee alarm calls and then, 5 min later, tested with leopard growls to see whether they were able to anticipate the presence of a leopard. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that monkeys responding cryptically to chimpanzee alarm calls did so because they were not able to understand the calls' meaning. Data are discussed with respect to three possible cognitive mechanisms, associative learning, specialized learning programmes, and causal reasoning, that could have led to causal knowledge in some individuals but not others.

TI Multiple patterns of parental care
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE STRATEGIES; MATE DESERTION; MODEL; PENDULINUS
AB Many animals show multiple patterns of parental care, where more than one of the four basic patterns (biparental care, uniparental care by males or females, or no care) is present within a single population during a single breeding season. We consider three reasons for the existence of multiple patterns of parental care: (1) mixed-strategy behaviours; (2) time-dependent behaviour with parents changing their care decision during the breeding season; and (3) quality differences between individuals leading to different care decisions being made depending on the qualities of both parents. The basic framework we use to investigate these is a two-stage game-theoretical model, and we highlight the importance of including feedback between the parental care decisions made by population members and the probability that a deserting individual will find a new mate. Including this feedback may introduce a nonlinear dependence of the fitness payoffs on the frequencies with which the pure strategies ('care' and 'desert') are played by each of the sexes. This can have important consequences for the existence of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs). For example, mixed-strategy ESSs may exist tan outcome forbidden if the feedback is not included), and, in one model, the feedback also prevents uniparental care by either sex from being evolutionarily stable. We also point out that decisions made by animals without dependent offspring can have important consequences for observed parental care behaviour.

AB Workers in queenless colonies of the ant Leptothorax gredleri form dominance hierarchies by antennation bouts and biting. The frequency of aggressive interactions peaked when the ants became active again after hibernation, a second time in summer, when new workers eclosed from overwintered brood, and a third time when we experimentally removed the queen. High-ranking individuals were more active and had greater ovarian development than their low-ranking nestmates. We investigated what proximately determines a worker's social status. Neither age, previously shown to affect hierarchy rank in several other social insects, nor levels of fluctuating asymmetry appeared to be important in worker rank orders in L. gredleri, High-ranking workers were on average larger than low-ranking individuals and body size and rank were correlated in four of five colonies investigated. However, individuals of similar age but different social status did not differ in size. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   COMMUNICATION; POLYCHROTIDAE; CAROLINENSIS; METABOLISM; HANDICAP
AB Current theory on the evolution of pursuit-deterrent signals predicts that it may be advantageous for the prey to communicate to the predator its alertness and its ability to escape an attack. I tested these predictions by staging predator-prey encounters between A. cristatellus lizards and a model of one of its predators under natural conditions. Results supported the use of pushup displays as pursuit-deterrent signals. The intensity of signals, measured as the number of pushups given during predation episodes, was significantly positively correlated with individual physiological condition measured as endurance capacity. Because endurance capacity can be a critical aspect limiting the ability of A. cristatellus to escape a predatory attack, pushup displays can potentially communicate an individual's ability to escape an attack and, therefore, can be categorized as honest signals. furthermore, because pushup displays are widely used during anoline social interactions, predation pressure and sexual selection may simultaneously favour the evolution of honest communication to allow both the predator and the potential mate or male rival to assess individual quality using the same signal.

AB Reproductive skew models have greatly enhanced the study of sociality but are applicable only to societies where the aim of the members of the group is to reproduce. In 'foraging societies', where the aim of the members of the group is to grow, quite different parameters will govern the form that the societies take. We examined factors that influence the structure of foraging groups in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola (Eresidae). In particular, we examined food distribution and consumption within groups, and how this related to predictions derived from two models. One model indicates that colonies in which individuals compete for resources via interference competition are more likely to survive than those in which individuals divide resources using scramble competition. The second model predicts the proportions of hunters, cheaters and scavengers expected in foraging groups. We found that food was not distributed evenly among group members, and that spiders that fed primarily on the head and thorax of the prey during the middle of a feeding event gained the most body mass. Spiders even lost mass if they fed only in the last hour of a foraging event. Large spiders had a competitive advantage (via interference competition) in obtaining preferred positions, and could ingest food faster than small spiders. Distributing food among colony members in this manner could cause large size differences between colony members, as predicted by the models. The implications of competitive foraging for sociality are discussed. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that members of many territorial species use naturally occurring landmarks to define the boundaries of their territories. In the work reported here, we first tested whether artificial landmarks would be adopted as boundaries by territorial male cicada killer wasps, Sphecius speciosus. To perform this test, we set out wooden dowels on a flat, grassy lawn on which male wasps were defending mating territories. The dowels were situated so that they did not coincide with any existing territorial boundary. After we provided the dowels, the wasps established new territorial boundaries coinciding with the dowels. We hypothesized that using visual landmarks as territorial borders might lower defensive costs, and indeed, focal samples on territorial wasps revealed that borders that were defined by dowels cost less to defend than did borders that were not defined by any landmark. This result suggests that the use of natural landmarks as territorial boundaries may have evolved as a result of the reduced defensive costs that accrue to these boundaries. Furthermore, defensive costs may not depend directly on territory size: territory owners may be able to reduce defensive costs by selecting sites with high tactical defensibility.

   MELOSPIZA-GEORGIANA; EVOLUTION; PERCEPTION; SELECTION; PATTERNS
AB Vocal learning in swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, is subject to a host of sensory and motor limitations. One such limitation is that young swamp sparrows almost invariably crystallize their songs with a simple trilled syntax, irrespective of the syntax of vocal models from which they learn. A striking exception to this pattern was recently identified by Podos (1996, Animal Behaviour, 51, 1061-1070), who found that large-scale organizational changes in vocal syntax, including the production of an intermittent or 'broken' syntax, were produced when birds faced limits on vocal performance capacities during motor ontogeny. Our goal in the present study was to determine whether song models with broken syntax could serve as suitable training models for young swamp sparrows, and, if so, if broken syntax could be faithfully reproduced. We hand-reared 10 male swamp sparrows and exposed them to control, rapid and broken song models. Control song models were copied with a high degree of accuracy, as in previous studies. Rapid song models were copied with deficiencies that;suggested performance limits on vocal production; such deficiencies included the production of songs with broken syntax and the production of songs in which notes were dropped out as songs progressed. Broken songs proved suitable as training models. Furthermore, copies of broken song models were crystallized either with normal or with broken syntax. These data identify an unexpected direction of permissiveness in the types of songs swamp sparrows will memorize and accurately reproduce, and also point to a possible proximate basis for syntactical changes in the evolution of sparrow songs.

ID MALE SEXUAL ORNAMENTS; FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY; SELECTION
AB We used a four-arm choice chamber to investigate whether the symmetry of artificial traits (leg bands) influenced how attractive male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were to females, and whether a female's preference was influenced by the opportunity to interact with males during choice tests. Females (N=10) were tested separately and moved freely between the chamber's arms, each of which contained a male wearing bands (two per leg) in symmetric, asymmetric or cross-asymmetric configurations. In three of the six tests experienced by each female, one-way glass (mounted diagonally within each arm) prevented males from seeing the female or their own reflection. During the other three tests, transparent glass was used, so males could see and react to the female. A male's band combination had a significant influence on the amount of time that females spent with him, but only during transparent-glass tests, where symmetric males were preferred. The results of our transparent-glass tests were similar to those reported by Swaddle & Cuthill (1994, Nature, 367, 165-166), in a study where females selected between males that were interacting with their own mirror images (reflected by one-way glass). We discuss why females display the same apparent preference when tested with males engaged in intra- (Swaddle & Cuthill's study) versus intersexual activities (our study). Since females in our study displayed a preference only when males could interact with them, caution may be required when extrapolating the results of static choice tests (e.g. involving models, one-way glass or video images) to situations where the participants can interact.

ID SEXUAL SELECTION; FEMALES COPY; OTHERS
AB In four experiments, we examined effects on affiliative preferences of 'focal' male Japanese quail of seeing a conspecific female interact with another male. Each experiment was conducted in three 10-min phases: (1) a pretest during which a focal male chose between two females; (2) an observation phase, when each focal male watched the female he had spent more time near during the pretest (his 'preferred' female) interact with another male (referred to as a 'model' male); and (3) a post-test, during which each focal male again chose between his nonpreferred and preferred females. Focal males decreased their preferences for preferred females after seeing them together with a model male, even when preferred females and model males were separated by a transparent barrier that prevented them from mating, but allowed them to court. A focal male's preference for his preferred female did not decrease when the female mated with a model male out of sight of the focal male. These first results could reflect a tendency for males simply to avoid areas where they saw conspecifics courting. However, focal males also showed reduced preferences for preferred females they bad seen mate when the locations of preferred and nonpreferred females were reversed between observation and post-test phases of the experiment and the effects of transposition were controlled for. We concluded that male quail tend to avoid areas that recently contained courting pairs, as well as particular females, seen courting. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We conducted an experiment to investigate whether the presence of a conspecific model can promote the acquisition of a motor task in common ravens. For this purpose, dyads, either of control birds or of model-observer pairings, were allowed to operate together in an arena with a set of identical boxes. Each box consisted of two compartments each containing a reward of three pieces of meat.:The compartments were closed by gliding lids with red flaps on their front, opening horizontally in opposite directions. Naive control individuals opened the lids exclusively by levering, that is, jumping on top of the box, inserting the beak at the posterior rim of the lid and pushing it open. Models were trained to demonstrate an alternative opening technique, pulling at the front flap, then jumping on top of;the box to get at the reward. In contrast to the control birds, observers initially opened boxes both ways, by pulling and levering. Furthermore, observers approached the boxes more quickly and showed less fearful behaviour than the control birds, which we attribute to the enhancing effect of the model. We discuss both stimulus enhancement and motor imitation as possible learning mechanisms. Even though observers initially obtained a considerable amount of reward produced by the models, scrounging evidently did not inhibit learning.

AB Variation in female behaviour has only recently received attention in studies of sexual selection. It has been suggested that females may invest differentially in their offspring in relation to the quality of their mate. This may lead to females that mate with high-quality and/or attractive males laying larger clutches. Females may also differ in their ability to choose between males. For example, females in good physical condition may make better choices. If physical condition and clutch size are positively correlated, this hypothesis could also produce a relationship between male attractiveness and female clutch size. We found, in lekking black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, that females mated to the highest ranked males laid the largest clutches. Furthermore we found, regardless of female age, a positive relationship between a measure of female condition and male rank but not between female condition and her clutch size. In addition, females in good condition visited a larger number of different male territories, and old females produced the largest clutches. Our results suggest two mechanisms to explain our findings. First, females in good physical condition tend to mate with the top males, suggesting an assortative mating pattern. Second, females mating with the highest ranked males lay larger clutches as a consequence of their choice. In general, our result calls for caution in evaluating studies that look at the consequences of mate choice. It may be that differences in female quality produce effects that may be wrongly interpreted as male quality effects. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Social diffusion of modified louse egg-handling techniques during
   grooming in free-ranging Japanese macaques
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID CAPUCHIN MONKEYS; BEHAVIOR; IMITATION
AB Changes in louse egg-handling techniques during grooming were studied among a free-ranging troop of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, from 1990 to 1997 at Jigokudani Monkey Park, the Shiga Heights, Nagano prefecture, Japan, where the skills were distributed based on matrilineages. One female altered her louse egg-handling technique from a one-hair combing technique, in which macaques comb a single hair with an egg without first loosening the cement of the egg, to a forefinger nail loosening technique, in which macaques use the nail of the forefinger to loosen an egg before combing. Therefore, louse egg-handling skills were not fixed, but could change. This female's new technique was later adopted by her sister, daughters and granddaughter. Not all elements of the technique were acquired at the same time, however, and individuals varied in when they acquired them. These shifts suggest that the mechanism of acquiring louse egg-handling techniques is information transfer of the partial functions and partial structure of the techniques together with individual learning. One female's initial technique (skin pinching), against which groomees reacted, was replaced by the forefinger nail loosening technique even though the techniques, once mastered, were equally efficient and the new;technique was initially less efficient. The social interaction between grooming partners may thus impede the diffusion of the harmful behaviour. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Parasites ran profoundly affect host morphology and behaviour, but previous work has focused on the effects bf parasites on males. In the present study, we assessed the effects of infection with the nematode Ascaridia galli on the morphology and behaviour, including mate choice, of female red junglefowl. Hens infected with A. galli had-lower mass and smaller combs than unparasitized birds when sexually mature. Parasite status had a significant effect on social rank in all-female flocks, with high-ranking birds being less likely to be parasitized. Larger females had higher social rank, but comb size was unrelated to Social Status. Neither parasite status nor social rank had any effect on mate,choice. These results differ from those found for male red junglefowl, and suggest that, males and females may allocate resources differently to comb versus growth, The low cost of choice in the red junglefowl mating system may also contribute to the lack of an effect of parasites and social status on mate choice.

AB Preferences of fish for different types of shoals may influence the transmission of novel information through them. We investigated the factors influencing the preferences of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, for different shoals in order to shed some light on how information transmission occurs. Adult subjects were given a choice between swimming with two diverging shoals of conspecifics that differed with respect to key characteristics. In six choice experiments, subjects discriminated between shoal partners on the basis of: (1) shoal size, subjects preferring a shoal of 10 to a single fish; (2) size of shoaling fish, small fish preferring small conspecifics rather than an equal number of large fish, while large fish showed no preference; (3) local foraging experience of shoaling fish, shoals containing fish that had previously been repeatedly fed in the experimental tank being preferred to shoals with no such experience; and (4) familiarity of shoaling fish, guppies preferring familiar rather than unfamiliar conspecifics. No discrimination on the basis of colour or hunger was observed. In addition, following a shoal to a food site on just three trials allowed guppies to learn a route, or food site, preference. Guppies were considerably more likely to learn to adopt the behaviour shown by members of a shoal of several demonstrators than an alternative behaviour shown by a single conspecific demonstrator. The relationship between preferences for different shoals and the social transmission of information is discussed in the light of these findings. The results suggest that shoaling preferences may strongly influence-the social transmission of novel foraging information or feeding preferences through fish populations, and imply that learned information may diffuse through fish populations in a nonrandom, or directed, manner.

AB A sexual size dimorphism usually occurs when size-dependent reproductive advantages exist in only one sex. Studies on Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, have demonstrated reproductive size advantages in females but not in males, even though males and females are similar in body size. We conducted mate-choice and mate-copying tests in which a female could first associate with, then mate with, either a large (greater than or equal to 1 so + (X) over bar standard length) or a small male (less than or equal to 1 so - (X) over bar standard length). Large males obtained a mating advantage in both tests, and both mate choice and mate competition influenced their mating success. In the majority of trials, females associated with large males. Association preferences of females corresponded to their mating preferences when mate competition between males was weak; however, when mate competition was strong, large males obtained almost every mating regardless of female association preference. Preference for large males may provide females with a reproductive advantage if males mate multiply because small males become sperm-depleted sooner than large males. We found no indication that females copied the mating decisions of other females. Repeatability of female mating preference was low, not because females mated at random with respect to male size, but because most females consistently preferred large males. We also conducted mating tests at four density levels and found that large males maintained their mating advantage relative to small males at all densities. Thus, male and female medaka may be similar in body size because large size provides a fecundity advantage for females, as demonstrated in previous studies, and large size provides a mating advantage for males, as demonstrated in our study.

AB Although previous laboratory studies have commonly determined sprinting speeds of lizards on horizontal surfaces, the speeds and slopes used during the escapes of lizards in natural habitats with variable inclines are virtually unstudied. To quantify performance and the use of inclined surfaces during escape, we took advantage of the footprints left in soft substrate and the simple surface topography of the natural dune habitat of the Mojave fringe-toed lizard, U. scoparia. The lengths of 52 escape paths ranged from 1.7-34 m, and the inclines of I-m portions of escape paths ranged from -25 degrees to 28 degrees, which effectively encompassed the entire range of inclines in the habitat. The cumulative frequencies (N=550) of inclines along l-m intervals of the escape paths were not a simple random sample of the habitat. Less than 10% of the cumulative distance travelled during escape was bipedal, and the escape paths were relatively straight. Trajectories of the first metre of escapes were oriented significantly away from the presumed threat (observer) but were random with respect to the orientation of both the nearest cover and steepest incline. Eleven per cent of the cumulative number (N=1382) of strides measured were within 90% of the maximum stride length within each path. Multiple regressions revealed that stride lengths (and hence speed) during escapes in the field were maximized on level surfaces with no turning. For lizards tested on a level racetrack in the laboratory, maximum speeds averaged 2.8 mis (range=2.1-3.9) and approximated 75% of the maximum performance attained in the field.

AB We studied the function of learning in the parasitoid Leptopilina heterotoma by looking at discrimination of odour stimuli used in foraging for a host. To optimize the rate of encounters with hosts, these parasitoids are expected to assess the extent to which variation in host-substrate odours is reliably associated with variation in the presence of hosts, that is, substrate profitability. Where the association is reliable, parasitoids should attend to variation in odours and discriminate between them; where it is not, they should ignore it. We hypothesized that foraging decisions are based on the completeness of information the animal has about differences in substrate profitabilities. Our laboratory studies showed that discrimination and non-discrimination of odour stimuli are dynamic behavioural decisions that can be related to the degree of substrate variation and to an animal's informational state. In wind-tunnel studies, females learned to discriminate between odours from substrates that were qualitatively different, for example, between odours from apple and pear substrates or between yeast substrates with different C-6, compounds added. They did not discriminate when differences were small (e,g. between odours from two apple varieties or between yeast patches with different concentrations of ethyl acetate), unless unrewarding experiences provided evidence of the absence of hosts in one of the substrates. Hence, we suggest that non-discrimination between odour stimuli in L. heterotoma is not a lack of ability to discriminate but a functional decision by the parasitoid.

AB I examined the number of lifetime mating opportunities and mating behaviour of males in two sexually cannibalistic species, the Mediterranean, Iris oratoria, and bordered, Stagmomantis limbata, praying mantids (Mantodea: Mantidae). Two approaches estimated the number of lifetime mating opportunities: direct observations of intersexual encounters in the field, and an encounter model. I collected behavioural observations, together with ecological data for use in the model, over three field seasons. The ecological data included an assessment of the feeding condition of S. limbata females in nature; the females fed at a level comparable to females maintained on an abundant diet in the laboratory. As for the number of mating opportunities, individual males of both species encountered two or more females, as predicted by the model. I observed no male, however, in more than one copulation. This result could reflect individual variation in the times and places of sexual activity or an actual low number of mating opportunities in the field. Furthermore, a higher percentage of I. oratoria males encountered two or more females than S, limbata males, as the model indicates. Fewer mating opportunities could lead to greater selection upon S. limbata males to ensure paternity at each mating, which can explain the longer copulation times observed for S. limbata males. I considered two hypotheses about male behaviour in light of the number of lifetime encounters with females: male suicide and male reduction of the risk of cannibalism. Behavioural observations do not strongly support male suicide in either species. Certain male behaviours, such as the nature of copulatory position and, in captivity, mounting females from the rear, are consistent with the idea that males behave so as to reduce the probability that they are cannibalized during intersexual encounters. Moreover, male I. oratoria preferentially mount well-fed, fecund females in captivity. Taken together, these results suggest that the prospect of multiple mating opportunities has :influenced male mating behaviour over evolutionary time.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID GUPPY POECILIA-RETICULATA; SEXUAL SELECTION; BLACK GROUSE; FEMALES COPY;
   OTHERS
AB Mate-choice copying has recently been demonstrated in several species. Two, not mutually exclusive, explanations for copying have been proposed: it reduces sampling costs and/or error of mate choice. In guppies, Poecilia reticulata, and black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, young females seem most likely to copy. Therefore, copying may teach inexperienced females what attractive males look like. I developed a 2-year dynamic model, to investigate under which conditions a mate-copying strategy might first evolve. An original population of pure choosers was assumed, which was invaded by a mutant female, able to copy during her first mating season, thereby instantly improving her ability to assess male quality. Alternatively, she could either wait and learn by observing males, just as non-copiers may do, but incurring some time costs, or choose, relying on her own abilities. The degree to which copying occurred among these mutant, young, inexperienced females increased with an increasing proportion of old, experienced females in the population, and with decreasing time left until the end of the season. The model demonstrates that mate-choice copying may evolve, when young females are poor at discrimination and need to learn what high-quality males look like. Male quality proved to be unimportant for copying to evolve, as long as there are sufficient differences in quality for mate choice to be meaningful. As with previous models, time constraints are an important assumption for copying to be advantageous over non-copying. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Domestic animals that are socialized to humans are often more easily managed and less timid than those that are not. We examined whether increased handling and artificial feeding of domestic sheep, Ovis al ies, at an early age would decrease their subsequent timidity towards people. Forty-eight lamb twin sets were divided into four treatment groups for 2 days of treatment at ages 1-3, 3-5, 5-7 or 7-9 days, Treatment lambs were fed milk replacer and were handled four times/day for 5-min periods. Their twins, used as controls, were left with their dams. Two 5-min tests of lamb temperament were conducted at ages 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 25 days. Testing consisted of a stationary human encounter, in which lambs' responses to a silting person were recorded continuously, and a moving human encounter, in which lambs' responses to a person walking at 0.5 m/2 s were recorded by instantaneous scans. Measures included latency to proximity (<2 m) and arm's reach (<1 m) of the person, time spent in proximity and within arm's reach, average distance (m), mean number of human contacts, number of lambs contacting a person and following/approach/avoidance. Treatment lambs showed significantly greater affinity for humans than their twin controls. The 1-3-day treatment group showed the greatest response to treatment, consistently outperforming controls in all of the above measures. These results suggest that 40 min of positive human contact at age 1-3 days reduces lamb timidity to people. Socialization of lambs to humans need not disrupt the primary lamb-dam bond, and it may have positive management as well as welfare implications.

AB It has been proposed that females use the symmetry of secondary sexual traits to differentiate between potential mates. The vertical bars on male swordtail fish function as a signal that attracts females and deters rival males in one swordtail species. In addition, male courtship behaviour of most Xiphophorus species incorporates serial lateral presentations, which provide females with a clear opportunity to assess males for bilateral symmetry. We tested the hypothesis that X. cortezi females prefer males with a symmetrical bar number by determining whether females switched their preference between two males when we switched which male had a symmetrical number of bars. The ability to manipulate the bars without influencing other male traits allowed us to control for male characters correlated with bar symmetry that females might prefer. The degree of asymmetry in bar number we used was within the degree of asymmetry found for this trait in nature. Females switched their preference between a pair of males when we switched which male was symmetrical for bar number. We discuss the possibility that females prefer a symmetrical bar number as well as an alternative hypothesis. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Advertisement calls and female preferences in allopatric populations of midwife toads, Alytes obstetricans and A. cisternasii, were compared with those in a sympatric population. These species have simple tonal advertisement calls which overlap substantially in frequency and duration. In both species, the duration of male advertisement calls did not differ between an allopatric and a sympatric population. Playback tests suggested that females in allopatric populations preferentially approach low frequency calls and long calls, exerting directional selection for larger males and males with longer calls. Female A. cisternasii from the sympatric zone did not prefer low frequency calls, which could be made by males of A. obstetricans. Similarly, female A. obstetricans from the sympatric zone did not preferentially approach long calls, which could be made by A. cisternasii males. The differences in female preference between sympatry and allopatry follow the expected direction of reproductive character displacement. Within each species, female preferences differed clearly between sympatry and allopatry while male call characteristics did not. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Antennal asymmetry and sexual selection in a cerambycid beetle
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY; PANORPA-JAPONICA; MALES; ORNAMENTS; SUCCESS
AB Cerambycid beetles have exaggerated antennae that are usually sexually size-dimorphic. We investigated the relationship between antenna morphology and sexual selection in the species Stenurella melanura (L.) in which males on average have antennae that are 13% longer than those of females. Males and females aggregate at flowers near oviposition sites for feeding during June-August. We sampled both copulating and single individuals at these sites. Fluctuating asymmetry (a measure of developmental instability) in antennae was considerably larger than in tibia and elytra and males had larger degrees of asymmetry in their antennae than females. Mated individuals did not differ from unmated individuals with respect to any of three size variables, but antennal asymmetry was smaller in mated individuals of both sexes. When two males were released with a female on a flower, males with symmetric antennae more often won the fight over the female than expected by chance. When two females and a male were released on a flower, the male more often preferred the female with more symmetric antennae than expected by chance. These results suggest that antennal symmetry, but not length, is currently under sexual selection. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Aquatically mating male harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, must balance the competing demands of foraging and reproduction while at sea during the breeding season. Time-depth recorders (TDRs) were attached to 31 adult male harbour seals to investigate changes in diving behaviour at Sable Island, Nova Scotia, during the 1992-1994 breeding seasons. Male seals were captured, fitted with TDRs and weighed at the beginning of the season in late May, then recaptured for TDR removal and reweighing at the end of June. Males made deep dives (to maximum depths >20 m) more frequently early in the breeding season, then switched to shallow (less than or equal to 20 m) diving later during the mating period. Deep dives (38.8 +/- 2.2 m; 4.6 +/- 0.1 min) were fairly uniform in shape, appearing flat-bottomed with rapid rates of descent and ascent and long bottom time, but shallow dives (10.5 +/- 0.5 m; 3.0 +/- 0.1 min) were more variable in shape. Rates of mass loss varied inversely with time spent in deep dives, indicating that deep diving behaviour reflects foraging activity. Males lost mass while making shallow dives associated with mating behaviour later in the breeding season. Deep diving occurred more frequently during daylight hours. Shallow dives were predominant at twilight and at night when females are likely to be departing and returning to the island from foraging trips in late lactation. At Sable Island, males may maximize their encounter rates with oestrous females by ceasing to make offshore foraging trips, and increasing the time spent patrolling home ranges and displaying in shallow water near the breeding colony in late lactation. Relatively larger males may have a competitive advantage since they can afford to spend less time making foraging trips away from the concentration of females and more time displaying in shallow water near the shore.

AB We examined the hypothesis that adult diet affects the reproductive success of male Mediterranean fruit flies. In particular we determined whether protein-fed males copulated more frequently than protein-deprived males. Furthermore, we determined whether the nutritional status of their first sexual partner affects the renewal of female receptivity. Males fed no protein copulated at a significantly lower rate than did males fed protein. In both diet groups, size was significantly associated with copulatory success. Protein-deprived males transferred significantly more sperm to their mates than did protein-fed males. However, significantly more females mated to protein-deprived males re-mated on the following day. We conclude that male diet is a Significant factor in determining male reproductive success. Male diet affects the ability to gain copulations with virgin females, and the receptivity of these females to further copulations. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A widespread feature of territorial systems is that residents almost invariably defeat challengers. This phenomenon has been explained by the existence of value asymmetries, variations in resource-holding potential or an 'owners always win' convention. Removal-replacement experiments were performed on 75 robins, Erithacus rubecula, to test these hypotheses. The settling behaviour of newcomers was also examined in order to identify energetic costs incurred during territory establishment. In winter, dominance shifted gradually from removed owners to newcomers with increasing time of newcomer residence, and there was a peak in contest duration at 4-7 days. Removals of newcomers, followed by replacement with another newcomer, confirmed that dominance was determined by the time newcomers were in residence rather than the time original owners were absent. These results support the hypothesis that asymmetries in territory value govern the outcome of contests. It is proposed that high singing rates and low foraging rates of newcomers settling boundaries with neighbours contribute to this asymmetry, skewing outcomes in favour of original owners until replacements are fully established. The key result in this study is that the time at which dominance tends to reverse (5-6 days in winter) is predicted by the time taken for newcomers to settle territory boundaries and achieve base-line foraging effort. In spring, original owners become subordinate almost immediately after removal. Reductions in settlement cost for newcomers, and increases in territory value, are proposed to accelerate dominance reversal. Age and sex effects on dominance suggest that the value asymmetry rule is modified by variations in resource-holding potential. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Extra-pair courtship behaviour of male budgerigars and the effect of an
   audience
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE
AB Male budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, socially monogamous birds, actively pursue extra-pair copulations while breeding in captive flocks. Males are more likely to pursue extra-pair copulations when their mates are inside nestboxes, an apparent audience effect. In this study, it was further confirmed that males are significantly more likely to engage in extra-pair activity when their mates are not able to observe their behaviour, and the evidence suggests that a male's frequency of extra-pair activity is negatively related to his mate's reproductive success, as measured by nestling weight and number of fledglings. A second experiment was designed to separate an audience effect phenomenon from alternative explanations such as time conflicts with mate guarding. Males were given the opportunity to court an extra-pair female both when their mates were present as a potential audience and with no audience present. In both conditions, mates were isolated from both the flock and the test male, removing the need and the opportunity to guard. Males were still significantly more likely to court extra-pair females when their mates could not see them, supporting the audience effect interpretation. It is suggested that female budgerigars may use mate fidelity in assessing male parental qualities; If so, males that court extra-pair females only when their mates cannot observe may avoid weakening an existing pair bond.

AB Songbirds can vary the timing of song production with respect to other singing individuals on a song-by-song timescale, for example birds may overlap songs or alternate singing and thereby avoid overlap. Playback was used to study the information contained in such timing of song exchanges in territorial male robins, Erithacus rubecula. The results are consistent with the idea that interacting with a singer either by overlapping or alternating is a way of indicating the intended receiver whereas non-interactive (loop) playback does not give this information. Furthermore, an overlapping pattern of singing generally elicited responses characteristic of highly aroused males. In robins this is shown by a rapid approach and change to an almost continuous, low amplitude pattern of singing referred to as twittering. Thus overlapping could be taken as indicating a high degree of arousal or a willingness to escalate. The response changed during the experimental period, with twittering responses becoming more common regardless of playback treatment. This result is consistent with experimental males having gathered information from interactions between playback and their neighbours in previous trials, that is, they collected information by eavesdropping.

AB Natural sequences of calls produced by isolated domestic piglets were played to lactating sows (N=24) separated from their litters. Two piglets from each of eight litters were recorded under conditions designed to influence their need for a rapid response from the sow. The 'needy' piglet was the smallest and slowest growing in the litter, had just missed a nursing and was isolated in a relatively cool enclosure. The 'un-needy' litter-mate was the largest and fastest growing, had just nursed and was isolated in a relatively warm enclosure. Calls from the needy piglets were of a higher rate, higher in frequency, and longer than those from the un-needy piglets. Sows responded to playback by orientating towards the loudspeaker and approaching it, by moving about the area near the speaker, by vocalizing and by reducing the duration of their own calls. Sows showed stronger responses to playback from needy piglets than from un-needy piglets by vocalizing more, moving more and spending more time near the playback speaker. Sows responded to the calls of their own piglets and to those from other litters, but showed a stronger response to calls of their own piglets.

ID HOMING PIGEONS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; BEHAVIOR
AB The initial orientation of homing pigeons, Columba livia, immobilized for 30 min just before release or 24 h in advance, was heavily disturbed whereas homing performance was unaffected. Similar results were obtained by transporting the birds in the dark to the release site or driving them in the dark on a circuit around the release site. Both treatments appeared to reinforce the pigeons' tendency to fly in the preferred compass direction, which thus turns out to be an emotional component of orientation. The similarity noted with previous results obtained with magnetic treatments calls for a reconsideration of these results and of current views regarding the role of magnetism in pigeon navigation.

AB An ability to form a map or spatial representation of a home range should facilitate efficient foraging and promote the use of effective escape routes to shelter. Although a few experiments have shown some species of fish are capable of simple spatial behaviour, little is known about the behavioural mechanisms they use to orient as they forage. Whether juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, have the capacity to use conspicuous visual landmarks to help them track a moving resource was investigated. The experiment was then modified to determine whether the salmon could continue to track the resource in the absence of conspicuous visual cues. The salmon followed a moveable food source in the presence and, after retraining, in the absence of distinct coloured landmarks. It is suggested that juvenile salmon may be capable of using multiple forms of cue to help them solve spatial tasks such as tracking a moving resource.

AB Models of female mate sampling assume that females independently assess the quality of individual males. However, several empirical studies indicate that this assumption may not hold true. Females may copy the mate choice of other females, for example to minimize the costs of mate sampling or to increase the benefits of mate choice. This study investigated if mate choice copying is likely to occur on great snipe, Gallinago media, leks. Whether the observed number of females mating in groups differed from a simulated number of females mating in groups, under the null hypothesis of no copying, was tested. There were no significant differences between the observed and simulated number of group mating females. Group matings were not more prevalent when many females mated on the lek, nor towards the end of the mating season, and were not correlated with male mating skew. The number of group mating females for different proportions of copiers in the population was simulated, and the results tested against the observed number of group matings. These simulations indicate that the proportion of copiers in the population was less than 0.2, and not significantly different from zero. It is concluded that mate choice copying is not an important factor in mate selection by female great snipe. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB This study examined how variation in a critical environmental variable, protein content in the adult diet, influenced male mating signals, mating success and male 'quality' in a lekking Hawaiian Drosophila, D. grimshawi. Specifically, the effects of low- and high-protein-containing diets on male physical condition, courtship behaviour, copulation success and adult offspring production were investigated, Potential differences in attractiveness to females were investigated by recording times to mating. Males fed high-protein diets were in better physical condition, courted more vigorously, and mated more often and sooner than males fed low-protein diets. Matings involving males fed a high-protein diet resulted in more eclosing offspring than matings involving low-protein-fed males. Because females control when mating occurs in this species, these results indicate that females may have preferred males fed high-protein diets. The results are discussed in light of recent questions regarding female choice and the possible benefits that females of lekking species might gain by discriminating between males.

AB In animals with limited capacity for aerobic respiration, one possible cost of fighting is the accumulation of the metabolic end products of anaerobic respiration, high concentrations of which are known to limit future potential for behaviour. This possibility was tested by measuring various tissue metabolites in haemolymph and muscle of male swimming crabs following either a period of sustained exercise or a fight. No differences in tissue metabolites were found between winners and losers, suggesting that none of the measured variables acts as a switch causing the eventual loser to give up. Few differences were found between crabs that had fought and controls, both of which differed from exercised crabs in their profiles of tissue metabolites. However, both crabs that had fought and exercised crabs had higher concentrations of muscle glucose than did controls. These results suggest that fighting has limited cost in terms of accumulation of end products of anaerobic respiration, although local mobilization of energy reserves did occur. This conclusion is confirmed by the behavioural study in which the effect of participation in a fight on subsequent agonistic behaviour by the winner was examined. Crabs that had fought were just as likely as controls to initiate and win a second fight staged immediately afterwards. The second fight did not differ from the first in duration or intensity, indicating that participating in a fight has no adverse effects on subsequent scope for action.

AB The energetic cost of signalling may be important in maintaining the honesty of the signal, yet it is rarely measured directly. Oxygen consumption during crowing by roosters, Gallus gallus domesticus, was measured in a closed-circuit indirect calorimeter. Although there was a positive relationship between crowing and O-2 consumption, roosters consumed only 0.005 ml/g/h for each vocalization. Thus at the average crowing rate, O-2 consumption rate would be 15% above standing, which is less than the cost of low-level activities such as feeding, drinking and preening, and over 10 times less than the maximum sustainable metabolic rate. These results contrast with previous reports of high energy consumption during calling in insects and frogs, which approach or exceed maximal levels. Other costs, such as predation and social retaliation, are probably more important than energetic costs in maintaining crowing as an honest signal.

AB The availability of food to fish larvae influences the mean and variance of the growth rate in a cohort. At higher food densities, slower developing herring, Clupea harengus, larvae in the pre-metamorphic stage may co-occur with more developed, post-metamorphic individuals. The development of schooling in herring is closely associated with metamorphosis. To assess whether the presence of schooling conspecifics encouraged the premature development of schooling in larvae, laboratory reared larvae (length 29-31 mm) were exposed to wild-caught schooling juveniles (length 55 mm) for the duration of the experiment. Observations of larvae from the experimental group were carried out for 37 days and the behaviour of the fish was recorded on video for subsequent analysis. These larvae were observed in the presence and absence of schooling juveniles with no food in the observation tank, and a few minutes and Ih after food was added. The behaviour of these two groups (juveniles present and juveniles absent) was compared with that of two additional groups (different rearing densities), where the larvae had not been exposed to schooling herring. The exposure to schooling conspecifics did not affect the degree of interaction among herring larvae unless the juveniles were present in the observation tank. Consequently, in the presence of a school the larvae seemed to opt for the increased protection of the school, regardless of associated disadvantages, such as greater competition for food. These findings are discussed in relation to larval vulnerability to predators. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Male bowerbirds build and decorate bowers to attract females as copulation partners. Spotted bowerbirds, Chlamydera maculata, are atypical in having widely spaced display sites, bowers that are greatly diverged from those of closely related species, and extremely intense, aggressive displays. Results from the continuous monitoring of bowers show that (1) a few males account for the majority of matings, (2) the two most common decoration types, bones and glass, explain a large proportion of the variation in male mating success and (3) large inter-bower distances relate to low levels of decoration stealing and bower destruction. Components of male mating success, male ability to attract female visitors to the bower, and male courtship success correlate respectively with counts of bones and glass. Bones are spread widely around the bower and glass is placed close to it supporting the hypothesis that bones act to attract females towards the bower and glass functions later to stimulate females in the bower. This temporal sequencing of courtship functions represents a novel explanation for the evolution of complex male display traits.

ID WARNING COLORATION; DISTASTEFUL PREY; DOMESTIC CHICKS; AVOIDANCE;
   RESPONSES; PATTERN
AB Considerable recent research has suggested that predators learn to avoid noxious or unpalatable prey more rapidly if those prey have conspicuous (aposematic) colour patterns. However, the precise psychological mechanisms by which predators associate conspicuous coloration with unpalatability remain poorly understood. In this study, the relative importance of visual and chemosensory information in learned aversions to noxious prey was examined by offering garter snakes two different types of prey (fish and earthworms) on forceps with varying colour patterns. Experimental subjects received injections of LiCl to induce illness immediately following the consumption of fish offered on either aposematic (yellow-and-black) or non-aposematic (green) forceps. Following their induced illness, snakes within both the aposematic and non-aposematic treatment groups showed significant aversions to fish, and avoided fish regardless of the colour of the forceps with which fish were offered. However, the aversion to fish was markedly stronger among snakes in the aposematic treatment group than in the non-aposematic group. These results indicate that aposematic coloration enhances chemosensory learning; aversions to unpalatable prey are formed more readily if the prey is conspicuously coloured, even though recognition of unpalatable prey depends on the prey's chemosensory characteristics rather than its coloration. Future responses to unpalatable prey are therefore influenced by an unexpectedly complex interaction of visual and chemosensory information acquired during the initial encounter.

AB Indigo buntings, Passerina cyanea, and lazuli buntings, P. amoena, form hybrid pairs during the breeding season, although the frequency of hybrid pairs is less than expected if mating is at random. The antecedent conditions leading to hybrid pairing are unknown. In the experiment reported here, adult female indigo and lazuli buntings from allopatric populations were photostimulated and implanted-with oestradiol to attain reproductive condition in the presence of heterospecific males. Females were exposed for 25 days to vocal and visual displays of heterospecific males while developing reproductive physiology and behaviour. Females were then tested for their preferences, as indicated by copulation solicitation displays, for conspecific versus heterospecific males and their vocalizations. Additionally, songs of several males were recorded before and after exposure to females and subsequently examined for structural modifications that may have been caused by the exposure to heterospecific females. Females of both species preferred conspecific males and their vocalizations in tests following the heterospecific exposure treatments. Comparisons with previous experiments on female buntings suggested that the 25-day stimulation from heterospecific males was unable to alter female preference for conspecific males. Nor were male songs structurally altered as a consequence of exposure to heterospecific females.

AB Recent studies have revealed that male tree lizards, Urosaurus ornatus, have two sexually dimorphic colour badges (throat colour and dorsal darkening) that function as status signals. In high-density populations, males may darken dorsally to signal dominance; this is a dynamic, modifiable badge. To ascertain the circumstances under which this showy trait is used, tree lizards were observed under varying social conditions in large (2 x 4 m) outdoor pens containing clusters of cinder blocks to simulate the natural environment. The three social conditions consisted of the following groups (nine or 10 replicates of each): three males with one female (MMMF), three males (MMM) and one male with two females (MFF). Behaviour and dorsal colour of the males in these groups were monitored every other day over a 28-day period using the scan-sampling technique. When females were present (MMMF and MFF), one male in each group exhibited dominance behaviour and darkened dorsally some of the time; in the absence of females (MMM), males infrequently exhibited dominance behaviour and dorsal darkening. In groups with multiple males (MMMF and MMM), dominant-subordinate relationships consistently arose only when a female was present (MMMF). The dominant male in each group displayed aggressively significantly more often when both other males and a female were present (MMMF). Thus, males use the dorsal badge to signal their dominant status and exhibit territorial behaviour most readily when females are available to defend.

ID INHERITANCE; CARE
AB In animals capable of learning from a parent or other individual, socially acquired behaviour can be transmitted through several generations. When the inheritance of variations in such behaviour is independent of genotypic variations, natural selection can operate on an additional level. Direct evolution of behaviour becomes possible, and this may alter the estimates of costs and benefits of behaviour patterns for the individual who transmits them. It is suggested that the effects of maternally transmitted behaviour contribute to the evolution of maternal behavioural strategies, and to the evolution of behaviour associated with male-female conflict.

AB Under controlled laboratory conditions, insectivorous bats use echolocation to make detailed discriminations among targets. However, field evidence suggests that bats do not make such discriminations under natural conditions, although the observations are generally anecdotal. The ability of free-flying aerial insectivorous bats to distinguish among a range of edible and inedible targets was tested in a series of cafeteria-style presentations. Bats responded to and attacked moving prey significantly more often than stationary prey. There was some evidence that prey too large for the bats to consume were distinguished from edible-sized targets, although attacks on large targets were common. Bats attacked small inedible prey (beetles and leaves) as frequently as similarly sized edible prey (moths). Thus, insectivorous bats attack any moving target of an appropriate size and appear not to make the fine-detailed discriminations based on target shape and texture that occur in the laboratory. These results suggest that the lack of discrimination is due to the rapid flight of bats and the short prey detection range inherent in echolocation. Bats have only a fraction of a second between prey detection and capture, possibly not enough time to distinguish among prey even though prey selection should otherwise be beneficial. These results emphasize that laboratory findings regarding sensory capabilities must be verified under natural conditions in the field.

TI AN ASSESSMENT OF DATA POOLING AND SOME ALTERNATIVES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS; SONG PLAYBACKS; DATA SET; BEHAVIOR
AB Data pooling is an analytic procedure in which multiple samples of an individual's behaviour are treated as independent events. Although common in animal behaviour research, data pooling has been discredited because it may violate statistical assumptions. Four data sets were analysed in both their pooled and unpooled forms. Pooling did not bias results provided that either intra-subject variance exceeded between-subject variance or Ns were equal. Between-groups tests of significance were affected in the same way as descriptive statistics, and as long as intra-subject variance exceeded between-subject variance, pooling did not increase the probability of a type I error. Utmost care must be taken to sample individuals from populations and behaviour from those individuals in an unbiased manner.

TI THE INFORMATION IN SCENT OVER-MARKS OF GOLDEN-HAMSTERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

   MARKING; INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION; VAGINAL SECRETION; KIN RECOGNITION;
   MATING SUCCESS; VULPES-VULPES; HOUSE MICE
AB Although scent over-marking is a commonly observed behaviour among mammals, it has received little experimental attention. With regard to individual signatures, there are three types of information that might be obtained from such marks: (1) the scents might blend, thus creating a new odour quality but sacrificing individually distinctive information, (2) the scents might remain distinct, preserving individual identity information, or (3) the scent on top could mask the individual identity information in the bottom scent. These three possibilities were tested in golden hamsters for two scents (flank gland and vaginal secretions) that are deposited by hamsters using two distinct patterns of scent-marking behaviour. In an habituation paradigm, test animals were exposed on five successive trials to a simulated over-mark in which the scent from one individual was placed on top of scent from another individual. On the sixth (test) trial, males were exposed to two separate scents, one from a novel individual and the other from the individual that provided either the top or the bottom scent during the habituation trials. Results on the test trial were similar for both vaginal secretions (experiment 1) and flank gland scent (experiment 2). The novel scent was investigated more than the top scent, indicating that the top scent was familiar to the males, but the bottom scent and the novel scent were investigated equally, indicating that the bottom scent was not familiar. These results suggest that the distinctive information in the bottom scent was masked by that of the top scent; furthermore, they show that the other two possible phenomena (scents blending or remaining distinct) did not occur. This demonstration of scent masking may well be the first reported to date. The possible significance of over-marking in hamsters and other species is discussed, and it is suggested that the precision and thoroughness of covering one scent with another may relate to species differences in the information available in over-marks and therefore in the functions that such marks serve.

TI PRECOPULATORY MATE GUARDING IN THE AMPHIPOD, GAMMARUS-LAWRENCIANUS -
   EFFECTS OF SOCIAL STIMULATION DURING THE POST-COPULATION INTERVAL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Immediately following copulation, male Grammarus lawrencianus were exposed to three different treatment conditions during a 240-h post-copulation interval. Males isolated alone (group M) or isolated with another male (group M-M) during the post-copulation interval guarded females earlier in the female reproductive cycle than males isolated with unacceptable females (group M-F). These data suggest that males adjust their mate-guarding threshold according to the density of females they  encounter. When females are scarce (group M and group M-M), the males accept females that require a longer time investment than when females are plentiful (group M-F).

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An experiment on the relationship between body size and duration of precopula mate guarding in Gammarus pulex is presented in an attempt to test the frequency-dependent model of Grafen and Ridley (J. Theor. Biol., 1983, 102, 549-567). Body sizes of males and females were positively correlated with precopula duration. The costs and benefits of mate guarding are discussed in relation to male and female body size. The predictions of a graphical analysis are congruent with the data and with those of other experimental studies but disagree with the model of Grafen and Ridley (1983). Furthermore, a major prediction of the cost/benefit analysis is that differing precopula durations will result in positive size-assortative mating. The analysis thus provides a comprehensive explanation of mate guarding in this species.

TI A TEST OF THE INFORMATION-CENTER HYPOTHESIS IN A COLONY OF SANDWICH
   TERNS STERNA-SANDVICENSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It has been suggested that colonies of terns function as information centres from which unsuccessful foragers follow other birds to feeding sites. From a sandwich tern colony in south-western Sweden, foragers departed in temporal synchrony and birds leaving at the same time headed preferentially in similar directions. However, unsuccessful foragers did not follow other birds from the colony, and successful birds were not followed more often than other birds. Moreover, a ''leader'' and a ''follower'' that departed together in the same direction flew to the same feeding site in fewer cases than predicted by the hypothesis. A food shortage was noted twice, but there was no indication that terns sought information within the colony during these periods. Thus, clumped departures are weak evidence for the information-centre hypothesis and in the present case might be explained by clumped arrivals or, possibly, benefits of local enhancement in the foraging area. Sandwich terns usually nest in association with black-headed gulls, Larus ridibundus, and the benefits of this in terms of reduced predation risk may be an important reason for coloniality.

TI BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSE OF FEMALE DARK-EYED JUNCOS TO THE EXPERIMENTAL
   REMOVAL OF THEIR MATES - IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF MALE PARENTAL
   CARE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, are monogamous and normally help females feed nestlings. We removed males at hatching of their eggs and examined female parental behaviour in response to male removal. We compared parental behaviour of unaided females (experimentals) with that of (1) females aided by their mates (control females) and (2) females and their mates working together (control pairs). Unaided females fed their young at least twice as often as did aided females and as often as  the combined efforts of pairs. The increased rate of food delivery by unaided females was accompanied by a decrease in time brooding the young and an increase in the amount of time the female''s nest was unattended, suggesting that feeding and brooding are competing parental behaviours. Feeding rates of both unaided females and pairs increased as brood size increased, but the response to brood size was stronger in unaided females than in either aided females of pairs. An earlier study indicated  that, despite their compensatory feeding rates, unaided females experienced greater partial brood loss than did pairs. Perhaps males bring more food per feeding trip, or food of a different quality. It seems likely that males can improve fledging success by bringing food to the young, both during the early nestling stage when brooding is crucial and also later, during the period of rapid growth.

TI SWIMMING TRACKS IN SWARMS OF 2 CLADOCERAN SPECIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Video-recorded swimming behaviour of both Polyphemus pediculus, a predatory cladoceran, and Bosmina longirostris, a typical prey species, was analysed. Swimming speed, turning rate, ground covered and track tortuosity were measured. Individual behaviour was influenced by neighbouring individuals, though not, in the case of Polyphemus, by the presence or absence of prey. On average, Polyphemus swimming was faster and turning rates higher than in Bosmina. Individuals at the periphery of  Bosmina swarms covered more ground than those in the centre, and there was tendency for coordinated circling. For Polyphemus, group size had a marked effect on swimming behaviour, with large groups swimming more slowly and covering less ground. Average turning rates were not affected by group size. Polyphemus tracks were oriented orthogonally to Bosmina tracks, thus maximizing the predators'' rate of encountering prey. Both species oriented by polarized light (polarotaxis). Mechanisms for  swarm cohesion are discussed.

TI BEHAVIORAL PREDICTORS OF ESTRUS IN DOMESTIC CATTLE, BOS-TAURUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB Observation of social interaction within a commercial dairy herd showed that bulls initiated more interactions with pro-oestrous cows than did cows. The bulls'' interest in pro-oestrous cows began at around 4 days before oestrus and was characterized by an increase in olfactory and gustatory behaviour. Cows did not appear to show similar interest but their behaviour may have been inhibited by the close presence of a bull. It is suggested that bulls can predict the onset of oestrus by several  days using olfactory/gustatory signals produced by pro-oestrous cows.

TI MULTIPLE MATING IN A WATER STRIDER - MUTUAL BENEFITS OR INTERSEXUAL
   CONFLICT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It has long been recognized that male and female interests in mating may be asymmetrical. The presetn study quantified experimentally several potential costs and benefits in mating multiply in female water striders, Gerris odontogaster (zett.). Matings were costly to females, mainly in terms of increased predation risk and time/energy costs involved in carrying passive males. There were no balancing benefits to females in mating multiply. It is concluded that female sshould theoretically mate  approximately every 10th day for maximal survival and fecundity and that multiple matings are not beneficial to females per se. However, females frequently mate several times every day. Several facts suggest that matings are enforced by males at the expense of females'' primary interests and that an intersexual conflict over the mating decision exists. However, since a mating male repels copulatory attempts by other males, females may minimize costs by accepting superfluous matings in order to  forage relatively undisturbed.

TI EGGS IN THE NESTS OF MALES AND THEIR EFFECT ON MATE CHOICE IN THE
   3-SPINED STICKLEBACK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It is thought that female three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, prefer to mate with males whose nests already contain eggs. This is based on the results from a study where gravid females were tested sequentially, first with a male without eggs, and then with a male with eggs. However, that experimental design fails to detect important effects due to male-male competition. Simultaneous and sequential choice experiments were conducted to determine the relative importance of eggs in a nest with respect to female mate choice. In the simultaneous choice tests, males with eggs in their nest were more likely to obtain a second spawning than males without eggs. However, there was little evidence of females actively ''choosing'' mates on the basis of presence or absence of eggs. Rather, males that had recently spawned courted more intensely and were more successful at leading females to their nests. In only a few cases could a male''s failure to spawn be attributed to a female aborting entry into a nest without eggs. In the sequential choice tests, significantly more females entered and spawned than aborted entry into nests without eggs. Furthermore, aborted entries were not seen exclusively in nests without eggs. The results indicated that the presence of eggs had a general priming effect on courtship behaviour of males, but evidence for active female choice was lacking. Overall, females did not exhibit the behavioural patterns predicted from the hypothesis that females should spawn preferentially in nests with eggs.

TI OLDER MALES HAVE HIGHER INSEMINATION SUCCESS IN A BEETLE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The hypothesis that male age affects insemination success was tested in a field study of a fungus beetle, Bolitotherus cornutus. In this species, male competition is important in determining the number of females with which a male attempts to copulate, but females have control over whether an attempt results in sperm transfer. Thus the proportion of a male''s copulatory attempts that are accepted by females is a measure of the male''s insemination success, independent of his overall access to females. This proportion was found to increase significantly as a male ages; thus, older males had higher insemination success. The insemination advantage of older males could be the result of two different mechanisms: female choice of older males or greater access of older males to highly receptive females. Neither of these mechanisms could be definitely supported or refuted based on the data collected in this study; therefore, further studies are necessary to determine whether one or both of these non-mutually exclusive mechanisms account for the older male advantage.

TI SEXUAL CONFLICT AND THE POLYGAMY THRESHOLD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Polygamy threshold models are the most widely accepted explanations for the mating systems of passerine birds; polygyny is proposed to arise through female choice and cooperative polyandry through male choice. There is, however, often confusion about whate these models predict; a variety of patterns of settelment and reproductive success would occur depending on the assumptions made about the costs of sharing and the distribution of choices available. Many workers have tested predictions  without considering whether the assumptions of the models apply to their study. Assumptions about costs of sharing remain to be tested experimentally and there is little information on the costs of choice. Furthermore, mating systems are unlikely to be explained by the choice of one party; there are often conflicts of interest within and between the sexes, so individuals will not always end up with the options they choose. Variable mating systems may arise as an outcome of sexual conflict.

TI MALE AND FEMALE MATE CHOICE IN THE REDLIP BLENNY - WHY BIGGER IS BETTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mate choice and mating success were investigated in a natural population of the redlip blenny, Ohioblennius atlanticus (Pisces: Blenniidae). Male mating success was correlated significantly with male size and with the inner surface area of the male''s nest. Females preferred to mate with large males; they approached the territories of large males more often, their probability of spawning after entering the nest was greater, and they released more eggs when spawning with larger than with smaller males. Large males may be preferred because they spend more time guarding and therefore lose a smaller proportion of egg batches per reproductive period. In addition, last batches have half the hatching success of batches laid earlier. Since larger males guard longer per reproductive period, a female may decrease the probability of being the last to spawn in a nest by mating with larger males. Females may prefer nests with larger surface area because such nests can hold more egg batches, and the predation risk to individual egg batches may therefore decrease. Feeding rate is reduced during guarding and the effect of this cost on future reproduction may constrain increased guarding investment by small males. Male preference for larger females was observed directly; females accepted in a nest were larger than females chased from the nest. A computer simulation showed that males mating selectively should obtain eggs at a faster rate than males mating indiscriminately.

TI MIGRATORY ORIENTATION AND VERTICAL MOVEMENTS OF HOMING ADULT SOCKEYE
   SALMON, ONCORHYNCHUS-NERKA, IN COASTAL WATERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Adult sockeye salmon returning to the Fraser River, British Columbia, were tracked with depth-sensing ultrasonic transmitters to study the factors guiding their homing migration in coastal waters. The salmon generally swam in either the homeward direction (east southeast) or the opposite direction. When sockeye salmon encountered obstacles such as islands or pennisulas, they did not follow the shoreline but rather swam back out into open water, turned and resumed their original oreintation. Sockeye generally occupied the upper 30 m of the water column but significant variation in depth of travel between regions with different oceanographic characteristics was observed. Depth of travel seemed to be controlled by a general preference for the surface, avoidance of warm (also low salinity) water, and orientation to the thermocline.

TI BEHAVIORAL-ANALYSIS OF ELECTRIC SIGNAL LOCALIZATION IN THE ELECTRIC
   FISH, GYMNOTUS-CARAPO (GYMNOTIFORMES)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study investigates how an electric fish is able to localize in space the electric signals from another fish. South American electric fish of the pulse-species, Gymnotus carapo, were housed in a large, circular arena with a shelter in the centre and non-moving electrical models which mimicked the discharge of a conspecific were presented at the edge of the tank. Gymnotus, a naturally aggressive fish, approached and threatened these electrical models. The nocturnal fish were observed  approaching the electrodes under near-infra-red light, and the paths to five different geometrical arrangements of electrodes were compared. The results suggest that Gymnotus cannot determine the direction or distance of an electrical source placed in its territory but that they can approach the electric stimulus by aligning their body axis parallel to the electric field vector while swimming. By using this simple strategy they are able to find the source in a reliable, although indirect, way. Gymnotus showed a slight polarity preference for approaching the head of the model fish. These fish did not discriminate between a diverging electric field and a converging electric field. They were well-oriented to the vector direction even when the magnitude of the current was relatively homogeneous. Gymnotus appears to maintain its aligment to the electric field vector by an active hunting movement.

TI NOCTURNAL CAPTURE OF FIREFLIES BY LYCOSID SPIDERS - VISUAL VERSUS
   VIBRATORY STIMULI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The untested idea that wolf spiders such as Lycosa rabida rely on visual cues when preying on fireflies at night was examined. Under controlled conditions, individuals of L. rabida and L. punctulata were exposed to both actual and simulated firefly flashing. These stimuli elicited orientation or approach in only 24% of the spiders. In other experiments, constant light yielded more responses than did flash patterns, and a stationary light elicited more responses than did a moving light.  Both of these findings suggest that phototaxis underlies the responses. To determine the importance of vibratory cues, crawling fireflies were offered to blinded spiders on a paper substratum and on living plants; response levels were 85% and 100%, respectively. These data suggest that much, if not mostly, nocturnal predation by lycosid spiders on fireflies involves vibratory rather than visual stimuli.

TI SENSORY INFLUENCES ON PHYSICAL DESIGN OF A VISUAL-DISPLAY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Physical design features of animal visual signals have rarely been analysed. The parameters of motion patterns found in the visual displays of the iguanid lizard, Anolis auratus, were analysed by comparing a long-range display directed at unattentive viewers with a short-range display directed at attentive viewers. Movements in the long-range display were of higher amplitude, increasing the distance over which the display can be resolved. The initial portion of the long-range display  contained movements of extremely high acceleration and velocity, which have been shown to be extremely effective at drawing attention. It is shown that the physical properties of a visual signal depend on the context in which it is used, and the response properties of the visual system.

TI THE ACQUISITION OF DOMINANCE AMONG FREE-RANGING RHESUS-MONKEY SIBLINGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In several species of Cercopithecine monkeys, younger sisters reverse dominance with older sisters during the course of maturation. Proximate hypotheses to account for the phenomenon are based on few and incomplete data, and tend to be unifactorial. This paper (1) presents systematic data on ''youngest ascendancy'' among free-ranging rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta, siblings; and (2) attempts to identify its proximate basis. Early social influences were inadequate to explain reversal. Older  siblings resisted outranking, and only those younger siblings (including orphans) with powerful long-term support rebelled successfully. Supporters tended to be close relatives (such as the mother and other siblings) dominant to both siblings. Rebellion did not occur at some absolute age of the young sibling. Its timing depended partly on the relative size of siblings, and partly on the extent of support the younger sibling had against the older. The study strongly suggests that the occurrence  and timing of reversal depends on an interaction between factors predictive of individual fighting ability(such as body size) and those predictive of social power (such as alliances). Observed variation in the regularity with which ''youngest ascendancy'' occurs is discussed in relation to these findings.

TI ACOUSTIC DISPLAYS FACILITATE COURTSHIP IN LITTLE BLUE PENGUINS,
   EUDYPTULA-MINOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Playback of the acoustic components of each of three little blue penguin, Eudyptula minor, displays resulted in significant increases in the rate at which perceiving conspecifics copulated and performed courtship displays; playback of crested penguin calls (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus and E. robustus) as controls had no effect on little blue penguin behaviour. Although the performance rates of courtship behaviour observed (i.e. mutual displays, copulation and male solo calls) were elevated significantly by the playback of each little blue penguin display, the courtship behaviour facilitated most was that incorporating the acoustic components being played back. Responses were greatest during the 5-min playback period of each test and usually dropped to control levels within 20 min. Social facilitation may alter the availability of social stimuli and cluster acts of copulation, both of which may influence the timing and synchrony of breeding.

DT Article
AB Two alternative reproductive tactis (amplexus and spermatophore transfer interference) and three sexual interference tactics (spermatophore transfer interference, pseudofemale behaviour, amplexus interference) are described for male red-spotted newts, Notophthalmus viridescens. The two reproductive tactics yield equal insemination rates for males displaying these behaviours. The three sexual interference tactics decrease the potential fitness of amplectic males either directly, by displacing  them from receptive females and/or duping them into fruitless spermatophore depositions, or indirectly, by increasing the time spent in amplexus with no concomitant increase in probability of successful insemination.

TI THE GENETICS OF FORAGING BEHAVIOR - ARTIFICIAL SELECTION FOR FOOD CHOICE
   IN LARVAE OF THE FRUITFLY, DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Artificial selection for choice between high protein content and high energy content of food was performed for 44 generations of fruitfly larvae. There were significant responses to selection both in a line selected to choose high energy food and in a line selected to choose high protein food. Both lines showed a significantly higher preference for the selected food type than did the control line. The line selected for high energy food also showed a significant increase in response over the generations. Since the selection resulted in lines that differed significantly from controls and from each other, there must be some genetic basis for food choice behaviour. Realized heritability was very low in both selected lines. Viability, as measured by larval weight, pupation time, emergence time and adult size, was significantly higher for flies raised on high protein food than for those raised on high energy food.

TI FEMALE CHOICE OF SITES VERSUS MATES IN A CORAL-REEF FISH,
   THALASSOMA-BIFASCIATUM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To understand the dynamics of sexual selection, one needs to identify the basis of female choice in mating. Daily censuses showed that most spawns of individual female bluehead wrasses, Thalassoma bifasciatum, occurred at one of several available mating sites, either in a group-spawning aggregation of small males or with a large territorial male. Most females were not located near their principal mating site during the non-spawning period of the day. Females were thus exposed to other males and sites and should have had the opportunity for choice. When a resident territorial male disappeared or was removed experimentally from a mating site, females did not alter their fidelity to that site. Furthermore, manipulations showed that when a territorial male changed the location of his mating activity to an adjacent site, females did not follow him but continued to mate at their customary site. Thus mating sites, rather than the males occupying them, appeared to be the objects of female  choice. The bright coloration and courtship behaviour of larger males may demonstrate the safety of a particular site rather than indicating some aspect of male quality.

DT Article
AB Mating success of male grasshoppers, Chorthippus brunneus, has previously been shown to be highest for intermediate, and lowest for extreme individuals with respect to at least one parameter of the male calling song and probably also one morphological character. The heritabilities of these and other song and morphological characters have been estimated in an experiment utilizing the North Carolina I design. Heritability estimates for song parameters are all low (< 0.28). Estimates for morphological characters are higher, particularly for features of the stridulatory file, despite the fact that it was just these characters that were shown to be under stabilizing sexual selection. These results are related to sexual selection theory.

TI THE ECONOMICS OF KLEPTOPARASITISM - OPTIMAL FORAGING, HOST AND PREY
   SELECTION BY GULLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Kleptoparasites (food thieves) use the time and energy investment of others to reduce their costs of obtaining food. In charadriiform flocks on agricultural pastureland, gulls (Larus ridibundus) behaved as pure kleptoparasites on two species of plovers (lapwings, Vanellus vanellus and golden plovers, Pluvialis apricaria). Two energy maximizing models are developed to examine attack duration and prey size selection by gulls. Risk of detection, behaviour of plovers, energy content of target worms (Lumbricidae), and time and energy costs of making an attack all influenced attack efficiency. Most attacks were made over the range of distances expected to provide the highest average rate of energy intake. An optimal diet breadth model catered for the usual constraints of attack and handling time, as well as the probability of not being detected and the estimated energetic cost of making an attack. The model predicted that gulls should steal medium to large sized worms; 94% of  the gulls'' diet consisted of these. As predicted by optimal foraging theory, there was an inverse relationship between capture rates of profitable and unprofitable worms, and capture rate of profitable worms increased with encounter rate. Gulls foraged most efficiently in single-species host flocks, apparently because (a) attacks involving lapwings incurred smaller costs and (b) gulls were more numerous and competitive in mixed species host flocks. The paper ends with an appraisal of the models and discusses departures from their predictions. Important parellels between kleptoparasite-host and predator-prey associations are drawn throughout; the observability of the former can reveal much about the latter.

   BAT, MACROTUS-CALIFORNICUS (CHIROPTERA, PHYLLOSTOMIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behavioural tests were used to examine the visual acuity and sensitivity of Macrotus californicus, a 12-14-g desert bat known to use vision in the location of terrestrial pray. Optomotor responses indicate single point visual acuity as fine as 3''38'''' of arc. For comparison, the same tests were applied to two other species of bats. Antrozous pallidus, a desert gleaner which locates prey by the founds they produce, exhibited acuity of 15'' of arc, and Eptesicus fuscus, an aerial foraging species that uses echolocation to find prey, 60'' of arc. Both M. californicus and A. pallidus retained their acuity at light levels as low as 2 .times. 10-4 mL (approximately 2 .times. 10-3 lux), comparable to ground luminance on a clear, moonless night. The eyes of M. californicus were more anteriorly directed, and had twice the binocular overlap of the other species examined. Comparison of our data with results from other studies indicated that M. californicus has vision superior to other insectivorous bats, and at least equivalent to larger-eyed frugivorous and nectarivorous bats examined in previous studies.

AB Minnows in shoals used a spectrum of behaviours to discriminate stalking models of pike. Predator recognition was initially based on model shape and size, with identification being confirmed using information on markings gathered by minnows during predator inspection visits. Minnow behaviour indicated that shoals regarded the most realistic model as the greatest threat. Conversely, habituation of the anti-predator response in repeated stalks was most evident with the least realistic model.  Implications for the design of models used in predation experiments are discussed.

TI INTERMALE COMPETITION AND MATING SUCCESS IN THE FIELD CRICKET,
   GRYLLUS-BIMACULATUS (DEGEER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus compete aggressively for the acquisition of burrows and females. The effect of population density on the nature of encounters between males, and factors affecting individual competitive ability were examined. Aggression was reduced in high population densities, both in terms of the proportion of encounters leading to aggression and in the intensity of aggressive disputes. The addition of burrows and females increased aggressiveness and removed population density effects. Individual competitive ability was determined primarily by body size and secondly, by an individual''s past experience of winning (''confidence''). Competitive ability, prior residence in burrows and the presence of females all appear to influence the outcome of aggressive disputes. Variation in calling frequency of males was influenced both by population density and competitive ability; males who called more often had a greater encounter rate with females. Females were more likely to mate with burrow residents. However, amongst residents, larger males gained more matings. The potential for female choice in this species is discussed.

TI INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MALES AND THEIR SPERM DURING MULTI-MALE COPULATORY
   EPISODES OF DEER MICE (PEROMYSCUS-MANICULATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Twenty triads of one female and two male deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus bairdi, copulated in tests in which the dynamics of male-male interactions and sperm competition could be analyzed. Paternity of offspring was determined with starch-gel electrophoresis. Basic parameters of male copulatory behavior resembled those of one-male, one-female episodes. Male-male influences on copulation were subtle and complex, with a given male somewhat less likely to copulate during the other''s  copulatory than refractory periods. Males ejaculating first or last gained no reproductive advantage. The male attaining more ejaculations sired more, but not significantly more, offspring than the other male. However, the predictability of litter composition was improved and significant when ejaculations followed by male a female post-ejaculatory quiescent period of 1 min or less were discounted. This suggests that male deer mice can essentially cancel the ejaculation of another male by  copulating within 1 min of his ejaculation.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IN DUCKLINGS .11. EMBRYONIC
   CRITICAL PERIOD FOR SPECIES-TYPICAL PERCEPTION IN THE HATCHLING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the embryonic stages prior to hatching, the contact-contentment call of the Peking duck (domesticated Anas platyrhynchos) is more highly variable (2-6 notes/s) than it is after hatching (4-6 notes/s). The embryos must be exposed to the normally wide range of repetition rates of their contact-contentment call (2, 4, 6 notes/s) if their preference for the species maternal call is to be normal at 24 h after hatching. Exposure of muted embryos to the higher (4, 6 notes/s) or lower (2,4  notes/s) portions of the normal range was ineffective. Thus the normally highly variable nature of the embryo''s vocalizations fits the requrements of its developing auditory system. An embryonic critical period was also demonstrated: when muted hatchlings were exposed to the rates typical of the postnatal period (4,6 notes/s), or even the more widely variable rates of the embryonic period (2, 4, 6 notes/s), they failed to show a preference for the normal maternal call at 24 or 48 h after hatching. The precise developmental linkage involves maturational stage as well as the representativeness of the stimulation.

TI SCHOOL FIDELITY IN FISHES - THE YELLOW PERCH PATTERN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB School fidelity concerns the cohesiveness of social aggregations over time, as measured by the regularity or repeatability with which known individuals re-occur as members of a school. School fidelity was measured by divers who observed yellow perch (P. flavescens) marked with individually recognizable tags in Cazenovia Lake, New York [USA]. Yellow perch were facultative schoolers, with individual differences in schooling tendency (measured as percentage of time in schools) accounting for  different numbers of observations of schooled versus solitary fish. The greatest co-occurrence was found between fish with strong schooling tendencies, but within this group co-occurrence was random. Home ranges overlapped greatly between individuals, yet co-occurrence was more a function of schooling tendency than of overlapping home ranges. Individuals with overlapping home ranges but with weak schooling tendencies seldom co-occurred. Home range size increased directly with schooling tendency: the distances that individuals moved apparently depended on the movements of the schools they joined, with strongly schooling fish remaining in schools longer. Individuals joined and left schools frequently; this also reflects a lack of fidelity between fish. Fish schools that form primarily for predator avoidance may show higher levels of fidelity than do schools that form for foraging or hydrodynamic efficiency.

TI THE EFFECTS OF MIXED-SPECIES FLOCKING ON THE VIGILANCE OF SHOREBIRDS -
   WHO DO THEY TRUST
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of mixed species flocking on vigilance is investigated in 2 spp. of wading bird wintering on rocky shores. Both turnstones, Arenaria interpres, and purple sandpipers, Calidris maritima, share vigilance with conspecifics, but also with some other waders; the extent of sharing appears to depend on the relative size of, and habitat overlap with, the other species. Vigilance is not shared with much larger species, nor with those rarely found in the same areas. There is no sharing of vigilance between neighboring birds unable to see each other. Variation in vigilance level results from an alteration in both rate of scannning and duration of single scans; these 2 variables are adjusted independently over the range of densities experienced. This is due to constraints on a high scanning rate (which may reduce feeding efficiency) and a short scan duration (which cannot be lower than the minimum required to take in the necessary information).

TI COMPETITIVE RESOURCE SHARING - A SIMULATION-MODEL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The problem of how competing individuals should distribute themselves between food resource patches was studied theoretically and experimentally using a simple simulation model is used as a tool. To give the model a realistic background the individuals are assumed to differ in their abilities to compete for food. Stimulations are run with and without assuming traveling costs, to study their influence. The individuals distribute themselves between the food patches in good approximation to the  ratio of the patch profitabilities. This result is discussed in relation to the theories of the ideal free distribution and the despotic distribution. The model makes 5 predictions on how competing individuals should distribute themselves between food resource patches. These predictions have already received some confirmation in experimental studies.

TI NESTMATE RECOGNITION IN HONEY BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The recognition cues by which nestmate worker honeybees are discriminated from non-nestmates were investigated using new experimental techniques. The experiments described support the contention that the recognition cue is acquired prior to emergence as an adult. The cue probably has a genetic, rather than an environmental, source. Previous findings, which indicated that worker honeybees are recognized on the basis of environmentally acquired odors, do not contradict this result. Rather, bees probably use whatever cues are available for recognition. When environmental odor sources are carefully controlled, cues remain that allow discrimination of nestmate vs. non-nestmate individuals.

TI SENSORY FEEDBACK STABILIZING RELIABLE STRIDULATION IN THE FIELD CRICKET
   GRYLLUS-CAMPESTRIS L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male field crickets (G. campestris) normally perform calling songs with the right forewing over the left. If the wing orientation is inverted, the male can stridulate, but sound intensity is 100 times less and it uses a special wing-spreading behavior to restore the normal right over left orientation. A set of 2 hair fields on each wing is shown to have a stabilizing effect on wing orientation. After removal of the inner hair plates, that is the lower on the right forewing and the upper on the left forewing, the chance of accidental wing inversion rises dramatically. Quantitative measurements of the wing position during stridulation were made using miniature angle detectors. After hair plate removal the wing opening is increased by 13% and the jitter in the opening position is increased by 100%. The wings are then fully separated in 2% of the calling song syllables observed, explaining the increased chance of inversion. Sensory feedback from these hair fields stabilizes the wing movement amplitude, preventing wing inversion during calling, which ensures the high intensity sound production necessary to attract females.

This was true for both intra- and interspecific exchanges.

In this system, interspecific exchanges of a mutually limiting resource may result in benefits to individuals of both species of crab.

TI MATE GUARDING IN THE ACORN WOODPECKER - WITHIN-GROUP REPRODUCTIVE
   COMPETITION IN A COOPERATIVE BREEDER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB California populations of acorn woodpeckers (M. formicivorus) show 2 distinct types of cooperative breeding: cooperative polygamy, 2 or more individuals of the same sex sharing breeding status and mates and helping, non-reproductives assisting in rearing young. Because the presence of more than 1 male within a single social unit could greatly increase the threat of kleptogamy (cuckoldry), the degree to which males maintain surveillance of their females prior to and during egg laying was  quantified. In polyandrous groups with 2 breeding males and 1 breeding female, both males closely guard the female early in the breeding season. Guarding begins 7-25 days before the 1st egg is laid and terminates 1-2 days before clutch completion. Mate guarding is absent in groups that contain only a single male. This suggests that mate guarding in the acorn woodpecker is an expression of within-group reproductive competition, rather than a means by which males prevent their mates from  copulating with extra-territorial males. The presence of male helpers, usually older offspring of the breeding female, has a positive effect on the mate-guarding behavior of male breeders, even though male helpers themselves do not guard females. Female helpers, usually older offspring of the breeding males, do not lay eggs and are not guarded.

TI EVIDENCE OF USE OF VIBRISSAE IN SWIMMING IN SIGMODON-FULVIVENTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Yellow-bellied cotton rats (S. fulviventer) from riparian habitats of a southwest New Mexican [USA] canyon have mystacial vibrissae that move well forward of the animals'' noses when the rats are placed in the water. These rats are excellent swimmers and centrifugal stress alone has little or no effect on their aquatic behavior. Devibrissation (right, left, both sides) affected the swimming of 13 of 18 rats, resulting in body tilting and/or nose-dipping while in the water. With centrifugal stress and devibrissation, all 18 rats showed either or both effects. Vibrissae probably play a role in the successful swimming of these rats, perhaps in maintaining body position as well as in keeping the head above the water.

TI BEHAVIORAL INTERACTIONS OF DAIRY-COWS WITH THEIR NEWBORN CALVES AND THE
   EFFECTS OF PARITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Continuous observations of 82 individually penned Friesian cows and their calves were made during the first 6 h post partum. The behavior observed was similar to that described for wild ungulates of the hider type. Cows showed a marked decrease in calf-directed activities with time after parturition. This was more pronounced in older animals, which recommenced ingestive behavior sooner. The incidence of licking and other maternal behavior depends upon the characteristics of the calf and upon the state of the mother. Close proximity between cow and calf was maintained, in small calving pens, by the mother at the first 3 calvings but by the calf after these. The eating of the afterbirth is considered to be anti-predator behavior. Calves of primiparous dams spent more time suckling and suckled from more quarters than did calves of older cows. Primiparous dams showed a higher incidence of abnormal maternal behavior.

TI FLEHMEN - ITS OCCURRENCE AND POSSIBLE FUNCTIONS IN FERAL GOATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Flehmen is a behavior characterized by an open mouth and the upper lip curled back and up. It is given by feral goats of both sexes. Males give flehmen most often in response to the urine of females, but also to their own urine and to the urine of other males. Females give flehmen and a related behavior, riech-gahnen, after sniffing their own and unrelated neonates. Flehmen in the feral goat may function in the olfaction of a number of compounds, enabling males to assess estrus in females and the relative condition of other males, and females to differentiate between their own and unrelated neonates. Two functional classes can be recognized: monitoring processes, involving regular, frequent testing, and discriminatory learning processes, involving relatively rare decision-making. The relative frequency of flehmen in different contexts may not reflect its biological significance.

TI HOME RANGE USE BY KLOSS GIBBONS (HYLOBATES-KLOSSII) ON SIBERUT ISLAND,
   INDONESIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A home range is a reservoir of resources which are distributed throughout its area and joined by pathways. These resources are used for different activities and at different times of day. Space-time systems have been described for a few terrestrial mammals, but no previous study attempted a similar analysis for an arboreal mammal. Kloss gibbons were studied for 2 yr on Siberut Island, Indonesia, and 1 group was habituated to an observer. The ranging patterns of this group are analyzed in 2, 3 and 4 dimensions with respect to the types of forest in which the animals lived. Differences between the results of this and previous studies of Kloss gibbons are discussed. A home range can probably be more permanent than the animals within it.

TI ANIMAL SIGNALS - ETHOLOGICAL AND GAMES-THEORY APPROACHES ARE NOT
   INCOMPATIBLE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The traditional ethological approach to the study of animal signals was recently compared with that derived from games theory. The traditional ethological approach portrayed is not in keeping with main stream of ethological research on animal signals. It has not been generally assumed that the evolution of animal signals was based on selection for mutual benefit of actor and reactor, nor that signals carry precise information of what the actor will do next. A synthesis of the ethological and games theory approaches is possible. Many threat displays may signal ''Will stay, but will attack if provoked'' or ''Will stay, but will flee if provoked''; the subsequent behavior of the displaying bird may depend in part on that of the reactor.

TI FORAGING TACTICS OF A TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDER - SUSTAINED YIELD IN
   TERRITORIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Territorial red-backed salamanders (P. cinereus) were given a high density of 2 prey types differing in size and caloric profitability. They chose a diet that approximated optimal foraging when they foraged in areas previously marked with advertisement pheromones. However, when foraging in previously unmarked or conspecific-marked areas they did not forage optimally, in a short time frame. In the latter 2 situations they evinced a lower rate of net energy due to their failure to specialize on the more profitable prey type and their longer intercapture intervals while time was devoted either to marking behavior or submissive posturing. The salamanders appeared to opt for a strategy of sacrificing initial coloric yield until they had established marked territories and then switching to a higher sustained caloric yield. The data show that experimental handling of a predator per se can alter its foraging behavior. Also a predator just initiating a territory may forage quite differently from one that has already established ownership, making the time frame during which observations are made important to understanding the predator''s foraging strategy.

TI CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION DURING SWARM EMIGRATION IN THE SOCIAL WASP
   POLYBIA-SERICEA (OLIVIER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Communication during swarming was studied in the social wasp P. sericea in Brazil. After the adult population (swarm) evacuates following destruction of the nest, it forms a temporary (0.5 to 2 day) cluster on nearby vegetation and then emigrates to a new nest site. During both phases many adults drag the gaster over leaves and other substrates around the cluster and along the emigration route. The odor left on these objects is identical to that of the copious secretion of an exocrine gland opening at the base of the 5th (penultimate) sternite of the gaster. Following emigration the deposit of secretion in many individuals is depleted and shows signs of disturbance. The swarm, if chased from its cluster site, reorients to it by the scent marks alone. The swarm is guided to its new nest site by the trail of scent marks along the emigration route.

TI PLACENTA ON PUPS SKIN ACCELERATES ONSET OF MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR IN
   NON-PREGNANT RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous research indicated that virgin rats (Rattus norvegicus) behave maternally (sensitize) more rapidly if kept in close proximity with pups. Since both parturient rats and a large percentage of virgin rats avidly consume placenta, placenta and amnionic fluid were applied to the skin of the stimulus pups to test whether it would draw the female adults into closer contact with the pups and therefore hasten the onset of maternal behavior. The procedure shortened the maternal sensitization latency. This effect was not due to the wetness of the pups, to the presence of placenta in the cage, or to the adults having previously ingested placenta. Other attractive ingestibles applied to the pups'' skin produced an intermediate, but not significant, shortening of the maternal sensitization latency.

TI A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY OF SOCIAL-DEVELOPMENT IN THE RAT (RATTUS-NORVEGICUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The social interactions between juvenile rat pups (R. norvegicus) were observed daily between 21 and 55 days of age. The data were analyzed for developmental changes, sex differences, play-partner preferences and dominance relations. The results revealed clear patterns in the development of sexual and agonistic behaviors in the rat. This development refers to changes in either the manner in which animals interact or the behaviors involved in social play, but not to the topography of specific behaviors. Development toward the adult pattern of social behavior was temporally associated with the period of sexual maturation (i.e., between days 36 and 50).

TI A NONSPECIFIC AGGREGATION PHEROMONE IN 2 AUSTRALIAN REPTILE TICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB Larvae, nymphs, adult males and adult females of each of the Australian reptile tick species Aponomma hydrosauri and Amblyomma limbatum took up significantly aggregated distributions when left for 12 h in the dark in petri dishes. Nymphs of the 2 spp. placed together formed co-aggregations. Pheromonal communication was implicated by the attraction of nymphs to filter paper squares which had been in contact with other nymphs. Each species was attracted to pheromone from the other species and no conspecific preference was detected. A common ancestral pheromone may have been retained after speciation by stabilizing selection for a behavior of major importance to tick survival.

TI THE THERMAL-DEPENDENCE OF LIZARD BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB New techniques were utilized to measure burst speed and distance running capacity in 6 spp. of lizards [Cnemidophorus murinus, Dipsosaurus dorsalis, Eumeces obsoletus, Gerrhonotus multicarinatus, Sceloporus occidentalis and Uma inornata] and to examine the thermal dependence of these behavioral capacities. These behaviors were repeatable among groups of animals within a species, within a group during the experiments, and among individuals of a group. Burst speeds averaged 130-150 m/min for active species, with some individuals exceeding 200 m/min. Total distances run during 2 min averaged 60-70 m in species with the greatest stamina. Thermal dependence of these behaviors was low or absent (Q10 .ltoreq. 1.5) over the normal range of activ e body temperatures, and performance was not necessarily maximal at normally experienced body temperatures. These processes have much less thermal dependence than do most physiological processes and suggest adaptations to maintain functional behavioral capacity over a broad range of body temperature.

AB Golden digger wasps, S. ichneumoneus L. (Sphecidae), are a solitary, ground-nesting species that dig burrows to particular depths in the soil. Hypotheses about the mechanisms controlling digging behavior are evaluated. Altering the wasps'' burrows as they are digging, indicates that they are not digging for some prescribed length of time nor are they digging until they reach some suitable environmental characteristic deep in the soil. They may be digging until they reach a particular tunnel length, making corrections if the tunnel is too shallow or too deep. This distance can be altered somewhat by surface environmental conditions.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To relate copulatory behavior to differential reproduction, 20 Long-Evans and 20 F344 male rats were observed in both 1-male and 2-male tests with an F344 female. Copulatory behavior was quite similar in the 2 conditions, although there were some quantitative differences. Little fighting occurred. Long-Evans males attained 56% of the ejaculations and sired 76% of the offspring. The 1st male to ejaculate gained no advantage with respect to siring offspring. The male ejaculating last or most frequently gained a significant reproductive advantage. Far from being wasted activity, persistent copulation in male rats plays an integral role in differential reproduction.

TI CONTROL OF DIFFERENT MATING SYSTEMS IN A CORAL-REEF FISH BY ONE

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The Red Sea coral-dwelling damselfish D. marginatus is organized in stable territorial groups with males dominating all females. The fish live in pairs, harems of multi-male groups. Group size, and the number of sexually active males in a group, are correlated with coral size. Males monopolize and control the coral, attracting potential mates. The experimental alteration of coral sizes, using spherical Stylophora corals, resulted in an increase of male numbers, in artificially composed groups, with the increase of coral size. Pairs and harems were produced on small corals, multi-male groups on big corals. Experiments with unisexual groups revealed a higher survival of females; males are more aggressive to each other, and cause a stronger emigration of subdominants. In D. marginatus, group size and the number of sexually active males are essentially restricted by 1 environmental factor: the number of available hiding places on a coral.

In-fostered (reared by foster conspecific females) and non-fostered animals served as controls. When adult, subjects, were tested for olfactory preferences in a free-choice Y-maze olfactometer. When compared to controls, cross-fostered animals showed an increased preference for heterospecific odor. This effect was stronger for males than for females. Adult species-specific odor preferences are learned during the neonatal period.

AB Data were collected to test the idea that male magpies guard their mates during the fertile period (i.e., when a female can be fertilized) from mating attempts by other males. During the fertile period males remained closer and followed their mates more than before. Each sex responded differently to male and female intruders. A caged female in a territory elicited aggression from the female, and from male and female when both birds approached together. Lone males courted the caged female. Non-breeding males were probably the greatest risk to mated males. The adaptive significance of different copulation frequencies in birds, in relation to cuckoldry, is discussed.

Up to 6% of rutting stages are permanently injured each year, while fighting success and reproductive success are closely related, within age groups and across them. Fighting behavior is sensitive to changes in the potential benefits of fighting. Stags fight most frequently and most intensely where potential benefits are high and tend to avoid fighting with individuals they are unlikely to beat. The relevance of these findings to theoretical models of fighting behavior is discussed.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Courtship behavior of 2 spp. of periodical cicadas, M. septendecin and M. cassini, was studied in the field during the 1970, 1973 and 1974 emergences of these insects. In areas where both species were courting there were differences in both male and female courtship patterns, both in acoustic and behavioral components. Experiments with models showed that male M. septendecim were more likely to court crude models of females than were M. cassini males. When females were courted with models that could imitate some of male courtship, they were more receptive when the models songs were those of conspecific males. Acoustic differences between species are probably used by females in mate selection, maintaining species separation even in areas where the 2 spp. overlap in both space and time.

The great tits were more successful than the other 2 spp. This may be related to difference in adaptability in the wild, where the great tit is the most successful of the 3 spp. in urban environments.

TI CLUMPING VERSUS SPACING OUT - EXPERIMENTS ON NEST PREDATION IN
   FIELDFARES (TURDUS-PILARIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Fieldfares (T. pilaris), which nest solitarily and in colonies, offer an opportunity to assess within 1 spp. the relative advantages of clumping vs. spacing out. An experiment with artificial, egg-baited nest showed that predation in the absence of fieldfares was higher on clumped than on scattered nests. Whether artificial nest run a higher risk of predation near solitary fieldfare pairs than near fieldfare colonies was tested. Nest predation was higher near solitary fieldfare pairs than outside and inside fieldfare colonies. The risk probably was higher outside than inside colonies. Communal antipredator attacks is the likely cause of reduced predation near colonies. Even solitary fieldfare pairs confer some degree of protection, because predation was lower at artificial nests near solitary fieldfare pairs than at nests without neighboring fieldfares.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of early experience on chemoreceptive and feeding responses were studied using 224 naive, newborn snakes (T. sirtalis) from a single locality in California [USA]. The effect of experience depends on the kind of prey. Responses to some prey (fish) can be modified by early experience. Response to dead, motionless fish can be enhanced by a single experience with a live, moving fish. Responses to other prey were not affected by experience. Snakes attacked and ate frogs and tadpoles on nearly all occasions regardless of prey movement and experience with other prey.

TI MILK EJECTION OF THE RAT, AS A STIMULUS AND A RESPONSE TO THE LITTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The milk ejection of the rat is stimulated effectively only if at least half the pups are suckled. This relationship is found if the mother is anesthetized but not if the mother is conscious. If the mother is conscious, the milk obtained by individual hungrey pups is unaffected by the number of other hungry pups suckled. This is true whether the other pups of the litter are removed, or whether they are present by satiated. After the milk ejection, pups tend to leave the mother''s nipple. Milk yield decreases with each milk ejection of a series, but getting less milk does not make the pups more likely to leave the nipple in search of another.

TI MODEL OF MATE DESERTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Using a very simple model, in which the reproductive strategy of an individual is considered to be completely specified by the time care for each brood, evolutionarily stable strategies were found and characterized in terms of the parental abilities of males and females. It was predicted inter alia that if at any stage the sexes were complementary, either by specialization or by the need for constant attendance with the young, so that 2 parents were much better than either parent alone, then only at extreme sex ratios would either parent desert. If the sex ratio was unity, then the 1st parent deserted when both parents were twice as good as the deserted parent alone. Except at extreme sex ratios, if 1 sex was very much worse than the other at caring for the young, then that sex would desert first. Where the male deserted first, the more heavily the sex ratio was biased towards males, the less the relative advantage of both parents over the female alone, at the time of desertion. Some general points about modelling mate desertion and parental investment were added.

TI ORIENTATION TO RAT PUP CUES - EFFECTS OF MATERNAL EXPERIENTIAL HISTORY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pup odors and ultrasonic vocalizations interact to produce effective location of rat pups out of the nest. Whereas, ultrasounds were effective directional cues for localization of pups, pup odors were not. Pup odors determined the speed at which females initiated searching and increased the choice of ultrasounds when these 2 cues were presented together. Litter removal, removing cues provided by the litter, affected orientation to ultrasounds. Stimuli from pups not only initiate and direct the location of pups but also maintain the females'' predisposition to retrieve.

TI EGGSHELL REMOVAL BY LAUGHING GULL (LARUS-ATRICILLA) - NORMATIVE DATA AND
   VISUAL PREFERENCE BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB After the eggs hatch, about 63% of the large eggshell fragments can be found near laughing gull nests. For the shells that were found, the mean distance from the rim of the nest was less than 80 cm at 3 study sites. The removal distance was positively correlated with the size of the nest platform, which suggests that birds often walk to the edge of the platform and simply drop the shell. Within the colony, eggshells have a natural variation in darkness that is related to the range of darkness of the nest material. Shell models were matched to the darkness of the eggs in the nest in preference tests. When natural shells and orange shells pegged to the ground were presented simultaneously, gulls preferentially attempted to remove the orange shell. The strength of the preference for the pegged orange shell varied from site to site within the colony, so the results were validated in a separate experiment by placing shells in the nest bowl one at a time to be removed in as natural a manner as possible. Orange was still preferred; fear of the orange model seemed to promote the removal response. The natural model was also no stronger stimulus than a solid white model in pegged shell tests. Control tests with white, grey and black models indicate that brightness plays a very weak role, so the removal preference must be based on color. When pegged models of any color were on the nest and the bird engaged in nest building, the nest building was usually biased towards the models, but not precisely directed at them. Removal behavior can be elicited via different perceptual mechanisms. One mechanism specifically recognizes the eggshell; the other mechanism is stimulated by a broad range of foreign objects that contrast with the nest background. In the laughing gull the contrast mechanism appears to be at least as strong as the recognition mechanism. This may be related to the low level of predation experienced by these gulls.

AB The scent-marking behavior of a group of captive but undistributed muntjacs (M. reevesi) was studied for 450 h in a 2200 m2 enclosure at the Calgary Zoo [Alberta, Canada] in 1971. Males marked more than females, and dominants of both sexes marked more than subordinates. Experimental alterations of the composition of the herd revealed that dominants marked most when in the presence of their subordinate rival. Some muntjacs covered the scent of conspecifics with their own. This behavior was interpreted as a means of monitoring the circulation of conspecifics in one''s home range.

TI EFFECT OF DISTASTEFULNESS OF MODEL ON PREDATION OF ARTIFICIAL BATESIAN
   MIMICS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In experiments with wild birds in suburban gardens, it was found that the rate of predation on artifical Batesian mimics was a function of level of distastefulness of the model. Birds which had eaten pastry pellets containing a high concentration of quinine dihydrochloride rejected more palatable patries than did birds which had experienced only mildly distasteful models. Furthermore, experience with the more aversive models resulted in the rejection of mimetic pellets further away from the model on the stimulus dimension of color than experience with less aversive models. These observations suggest that the rate of evolution of mimetic species and the size of mimetic populations are dependent of the level of aversiveness of the model species.

TI DOES ACTIVATION INFLUENCE SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN ZEBRA FINCH BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Zebra finches show short-term fluctuations between activity and inactivity, with feeding associated primarily with the former and grooming with the latter, while song tends to occur during the transition period. The hypothesis that these relationships between behavior patterns stem from fluctuations in a single underlying variable, termed activation, the level of which alters the probability of different acts was tested. In some individuals it proved possible to synchronize fluctuations in locomotion with short-term cycles of light intensity and in most cases the relationships of other behaviors to these cycles followed the predicted pattern. The fact that cycles in one behavior were not necessarily accompanied by cycles in others, and that a bird which synchronized its locomotion with all 4 of the cycle lengths used showed variable relationships between behaviors, both argued against this hypothesis. It is suggested that rest precludes the occurrence of other behavior patterns and that the relationships between these arise because they occur in order of priority when rest terminates.

TI SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION AND TERRITORIALITY OF SHORT-TAILED SHREW
   (BLARINA-BREVICAUDA) POPULATIONS IN OLD-FIELD HABITATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The social organization of short-tailed shrew (B. brevicauda) populations was studied using field and laboratory experiments and observation of a shrew population inside a large enclosure. Short-tailed shrew populations contain resident and nomadic components. Residents occupy small stationary areas at high prey densities and larger areas that are shifted frequently at low prey densities. Areas occupied by residents overlap minimally in winter, non-breeding populations. In summer breeding populations areas occupied by residents of the same sex do not overlap while those of residents of opposite sexes may overlap. Residents defend the area occupied against conspecifics. Scent markings along boundaries appear to maintain the spatial distribution of residents and deter intrusions by nomadic shrews. During encounters vocalizations function as offensive threats, and attacks and chases follow if the intruding shrew does not retreat. Visual communication appears to be less important than chemical and vocal communication in the defense of the area occupied. These data suggest that Blarina is a solitary territorial species.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Feeding sensitizes the responses of Nereis to sudden increases in illumination. After feeding significantly (p < 0.01) more animals responded to the light by crawling to the ends of their tubes than before it. In conditioning experiments groups of 10 N diversicolor be-came more reactive to the light (CS) [conditional stimulus] when fed (UCS) [unconditional stimulus]. But this was due to this sensitization effects of feeding because a group fed between CS presentations was as reactive as the group subjected to paired CS-UCS presentations. Tactile stimuli and electric shocks sensitize withdrawal responses to light. Sensitization occurred in conditioning experiments but there was no evidence of learned associations between the shock and light.

AB Avoidance in thalamus-damaged rats is facilitated following a period of exploratory behavior. The rats also exhibit a large daily warm-up effect in avoidance performance. Conditioned vocal responding is not facilitated by prior exploratory behavior and exhibits only a slight daily warm-up effect. It is suggested that the occurrence of a motor act facilitates subsequent voluntary motor activity and that the locus of such facilitation may be the diencephalon and limbic cortex.

TI ACTIVITY DURING FOOD DEPRIVATION AND SATIATION OF 6 SPECIES OF RODENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hunger motivation was investigated in hibernating species in order to compare their behavior to that of hypothalamic obese rats. Small numbers of ground squirrels, dormice, chipmunks, hamsters (hibernators) and rats and guinea pigs (non-hibernators) were tested for their reaction to a 3 day food deprivation in double activity cages that sampled movements in the living cage as well as recording wheel running. In all cases the wheel scores were more sensitive to deprivation, increments occurring in all species, except the chipmunks. When food was returned all species ran less in the wheel, except the ground squirrels. These animals did not show elevated post deprivation food intakes. After the fast the rats showed unexplained increases in activity in the living cages. There were apparent species differences in adaptation to the cages the rats and chipmunks gradually increased wheel running over the 1st few weeks; the hamsters ran less than initially; the other species remained fairly level. The hibernating species that can become obese, the dormice and ground squirrels, appeared less motivated by food deprivation than the non-hibernating species tested here. Quiescence in the medial hypothalamus might underly this behavior.

TI TURN ALTERNATION BY BUGS ON CAUSEWAYS AS A DELAYED COMPENSATORY RESPONSE
   AND EFFECTS OF VARYING VISUAL INPUTS AND LENGTH OF STRAIGHT PATH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two species of Heteroptera, Dysdercus fasclatus (Pyrrhocorldae) and Oncopeltus fasclatus (Lygaeidae), when placed on a causeway which includes a forced turn will make a 2nd opposite turn at a subsequent free choice. The magnitude of the opposite turn is a direct function of distance traveled prior to the forced turn and of the variety of patterning in the visual inputs. On a causeway with no turn of any kind the above factors resulted in a straightening tendency manifested as a decreased response to normally deviating stimuli. The turn opposite to the forced turn is considered a delayed compensatory response to the deviating stimuli of the forced turn. The response is "primed" by increasing visual and other stimuli and contains a memory element indicated by the delay in appearance; it is presumed to be a manifestation of a generalized orientation phenomenon which assures non-random movement.

AB Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a pervasive environmental pollutant with multiple adverse effects on animal biology. As the vertebrate nervous system is particularly sensitive to light effects, this study explores the potential negative impact of ALAN on cognition in adult zebrafish, Danio rerio. Fish from mesocosm populations exposed to either ALAN or control conditions underwent visual and spatial learning tasks, along with an evaluation of cognitive flexibility with visual and spatial reversal learning tasks. Contrary to our initial prediction of a general negative impact, learning performance was not affected by the ALAN treatment. The analysis of reversal learning revealed task-dependent effects on cognitive flexibility: fish exposed to ALAN performed worse than control fish in the visual reversal learning task, but displayed better performance in the spatial reversal learning task. We propose that the influence of ALAN on cognition might differ between different cognitive functions or involve noncognitive factors that play different roles in the testing paradigms. The study underscores the importance of task specificity in nonadaptive cognitive plasticity and calls for ecological assessments to quantify fitness consequences of ALAN in natural settings.

AB The robust exoskeleton of beetles, Coleoptera, is believed to have protective advantages, contributing to their evolutionary success. However, empirical evidence of the defensive capabilities of this exoskeleton remains surprisingly scarce. Here, we demonstrate the critical role of the robust beetle exoskeleton in protecting against avian predation. We found that flower chafers (Scarabaeidae, Cetoniinae) have more robust bodies than other scarab species. Laboratory experiments with na & iuml;ve Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, revealed that some individuals of intact Cetoniinae survived attacks without serious injury, whereas all individuals of soft scarab species or elytra-removed Cetoniinae were consumed. The survival rate of intact Cetoniinae increased in complex environments because the combination of their stiffness and elliptical shape made it difficult for quail to handle the prey. Field experiments with wild whitecheeked starlings, Sturnus cineraceus, and Eurasian tree sparrows, Passer montanus, demonstrated that most individuals of Cetoniinae species were ignored, whereas soft species were readily preyed upon. Further, when we presented the starlings with the Cetoniinae species Protaetia orientalis that had artificially softened bodies and altered appearance, the starlings readily preyed upon them. This observation suggests that P. orientalis is not chemically defended. Moreover, wild birds can visually discriminate hard species because of prior experience with the unprofitable prey. These results collectively provide evidence that the robust exoskeleton of beetles protects them from predatory attack. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal sociality ranges from predominantly solitary life to complex multilevel societies in which stable core units merge into increasingly inclusive entities. To understand the evolutionary pathways and mechanisms that promote and maintain animal sociality in different taxa, it is crucial to uncover whether conspecific aggregations result from true social attraction or nonsocial forcing factors (e.g. localized resource) and whether social preference is maintained in different contexts. Here, we show that, in cooperatively breeding carrion crows, Corvus corone, core social units persist at higher levels of aggregations (roosts). In our study population, individuals live in cohesive territorial kin groups year-round in an all-purpose territory. At night, crows from different territories may sleep communally in one of the four roosts available in the area. By radiotracking 73 individuals, we found that roosts were used mainly in winter and on cold nights in autumn and spring, suggesting a thermoregulatory function of nocturnal aggregations. Interestingly, we also discovered that members of the same social group preferentially used the same roost, showing a social cohesion that was not achieved by mere attraction to the same roosting site but was based on an active choice of joining groupmates. Therefore, our results indicate that social preference persists in different aggregation contexts in cooperative crows, revealing a further complexity of their society and suggesting a social function of roosts. However, different social groups did not merge in a stable and predictable way at the roost level, providing weak support for a multilevel society in this population.

AB Personality indicates consistency in individual behavioural responses across time, and different personality traits may be correlated in behavioural syndromes. Investigating such dimensions of the behaviour in frugivorous animals is crucial given the potential link between individual variation and their ecological significance as seed dispersers. However, few studies have explored the existence of personality traits and behavioural syndromes in fruit bats. In this context, we aimed to test whether the Neotropical fruit bats Artibeus lituratus and Carollia perspicillata show individual repeatability (i.e. personality) related to activity, docility and boldness and, if so, whether correlations between these personality axes constitute behavioural syndromes. All tests were repeated after 48 h to analyse repeatability. We found high individual repeatability in aggressiveness, activity and boldness for both species, but different behavioural syndromes for each species. For C. perspicillata, the three behaviours were correlated, with the least docile individuals being bolder and more active. For A. lituratus, docility and boldness were positively correlated but activity was not correlated with docility or boldness. Considering these different syndromes, our results suggest that C. perspicillata may show reduced variation in behavioural profiles compared to A. lituratus, likely influenced by species-specific selective pressures. Although our results are restricted to males, the existence of behavioural syndromes in these frugivorous bats contributes to our understanding of the importance of individual variation in behaviour on the ecological functions of these seed dispersers.

AB The mushroom bodies, an integrative region of the insect brain involved in learning and memory, have undergone volumetric increase in several independent lineages including bees and ants, cockroaches and some beetles. However, the selective pressures driving these expansion events are not fully understood. One promising system for investigating this question is the Neotropical butterfly genus Heliconius, which exhibits markedly enlarged mushroom bodies compared with other members of the Heliconiini tribe. Notably, this neural elaboration co-occurs with the evolution of trap line foraging behaviour and an improved capacity for learning complex visual cues and long-term memory. Here, we further investigated the behavioural consequences of this brain expansion by testing reversal learning ability, a commonly used measure of cognition and behavioural flexibility in both vertebrates and invertebrates, across three Heliconius and three closely related Heliconiini species. We trained butterflies to associate a food reward with either purple or yellow flowers, before training them with the reversed associations, and then reversing the cues again. All six species successfully learned the reversed cues, and, contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence that Heliconius performed better than the other Heliconiini species. These results are surprising, given previous evidence linking the mushroom bodies to reversal learning in other insects and the enhanced performance of Heliconius in other cognitive tests. This serves as a reminder that the functional consequences of brain expansion can be multifaceted and do not necessarily result in an overall increase in general cognitive ability, but rather result in enhanced performance in specific, ecologically relevant tasks.

AB Traits and patterns of time allocation that improve mating success can impose costs with respect to other functions, including thermoregulation. In dragonflies, melanin on their wings can be used as a sexual signal. However, melanin also absorbs solar radiation and can cause animals to overheat in warm temperatures. We examined how dragonfly mating effort and thermoregulatory behaviour change in response to temperature and whether those responses vary based on levels of wing melanin ornamentation in the calico pennant dragonfly, Celithemis elisa. We conducted our study at the northern edge of C. elisa's range and measured the time spent on mating effort behaviours and thermoregulatory behaviours as a function of ambient and microhabitat temperature in male dragonflies. We found a trade-off between mating effort and thermoregulatory behaviour in response to temperature; time spent on mating effort significantly decreased with increasing temperatures, while time spent on thermoregulation was positively related to temperature. However, we found no effect of wing melanin on behavioural patterns. These findings suggest that, as temperatures rise in response to climate change, some species may be forced to reduce important life history activities (including mating effort) with potential population level consequences for animals living in temperate areas.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB There are two main hypotheses for why offspring in cooperatively breeding taxa delay dispersal and remain on their natal territory rather than disperse. First, ecological constraints may force offspring to remain on their natal territory until a reproductive opportunity presents itself in an otherwise saturated habitat. Alternatively, delaying dispersal and helping kin may increase an offspring's inclusive fitness. One means by which offspring might enhance their direct fitness by delaying dispersal is by inheriting breeding status on their natal territory. Such territory inheritance regularly occurs in acorn woodpeckers, Melanerpes formicivorus, a species whose social groups consist of a cooperatively polygynandrous breeding core along with nonbreeding helpers of both sexes that are offspring from prior breeding efforts. Here we examine the life-history differences and the fitness consequences of birds attaining breeder status by either inheriting their natal territory or dispersing to a new territory. Despite significant differences in life history, including the mean territory quality on which individuals bred and mean co-breeder coalition size of breeders, we found no statistical differences in either direct or kin-selected (indirect) fitness benefits for breeders that inherited and dispersed. The incidence of birds engaging in both strategies, inheriting their natal territory and later dispersing, or dispersing but later returning to inherit their natal territory, further reduces the potential direct fitness benefits of inheritance relative to dispersal, since neither precludes the other. Territory inheritance is an important, alternative means of achieving breeding status in this population. However, ecological constraints to dispersal and kinselected fitness benefits as a helper likely play larger roles driving the acorn woodpecker's extraordinary social system.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Many animals rely on their visual systems to detect, locate or discriminate information in their envi-ronment. Environmental 'visual noise', however, may interfere with an animal's ability to detect visual information, affecting decision-making processes. A ubiquitous form of visual noise in aquatic envi-ronments is caustic flicker: moving light patterns caused by the refraction of light through surface waves. While caustics impair the ability of fishes to detect prey, the impacts of caustics on the ability of non -vertebrates to target prey remains untested. In the present study, we asked whether the hunting success of the common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, is affected by the presence of caustic flicker. To do this, we tested whether both the spatial (definition) and temporal (speed) components of caustic flicker affected the ability of cuttlefish to detect and catch a common prey, the brown shrimp, Crangon crangon. Neither the spatial nor temporal components of caustic flicker affected the detection latency or the capture time of prey. Moreover, cuttlefish did not adapt their hunting behaviour, including their approach speed, movement bouts, attack distance or angle, as a function of caustic flicker. Our results show that visual noise from caustic flicker does not affect the ability of cuttlefish to hunt their prey or their hunting behaviour. We provide multiple explanations, including the role of polarization vision, for why dynamic illumination does not appear to impact the visual sensory processing of cuttlefish.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Animals often plastically adjust resource choice to improve search efficiency or access to high-quality resources. However, animals may encounter environments in which resources vary in both apparency and quality, making it difficult to simultaneously search efficiently and exploit high-quality resources. We tested the hypothesis that time-limited animals tend to prioritize resource apparency, sometimes over resource quality. We observed individual cabbage white butterflies, Pieris rapae, as they searched for visually discriminable host plants (cabbage) and host plants that closely matched nonhost plants in our arena (radish). We found that cabbage was more discriminable than radish due to a waxy ultraviolet (UV)-reflective layer which, when removed, decreased butterfly search accuracy. When cabbage (with wax) and radish were both of high quality, butterflies preferentially landed on cabbage, despite radish being a superior resource in terms of growth rate. When differential fertilizer application was used to lower cabbage's quality relative to radish, butterflies slightly reduced their landings on cabbage compared to other treatments but still showed a preference for cabbage (the more discriminable host). Furthermore, individuals with more pronounced preferences for the discriminable host made fewer mistakes during host searching. These results suggest that while resource choice is sensitive to changes in host quality, time-limited species continue to visit relatively more discriminable resources even when they are of low quality. We argue that an understanding of species ecology gives insights into when animals may fail to plastically adjust decision making.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Furthermore, individual phenotypic plasticity and population-level evolutionary adaptation might interact in a reciprocal relationship: phenotypic plasticity itself may evolve in response human disturbance, and the nature of those plastic responses might influence subsequent evolutionary adaptation (the plasticity-first hypothesis). For years biologists have emphasized the need to evaluate multiple environmental stressors when studying organisms' responses to human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC). Given that these multiple stressors are likely to impact a variety of phenotypes simultaneously, there is also a particular need to study plasticity in response to numerous stressors (i.e. 'multidimensional plasticity'). While current research has yielded great insight into how populations are adapting in the face of novel environmental challenges, there are clear gaps in our understanding of these mechanisms, such as why similar species, or even multiple populations of the same species, do not exhibit similar ecological or evolutionary responses to HIREC. Here, we argue that incorporating the plasticity-first hypothesis and multidimensional plasticity into ecological and evolutionary studies of HIREC may yield greater insight into some of these challenges. This is important considering that most phenotypes display multidimensional plasticity, and HIREC brings with it a suite of novel challenges. The goal of this review is to highlight the need for incorporating multiple environmental stressors when considering organismal responses to HIREC and emphasize the importance of multidimensional plasticity and the plasticity-first hypothesis as ways to study how these suites of ecological stressors may influence evolutionary trajectories following HIREC. We then end by laying out questions and predictions that may be useful to those who wish to incorporate these concepts into their research. (c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Intraspecific interactions shape animal social networks and regulate population dynamics. Species with solitary life histories rely on communication cues for population regulation, especially olfaction for many terrestrial mammals. Increasing evidence shows complex social structures among presumably solitary species and although social factors may play a key role in spatial organization, we lack insights into how species with solitary life histories structure and maintain sociospatial systems. Herein, we applied a social network approach to decode leopard, Panthera pardus, behaviour and interactions at marking sites that we monitored with camera traps. We found that leopard social units within our study area consisted of up to five individuals and that same-sex and opposite-sex interactions were equally likely to occur. Individuals behaved and responded differently depending on the type of interaction, serving both ter-ritorial and reproductive purposes. Temporal segregation allowed intersexual co-occurrence, while same-sex co-occurrence may be facilitated through familiarity with stable neighbours. Central in-dividuals interacted within and outside their social unit and appeared fundamental to group stability. The removal of these individuals, such as through legal harvest or pre-emptively as an attempt to minimize depredation, may weaken social cohesion and ultimately affect population demography. Our findings on intraspecific co-occurrence in a solitary carnivore depict a complex social structure that can be important for population stability and might occur in other solitary species.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Identifying ecological factors that influence brain size evolution is a major challenge in organismal biology. The extractive foraging hypothesis proposes that large brains are more likely to evolve in taxa that extract prey items from hard-to-access substrates, but this idea has received relatively little attention. Here, we provide a comprehensive test of the extractive foraging hypothesis in woodpeckers, a family of relatively large-brained birds that contains many species that feed on wood-boring larvae extracted from trees. Our results show strong support for the extractive foraging hypothesis. First, woodpeckers that use extractive foraging have relatively larger brains compared to species that forage using other tactics. Second, our comparative analyses suggest not only that big brains are the likely ancestral phenotype among all woodpecker taxa, but also that this trait is associated with innovation in foraging behaviour. We suspect that retaining an ancestral large brain likely increases the probability that a given species evolves to become an extractive forager who eats largely wood-boring larvae, given that species that transitioned to a small brain evolved different diets. Thus, the extractive foraging hypothesis likely applies to woodpeckers because of a historical contingency (large brains) that sets the stage for behavioural innovations to better exploit ecological opportunities.

AB For small, arboreal marmoset monkeys, antipredator vigilance is essential to ensure survival. However, since antipredator vigilance is incompatible with some other behaviours, such as feeding in a head-down position, it has to be regulated efficiently within individuals and perhaps even at the group level. To investigate what drives individual differences in vigilance and feeding behaviour in common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, and whether they adjust these behaviours to each other, we collected behavioural data on 14 marmosets in contexts where feeding and vigilance were mutually exclusive. The presence of infants resulted in higher overall vigilance and less feeding. Moreover, individuals increased their vigi-lance when the pair mate was feeding and thus could not be vigilant itself. They thus adjusted their own vigilance to the risk level of their pair mate, which resulted in a turn taking-like pattern of feeding and being vigilant in the pair. This flexibility of vigilance is consistent with marmosets' sensitivity to other's needs in another context, food sharing, when sharing is increased when food is more difficult to obtain. Together, these results suggest considerable awareness of the current state of group members in com-mon marmosets.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB The quantity and quality of individual social relationships is a fundamental feature of social structure for group-living species. In many species, individuals preferentially associate with close relatives, which can amplify social benefits through inclusive fitness. Reproductive variation, dispersal and other factors may nevertheless impact relative kin availability, especially for species with slow life histories. As such, variation in family size can affect the social integration of the individual. Here, we investigated the effects of family size on female sociality in a population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Shark Bay, Australia. This population exhibits high fission-fusion dynamics, with females varying widely in gregariousness and both sexes remaining philopatric, providing females with both matrilineal and nonmatrilineal kin as potential associates. We used genetic relatedness data obtained from a large single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel and a spatially explicit null model to measure females' pro-pensities to form affiliations with both related and unrelated individuals. We found that females had strong social preferences for matrilineal close (first, second and third degree) kin, but also significant preferences for nonmatrilineal close and more distant kin compared to unrelated individuals. Despite these preferences, we found only small effects of kin availability on individual social position. Stronger and more consistent effects were attributable to individual foraging ecology, although much of the variation remains unexplained. Overall, our models suggest that while female dolphins have strong kin preferences, their social connectivity is not determined by family size; rather, individual foraging stra-tegies and high fission-fusion dynamics enable a diverse repertoire of social strategies to coexist within a population.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many taxa, variations in the early social context are well known to influence the expression of a suite of behaviours later in life. For species living temporarily in groups, relatively few studies have examined how the ontogenetic change in the social context experienced by individuals during their transition from social to solitary influences their responses to environmental variation. It can be hypothesized that the presence of conspecifics during the gregarious phase may constrain the expression of any behavioural changes in response to external variations that would be detrimental to group cohesion and reduce the benefits associated with social life. In this study, we investigated the interplay between early social experience, satiation and ontogeny in the development of aggressive behaviours in juveniles of the solitary spider Agelena labyrinthica. First, we exposed spiderlings to a period of social isolation of similar duration at different ages, while others were continuously reared socially. Second, we examined how feeding influences the onset of agonistic interactions in spiderlings reared in isolation or socially. When spiders were socially deprived, we found that aggressive behaviour towards siblings increased both when they experienced isolation at a later developmental stage and when they were fed. This was in contrast to spiders maintained in groups, which, regardless of their age and whether they were fed or not, remained tolerant. Overall, our study suggests that changes in the social environment during ontogeny set the context for the expression of behavioural plasticity that prepares individuals for living alone.

AB Groups of cooperative organisms, including humans, benefit from the contributions of both specialist and generalist individuals. Group responses to resource or task demand emerge from the specific actions of individuals within the group. Bumble bee colonies need to respond to resource demands for both pollen and nectar for colony growth and reproduction. Bumble bee workers have been shown to display differ-ences in foraging preferences for these essential resources and in activity level. This study investigated the responses of Bombus terrestris individuals to resource demand by subjecting colonies to different pollen and sucrose storage scenarios, considering their individual foraging preferences and activity levels. The sucrose sensitivity and olfactory learning ability of individuals were then compared along a spectrum of foraging preference (between pollen and sucrose foraging) using the proboscis extension reflex paradigm. When sucrose was in demand, individuals with a preference for sucrose showed the largest upregulation in foraging bouts. Individual preference for pollen and activity level correlated with the upregulation of foraging bouts when pollen was in demand. This study detected no relationship between body size, su-crose preference and worker sucrose sensitivity or olfactory learning ability, tested with proboscis extension reflex conditioning. This study highlights the potential value of foraging preferences in bumble bee colonies but also the flexibility these colonies have with a small foraging workforce.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Orange-crowned warblers, Leiothlypis celata sordida, breeding on the California Channel Islands exhibit remarkable variation in their nest structure and placement, providing an intriguing exception to the general pattern that avian nest structure and nest site selection are highly conserved characters. We examined nest construction at both the population and individual scale to test whether warblers on Santa Catalina Island change their nest construction in response to nest height. At the population level, warblers built both lighter, grass-dominated ground nests and heavier off-ground nests that contained more rigid materials and less grass. The probability of nest success was significantly and positively correlated with nest height. At the individual level, we found the same individuals were capable of building on-and off-ground nests between nesting attempts within the same season. However, nest construction was highly variable among individuals and not significantly correlated with nest success after controlling for nest height. We suggest this observed behavioural plasticity in nest construction and nest height is a hierarchical response to the absence of avian predators. Reduced risk from avian pred-ators appears to allow the warblers to use a variety of nest sites, thereby necessitating increased flexi-bility in nest construction.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB The ability to detect and respond to indicators of risk is vital for any animal and, for many species, humans represent a key threat. We investigated whether wild jackdaws, Corvus monedula, a species that thrives in anthropogenic environments but is regularly persecuted by people, associate human voices with differential degrees of risk and differ in their responses according to local levels of human disturbance. Playbacks showed that nesting females did not discriminate between the voices of familiar men who posed differing levels of threat, generalize to unfamiliar individuals with similar regional ac-cents or discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar accents and voices. They were, however, considerably more wary towards male than female human voices, which may reflect the greater likeli-hood of negative experiences with men than women. Responses to playbacks also differed across fine -scale spatial locations: females nesting in areas of the colony with high levels of disturbance were less likely to leave the nest cup in response to playbacks and were more wary on their return to the nest than birds nesting in less disturbed areas. Nevertheless, levels of local disturbance did not influence repro-ductive success. Together these results indicate that, although vocal cues alone may not suffice for wild jackdaws to discriminate between individual humans or generalize across categories of people, sensi-tivity to cues of gender and local disturbance may help jackdaws to optimize their defensive behaviour and maintain breeding success. Further research into plastic responses towards indicators of human risk is vital to understand and mitigate the impacts of increasing urbanization on wildlife populations.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Scent marks deposited as semiochemical signals are a primary mode of communication for a broad range of mammal species. Such scent signals are often deposited at specific, frequently visited marking sites called latrines. Despite descriptions of widespread latrine use by numerous mammal species, detailed understanding of site visit rates and latrine function is lacking. Here we report for the first time a quantitative assessment of scent-marking behaviours that represent interpack olfactory communication by African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus, at latrines visited by multiple resident neighbouring packs, hereafter called a 'shared marking site' (SMS). We show that multiple packs visited specific SMSs frequently and regularly throughout the year, with a notable decrease in visits during the 3-month denning season coinciding with a contraction in range size. In addition to resident neighbouring packs, dispersing in-dividuals visited and scent-marked at SMSs, suggesting that latrines function at least in part as sites communicating information about residence and possibly reproductive status. Further detailed investi-gation of the relevance of latrine use to territorial behaviour, ranging, habitat use and dispersal in this species is required, particularly as it may have direct applied conservation implications for this wide-ranging but territorial endangered species.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Interindividual differences in behaviour within the members of a social group can affect the group's productivity. In eusocial insects, individual differences between workers in a colony play a central role in division of labour and task allocation. Extensive empirical and theoretical work has highlighted variation in response thresholds as a proximate mechanism underlying individual behavioural differences and hence division of labour. However, other response parameters, like response probability and intensity, can also affect these differences. In this study, we first extended a previously published agent-based model on honey bee, Apis mellifera, foraging to understand the relative importance of response (dance) probability and response (dance) intensity in the task of recruitment. Comparing variation obtained from the simulations with previously published empirical data, we found that response intensity played a more important role than probability in producing consistent interindividual differences in recruitment behaviour. We then explored the benefits provided by this individual variation in recruitment behaviour to the colony's collective foraging effort under different environmental conditions. We found that individual variation led to a greater energy yield per forager, but only when food was abundant. Our study highlights the need to consider all response parameters while studying division of labour and adds to the growing body of evidence linking individual variation in behavioural responses to the success of social groups.

AB As Darwin first recognized, the study of emotional communication has the potential to improve scientific understanding of the mechanisms of signal production as well as how signals evolve. We examined the relationships between emotional arousal and selected acoustic characteristics of coo and scream vocalizations produced by female rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, during development. For coos, arousal was assessed through measures of stress-induced elevations of plasma cortisol exhibited in response to the human intruder test. In the analysis of screams, arousal was evaluated from the intensity of aggression experienced by the vocalizer during natural social interactions. Both call types showed a positive relationship between arousal and overall fundamental frequency (F0, perceived as pitch in humans). In coos, this association was dampened over development from infancy (6 months) to the juvenile, prepubertal period (16 months) and further to menarche (21.3-31.3 months), perhaps reflecting developmental changes in physiology, anatomy and/or call function. Heightened arousal was also associated in coos with increases in an acoustic dimension related to F0 modulation and noisiness. As monkeys matured, coos showed decreases in overall F0 as well as increased noisiness and F0 modulation, likely reflecting growth of the vocal apparatus and changes in vocal fold oscillation. Within screams, only one acoustic dimension (related to F0 modulation) showed developmental change, and only within one subclass of screams within one behavioural context. Our results regarding the acoustic correlates of arousal in both call types are broadly consistent with findings in other species, supporting the hypothesis of evolutionary continuity in emotion expression. We discuss implications for broader theories of how vocal acoustics respond to selection pressures. (c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Specialist predators are innately and distinctively proficient at targeting specific prey types. This is enabled by behavioural, perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that can only be understood using carefully designed experiments. Evarcha culicivora is an East African jumping spider that feeds on vertebrate blood acquired indirectly by actively targeting blood-carrying female mosquitoes as preferred prey. Here we asked whether these spiders use the colour red to identify this prey. In Objective 1, we used spectrophotometry to document the changing redness of mosquitoes in the first 17 h following blood meals. In Objective 2, we used vision-based choice tests to document how E. culicivora's preference for blood-carrying mosquitoes changes over time (using an interval comparable to that in Objective 1). We found the strongest preference for blood-carrying mosquitoes during the first 6 h after those mosquitoes had fed on blood and that this time interval corresponded to when mosquitoes exhibit the reddest coloration. Based on this, we then took mosquitoes that had never fed on blood and manipulated their colour using a blend of red food dye to make them appear blood-fed (i.e. by matching their spectral properties to mosquitoes that had fed on blood within the previous 6 h). We also created grey-dyed mosquitoes that matched the spectral properties of those that had never fed on blood. In Objective 3, there was no evidence of E. culicivora visually discriminating between our red-dyed mosquitoes and blood-carrying mosquitoes; this indicates that, to E. culicivora, our red-dyed mosquitoes appropriately resembled blood-carrying mosquitoes. Finally, in Objective 4, we show that E. culicivora consistently preferred red-dyed mosquitoes over grey-dyed mosquitoes, supporting the hypothesis that E. culicivora uses some aspect of red coloration to identify their preferred prey. We discuss how these findings relate to cognitive processes, colour-based communication and sensory exploitation.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Artificial objects can polarize ultraviolet light sources to a higher degree than natural objects like water bodies. This can induce a strong attraction response by insects that use such cues as proxies of habitat suitable for reproduction. Visible range polarized light (VRPL) can create evolutionary traps for aquatic insects, but it remains unclear whether insects can use ultraviolet polarized light (UVPL) as a habitat selection cue or if UVPL pollution can create evolutionary traps for aquatic insects like VRPL can. Odonate (dragonflies and damselflies) insects require an aquatic habitat to perform their mating and egg-laying behaviours yet they also perform such behaviours on artificial surfaces (i.e. metal pieces). We measured the preference for UVPL versus VRPL via exposing three species of odonates (Enallagma praevarum, Ischnura denticollis and Sympetrum illotum) to experimental test surfaces differing in these visual cues and assessing behavioural preference via differences in mating behaviour, body condition (i.e. lipid and protein content and body size) and visual acuity (based on eye width size). Ischnura denticollis performed more diverse mating behaviours in association with the VRPL treatment, while S. illotum preferentially exhibited these behaviours in association with the UVPL. Ischnura denticollis individuals associated with the preferred habitat had lower lipid reserves, smaller body size and larger eyes, while habitat preference was unrelated to individual condition and morphology in E. praevarum and S. illotum. These results suggest intra-and interspecific variation in trap preferences, which are related to individual condition. They also show that UVPL is a cue that odonates use in habitat selection that has the potential to create evolutionary traps, suggesting conservation problems for aquatic insects that rely upon it to locate water bodies.

AB Play fighting, the most iconic form of social play, has been hypothesized to serve multiple evolutionary roles as a function of the age of the players. Although widely practised by youngsters, in some mammal species this form of play can also be present in adults. Here, we aimed to test these hypotheses by looking at the play-fighting behaviour of spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, by analysing the behaviour across age classes. Spotted hyaenas live in fission-fusion societies characterized by a rigid, nepotistic system of dominance hierarchy. Yet, the species is also characterized by social flexibility, which is evident from the high levels of support, cooperative behaviours and alliances. All these social features make spotted hyaenas a valuable model to explore play fighting at every age. We found that both immature individuals and adults invested a comparable amount of time in playful activities and showed similar motivation in initiating and maintaining their playful interactions. By play fighting, immatures can improve their motor and physical skills as predicted by the motor training hypothesis and, in agreement with the social assessment hypothesis, adults can gain information on social partners with whom they will have to interact in the future. Finally, contrary to our expectations, we found that those playful interactions characterized by strong competition (measured via play asymmetry index) also had the longest durations independently from the age of the players involved. Owing to the absence of escalation into real fighting, both immatures and adults appear to be able to manage the playful sessions despite their unbalanced nature. All these findings suggest that play fighting in spotted hyaenas can function as a 'safe social bridge' navigating both immatures and adults into the real future competitive challenges of the clan.

AB Territory defence is widely assumed to be adaptive because it enhances reproductive success. However, empirical evidence for such a benefit is scarce or nonexistent for many types of territorial organisms. The roles of intraspecific aggression versus interactions with females in successful breeding by territorial males are also still poorly understood in lower tetrapods, including lizards. We address both of these important issues using 10 years of data on genetic parentage combined with field behavioural studies in collared lizards, Crotaphytus collaris. As predicted, territorial males (T-males) had more mates, sired markedly more total offspring and sired more surviving offspring with more females than did nonterritorial (NT) males. Territorial males in structurally simpler habitats sired a higher proportion of each female's offspring than their counterparts in complex habitats, indicating that the ability of T-males to accrue mating benefits is highest where topography maximizes contact with multiple females. All measures of T-male reproductive success increased with travel rate but decreased with the time spent courting individual females, suggesting a fitness trade-off between these behaviours. We found no evidence that aggressive behaviour was linked to any component of male fitness. Hence, activities of territory owners appear to be shaped by sexual selection to enhance mating opportunities rather than to aggressively dominate same-sex rivals. Our study illustrates the value of long-term research documenting behaviour and fitness of free-ranging individuals over multiple reproductive cycles in evaluating fundamental questions about the adaptive significance of social tactics.

AB While fixed visual cues provide reliable reference points for navigation in static water, it remains unclear whether fish energetically benefit from their presence in flowing water. Furthermore, benefits of visual feedback from fixed sources may be less for group members that can gain additional information from others. Using an open-channel flume, this study investigated how the response of fish to stationary visual stimuli is influenced by flow and group membership under two treatments: vertical black and white stripes placed on (1) both side walls of the channel or (2) one side wall only compared to a control where both walls were uniform white. The responses were compared in flowing and static water, and between individuals and groups of five. Fish exhibited a positive affiliation for the visual cues, travelling more slowly and spending more time closer to the striped walls. Fish were more edge oriented under flowing conditions, presumably utilizing the lower velocities at the wall boundary to reduce energy expenditure. When only one wall presented visual cues, individual fish spent more time associated with it in flowing water, suggesting some energetic benefit in lotic conditions. This may result from a greater ability to maintain station or control position relative to a reference point and/or the use of visual stimuli as a proxy indicator of physical structure which may provide drag-reducing refuge. A lesser association with the striped wall in static water suggests that visual cues provide other nonhydrodynamic benefits, such as physical refuge from predators or opportunities for crypsis. Conversely, less association of shoals with the striped walls may reflect a greater dependence on information provided by conspecifics or increased security associated with being part of a group. This study indicates that fixed visual cues likely provide several benefits that vary depending on flow and group membership.

AB The environment experienced by one generation can influence the phenotypes of future generations. Because parental cues can be conveyed to offspring at multiple points in time, ranging from fertilization to posthatching/parturition, offspring can potentially receive multiple cues from their parents via different mechanisms. We have relatively little information regarding how different mechanisms operate in isolation and in tandem, but it is possible, for example, that offspring phenotypes induced by nongenetic changes to gametes may be amplified by, mitigated by, or depend upon parental care. Here, we manipulated paternal experience with predation risk prior to fertilization in threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and then examined the potential of paternal care to mitigate and/or amplify sperm-mediated paternal effects. Specifically, we compared (1) offspring of predator-exposed fathers who were reared without paternal care, (2) offspring of predator-exposed fathers who were reared with paternal care, (3) offspring of control (unexposed) fathers who were reared without paternal care and (4) offspring of control fathers who were reared with paternal care. We found that offspring of predator-exposed fathers were less active and had higher cortisol following a simulated predator attack. Although predator-exposed males shifted their paternal care behaviours - reduced fanning early in egg development and increased fanning right before egg hatching compared to control males - this shift in paternal behavior did not appear to affect offspring traits. This suggests that paternal care neither amplifies nor compensates for these phenotypic effects induced by sperm and that nongenetic changes induced by sperm may occur independently of nongenetic changes induced by paternal care. Overall, these results underscore the importance of considering how parents may have multiple nongenetic mechanisms by which they can influence offspring.

AB Models investigating predator-prey games often fix one player's behaviour while allowing the other to make patch use choices. Here, we use adaptive dynamics to model changes in behavioural rates of a predator and prey, while explicitly allowing both to make decisions simultaneously. Our model focuses on a two-patch situation. The prey can move between an open patch, allowing for energy intake but also predation risk, and a refuge with no possibility of energy intake or predation risk. The predator can move between that patch, where it can attack prey, and an alternative patch that provides a fixed rate of energy intake, and consequently imposes a missed opportunity cost (MOC) of using the focal patch. The model predicts how the rates of movement by the players are influenced by specific parameters, including the predator's lethality and MOC, as well as the information available to the players. For example, our model predicts that the time a prey takes to emerge from its refuge and the time a predator waits for the prey to emerge depend on the sequence of events leading to the prey entering the refuge. For instance, the predator would leave the patch more quickly and the prey would emerge from the refuge more quickly if the prey entered the refuge after a failed attack rather than as part of its time allocation.

AB Winner and loser effects are widespread among animal taxa and are known to influence hierarchy formation, although it is unclear how rank influences such effects in species organized in social hierarchies. We investigated the existence of winner and loser effects and the effect of social rank on such effects in Neolamprologus pulcher, a cooperatively breeding cichlid fish. Social groups of these fish are organized in strict linear, size-based hierarchies. We successively assigned a dominant or subordinate rank to each of 18 focal individuals in balanced order, followed by an assigned winning or losing experience, respectively, resulting in a two-by-two factorial design. For each of the four treatment combinations, we recorded the performance of the focal fish in contests over a resource with similarsized, na & iuml;ve opponents. Assigned winners won subsequent contests more often than losers, were more likely to escalate the contest and showed more overt aggression during a contest. Moreover, individuals with assigned subordinate rank showed more restrained aggression. However, winner and loser effects were not modulated by rank. This study shows that winner-loser effects exist in a highly social fish with linear social hierarchy. Moreover, fighting experience and rank may play complementary roles in conflict resolution.

AB Geographical variation in animal phenotypes is common, yet we know surprisingly little about how recognition varies across populations. Instead, much recognition research focuses on one or a few populations and assumes recognition behaviour is consistent across a species' range. Here, we show that individual identity signals and individual recognition vary across the geographical range of Polistes fuscatus wasps. Polistes fuscatus in Michigan and New York, U.S.A., have variable facial patterns that signal individual identity and are used by receivers for individual recognition. However, P. fuscatus from Rothrock, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., lack individual identity signals, as they have less variable facial patterns than P. fuscatus from Michigan. Furthermore, P. fuscatus from Pennsylvania are not capable of individual recognition. Pennsylvania P. fuscatus do not learn and remember individual conspecifics during social interactions or during training. The Michigan and Pennsylvania populations are genetically differentiated, but the differentiation is driven by geographical distance, not adaptive differentiation based on recognition differences. Overall, both signals and receiver responses vary across populations of P. fuscatus. Our results suggest that recognition systems may rapidly evolve to produce variation in signals and receiver responses across a species' geographical range.

AB Observing interactions between others can provide important information to individuals. Male songbirds often engage in singing contests where they vary the type and timing of signals and provide eavesdropping individuals with information about their competitiveness. How this information is used and its effect on subsequent spatial behaviour and reproductive decisions of eavesdroppers is not well understood. Here we tested whether great tits use information gathered by eavesdropping on male singing interactions to assess rivals and (potential) mates. We used interactive playback experiments to engage territorial males in song contests with either a more (song overlapping and more persistent singing) or less challenging (song alternating and less persistent singing) intruder. We followed male and female movements by automated radiotracking, determined paternity using microsatellite analysis and maternal investment by quantifying egg weights and provisioning behaviour. We expected that mates of males exposed to the challenging treatment would subsequently foray more often off territory to assess other males and potential extrapair mates and invest less in their broods. Moreover, we expected that neighbours would adjust their foraying behaviour according to information gained by eavesdropping. Females, however, did not alter their foraying behaviour or brood investment and neither female nor male neighbours changed their visiting behaviour to playback territories. Our results provide no evidence that females used information gathered by eavesdropping on asymmetric song interactions in reproductive decisions or that song interactions affected movements across territories in the neighbourhood. Overlapping or singing for a longer time on an intruded upon territory may not always be perceived as a higher level of threat, and reproductive decisions and assessment of familiar individuals are likely to be based on multiple sources of information rather than on a single interaction.

AB In many animal systems, the defence of a territory or nest coincides with the defence of offspring, and it is often unclear whether the defence behaviour exists for the purpose of offspring protection, territory protection or a combination of both. In species with biparental care, the drivers of defence behaviours in males may differ from those in females, particularly if there are sex-specific fitness benefits from the current brood or territory. In this study, we present field experiments aimed at elucidating sex differences in the drivers behind nest defence in a fish species (Variabilichromis moorii, Cichlidae) with biparental care. High rates of cuckoldry in this species create asymmetries in brood value between mates, suggesting that increased brood survival may be a weaker driver of male than of female defence effort. We conducted parent and offspring removal experiments and found that following the removal of their mates, single males lost significantly more fry than single females. Some single males lost their territories, while others constricted their space use, suggesting that experimental divorce decreased their success in territory defence. Removal of fry from territories guarded by both parents caused the defence behaviour to become more male biased, that is, males contributed relatively more to defence without any fry present. Our results suggest that, relative to that of females, male defence behaviour is more strongly driven by territory retention than by brood protection. Nevertheless, the presence of males improves parents' abilities to keep territory intruders at bay, and thus probably confers benefits to broods. We conclude that the drivers of defence behaviours differ between the sexes in this species, with defence behaviours aligning well with the traditional definition of parental care for females, but less so for males.

AB Behavioural trade-offs arise when animals must decide to engage in one behaviour at the expense of another, potentially to the animal's detriment. Here, we investigate the existence of such a trade-off by exploring the relative influence of two important behavioural processes, thermoregulation and predation avoidance, on resting behaviour in a cold-adapted mesocarnivore, the wolverine, Gulo gulo. Using animal-borne biologgers, we evaluate the hypothesis that wolverine resting behaviour in both subnivean cavities and on surface snow beds is influenced by a combination of ambient weather conditions and predation risk. Specifically, we posit that although resting on the snow surface is more thermally advantageous in certain weather conditions, it is traded off against heightened predation risk. In support of the importance of thermoregulation, we find that wolverines rest almost exclusively in subnivean cavities at very low temperatures and low levels of solar radiation, and rest almost exclusively on the snow surface at higher temperatures and higher levels of solar radiation. In support of the importance of predation avoidance, we find that wolverines select more topographically concealed sites and are more vigilant while resting on the snow surface. We also find that wolverines are more vigilant at topographically exposed resting sites than at concealed sites. Together, these lines of evidence suggest that wolverines trade security from predators for thermal advantage at warmer ambient temperatures and higher solar radiation levels during winter, but that this trade-off is not necessary at lower temperatures when wolverines preferentially use subnivean cavities to simultaneously meet both demands. Parsing such contextually dependent trade-offs is important to understanding species' habitat selection, energy management and survival. (C) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Extended breeding bonds and direct paternal care are rare in group-living species with high levels of male-male competition. In polygynandrously mating savannah baboons, many males form close ties (primary associations) to certain females outside the mating context. These relationships have likely evolved as a form of male parenting effort because roughly 50-75% of primary associates are the sires of the females? current infants. Mismatches between the formation of primary associations and paternity have been interpreted as kin recognition errors, which arise because males rely on imperfect proxies of paternity. Alternatively, mismatches may reflect prior paternity history if males form enduring relationships with the mothers of their offspring. We tested these hypotheses in a wild population of olive baboons, Papio anubis. The behaviour of sires near the time of conception was considerably different from the behaviour of nonsire primary associates, suggesting that most males were not misled by ambiguous behavioural cues of paternity. Instead, previous paternity history was an important predictor of the strength of ties between males and lactating females. Both paternity of the current infant and paternity of the previous infant influenced the probability that males would establish close ties to females, and these effects were largely additive. These findings indicate that male-female bonds in olive baboons extend long past lactation and suggest that selection may have favoured prolonged paternal investment in offspring. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Group hunting where two or more individuals chase the same prey occurs in various vertebrate clades. Its evolution has typically been attributed to the resulting increased prey capture rate. Indeed, many studies have documented positive correlations between the number of individuals and probability of success, suggesting that joint hunting is cooperative. However, all existing data on vertebrates are based on field observations and hence cannot control for factors that may also influence hunting success, such as variation in habitat structure, hunting motivation or prey state. Therefore, we conducted controlled laboratory experiments to test whether hunting performance is affected by group size in the grouphunting yellow saddle goatfish. We presented invertebrate prey in an artificial coral reef and measured hunting performance as a function of manipulated group size, ranging from one to four individuals. We found that individuals hunting alone failed to catch the prey within the trial time limit significantly more often than groups did. Furthermore, we found that time until capture depended on group size, with singletons being slowest and groups of four fastest. With few exceptions, group members were approximately equally likely to catch prey. Hunting success as a singleton did not predict an individual's prey capture probability when in a group, suggesting that group hunting involves some producer-scrounger dynamics. In conclusion, while the experiment cannot address the question of how group size affects individual net calorie intake, the results show that groups are more successful at hunting than singletons are.

AB Song learning is generally assumed to be beneficial for a young songbird, but merely incidental, without costs or benefits, for the older song 'tutors'. In the present study we contrast two mutually exclusive hypotheses about the tutor/tutee relationship: (1) that it is cooperative, or at least mutually tolerant, with tutor and tutee mutually benefiting from their relationship, versus (2) that it is competitive, with tutor and tutee competing over territory, so that one or the other suffers negative fitness consequences of their relationship. In a field study of three consecutive cohorts of song sparrows, Melospiza melodia morphna, we determined the older bird (primary tutor) from whom the young bird (tutee) learned most of his songs, and how long tutee and primary tutor survived subsequently. We found that the more songs a tutee learns from his primary tutor, the longer their mutual survival on their respective territories. While the number of songs they share predicts the mutual survival of tutor and tutee, it does not predict the independent survival of tutor or tutee, suggesting that the benefit each receives from song sharing exists only so long as both survive.

AB Flexibility in foraging behaviour is a key individual trait, promoting adaptive responses to changing environmental conditions. Such flexibility can be especially pronounced in marine predators that forage in highly dynamic environments and pursue ephemeral and patchily distributed prey. Individual characteristics, social interactions and resource availability may all promote behavioural flexibility, which in turn may foster divergence in foraging tactics within populations. The adoption of specific foraging tactics by individuals from the same population could be driven by a complex mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We GPS-tracked chick-rearing parents of a sexually size dimorphic, avian, marine top predator, the Scopoli's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea, across multiple foraging trips to investigate (1) intraindividual variation in foraging behaviour and (2) the effect of sex and wind conditions on the adoption of specific foraging tactics. Based on cluster analysis applied to GPS-derived behavioural patterns at the foraging trip scale, we identified variation in foraging trips, from fine- to coarse-scale foraging (FF and CF, respectively). FF trips were characterized by lower flight activity, shorter travel distances and more intensive prey-searching behaviour compared to CF trips. Individuals did not consistently perform FF or CF trips. Males were more prone to perform FF trips than females, but both sexes shifted towards CF trips with increasing wind intensity, probably to exploit the energetic advantages of dynamic soaring. We conclude that sex-specific foraging tactics reflect the interplay between sex-specific energetic optima, originating from differences in morphology and a reduction in the niche overlap between the sexes. By adopting flexible, sex-specific foraging tactics, shearwaters probably optimize their energy expenditure during the energy-demanding chick-rearing stage. Our study outlines the importance of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors in shaping interindividual variability in foraging behaviour. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The long-held view that birdsong is exclusively a male trait has been challenged recently by a number of studies and reviews highlighting the prevalence of female song. Despite that, there remains a lack of knowledge on the function of female song, with most evidence thus far focusing on females performing duets with males in courtship displays, typically for joint territory defence or mate-guarding purposes. Here we show in a tracheophone suboscine passerine Formicarius moniliger, a sexually monomorphic species in which both sexes sing, that females may participate in both intrasexual and intersexual territory defence. Females sang more in response to females than to males, suggesting they consider females more of a threat to their territory. Yet, females also demonstrated an unexpected pattern of singing back to playback of males singing higher-frequency song than themselves. Unlike males, which responded indiscriminately to playback of any song performed by either sex, females appeared to discern not only the sex, but perhaps also the size of the presumed intruder. There was a strong negative relationship between body mass and frequency, and females responding only to higher-frequency male song suggests they will only engage in territory defence with males when they expect those males to be weaker than they are. While our results are consistent with expectations of a shared ancestral function of song in territory defence, they also suggest females may suffer greater costs in engaging in territorial disputes and thus limit their vocal contribution according to the perceived threat.

AB Individual variation in resource acquisition prior to mating can influence the expression of sexually selected traits and mating dynamics. One important resource that has the potential to affect mating is water; however, little is known about whether variation in individual hydration status impacts mating behaviour. Here, we investigate the effects of short-term water deprivation on mating behaviour in the harvestman Leiobunum vittatum, commonly known as daddy longlegs. These harvestmen follow stereotyped stages of mating during which males attempt to clasp females in a 'mating embrace', then attempt to copulate, and may guard females after copulation; females are able to resist male attempts at each stage to end the interaction. During these interactions, males pass fluid nuptial gifts to females for their consumption. We tested how short-term water deprivation affects mating dynamics in harvestmen using a fully factorial, single-choice mating trials between males and females that were deprived or not deprived of water for 4 h. Water deprivation affected behaviour at multiple stages of mating. Females deprived of water were less likely to resist male advances but also less likely to be embraced by males. Most dramatically, the duration of intromission was greatly reduced in trials where both sexes were water-deprived. Together, these results suggest that even short periods of water deprivation impact mating-related behaviour of both sexes and may be an important but neglected factor in sexual selection.

AB Individuals of the same population differ in their cognitive abilities, that is, in their capacity to acquire, process, store and act on information from the environment. The question of whether individuals with different personality types differ in their learning performances has been commonly addressed but has yielded mixed results. We propose that methodological differences among studies might have contributed to these contrasting results. Notably, the strength and direction of the association between personality and learning might be affected by which personality traits are considered and how they are measured. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with sailfin mollies, Poecilia latipinna. We assessed three personality traits that are likely to affect individuals' performance by influencing either their willingness to encounter the new situation (i.e. exploration and neophobia) or their susceptibility or emotional reactivity to stressful situations (i.e. anxiety). Then, we scored their performance in two learning tasks (i.e. discrimination and spatial reversal learning) after they had been extensively familiarized with the learning device and hence were all willing to encounter the task. We found that only anxiety had a significant effect on learning performance, with less anxious fish performing better in the discrimination learning task but worse in the spatial reversal task than highly anxious ones. Thus, our findings confirm a link between personality and cognition and are consistent with the idea that learning requires different steps that are each associated with different personality traits. Furthermore, highly anxious fish, on average, needed more trials to learn an association but some of them (with presumably high energetic requirements) consistently took more time before making a choice and had higher performance than their counterparts that made faster decisions.

AB For social life to emerge, the benefits of group living must overcome its costs, a balance that depends on the life history of the organisms and may occur more easily in some taxa than in others. Among spiders, sociality is uncommon. Social species evolved several times independently through the subsocial route, a process connected to a mean reduction in the aggressiveness and boldness of the individuals, with a simultaneous increase in the variability of personality. Personality variability is at the root of spider's division of labour, but the mechanism for its increase is yet poorly studied. One possible mechanism for the evolution of the variability in personality would be the creation of a new selective regime by the newly evolved, larger colonial webs, which could offer a mix of more protected and predator-exposed areas. To evaluate this hypothesis, we present an ecological-evolutionary model in which heterogeneous, spatially explicit variation in predatory selective pressures appear through changes in niche construction. Our model shows that social webs, by providing areas of greater protection against predators, increase the survival of the shyest variants, leading to increased intracolonial variability in personality. We speculate that this greater protection allowed social species the possibility of colonizing otherwise inhospitable environments, and that larger intracolonial personality variance, associated with social web spatial heterogeneity provided the basis for social organization through division of tasks among colony members.

AB Psychological stress induced by exposure to predators has complex effects on the behaviour and physiology of prey species. This includes potential influences on gene expression mediated via stress-responsive physiological pathways such as the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamus -pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Laboratory studies have documented diverse transcriptional effects of predator-induced fear, but genomic responses to predator exposure in the wild remain poorly understood. Here, we used RNA-sequencing to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome response to chronic predator pressure in a well-studied population of wild yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. We assessed the genomic response to this stressor in three ways by (1) identifying differentially expressed individual genes across the genome, (2) assessing whether differentially expressed genes were statistically over-represented by functional categories and (3) testing for transcription factor activity that may mediate observed gene expression differences. We found 349 individual genes regulated in association with chronic predator presence, including transcripts known to regulate heat shock proteins, metabolism and DNA damage repair. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the majority of these differentially expressed genes were involved with the cellular response to stress, cellular metabolism and protein transport. Transcription factor analysis implicated glucocorticoid signalling in mediating these effects. Our work confirms that the physiological response to predator-induced stress is complex, initiating transcriptional activity in multiple processes and pathways. In addition to the canonical expectations that individuals exposed to predators mobilize HPA signalling and homeostasis pathways, we also detected activity in genes typically associated with human anxiety and cerebral function. This is the first study to demonstrate that leukocyte transcriptomes taken from animals living in a natural environment can reflect the complex ecology of fear.

AB Sexual selection can act on all aspects of the phenotype and the opportunity for selection (I-s) sets its maximal strength. Popular approaches to alter I-s include the manipulation of the operational sex ratio (OSR) and/or density, with an increase in I-s predicted with a male-biased OSR and at higher density. However, debate continues regarding the utility of I-s to measure meaningful changes in the strength of selection, as changes in I-s with OSR and density may only reflect stochastic processes. Here we tested whether the manipulation of OSR and density alters I-s in the broad-horned flour beetle, Gnatocerus cornutus, a species where males are under intense sexual selection and the targets of selection are known. We also recorded the average number of fights and mating behaviour of individuals in our competitive arenas. We found significant main effects of OSR and density on I-s, with the opportunity for selection being highest in male-biased high-density treatments. There were also significant effects of OSR and density on the average number of matings, whereas only density influenced the average number of fights. These results suggest that manipulation of OSR and density influence the opportunity for sexual selection in G. cornutus and our observations of fighting and mating behaviour provide a proximate mechanism for the change in I-s.

AB Nepotism and reciprocity are not mutually exclusive explanations for cooperation, because helping decisions can depend on both kinship cues and past reciprocal help. The importance of these two factors can therefore be difficult to disentangle using observational data. We developed a resampling procedure for inferring the statistical power to detect observational evidence of nepotism and reciprocity. We first applied this procedure to simulated data sets resulting from perfect reciprocity, where the probability and duration of helping events from individual A to B equalled that from B to A. We then assessed how the probability of detecting correlational evidence of reciprocity was influenced by (1) an increasing number of helping observations and (2) an increasing degree of simultaneous nepotism. Last, we applied the same analyses to empirical data on food sharing in common vampire bats, Desmodus rotundus, and allogrooming in mandrills, Mandrillus sphinx, and Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata. We show that at smaller sample sizes, the effect of kinship was easier to detect and overestimated relative to the effect of reciprocal help. This bias in power was true in both empirical and simulated data, including when simulating perfect reciprocity and imperfect nepotism. We explain the causes and consequences of this difference in power for detecting the roles of kinship versus reciprocal help. When comparing the relative evidence for kin-biased help and reciprocal help, we suggest that researchers measure the relative reliability of both kinship bias and symmetry in the model by plotting the coefficients and their detection probability as a function of sampling effort. We provide R scripts to allow others to do this power analysis with their own data sets. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   PLASTICITY
AB Biologists have long been interested in the factors that maintain variation in learning and plasticity within and between species, especially given the role of such flexibility in coping with novel and changing environments. A large body of theoretical and empirical work has established the role of environmental variation in selecting for learning and plasticity, suggesting that simple measures of such variation could serve as proxies for organismal flexibility. However, a wide range of behavioural and physiological traits can shape how organisms experience environmental variation, and thus how plasticity is shaped by selection. Given that these traits themselves can evolve, this sets up the potential for complex feedbacks in the evolution of learning and plasticity. We begin this review by first detailing the wide variety of behavioural traits that shape environmental variation, ranging from exploration and dispersal to sensory biases and habitat choice. We then review relevant theory that suggests how such behavioural traits can modify selection on learning and plasticity, often favouring the evolution of specialization in heterogeneous environments by reducing the variation that organisms experience. When models allow behavioural traits to jointly evolve with plasticity, model outcomes differ and complex evolutionary feedbacks may emerge. We suggest that further theoretical insights could be gained by incorporating more nuances of development and behaviour, such as variation in the developmental window of environmental sensitivity of traits or differences in exploratory periods prior to breeding. Finally, this review discusses implications of this perspective for understanding the maintenance of genetic variation in learning, differences in colonization and survival in novel environments and making predictions about how species will cope with environmental change.

AB Migratory songbirds are guided by an endogenous programme during their first migration, encoding timing of migration, distance and direction. To successfully perform migration, birds have evolved phenotypic adaptations for flight, fuelling and navigation. Migratory distance in different species of birds is encoded as a period of expressed migratory restlessness, for which the length is correlated with migratory distance. Most of the work so far has been on nocturnal passerine migrants, while much less is known about the phenotypic adaptations for migration in diurnal migrants. Here we studied autumn migration fuelling and expression of migratory activity in caged diurnally migrating juvenile dunnocks in response to magnetic displacements. We kept one group (control) indoors at the location of capture in south Sweden, while the two experimental groups were gradually (over 5 days) displaced magnetically to locations to the northeast or to the wintering destination in southwest France. We found that all birds showed two peaks of activity during the day, for which the onset of activity was tightly timed to sunrise and sunset. The longest activity (2-3 h) occurred in the morning, coinciding with the natural period of migration for this species. For the control group, the migratory (flight) activity increased with the season (15 days), while it was strongly reduced for the dunnocks displaced to the wintering areas. Birds displaced to the north showed a stable, but slightly reduced migratory activity over time. The results support the finding that geomagnetic information expected to be met en route is important for triggering level of migratory activity in juveniles of a diurnal songbird migrant.

AB When confronted with social challenge, animals extract information from their environment to make adaptive behavioural decisions. The size of an individual relative to its opponent is a decisive factor that could influence contest decisions and the outcome of social competition. Animals may determine whether or not to engage in fights by assessing each other's fighting ability (mutual assessment), or solely based on their own fighting ability (self-assessment). Mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus, have been reported to utilize both assessment strategies depending on the stage and intensity of a contest. However, it is still unclear whether rivulus' contest decisions are determined by their own body size, perceptions of size differences between themselves and opponents, or by information conveyed by opponents' behaviour. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether rivulus of different sizes respond differently when encountering opponents of varied sizes. We provided rivulus with a 'stationary model opponent' to fight against, which can isolate the effect of size (and size differences) on aggressive performance without the potentially confounding effects of opponent behaviour. We hypothesized that animals would be more willing to initiate a contest and behave more aggressively when interacting with a size-matched opponent because differences in fighting ability are less easily perceived. As size asymmetries increase, however, differences in fighting ability should be more obvious to the animals and, thus, they should be less willing to initiate a contest and behave less aggressively. Our data support our hypothesis and reveal that, during early stages of a contest, opponent size alone does not affect an individual's contest decisions. Additional sources of information (e.g. about one's own body size) likely contribute to decisions about whether or not to initiate a fight. However, once individuals engage physically, their own body size, but not opponent size, becomes a predictor of their aggression towards opponents.

AB The dynamic nature of animal societies often hides multiple layers of complexity. The field of animal behaviour is rapidly advancing with the development of increasingly sophisticated analytical methods that allow scientists to identify complex and nuanced drivers of social patterns. The resurgent interest in giraffe sociality illustrates this by challenging the early view that individuals interact at random; it became clear that, instead, giraffes can be organized into multilevel societies, apparently founded on preferred associations. However, it is unclear whether such enduring associations result from active choice for specific individuals. The extent to which other social and asocial factors can contribute to an individual's inclusion in groups remains underexplored. Here we assess how context affects social preferences at the individual level by evaluating grouping patterns of giraffes in different behavioural states, habitats and levels of disturbance. When we controlled for potential class-based (as opposed to individual-based) assortment of individuals by sex, age and gregariousness, we found that giraffes only exhibited individual social preferences when foraging, with minor influence of habitat complexity or level of disturbance. Our results indicate that behavioural context is a major driver of giraffe social association. This strengthens recent evidence of complex social systems in giraffes and suggests that classic metrics of social relationships (such as association indices) may be too coarse, concealing true social preferences in wild populations.

AB The balance between resource acquisition and risk avoidance should vary according to personality type, with potential knock-on effects for fitness. Although previous studies have suggested a link between boldness and fitness components, little evidence is available on the behavioural mechanisms mediating this relationship in the wild. Because habitat use is the outcome of the trade-off between the costs and benefits associated with using each habitat type, we evaluated between-individual differences in habitat use of 64 GPS-collared female roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, using multinomial logit mixed models. To investigate whether deer differed in their habitat use tactics in relation to their personality type and their annual reproductive success, we assessed the link between individual habitat use patterns, boldness (measured as the strength of behavioural responsiveness to handling) and annual reproductive success (measured by the presence/absence of fawns at heel during autumn). Although daily and seasonal variations in the risk-resource landscapes clearly drove patterns of habitat use, individuals adopted contrasting habitat use tactics depending on their position along the shy-bold gradient and their reproductive status. Shy individuals occupied safer woodland more frequently, even at night when risk is lower. In contrast, bold individuals were better able to exploit rich open habitats. When this included mature autumn crops, these females weaned more offspring. Finally, irrespective of personality type, females that used meadows more often also achieved higher annual reproductive success. Overall, we demonstrate that individuals express divergent habitat use tactics as a function of their ability to avoid exposure to risk and their annual reproductive success.

AB In laboratory rats, one of the most used paradigms to assess habituation to novelty is the open-field test. Environmental enrichment has proved to be a reliable way to enhance open-field test habituation. Experiment 1, therefore, was designed to test whether grooming behaviour in the open-field test increases concomitantly with the habituation of exploratory behaviours (locomotion and rearing behaviour, an alert upright posture). To this aim, after a baseline measure, rats were raised in environmentally enriched and standard housing conditions and then tested 30 and 60 days later. As some grooming subtypes are differentially displayed in the open-field test, we hypothesized that only the grooming subtype that included longer and more complex sequences (e.g. body licking) would increase with habituation. We found that environmental enrichment enhanced short-term (within days) and long-term (between days) open-field test habituation, and increased grooming, particularly body licking. To provide evidence that grooming in the open-field test is part of the habituation process and not a by-product of environmental enrichment, habituation was promoted by exposing a different group of rats that had been reared in standard housing to four consecutive open-field tests in experiment 2. We supposed that the diminution of exploratory open-field test behaviours would be accompanied by an increase in body licking. We found that as locomotion and rearing behaviour decreased, body licking increased gradually both within and between days, suggesting that the appearance of more complex and longer grooming sequences are part of a de-arousal inhibition system subserving novelty habituation. A detailed analysis of grooming, therefore, may provide information about the emotional state of the rat that cannot otherwise be obtained from assessing exploratory activity.

AB Group members interact with each other during multiple social behaviours that range from aggressive to affiliative interactions. It is not known, however, whether an individual's suite of social behaviours consistently covaries through time and across different types of social interactions. Consistent social behaviour would be advantageous in groups, especially when individuals need to remember their group members' social roles and preferences in order to keep track of social relationships and predict conspecifics' future behaviour. Here, we address whether social behaviour of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, is consistent through time and across four interaction networks (aggression, grooming, contact calling, scent marking). We quantified variation in social behaviour through four network centrality measures including outdegree, outstrength, betweenness and eigenvector centrality. Comparing lemurs' measures across 2 years revealed that network centrality remained consistent between years. Lemurs' centrality also stayed consistent across interaction networks: individuals with high centrality in one interaction network also had high centrality in the other networks, even when we controlled for sex-based variation in social behaviour. Thus, regardless of their sex, some individuals were highly social and frequently groomed others, initiated aggressive interactions and responded to others' contact calls and scent marks. Lemurs also had preferred social partners they frequently interacted with across years and across multiple behaviours. In particular, lemurs frequently responded to the contact calls and the scent marks of the conspecifics they had frequently groomed. Together, these results demonstrate that individual variation in lemur social behaviour is not context specific, but instead persists through time and across multiple social interactions. Such consistent behaviour provides evidence of social personalities, which may influence individuals' interaction styles, including how socially active they are and with whom they interact.

AB In group-living animals, the structure of social interactions among group members can have important consequences for individual fitness. Changes in resource abundance can influence social interactions with an expected weakening of social ties during times of resource scarcity. Although human activity and infrastructure often impose a disturbance on animal populations, they can also be a source of reliable resources that are relatively easy to access. We evaluated whether the social networks differed between four spotted hyaena, Crocuta crocuta, clans experiencing contrasting levels of human activity and infrastructure in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The clan living in an area of high human activity and infrastructure had a less dense social network than the other clans, and the clan living in an area with limited human activity and infrastructure had shorter path lengths than the other clans, suggesting that it had more closely associated individuals. Our results did not support substantial differences between clans in the relative social network positions of animals from different age and rank classes. Contrary to our expectations, we suggest that anthropogenic resources may have weakened the social cohesiveness within spotted hyaena clans. We also argue that our study supports previous suggestions that there may be individual variation within broader classes of rank, age and sex in the position of individual animals in social networks.

AB Seasonal variation in food resources and predation risk imposes major constraints on herbivores, which must adjust their behaviour to maximize their energy intake and survival. In seasonally driven landscapes, it is not yet clear what the primary drivers are that shape seasonal variation in vigilance and feeding rates. These rates have been shown to vary in relation to various environmental, social and individual factors, but many of these factors also vary through the year, due to variation in food supply. We studied wild female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, under low predation risk over a year to investigate whether vigilance and feeding rates varied seasonally and whether this variation was mainly driven by food quantity or quality, group size or individuals' reproductive states. Both vigilance and feeding rates varied seasonally, as did food quantity and quality and group size. Vigilance, including antipredator (head orientation away from the group) and exclusive (i.e. vigilance without chewing) vigilance, decreased and feeding rate increased with increasing group size. However, because group size increased with food quality and quantity, food resources emerged as the primary driver of variation in behavioural strategies. These results suggest that the observed effects of group size on the trade-off between food acquisition and safety are in fact corollaries of the seasonal variation in food supply in our study system, in which the risk of predation on adults is low, and hence are by-products of the foraging choices made by kangaroos in response to the dynamics of the quantity and quality of food.

AB Multimodal (multisensory) signalling is common in many species and often facilitates communication. How receivers integrate individual signal components of multisensory displays, especially with regard to variance in signal complexity, has received relatively little attention. In nature, male tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, produce multisensory courtship signals by vocalizing and presenting their inflating and deflating vocal sac as a visual cue. Males can produce a simple call (whine only) or a complex call (whine thorn one or more chucks). In a series of two-choice experiments, we tested female preferences for variation in acoustic call complexity and amplitude (unimodal signals). We then tested preferences for the same calls when a dynamic robotic frog was added to one call, generating a multimodal stimulus. Females preferred a complex call to a simple call; when both calls contained at least one chuck, additional numbers of chucks did not further increase attractiveness. When calls contained zero or one chuck, the visual stimulus of the robofrog increased call attractiveness. When calls contained multiple chucks, however, the visual component failed to enhance call attractiveness. Females also preferred higher amplitude calls and the addition of the visual component to a lower amplitude call did not alter this preference. At relatively small amplitude differences, however, the visual signal increased overall discrimination between the calls. These results indicate that the visual signal component does not provide simple enhancement of call attractiveness. Instead, females integrate multisensory components in a nonlinear fashion. The resulting perception and behavioural response to complex signals probably evolved in response to animals that communicate in noisy environments.

AB Video playback experiments offer unique opportunities for behavioural tests due to the breadth and ease of possible manipulations available to stimuli. However, serious limitations to video playback experiments exist, primarily the need to configure a technology designed for human vision to replicate stimuli for a nonhuman viewer. Here, we test the effectiveness of video playback for two species of freshwater fish, Etheostoma barrenense and Etheostoma zonale. The focal species are closely related sympatric species that have distinct male nuptial coloration. Dichotomous choice assays using video stimuli showed that female E. zonale prefer video of conspecific males whereas female E. barrenense showed no preference for videos of conspecific or heterospecific males. Comparisons of video trials to live trials indicate that response to video playback is comparable to responses to live stimuli in female E. zonale but not in female E. barrenense. Differences in monitor replication of species-specific coloration may account for the asymmetry in response, and future work should further test colour-based recognition of video stimuli in E. zonale.

AB Individuals within species differ consistently in their behaviour. Such individual differences may represent adaptations. Recently, researchers have started to implement the same adaptive framework to individual differences in cognition, leading to the suggestion that personality and cognition should covary. To determine the contextual consistency of cognitive traits and their covariation with several personality traits, 24 guinea pigs, Cavia aperea f. porcellus, were tested using a battery of 12 cognitive tests. Four tests each were conducted to test for problem solving, association learning and social learning. We assessed consistency within each of these three domains and tested for cognitive and behavioural syndromes between domains. Problem solving and social learning were consistent across contexts and positively correlated with each other. In addition, both correlated positively with boldness, and problem solving showed a negative correlation with aggressiveness and sociopositive behaviour. Association learning was neither consistent nor correlated with personality or performance in the other cognition tasks. We showed contextual consistency of two cognitive traits and found multiple links to personality traits that were predicted by recent theory. Surprisingly, associative learning was not consistent, demonstrating the importance of testing the relation between personality and multiple cognitive traits to increase our understanding of individual variation in cognition and personality.

AB The mechanisms underlying vocal development in nonhuman primates, so- called 'nonlearners', are of special interest because they give an insight in how social factors can shape the expression of an already genetically determined vocal repertoire. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that the acquisition of the complex rules governing vocal exchanges (i.e. context-specific temporal and structural acoustic adjustments) may result from a socially guided development process, with social experience and parental selective feedback playing a key role. Among those conversational rules, call matching is a particularly remarkable phenomenon in Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, with interacting adult females matching the frequency range pattern of their own call with another female's preceding call. Here, we investigated whether fine-tuned acoustic adjustments during vocal exchanges in Japanese macaques are subject to developmental processes, specifically testing for the ability of individuals of different age classes to discriminate between vocal exchanges respecting, or not, the matching rule. We performed playback experiments in 10 adult and 10 1-year-old captive Japanese macaque females. Each subject was successively exposed to two stimuli: a pair of calls respecting call matching (i.e. two calls from two individuals with matched frequency ranges) and another pair of calls that did not. Adults discriminated better than juveniles whether stimuli respected the call-matching rule or not, and displayed significantly different levels of interest towards each stimulus type. The latency to look towards the loudspeaker was shorter, and the duration of the directed gaze was longer, after the playback that violated the matching expectation in every adult, but not in juveniles which seemingly displayed a random gaze response. Our findings support the conclusion that the matching rule is relevant for adults, but not for socially inexperienced young monkeys which may not have had enough experience of the conversational rules governing vocal exchanges.

AB In humans, emotions play a fundamental role in decision making. Although there is considerable evidence that nonhuman animals exhibit emotions, studies on how emotional responses affect their choice behaviour are scant. We tested tufted capuchin monkeys in a probabilistic choice task, in which subjects were repeatedly offered a choice between a safe option (corresponding to four food units) and a risky option (corresponding to either one or seven food units). The study included three conditions that differed in the probability of receiving the larger outcome when choosing the risky option. We evaluated whether capuchins anticipated that they may experience negative consequences from their choices by scoring latency to choose, scratching and alarm vocalizations before they made their choices. Moreover, we assessed whether capuchins exhibited emotional responses to different decision outcomes by scoring scratching, alarm vocalizations, banging, and switching after the choice outcomes were revealed. We also assessed whether capuchins' motivation to choose the risky option and emotional responses were modulated by the probability of 'winning' and whether the emotional responses experienced after receiving the choice outcomes affected their subsequent decisions. Capuchins scratched more before making their choices than after choice outcomes were revealed, whereas alarm vocalizations showed the opposite pattern. Thus, the capuchins seemed more sensitive to the conflict experienced when deciding which option to choose than to the frustration of receiving an undesired outcome. The inconsistent pattern of scratching and alarm vocalizations suggests that these behaviours indicate different emotional states. Capuchins showed more emotional responses and attempts at switching their initial choice after a one-item outcome than a four-item or a seven-item outcome, suggesting that they experienced regretlike emotions. The lack of a negative impact of receiving one-item outcomes on capuchins' subsequent choices may support the view that emotional responses have a coping function, but this hypothesis remains to be demonstrated.

AB Predation has widespread influences on animal behaviour, and reproductive activities can be particularly dangerous. Males and females differ in their reactions to sensory stimuli from predators and potential mates, which affects the risk experienced by each sex. Thus, the information available can cause differential survival and have profound implications for mating opportunities and population structure. The wolf spider, Pardosa milvina, detects and responds in a risk-sensitive manner to chemotactile information from a larger predator, the wolf spider Tigrosa helluo. Male P. milvina use similar chemotactile cues to find females whereas female P. milvina focus on the visual, and perhaps vibratory, aspects of the male display. Our aim was to document the risk posed by T. helluo predators on P. milvina during reproduction and to determine whether augmenting chemotactile information would affect that outcome. In the laboratory, we explored the effects of adding predator and/or female cues on the predatory success of T. helluo on P. milvina males or observing females. Additional cues from prospective mates or from predators enhanced male survival. The addition of female cues increased predation on females whereas predator cues augmented female survival. In field enclosures, we documented the impact of T. helluo, with and without additional predator cues, on the sex ratio of survivors and the reproductive success of females. Additional predator cues shifted the sex ratio towards males, however, 90% of the remaining females in that treatment produced eggsacs whereas less than 60% reproduced in female-biased populations. Thus, augmenting the available predator information shifted the risk from males to females, presumably due to differences in their sensory priorities. By altering the availability of potential mates, this shift appears to have influenced the intensity of sexual selection for this spider. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The perception of different attributes of conspecifics is an integral part of intraspecific communication. It can facilitate the recognition of interaction partners or the assessment of potential mates. Acoustic signals can encode fine-scaled information through the interplay of acoustic variability and specificity. A reliable vocal signature is both unique within a class and variable between classes. Therefore, acoustic complexity might be associated with the number of classes to be discriminated. We investigated the assumption that limitations to signal design may affect the communicative functionality of a signal. To do so, we chose a signal with potentially dual functionality which may therefore display such limitations. In bats, echolocation is used primarily for foraging and orientation but there is increasing support for its additional role in communication. An acoustic analysis of echolocation pulses of the bat Rhinolophus clivosus confirmed sex and individual vocal signatures in echolocation pulses. A habituation -dishabituation playback experiment suggested that bats perceived these signatures because listening bats clearly discriminated between the sexes (two classes) and between individuals (representatives of a multiclass category), although to different degrees. The simple acoustic structure of these vocalizations provides sufficient specificity for sex discrimination but has limitations for individual discrimination because pulse parameters of individuals increasingly overlapped with increasing group size. We conclude that selection for the primary function of echolocation restricts the acoustic space available for communication. However, we frequently observed echolocation pulses with conspicuous structural modifications. Statistical analyses revealed that these vocalizations yielded increased individual distinctiveness. Such added systematic variation may indicate a communicative function and perhaps a signalling intent of the emitter, although the latter has yet to be tested. The findings suggest that the required specificity for effective communication could be obtained through modification of echolocation variants when adaptations for orientation and foraging constrain the evolution of complex communication signatures.

AB A multimodal shift is the ability to switch from reliance on one sensory channel to another during communication. The shift can take place during signal production and/or perception. If environmental changes such as urbanization and climate change impair signal transmission in particular channels, it would benefit the animal to be able to switch to a relatively quieter channel. For this strategy to be successful, it requires animals to be able to send redundant information across multiple channels. I develop and explore the argument that the ability of animals to switch from a noisy channel to a relatively quiet one may be key for the animals' ability to cope with rapid anthropogenic environmental change. I review examples of multimodal shifts that occur with environmental noise as well as cases in which a predicted shift did not occur. I survey which sensory channels are used in shifts and whether the signal components are redundant or nonredundant. Most multimodal shift examples include the visual channel as one of the components. The majority of signals involved in shifts appear to be redundant, although the majority of signals involved in multimodal communication in general appear to be nonredundant, especially for chemical/visual combinations. Finally, I discuss how anthropogenic environmental changes can affect signal transmission in different channels and habitats and explain why the ability to shift channels may help animals cope with these changes.

AB Understanding the responses of predators, such as seals, to variations in prey availability is key to understanding their role in marine ecosystems. Individual variation in prey preference is likely to be important but we have little information on this aspect of predator behaviour. Operant conditioning techniques and an underwater feeding apparatus were used to test the prey species and size preferences of five captive grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, in a series of paired choice trials. The experimental procedure was designed to present simple foraging choices to remove as many potentially confounding variables as possible. Results suggest that individual grey seals exhibit prey preferences. When presented with different numbers of items of the same species, seals generally selected the larger number of prey items. When presented with choices between two species, seals apparently showed consistent preferences for particular species. However, the apparent species preferences may be simply explained in terms of size selection.

AB In group-living species, conflicts between groups frequently involve multiple individuals participating in aggression towards the opposing group. Although defence is a collective action, individuals differ in their motivations. For males, the spatiotemporal distribution of resources should determine whether they defend food or mates. Although resource defence as a male mating strategy has been demonstrated primarily in unimale social systems, males in multimale groups generally directly defend access to females. I examined the factors affecting individual assessment of the costs and benefits of participation in aggressive intergroup encounters among tufted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus (Cebus apella) nigritus, at Iguazu National Park, Argentina. Through provisioning and playback experiments I show that male aggression during intergroup encounters in tufted capuchin monkeys is directly related to the presence of a high-quality food resource, whereas behaviours more consistent with direct mate defence were not apparent. Although males and females demonstrated concordant strategies, male responses were stronger than those of females, but no differences were observed between dominant and subordinate males in the presence of a defendable food resource. Resident females may be manipulating male-male competition within groups, using males as 'hired guns' to increase access to food resources, thereby increasing infant survivorship and decreasing interbirth intervals. In this population, intersexual conflict, which is often associated with infanticide and sexual coercion in nonhuman primates, has promoted cooperation between the sexes.

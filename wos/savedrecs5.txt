AB Social monogamy is the most common social mating system in birds. However, the persistence of pair bonds between breeding seasons varies among species, populations and individuals. Understanding fitness causes and consequences of mate change is critical for understanding population dynamics and the evolution of social monogamy. We used 12 years of data from Scopoli's shearwater breeding population to estimate mate change probabilities and test whether they affect the probabilities of (1) skipping breeding, (2) apparent survival and (3) breeding success. Widowing was the most common cause of mate change, with more males changing mates at least once in their lives than females. Females' probability of skipping a breeding season increased significantly just before pairing with a new partner. Also, we found that females' apparent survival, but not males', might increase after mate change. A possible explanation is that a longer adult life expectancy of females after mate change could at least partially offset the cost of skipping breeding. We found no relation between mate change and breeding success. Our study suggests that the costs and benefits of mate fidelity may be sex specific in this species. Future research on this topic should focus on the effects of mate change on each sex's lifetime reproductive success, which we could not address specifically in this study. Future studies will hopefully be able to delve deeper into how mate change, caused by divorce or widowhood, shifts the balance of reproduction or survival, determining lifetime reproductive success. & COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Prey species that form groups gain a range of benefits from associating with conspecifics, including access to social information. Groups typically coordinate collective movement through local interactions, where individuals copy their nearest neighbours behaviour to generate group level decisions. However, individuals in a group may not always make 'correct' decisions, and blind copying of behaviour can lead to the spread of poor information and maladaptive cascades. To impede the spread of poor information, many animals that form groups have developed information-dampening mechanisms such as consensus decision making through the quorum response. In this study we monitored flocks of roosting Eurasian oystercatchers with a view to understanding the mechanics of group departure decisions and to test for the presence of a quorum response. Nearing high tide, oystercatchers would leave the roosting site en masse, where the timing of departure of many individuals was coordinated. Coordinating the timing of mass departures was a complex task as single birds and small groups frequently joined and departed from the roosting site, meaning individuals had to decide which departures to copy and which to ignore. Individual oystercatchers were more likely to depart within 10 s of another bird if they were closer together in the group, suggesting that departure information may be transferred locally between neighbouring birds. While single departures were very common, most individuals departed in groups of 10 or more, showing that single departures were a relatively weak departure cue and were frequently ignored by the rest of the group. The probability of an individual joining a departure event was higher with increasing departure group size in a nonlinear (sigmoidal) relationship. This trend is consistent with a quorum response with the propensity to copy the departure of groupmates sharply increasing at a quorum threshold of about 10 birds.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB The costs and benefits of group living and sociality have received much attention. Recent studies suggest that the acquisition of a more diverse microbiome may be another benefit of sociality which could be beneficial for host health and survival. We characterized the sociality of free-living prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, and their oral microbiome alpha diversity and dissimilarity (beta diversity) to assess asso-ciations between sociality and microbiome diversity. Voles were born in the laboratory and then released into seminatural enclosures, representing a shift in diet and changes in social interactions. Social in-teractions were monitored using an automated behavioural monitoring system from which we quanti-fied degree (the number of social connections) and association index (the strength of the social connection between two individuals). Oral microbiome samples were collected throughout the field season and then the oral microbiome was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, representing the first ever characterization of the oral microbiome in this species. Oral microbiome alpha diversity increased when voles were moved to the field from the laboratory but did not change over time in the field. It was not related to the number of social connections (unweighted degree). Oral microbiome dissimilarity (beta diversity) between two voles was not related to the strength of their social association (association index) nor was it related to whether the pair produced offspring together. The oral micro -biome became more dissimilar over the field season in sibling versus nonsibling pairs. Together, our results indicate a lack of association between social interactions and oral microbiome diversity and dissimilarity and provide an important contrast as other studies on this topic are conducted mostly in primate species and mostly in the gut microbiome. This highlights the importance of investigating other areas of the microbiome besides the gut and the relationship between these variables in additional species.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Integrated phenotypes, that is, correlated suites of traits, can impact both evolutionary and ecological processes. Similarly, phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of one genotype to generate multiple pheno-types, can act as both a facilitator and constraint on evolutionary processes. While there has been an increasing focus on correlated behavioural means (i.e. behavioural syndromes), less attention has been paid to how plasticity in different behavioural traits may be correlated. Such correlated behavioural plasticities are likely to affect evolution and ecology, although possibly in different ways. Here, we review key insights from three research fields, behavioural syndromes, phenotypic plasticity and integrated phenotypes to provide a conceptual framework to understand why, how and when plasticities of different behavioural traits may become correlated. In particular, the conditions under which plasticity and behavioural syndromes are predicted to be important are also where correlated behavioural plas-ticities are likely to have the strongest impacts. In this review, we define correlated behavioural plas-ticities, summarize the conditions that are likely to give rise to them and highlight testable predictions in an effort to spark targeted research into this important phenomenon. We also provide a worked example to highlight how studying correlated plasticity can yield important new insights.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB In monotocous mammals (i.e. where females produce one offspring at a time), most juveniles will experience the birth of a younger sibling in their life. Transition to siblinghood (TTS) has rarely been studied in primates, although it reflects the last step in the shift of maternal investment from one offspring to the next and could thus represent a critical moment for mother-offspring conflict and sibling competition. Here, we used behavioural data on juvenile primates that had recently experienced, or not, the birth of a younger sibling to investigate changes in mother-juvenile relationships during TTS in a wild population of chacma baboons, Papio ursinus. We show that (1) mother-juvenile spatial as-sociations remained stable; (2) mothers did not decrease their probability of initiating proximity or affiliation with their juvenile; and (3) juveniles initiated proximity and affiliation more frequently to-wards their mothers, and showed more signs of anxiety, after the birth of their younger sibling. Taken together, these findings suggest that juveniles with a younger sibling solicit their mother more often and seek more maternal attention than juveniles without. Overall, mother-offspring conflict could extend into the postweaning period, during which more subtle maternal resources, such as maternal attention, could be at stake in competitive sibling relationships.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many social organisms assist their group mates in foraging. The honey bee waggle dance allows nestmates to communicate the locations of rewarding flower patches. This remarkable behaviour can increase colony food collection under certain environmental conditions. However, we know little about how it affects colony foraging distribution in the landscape. Here, we predicted that dance communication influences foraging distances and increases the aggregation of foraging locations. We tested these predictions by manipulating the ability of Apis mellifera colonies situated in a heterogeneous landscape to communicate location information. Following established methodology, six study colonies in observation hives were turned horizontally and exposed to light treatments that produced either oriented or disoriented dancing. After 10-17 days, hives were then turned vertically and allowed to dance under normal conditions. We videoed and decoded dances to compare foraging patterns that had developed during the preceding treatment. This procedure was repeated throughout the foraging season from spring to autumn. Dance decoding revealed that, on average, bees from disoriented colonies recruited for food sources further away than oriented colonies. This effect was consistent throughout the year. Oriented colonies' recruitment was to a smaller area and was more spatially aggregated than that of disoriented colonies. However, experimental treatment did not affect colony weight gain. Our results show that dance communication plays an important role in the spatial distribution of foraging and is potentially beneficial in reducing commuting costs by directing recruits to closer foraging locations. These findings may be particularly relevant in heterogeneous landscapes.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Migratory birds must make complex decisions to use wind to their advantage during flight and increasing flight performance is particularly important while crossing ecological barriers. Age-related differences in how birds deal with wind have suggested experience improves necessary skills in gaining positive wind support. However, differences in wind support between age groups over ecological barriers have rarely been tested, and our understanding of how birds acquire related skills is lacking. We compared wind support achieved by adult and subadult Caspian terns, Hydroprogne caspia, during southward and northward crossings of the Sahara Desert by quantifying air-to-groundspeed ratios (AGR). We also tested possible underlying causes of lower subadult wind support in comparison to adults by calculating optimal AGR altitudes and fitting step selection functions in response to wind direction and speed. We found no difference between age groups in autumn, when young were flying with adults, but subadults had lower wind support during their first solo northward crossings. Adults departed northwards from wintering areas earlier in the year and encountered more favourable wind conditions than subadults, yet both age groups made similar movement decisions in relation to wind. Consequently, differences in performance are better explained by timing of passage rather than movement skills. Our findings highlight the influence of wind seasonality over the Sahara on migratory behaviour and raise questions about the evolution and ontogeny of migratory timing in relation to wind patterns and other factors that may determine departure decisions.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Kin selection theory predicts that individual progeny members, in species where offspring share depreciable parental care, should increasingly attempt to monopolize resources provided by the parents as their relatedness to brood competitors declines. Although the level of relatedness among broodmates is often variable in vertebrates, whether it affects within-brood competition dynamics has seldom been studied. We tested this prediction in nestlings of the lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni, a cavity-nesting colonial raptor that can breed in high-density colonies, where nestlings often move between nearby nests, generating mixed parentage among broodmates. Pairs of nestlings composed of either unrelated, unfamiliar individuals or siblings were experimentally forced to compete for food. Nestlings stole prey more frequently when competing with an unrelated, unfamiliar competitor than when competing with a sibling. This finding adds to the limited evidence that rivalry among broodmates is affected by their relatedness, suggesting that kin recognition and kin selection may play an important role in determining individual competitive strategies and care allocation in multiparous species.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Various primate species, including golden snub-nosed monkeys, Rhinopithecus roxellana, form highly complex multilevel social systems. Breeding bands of snub-nosed monkeys maintain stability even though multiple one-male units (OMUs) within a band do not appear to engage in affiliative behaviours among units. As such, female dispersal within breeding bands may be a key factor related to social stability in these complex social systems. However, how individual and group behaviours influence both the formation of this complex social system and the maintenance of social stability within it remain to be fully elucidated. In the current study, based on 16 years of accumulated data, we investigated female dispersal in a wild population of golden snub-nosed monkeys in the Qinling Mountains of China. Using social network analysis and dynamic social modelling, we found that male take-over had no influence on the dominance rank of an OMU, whereas the number of breeding females within an OMU had a sig-nificant positive effect on rank. Both the number of breeding females and the number of females entering an OMU had significant positive effects on eigenvector centrality of an OMU. Female dispersal between OMUs decreased the clustering coefficient and reduced the risk of subgroup formation. In addition, fe-male kinship matrices between units were not significantly correlated with association behaviour pat-terns. Thus, this study sheds light on the internal mechanisms that drive social stability in a complex primate social system.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Predators are thought to prey on individuals that are in poor physical condition, although the evidence supporting this is ambiguous. We tested whether sick individuals were more predated using Drosophila melanogaster flies as manipulable prey. We asked whether hunting spiders, trapped from the wild, would selectively prey upon flies with compromised health (i.e. chronically infected or cancerous) versus healthy flies, under laboratory conditions. Flies chronically infected with the bacterium Providencia rettgeri, a natural Drosophila pathogen, were not selectively preyed upon by jumping spiders. We strengthened and confirmed our finding with another hunting spider species, small wolf spiders. This result supports the hypothesis that chronic infection is associated with reduced symptoms notably to avoid the potentially deadly consequences for pathogens of host predation. We then induced colon cancer in some of the flies and asked whether the presence of cancer led to selective predation; there is little empirical evidence for this, even in vertebrates. As the cancer developed, the incidence of predation by jumping spiders on the afflicted flies increased. We conclude that disease can have different lethal consequences through predation, even in invertebrate species, and that cancer is a factor in selective predation. Our results may explain why early tumours, but not metastasized cancers, are commonly detected in organisms in the wild, as cancer-bearing individuals are rapidly eliminated due to the strong selective pressure against them.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Owing to domestication, dog behaviour differs from wolf behaviour, which should also affect time budgets. At the Wolf Science Center, wolves and mongrel dogs are raised and kept in a similar way; thus, it is an ideal place to compare the time budgets of wolves and dogs in search of potential domestication-related shifts. Seven wolf packs and four dog packs were observed over a full year. We focused on major behavioural categories, such as resting and foraging, and calculated the proportion of time they spent on each of these activities. Based on mainstream domestication hypotheses we predicted dogs to be generally more active than wolves because domestication would have relaxed the need for behavioural efficiency. As expected, wolves and dogs differed in their time budgets. Wolves slept, walked and vocalized more than dogs, whereas dogs foraged, sat and manipulated objects more. Human presence around the enclosure increased the activity of both, but dogs were more active than wolves in this sit-uation. Season and time of day had the same effect on dogs and wolves. We conclude that dogs are not too different from wolves in intrinsic motivation affecting their time budgets, except for the increased responses of dogs to humans. This suggests that humans are more important as social Zeitgeber for dogs than for equally socialized wolves.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Insect cuticular hydrocarbons provide desiccation resistance but may also be used in chemical signalling. Sexually dimorphic hydrocarbon blends, which may be transferred between individuals during copulation, are used especially in mate assessment. However, not all insect species produce sex-specific hydrocarbon blends, and their general utility in mate choice requires study of a broader range of species than is currently available. In the nuptial gift-giving bushcricket Kawanaphila nartee, sex roles vary depending on food availability: when food is scarce, females compete for access to males and their nuptial gifts, and when food is abundant, males compete for access to females. Given the scope for both male and female mate choice in the species, we hypothesized that their cuticular hydrocarbon profiles would differ. We characterized the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of male and female K. nartee and found significant differences between them. Given the costly nutrient gifts provided by males at mating, we further hypothesized that males might use hydrocarbon residues left by rival males after mating to avoid investing in offspring sired by other males. Although females perfumed with male-derived hydrocarbon blends had lower mating success than control females, the difference was not statistically significant. We discuss the possible mechanisms that might favour the evolution of sexual dimorphism in cuticular hydrocarbon blends in this species.

AB Pathogen virulence is highly variable within populations, and although many factors contributing to virulence differences are known, there is still much variation left unexplained. Identifying and characterizing environmental conditions associated with different virulence levels is therefore an important undertaking in infectious disease research. One factor considered to be a major determinant of overall health and susceptibility to disease in social animals is social status. Health differences associated with social status are thought to be caused by different levels of chronic stress in higher-versus lower-status individuals. There is considerable evidence that these effects extend to the standing immune profile and that social status directly influences susceptibility to pathogens. Here we examined the association between dominance status in male wild-derived house mice, Mus musculus, and susceptibility to Friend virus complex in the context of seminatural populations with intense male-male competition and no predation. Due to an interruption in our facility's heating system, we were unexpectedly presented with the opportunity to assess how reduced ambient temperature influences the association of host social status and pathogen virulence. Environmental temperature has been implicated as a contributor to pathogen virulence, giving us a unique chance to examine its role in a previously unexamined pathogen system, while the added context of social status can expand our understanding of how the interaction of different environmental conditions affects virulence. We found that pathogen virulence and replication were lower in socially dominant hosts compared to nondominant hosts. When temperature was reduced, cool enclosure-housed dominant males were more susceptible to infection than their warm enclosure housed counterparts. The mechanistic underpinnings that link infectious disease and social status remain difficult to disentangle from their associated factors, but this study opens the door for future experiments using a novel approach in the most well-studied mammalian model available.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Courtship is an important component of male reproductive behaviour that enables males to learn about the suitability of their mating partners. Experimental evidence suggests that Drosophila melanogaster males can learn to modify their courtship behaviour based on their prior experience with unreceptive females. This courtship learning is expected to provide a fitness advantage to males and could therefore evolve given suitable heritable variation. We investigated the role of sexual selection in the evolution of courtship learning ability of males, using populations of D. melanogaster evolving under high and low levels of sexual selection for over 170 generations. We exposed males from both types of population to unreceptive females and then tested their ability to discriminate between receptive and unreceptive females in a complex mating environment. After being exposed to unreceptive females, males from both types of population (1) courted females less (both receptive and unreceptive), (2) took longer to initiate courtship, but took less time to start mating after initiating courtship and (3) increased the proportion of courtship directed towards receptive females, indicating the ability of both types of males to learn from previous experience. We did not find any difference in the courtship learning ability of males from the two types of populations. However, males from populations with higher levels of sexual selection were better at recognizing and courting receptive females, even when they were not previously exposed to unreceptive females. Taken together, these results show that sexual selection may not result in improved learning abilities but can lead to the evolution of an improved innate ability of males to assess the receptivity of females.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Theory and empirical work suggest that behaviours such as dispersal and exploration are predictors of invasive success, and that behaviours may shift predictably after invasive populations have established and spread. However, there are limited data on temporal patterns in the distribution of behavioural traits linked to the timeline of establishment of invasive species. We examined dispersal and exploration, along with life history traits that may be linked to behaviour, across multiple invasive populations of the brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus. This global invader has established populations across the United States and Israel. Using this temporal and spatial variation, we tested predictions about changes in suites of traits over establishment time. We compared trait distributions of four U.S. populations of L. geometricus to patterns in four populations in Israel. We predicted that selective filters during the invasion process would result in more dispersive, more exploratory spiders that are larger and more fecund in recently established populations, but, if trade-offs occur, dispersal would be favoured at the expense of fecundity and size in recent populations. We found more frequent and faster dispersal in more recently established populations in Israel, but not the United States. Spiders in more recently established populations in Israel were larger than those in older populations, but there were no consistent patterns across U.S. populations. However, there was evidence in both the U.S. and Israel for differing trade-offs among fecundity, dispersal and size. In more recently established populations, spiders were more variable in resource allocation to eggsacs. The results suggest that in some populations, trade-offs underlying dispersal, fecundity and body size are shaped by the time interval, and thus the number of generations, since establishment, with implications for the role of evolutionary processes in invasion success.

AB Vocal communication in group-living animals represents a major challenge when multiple individuals call simultaneously and generate a complex soundscape. Decoding relevant information from a vocal signal and its emitter can determine the survival of the receiver. In hierarchical social groups, information on sex, size and age can provide relevant context for vocal signals. Ultimately, individual vocal recog-nition is a keystone in vocal communication systems, especially in the context of sociality. Greylag geese (Aves: Anseriformes) are a basal, gregarious and highly social species, and adults produce a distance call when approaching or leaving the flock. In this study we (1) quantified the acoustic properties of distance calls to test whether they can provide information on the sex, size and age of the emitter, (2) evaluated whether distance calls have individual properties, from the sender's perspective, (3) tested whether receivers discriminate distance calls depending on the emitter's identity and (4) explored whether an individual's response strength towards its partner's distance call is associated with fitness-related traits (i.e. pair bond duration and average number of offspring per year). We recorded distance calls of indi-vidually marked geese, quantified the variation in call acoustic properties and carried out a playback experiment in the wild. Distance calls encoded information about the sex of the goose, but not its age or size. From the emitter's perspective, we found some support for individuality in distance calls. From the receiver's perspective, geese were capable of recognizing distance calls from different individuals. Finally, the response strength towards playback of the partner's call was positively correlated with pair bond duration. Vocal recognition has been proposed to be tightly related to social structure, the evolution of sociality and vocal learning. Here, we uncovered vocal recognition of individual affiliative calls in a social bird from the most basal avian group studied so far.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Traditionally, exploration and exploitation of resources have been viewed as mutually exclusive behaviours in which animals can either allocate time to gathering information or to using known resources. But these behaviours can also be viewed as opposite ends of a continuum, with intermediate behaviours that balance exploration and exploitation, such as information maintenance. Updating previously acquired information through information maintenance can allow animals in unpredictable environments to track changing environmental conditions. Theoretical studies predict that the degree of involvement in information maintenance should depend on environmental predictability when the overall environment is less predictable, animals should update previously acquired information more frequently because such information is less certain and could change quickly. We tested this hypothesis by allowing wild food-caching mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, to visit and sample multiple feeders with temporarily stable, unlimited food for five consecutive winters. We used an index of feeder use breadth to explore how feeder visits across multiple feeders varied with environmental conditions. Each feeder visit is associated with information updating, and more information maintenance should be associated with distributing more visits across more feeders. While controlling for the total number of visits by each individual, we found that (1) chickadees redistributed feeder use among more feeders when environmental conditions were harsh and unpredictable, (2) juveniles had a higher feeder use breadth than adults, and individuals reduced their feeder use breadth as they aged, (3) better spatial learning and memory ability but not spatial cognitive flexibility was associated with smaller feeder use breadth and (4) learning associated with decreased food availability reduced subsequent feeder use breadth. Our data supported our predictions that factors affecting the predictability of resource information (environmental conditions and individual characteristics such as cognition and age) affect how individuals engage in information maintenance.

AB Consistent individual differences in behaviour, or personality, likely influence patterns of space use and resource use in wild animals. However, studies on personality-dependent space use in natural ecosystems remain rare due to the difficulty of obtaining paired data sets on spatial dynamics and repeated personality measures from marked animals. We used repeated standardized assays (open field, mirror image stimulation, flight initiation distance and behaviour in trap) to perform the first characterization of personality in a free-ranging population of golden-mantled ground squirrels, Callospermophilus lateralis. We then used multilevel modelling to determine whether personality influenced 95% home range size, 50% core area size, movement speed or use of a preferred resource ('perches', vision-enhancing prominences such as rocks, which enhance survival) in nature. Data collected over 3 years showed that individual squirrels consistently differed in activity, sociability, boldness and aggressiveness (adjusted repeatability 0.16-0.44) and that activity was correlated with sociability (posterior mean correlation [95% credible interval] = 0.65 [0.39, 0.87]). We did not find an effect of personality on home range size, but bolder individuals maintained larger core areas than shyer individuals. More active and bolder individuals moved faster under natural conditions compared to their less active and shyer conspecifics. Individuals that scored higher for all four personality traits had more perches in both their home ranges and core areas compared to individuals with lower personality scores. Our results are indicative of personality-dependent space use and resource use in this study system. We hope our study will inspire future research that links animal personality with spatial ecology to inform wildlife management in natural ecosystems.

AB Parasites can play an important role in host sexual selection. According to the 'Hamilton & Zuk hypothesis', females acquire benefits from choosing parasite-free or parasite-resistant males based on their secondary sexual traits (e.g. colourful plumage) as indicators of heritable parasite resistance. However, females may also gain benefits by avoiding sexually transmitted parasites or acquiring more parental care, higher quality sperm and nuptial gifts provided by uninfected males. Here we tested how the presence of the Ophryocystis elektroscirrha-like parasite (OE-like) affected longevity, reproduction and mating frequency in the moth Helicoverpa armigera. We found that OE-like infection affected the sexes differently: the life span of uninfected males was reduced when paired with infected females, while these females had higher reproductive output than when paired with infected males. These results suggest some form of terminal investment by infected males. When we assessed the effect of OE-like infections on female calling behaviour and sex pheromone signal, we found that the OE-like parasite did not affect the female's pheromone signal in quality or quantity, but it did reduce her reproductive output, suggesting that infected females reallocate resources to maintain an attractive sex pheromone signal. In mate choice experiments, when females were the choosing sex, infected females mated significantly more often with uninfected than with infected males. Since these females produced approximately 12% more offspring, and uninfected females did not prefer uninfected or infected males, these results indicate female choice for uninfected males. Unexpectedly, when we compared the calling behaviour of the two females that were caged together, we found that infected females called signifi-cantly earlier than uninfected females, while this was not the case when females were housed alone. Thus, OE-like infection affects reproductive strategies in both males and females, but in different ways, which suggests sex-specific parasite-mediated selection. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Aggressive interactions are costly, such that individuals should display modified aggression in response to environmental stress. Many organisms experience frequent periods of food deprivation, which can influence an individual's capacity and motivation to engage in aggression. However, because food deprivation can simultaneously decrease an individual's resource-holding potential and increase its valuation of food resources, its net impact on aggression is unclear. Here, we tested the influence of increasingly prolonged periods of adult food deprivation on intermale aggression in pairs of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. We found that males displayed increased aggression following periods of food deprivation longer than a day. Increased aggression in food-deprived flies occurred despite their reduced mass. This result is probably explained by an increased attraction to food resources, as food deprivation increased male occupancy of central food patches, and food patch occupancy was positively associated with aggression. Our findings demonstrate that aggressive strategies in male D. melanogaster are influenced by nutritional experience, highlighting the need to consider past nutritional stresses to understand variation in aggression.

AB Understanding egg-laying behaviour of brood parasites in space and time can improve our knowledge of interactions between hosts and parasites. However, no studies have combined information on the laying activity of an obligate brood parasite with detailed information on the distribution of host nests within an area and time period. Here, we used molecular methods and analysis of egg phenotypes to determine maternal identity of common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, eggs and chicks found in the nests of four species of Acrocephalus warblers in consecutive years. The median size of a cuckoo female laying area (calculated as a minimum convex polygon) was correlated negatively with the density of host nests and positively with the number of eggs assigned to a particular female. Cuckoo female laying areas overlapped to a large extent and their size and location did not change between years. Cuckoo females preferentially parasitized host nests located close to their previously parasitized nests and were mostly host specific except for two that parasitized two host species. Future studies should focus on sympatric host and parasite communities with variable densities across different brood-parasitic systems to investigate how population density of hosts affects fitness and evolution of brood parasites. For instance, it remains unknown whether female parasites moving to new sites need to meet a threshold density of a potential host. In addition, young females may be more limited in their egg laying, particularly with respect to the activity of other parasites and hosts, than older females.

AB Reconciliation, or postconflict (PC) affiliation between former opponents, is a widespread conflict management strategy in animal societies, so-named for its relationship repair function. However, another possibility is that PC affiliation reflects a submissive response of victims towards aggressors to limit conflict escalation when the power imbalance between the opponents is large. Here we investi-gated this hypothesis in a highly asymmetric relationship context: heterosexual wild chacma baboon, Papio ursinus, dyads involving sexually receptive females, where sexual coercion by males is common. We found several lines of support for the submissive hypothesis in the context of sexual coercion. First, rates of sexual and nonsexual PC affiliative interactions in these dyads exhibited significant and com-parable increases compared to baseline conditions (ca. three-fold). Second, the baseline strength of the heterosexual social bond (outside of an aggressive context) did not predict the likelihood of sexual and nonsexual PC affiliation. Third, mate-guarded females, who could not escape the proximity of their aggressor (and faced high risks of renewed aggression), exhibited the most PC affiliation with males. Finally, most PC affiliation sequences contained at least one sexual act, and the first sexual affiliative act was primarily initiated by females via presenting. This suggests that female victims affiliate in a sub-missive way by displaying sexual compliance to aggressive males. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the co-occurrence of 'true' reconciliation: a quarter of PC affiliations between males and receptive females were exclusively nonsexual, and the first general affiliative act was equally initiated by males and fe -males. Overall, our results suggest a mixed PC affiliation strategy in which submission may play an important role in highly asymmetric relationships and indicate that the function of PC affiliation may vary from submission to reconciliation depending on the species, dyads, individuals and conflicts under consideration. Future research on PC interactions would usefully consider this full spectrum.

AB Establishing how collective decisions emerge is central to our understanding of animal societies. A frequent approach in collective behaviour studies is to look for leaders that will trigger and direct group movements. Relatively few studies on collective movements, notably in mammals, have taken the events preceding group departures into account. Success in recruitment can depend on the arousal state, the behaviour and the spatial distribution of animals before departure. We tested the effect of these factors on recruitment in two groups of nine domestic mares, Equus ferus caballus, at pasture. Predeparture periods were compared to control periods to identify their unique characteristics and to understand how they can predict the following collective outcome. We found that predeparture periods were charac-terized by the simultaneous increase in the number of active and goal-oriented individuals as well as in group cohesion. However, while the temporal patterns of activity and dispersion were unique to pre-departure periods, those of orientation were not different from control periods. We also found that before departure individuals started to move towards the future goal area and to position themselves along the front-back axis. Moreover, the front-to-back position of group members was linked to the order in which they joined a collective movement. Finally, the duration of the joining process was positively correlated with the group dispersion. Our findings demonstrate that decision making is a continuous process and emphasize the necessity, in the study of collective decisions, to look beyond the event of initiation itself and the identity of the initiator as recruitment depends on group state before and at departure.

AB Birdsongs are signals that encode information for multiple behaviours such as species recognition. Species recognition is influenced by both geographical variation in song and birds' discrimination abilities, forming the basis for evolutionary processes driving reproductive isolation and speciation. Here, we assessed the behavioural responses to geographical variation in songs in olive sparrows, Arremonops rufivirgatus. We conducted a series of playback experiments in two allopatric populations (Pacific, Peninsula) to assess whether olive sparrows responded differentially to geographical variants of their song and whether such responses could be predicted by the acoustic similarity between subject and stimulus songs. Our results indicate an asymmetrical behavioural response, with the Pacific population responding strongly to both local and allopatric stimuli and weakly to the control, and the Peninsula population responding strongly to local stimuli and weakly to both allopatric stimuli and the control. Furthermore, despite the birds' lack of previous experience with the playback stimulus songs, we found that response intensity was predicted by the acoustic similarity in both populations, with stronger responses to more similar songs, suggesting that males from different population may use a similar mechanism to recognize signals, despite whether the signal comes from conspecifics or heterospecifics. Our findings support the hypothesis that song divergence could act as a premating barrier for at least one of the studies populations, and that birds' responses are dictated by the structural similarity between senders' and receivers' signals.

AB Increased vulnerability to predation results in young individuals of many species experiencing higher predation pressure than adults. Consequently, the production of antipredator-related calls by young can differ from that of the same vocalizations given by adults. Sentinel behaviour is a coordinated vigilance behaviour, where one individual climbs on an elevated position and scans the surroundings for predators, while the rest of the group is mainly foraging. Meerkat, Suricata suricatta, sentinels produce six distinct sentinel call types, which inform other group members about the perceived predation risk, resulting in the adjustment of personal vigilance behaviour in foraging group members. Here, we investigated the onset of sentinel behaviour and the ontogeny of the different sentinel call types as well as the development of individual vocal signatures in meerkats. We found that meerkats started acting as a sentinel around 200 days of age, but this was highly dependent on group size, with individuals from smaller groups exhibiting sentinel behaviour earlier than individuals from larger groups. All six sentinel call types were already present in the repertoire upon first emergence of the behaviour; however, call rates of 'all-clear' calls increased while 'warning' calls decreased with increasing experience as sentinel. Analysis of one of the most frequent sentinel calls, the double note calls, indicated that fundamental frequency, mean amplitude, duration and entropy differed consistently between individuals, but we found no effect of age. Rather, our results provide evidence that individual signatures in this call type were already developed when young meerkats first started to act as sentinel and changed little with age. To conclude, we showed little ontogenetic change in overall sentinel behaviour as well as in its vocal coordination, indicating potentially high selection pressures on antipredator behaviours, such as the sentinel system, resulting in consistent behavioural responses upon first emergence.

AB Cold developmental conditions can greatly affect adult life history of ectotherms in seasonal habitats. Such effects are mostly negative, but sometimes adaptive. Here, we tested how cold conditions experienced during pupal development affect adult wing melanization of an insect ectotherm, the Glanville fritillary butterfly, Melitaea cinxia. We also assessed how in turn previous cold exposure and increased melanization can shape adult behaviour and fitness, by monitoring individuals in a seminatural set-up. We found that, despite pupal cold exposure inducing more melanization, wing melanization was not linked to adult thermoregulation preceding flight, under the conditions tested. Conversely, wing vibrating behaviour had a major role in producing heat preceding flight. Moreover, more melanized individuals were more mobile across the experimental set-up. This may be caused by a direct impact of melanization on flight ability or a more indirect impact of coloration on behaviours such as mate search strategies and/or eagerness to disperse to more suitable mating habitats. We also found that more melanized individuals of both sexes had reduced mating success and produced fewer offspring, which suggests a clear fitness cost of melanization. Whether the reduced mating success is dictated by impaired mate search behaviour, reduced physical condition leading to a lower dominance status or weakened visual signalling remains unknown. In conclusion, while there was no clear role of melanization in providing a thermal advantage under our seminatural conditions, we found a fitness cost of being more melanized, which potentially impacted adult space use behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DE Agelaioides badius; coevolution; greyish baywing; microsatellite;
   Molothrus rufoaxillaris; virulence
AB Avian brood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of other species, leaving the hosts to care for the parasitic offspring. The bookkeeping hypothesis predicts that, in order to reduce competition between parasitic nestlings, female parasites should keep a mental inventory of host nests that they have already parasitized and avoid laying multiple eggs in the same host nest. However, selection against repeat parasitism should be weaker when host nests are limited, or when hosts are able to rear more than one parasitic nestling. Here we use microsatellite genotyping of parasitic eggs to test whether female screaming cowbirds, Molothrus rufoaxillaris, avoid repeatedly parasitizing nests of their primary host, the greyish baywing, Agelaioides badius, in Argentina. Parasitism rates were extremely high (96.5% of 57 host clutches were parasitized with an average of 5.7 cowbird eggs each), indicating that host nests are limited. Although eggs laid by the same female showed moderate spatiotemporal clustering, individual females rarely laid more than one egg in the same host clutch (2 of 57 clutches, 26 of which contained multiple genotyped cowbird eggs). Females were much more likely to lay subsequent eggs in different host nests than to return to the same host nest. We found no evidence for kin structure among female cowbirds parasitizing the same host nest, which were no more closely related than chance would predict. These results suggest that female screaming cowbirds frequently lay eggs in host nests that have already been parasitized by unrelated females. However, they typically lay just one egg per host clutch, even though greyish baywings are capable of rearing several nestlings. Since screaming cowbird laying is often poorly synchronized with that of their host, avoidance of repeat parasitism may be adaptive if it allows females to spread the risk of failure among multiple host nests.

AB Individuals of many species utter distress calls when are attacked or trapped by a predator. These vocalizations can help them to escape but may also help conspecifics to reduce their predation risk, by inducing antipredator behaviours. Calls can encode information that modulates these antipredator responses, and the 'nonlinearity and fear hypothesis' proposes that complex nonlinear calls may trigger more fearful responses, because they encode higher levels of stress. We tested this hypothesis with the weeping lizard, Liolaemus chiliensis, which utters distress calls with and without nonlinear phenomena (complex and simple calls, respectively), and conspecifics respond to simple calls with antipredator behaviours. Here, we evaluated whether this species discriminates between these two types of calls, predicting higher levels of fear with complex calls. We also tested whether lizards experience less fear if calls are perceived in a safe environment, such as one full of their own scents ('home'). Our playback experiments showed that complex calls scared the lizards more than simple calls, triggering a reduction in activity, and prolonging attempts to escape. Lizards in their own-scented environments took longer to restore their activity after hearing complex than simple calls, suggesting that this combination of stimuli was more alarming. We postulate that the predation event was unexpected at 'home', which together with the nonlinearity of the call made a more frightening event for the lizards. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Exposure to predation should affect prey responses to predators by selecting for threat recognition and/or general risk avoidance. We investigated whether native and non-native predator density on the home reefs of juvenile striped parrotfish, Scarus iseri, which reflects their early exposure to predation risk, influences their behavioural responses and survival when faced with some of these predators under controlled conditions. In aquaria, parrotfish exhibited evasive behaviour, in the form of increased immobility and increased distance from threat, in response to visual and chemical cues from native predatory grouper (Epinephelus striatus) but not from invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois sp.), suggesting no evidence of risk perception in relation to the non-native predator. However, parrotfish from high-risk reefs exhibited more evasive behaviours and colour responses (i.e. more mottled coloration) in response to all stimuli than parrotfish from low-risk reefs. Moreover, more parrotfish from high-risk reefs than from low-risk reefs survived in direct encounters with lionfish, and those parrotfish that survived were those that had displayed increased immobility when exposed to lionfish cues. We suggest that predation, especially by non-native lionfish, targeting risk-taking fish could result in greater overall cautiousness in some prey populations. This heightened risk avoidance ultimately aids prey fish to evade non-native lionfish, even in the absence of predator recognition.

AB When males and females differ in their reproductive interests, each sex attempts to increase its own reproductive success, sometimes to the detriment of its mate. The environment that individuals experience has been shown to be fundamental in mediating this sexual conflict, since it can alter the balance between the costs and benefits that males and females obtain from mating. In the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus water availability is an important environmental factor that can alter this balance, with consequences for female mating strategies and the strength of sexual conflict. Whether the effect of water availability arises via effects on females or males, however, has not been explored. Here we manipulated access to water independently for adult males and females and explored how this environmental variation affected male and female mating behaviour, female fitness and offspring development. We found that access to water did not alter the size of ejaculates that males transferred, but that males with water available had longer copulation durations. We also found that females with access to water, despite living longer and laying a similar number of eggs during their lifetime, had offspring with longer development times and lower eclosion success than those of females with no access to water. Our results suggest that water availability has detrimental effects on female fitness, but despite changes in male mating behaviour these effects are not related to changes in the costliness of males as mates.

AB Nestlings of the obligate brood-parasitic common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, use diverse signals to manipulate host parents into feeding them. Begging calls, one of the most prominent parent-offspring communication signals, have been suggested to differ between cuckoos parasitizing different host species but the call characteristics involved differ between studies. We studied nestling begging calls of the cuckoo and two closely related cuckoo hosts breeding in sympatry, the great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, and the reed warbler, Acrocephalus scirpaceus, to determine whether cuckoo nestlings adjust their begging calls according to the host species and if these calls vary with cuckoo age and sex. We found that begging calls of host nestlings differed markedly between species but there was no difference in the begging calls of cuckoo nestlings raised by great reed warblers and those raised by reed warblers. These results suggest that cuckoo nestlings do not adjust begging vocalizations to match host species but rather use general begging call features to solicit food. However, their call frequency band narrowed, syllable duration shortened and call rate tended to increase with increasing age. None of the begging call characteristics differed between the sexes. The rapid development of cuckoo begging call parameters during ontogeny suggests that any comparisons of begging calls of cuckoo nestlings raised by different host species must control for nestling age. Finally, some discordant conclusions of this and other studies emphasize how little we understand parasite-host communication. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The removal of pre-existing geographical barriers between species, notably by humans, allows previously isolated species to hybridize. Interspecies hybridization has been studied at different levels but the mother-young relationship, which is crucial for the offspring's survival, has not been investigated in large wild mammals. We compared the establishment of the mother-young relationship at birth and during the first week of life and the morphological development of the young in red deer, Cervus elaphus, sika deer, Cervus nippon, and their hybrids (male nippon x female elaphus). Most mother-young behaviours did not differ between the three groups, showing strong conservation of peripartum behaviours in cervids. In contrast, the behaviour and body size of the hybrid young were similar or tended to be close to those found in the maternal species, suggesting important maternal effects. In addition, hybrid young were more likely to be standing during the first week than young from the other groups, possibly resulting from increased maternal stimulation and/or hybrid vigour. Adult females in the herd were more likely to perform smell-related and agonistic behaviours towards the hybrid young, suggesting potential species recognition issues, which require further investigation. In conclusion, our findings show that hybridization has no noticeable impact on the mother-young relationship, which could partly explain the success of hybridization between the sika and red deer in the wild.

AB How bats mitigate mutual interference is a long-standing question that has ecological and technological implications as biosonar systems continue to outperform artificial sonar systems in noisy, cluttered environments. Echolocating bats display a mutual suppression response, slowing their pulse emission rates when flying in groups to gain a net improvement in sonar performance. However, flight paths, directional effects, plus contextual and attentional processes influence the levels of mutual interference, causing some noises to be more deleterious than others. To tease apart the impact of these factors, we used playback experiments with flying Mexican free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis, to test whether the relative directional orientation of an interfering signal versus its returning echoes had a greater impact on a bat's sonar performance. We tested two competing hypotheses: (1) the intensity hypothesis predicts that a signal that is emitted towards a signalling bat is louder and will mask returning echoes more than a signal that is emitted in the same direction as a bat's emitted signal; (2) the similarity hypothesis predicts that a signal that is emitted in the same direction as a bat's signal will create echoes similar in amplitude and timing to those of the signalling bat's own echoes , which should cause greater interference than a loud, less similar signal. We analysed emission rates of bats navigating in both open and cluttered spaces while we varied the directional orientation of an artificial stimulus relative to the bat's flight trajectory. Both emission rates and navigational performance decreased significantly when playback was directed in the same heading as the flying bat, indicating that competing echo wave-fronts are more disruptive to a flying bat than the much louder source signal that produced them. This observation is important because it potentially reveals the impact of attentional processes on sonar performance. This study provides new information on how echolocating bats experience interference and the behavioural strategies they use to overcome jamming.

AB Eusocial societies, in which egg laying is monopolized by one or a few females, have evolved multiple times during the evolution of insects but were always rooted in a simple family structure. Female reproduction in such families is often characterized by a trade-off between reproduction and brood care, yet most work on the regulation of reproduction in social insects has focused on signals and traits exhibited by adults: particularly on the behaviour and chemical signals produced by the queen and nestmate workers. Here we examined the role of brood in regulating worker reproduction in Bombus impatiens, an annual eusocial species whose reproduction is monopolized by the queen via an unknown mechanism. We found that the presence of young larvae reduced workers' egg laying, whereas the presence of pupae stimulated egg laying. The effect of young larvae was quantity dependent, with nearly complete suppression of egg laying in cages containing a pair of workers and more than 10 young larvae, and replicable regardless of worker age, relatedness to brood or brood parentage/sex. The findings that any larvae can regulate worker reproduction in this simple, yet eusocial, species highlight the role of brood in the evolution of advanced eusocial insects as a mechanism for regulating worker sterility. These findings also provide the first holistic explanation for the regulation of worker reproduction in B. impatiens, suggesting that the queen inhibits worker reproduction through her brood.

AB Social learning from the observation of knowledgeable individuals can allow behaviours, skills and techniques to spread across populations and transmit between generations, potentially leading to emergent cultures. An increasing body of research has not only evidenced the occurrence of cultural behaviour in nonhuman animals, but also hypothesized that such cultures could 'evolve' over time in a way that shares key characteristics with biological evolution, including through a process of selection on variance, inheritance and adaptation. Outside of humans, song and contact calls in birds provide by far the most comprehensive evidence for culture and cultural evolution. However, birds have often been considered 'one-trick cultural ponies', only exhibiting significant diversity in this single component of their behavioural repertoire. Recent studies have begun to challenge this view. Here, I review the evidence across multiple behavioural domains for wild cultures in birds. I then discuss the evidence in birds for four key concepts of cultural evolution: (1) variation, selection, inheritance, (2) adaptation, (3) geographical and demographic processes and (4) the accumulation of modifications. I incorporate the evidence from birdsong with other behavioural domains for each key concept and identify important gaps in knowledge. Finally, I discuss how taking a cultural evolution perspective can be informative for our understanding of cognitive ecology more broadly. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social organisms make collective decisions during group movement, thereby remaining cohesive and providing the ecological and evolutionary benefits of sociality. The ability for groups to make successful collective decisions is dependent on relationships between leaders and followers. We investigated how consistent followers (a fan structure) facilitated successful group movement in a group of Tibetan macaques, Macaca thibetana, at Mt. Huangshan in Anhui, China. We used structural equation modelling to determine the relative influences of sex, age, number of maternal familial connections within the group, dominance and social network centrality on the number of fans that an individual had and the number of other group members that an individual was a fan of (fandom). Our structural equation modelling revealed that dominant females had more fans, while younger, dominant individuals with more familial connections were fans of more individuals. Fans and fandom were most strongly influenced by dominance, displaying a strong network of females occupying top positions in the dominance hierarchy who consistently followed each other. In addition, we examined the relationship between fan structure and movement speed and success. Using regression, we found a positive relationship between fans and speed and a negative correlation between fans and number of unsuccessful movements, suggesting a link between the social connections maintained in a movement and the speed of the movement. Dominant females with more fans initiated slower movements, perhaps because the complex fan structure slowed the joining process. However, individuals with more fans led fewer unsuccessful movements, suggesting a relationship between fans and initiation success. Our findings show a network of social relationships within Tibetan macaque groups that are used during movement organization to maintain cohesion and mediate the benefits of sociality.

AB Prey animals often face a trade-off between investing time in antipredator behaviour and performing self-maintenance activities, such as foraging. Parents face particularly high stakes as they must protect highly vulnerable offspring while also meeting elevated energetic demands. To optimize this trade-off, the risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey should adjust their antipredator behaviour to reflect temporal fluctuations in risk. That is, they should invest more in antipredator behaviour when risk is high and prioritize other activities when risk is low. Here we investigate whether changes in risk level resulting from periodic fawn exposure drive maternal vigilance patterns in Thomson's gazelle, Eudorcas thomsonn. We find that maternal vigilance patterns match the predictions of the risk allocation hypothesis. Mothers are highly vigilant prior to fawn retrieval, when risk of fawn detection by predators is high. They exhibit low levels of vigilance after fawns resume hiding, when certainty of predator absence is high and, therefore, risk is low. We suggest that fawn active periods may function secondarily as a form of predator sampling and that mothers may adjust their vigilance levels in response to information yielded by this sampling.

AB Animal communication takes place in a complex environment that is constantly modulated by particular social conditions. The majority of examples of signalling behaviours modulated by social context involve the presence of an individual of a particular sex or one that simply represents general competition. However, the identity of the individuals and the social relationships among individuals could also significantly modulate acoustic behaviour. In this study, I examined whether the presence of another male competitor modulates the post-interaction vocal response of a male subject to an oestrous female stimulus in golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus. I found that the presence of a potential competitor during an interaction with a female across a wire-mesh barrier significantly decreased the duration, tempo and energy of 'post-female calls' over time (experiment 1). Moreover, the call duration and energy of one-note simple calls changed over time depending on the identity of the stimulus male. Males that experienced social conflict and lost a fight maintained call duration and increased the energy of their calls over time, but only if the social interaction with the female was in the presence of another familiar neutral male and not in the presence of a familiar winner male (experiment 2). When the winner male stimulus was present, the duration and energy of the calls produced by the loser decreased with time. Individual recognition between familiar conspecifics with different shared experiences likely modulated the motivational state of the male subject and his vocal response after a social interaction with the female. This study provides new evidence that social complexity (competition and individual recognition) can induce dynamic changes of spectrotemporal features of hamster sexual ultrasonic vocalizations.

AB The spatial distribution of prospective mates can dramatically affect the process and outcome of mate choice. In a variety of species, spacing between males influences the likelihood that females visit particular individuals or respond to competing signals. Discrimination by females is expected to be highest among neighbouring males, yet males of some species aggregate in ways that apparently facilitate such comparisons. To better understand the selective pressures affecting male aggregation, we investigated how spatial organization of male territories related to female mate sampling tactics and male mating success in the lance-tailed manakin, Chiroxiphia lanceolata. This species displays in a dispersed lek of alpha males, each of which usually has a subordinate beta partner that participates in displays but does not mate with females attracted by their cooperative courtship. We video-recorded courtship activity at display perches of 12 alpha-beta pairs for 42 days in 2013, and documented 478 visits by 82 banded females. We further quantified the relationship of aggregation with genetic mating success for 49 alphas displaying at georeferenced locations in 5 years. Males with close neighbouring alphas were visited by more females, but geographic centrality was unrelated to female visit frequency. Females moved shorter distances between consecutive courtship visits than expected at random, but only 20.5% of 73 females visiting males with video-monitored nearest neighbours visited both neighbouring alpha males. Effects of aggregation on annual genetic reproductive success were only evident after accounting for the stronger effects of alpha age and experience, and only experienced alphas benefited from having close neighbours. Selection for aggregation more likely influences social behaviour of older alphas than settlement decisions by younger males. Benefits of aggregation for experienced alphas mitigate declines in old age, and may generate selective pressure favouring the long-term social alliances that are a key characteristic of this mating system.

AB To understand the implications of geographical variation in vocal culture in songbirds, researchers have often compared territorial responses to playback of local songs versus responses to playback of songs from 'foreign' conspecifics. This body of work has the potential to help us move towards a general understanding of factors driving divergence in signal recognition. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 57 playback studies to explain variation in strength of response to local versus foreign songs. Studies with incomplete reporting of results had elevated effects due to selective reporting. Studies that used small numbers of stimuli as exemplars (pseudoreplication) had more variable effects than studies without severe pseudoreplication. Whether or not we controlled for pseudoreplication, we found greater response to playback of local song than to foreign song. In investigating potential biological drivers of the variation in strength of experimental effects, we found that the difference in territorial response to local versus foreign song was stronger if the foreign song was recorded from another subspecies than if the foreign song was recorded from the same subspecies as the focal individuals. Indexes of risk of accidental response to heterospecific song did not coherently explain response to foreign conspecific songs, nor did factors expected to influence individual experience with foreign conspecific songs. Thus, although oscine songbirds clearly react more aggressively to local song than to foreign song and variation in the strength of this effect is influenced by methodological choices and subspecies status, considerable variation in the strength of response to local versus foreign song playback remains to be explained.

AB In species with biparental care, begging offspring may preferentially associate with or beg more towards one of their parents. Such preferences may reflect that the benefits of begging vary with the parent's sex given that females and males often differ in the amount of care they provide and/or in their responsiveness to begging levels. Alternatively, they may reflect the outcome of sexual conflict over care as females may deposit compounds into eggs tha tatter offspring begging behaviour such that it increases male contributions towards care. For example, females might use male presence during egg laying as a cue for whether they might receive male assistance in care. Here, we studied offspring begging behaviour towards male and female parents in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides by manipulating male presence or absence during egg laying and providing larvae with a simultaneous choice between an unfamiliar female and male adult beetle. We then recorded begging behaviour of (1) naive newly hatched larvae that had no prior experience of a parent and (2) larvae after 24 h of care by foster parents. Larvae showed a clear preference for associating with and begging towards females both when naive and after 24 h of care. We found no evidence for prenatal maternal effects on larval begging behaviour. Our study reveals that offspring are predisposed to preferentially beg towards females independently of prior experiences with parents and highlights the importance of considering responses of begging offspring to parental attributes, such as the parent's sex, for our understanding of family conflicts.

AB The ability to distinguish friends from foe is a widespread phenomenon among social animals. In ants, recognition of intruders is important for the maintenance of colony integrity and survival. Intruders are typically adult, but the acceptance of non-nestmate brood could result in severe fitness costs, depending on the caste of the brood. Accepting non-nestmate worker brood may not carry a cost, as they should not drain resources of the adoptive colony but may instead add to the workforce. Sexual brood, however, would typically not contribute to colony performance, yet require resources, and should thus be rejected. Here, we tested whether workers of the narrow-headed ant, Formica exsecta, which strongly discriminate between adult nestmates and non-nestmates, also discriminate between nestmate and non-nestmate pupae. Furthermore, we investigated whether the caste of the brood (workers/sexuals) affects discrimination. We carried out analysis of surface chemicals to investigate whether the chemical distance between colonies was associated with the propensity to accept non-nestmate pupae. We show that worker pupae were retrieved irrespective of their origin, whereas nestmate sexual pupae were retrieved at a slightly higher rate than non-nestmates. Our chemical data, however, suggest that both the reproductive and the worker brood carry sufficient chemical information for discrimination, as they both express colony signatures. However, this information is acted upon only in the case of sexual brood. Our results thus suggest that workers selectively capitalize on the chemical information in agreement with fitness predictions, albeit to a lower extent than during discrimination between adult individuals.

AB Novel ecosystems ('emerging ecosystems') result when species occur in combinations and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome, due to deliberate or inadvertent human agency. Humans have changed the environment through disturbance, physical structures or additional resources. Many vertebrate predators inhabit cities, towns and other places that humans have built or altered, and make use of these anthropogenic niches. These predators range in size from bats swarming around lamp posts, to leopards stalking domestic animals in the heart of cities. In this essay, we describe four scenarios where predators opportunistically make use of anthropogenic niches. First, humans are surrounded by animals, including synanthropic rodents and birds, livestock and pets, that can be novel prey for opportunistic predators. Second, feeding on prey concentrations created through anthropogenic niches increases their hunting efficiency, by reducing both search and commute times. Third, anthropogenic environments create novel situations such as thermals and artificial lighting that advantage some predators, increasing their capture success. Finally, many predators have developed novel hunting strategies to make the most of opportunities in anthropogenic environments that can lead to greater hunting success. We give examples of these four scenarios and have developed a conceptual model that captures the common mechanisms relevant to each, with predictions for how these can be explored further in future studies. Predators exploiting anthropogenic niches can experience greater ease of hunting, decreased search effort and/or increased capture success. Consequently, these animals experience many physiological and reproductive benefits over conspecifics that do not make similar use of anthropogenic niches, ultimately benefitting from living alongside humans.

AB Theoretical support exists for an exaggerated male structure to serve as both a weapon for intrasexual competition and as an ornament to signal quality and promote female choice. However, there is little, if any, evidence to support this theory in male-male competition breeding systems. Using white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, as a model species, we manipulated antler size on males while controlling for body size and age and allowed 25 oestrous females the opportunity to choose between pairs of segregated males with either large or small antlers. By segregating males, we were able to remove any intrasexual male competition and isolate the effects of female choice. Using various behavioural indications of female choice, we demonstrate that females prefer males with large antlers to those with small antlers. Because antler size is heritable in deer, this female preference for larger antlers may be adaptive by increasing the reproductive success of her male offspring. Our unique antler manipulation study supports the armament-ornament model where male weapons can simultaneously serve as ornaments to females and weapons in male-male competition breeding systems.

AB Ecological traps are maladaptive behavioural scenarios in which animals prefer to settle in habitats with the lowest survival and/or reproductive success. Aquatic insect species, for example, are attracted to sources of horizontally polarized light associated with natural water bodies, but today they commonly prefer to lay their eggs upon asphalt roads and buildings that reflect an unnaturally high percentage of polarized light. Ecological traps are a rapidly emerging threat to the persistence of animal populations, but the degree to which species vary in their susceptibility to them remains uninvestigated. We designed a field experiment to (1) assess the relative susceptibility of aquatic flies (Diptera) to a single maladaptive behavioural cue: variation in degree of horizontally polarized light (d), and (2) quantify how the isolation of an ecological trap from a high-quality habitat affects its relative attractiveness. We exposed wild dipterans to experimental test surfaces varying in d at three distances from natural streams and mapped behavioural reaction norms of habitat preference as a function of d and distance from high-quality habitat. All seven of the dipteran families were captured most in traps with progressively higher d values, especially those (d = 90-100%) that exceeded that of natural water bodies (30-80%). In most taxa, the height and slope of numerical responses to d were influenced by the distance of an ecological trap from a natural water body. Our results illustrate that dipterans have broadly evolved the use of a habitat selection behaviour that treats more strongly polarized light sources as indicative higher-quality habitats, making them broadly susceptible to ecological traps driven by polarized light pollution. We also found that the spatial isolation of ecological traps from higher-quality, but less attractive, habitats can either increase or reduce species' susceptibility to them.

AB This review focuses on the main acoustic adaptations that have evolved to enhance social communication in ants. We also describe how other invertebrates mimic these acoustic signals in order to coexist with ants in the case of mutualistic myrmecophiles, or, in the case of social parasites, corrupt them in order to infiltrate ant societies and exploit their resources. New data suggest that the strength of each antemyrmecophile interaction leads to distinctive sound profiles and may be a better predictor of the similarity of sound between different myrmecophilous species than their phylogenetic distance. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary significance of vibrations produced by specialized myrmecophiles in the context of ant multimodal communication involving the use of chemical and acoustic signals in combination and identify future challenges for research including how new technology might allow a better understanding of the study systems.

AB In fish, the presence of predator cues in the parental or juvenile environment engenders plasticity in the expression of fear-related behaviours. Whether these cues may engender developmental plasticity when they are present in the environment of embryos remains unexplored. Here, we tested in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss: (1) whether exposure to alarm cues during embryonic stages engendered developmental plasticity; and (2) whether an abiotic stressor could also orient the behavioural development of fry. We divided fertilized eggs into three groups: a control nonstressed group (Control), a group of embryos exposed to a conspecific alarm pheromone (e.g. predator-related cue stressor, PS), and a group of embryos that were chronically air exposed for 1 min (e.g. abiotic stressor, AS). Stressors were applied once a day, 3 times per week from 19 days postfertilization (dpf) until 52 dpf. Between 57 and 143 dpf, and for each individual, we assessed the propensity to express fear responses in different contexts and learning performances. When exposed to a novel environment or a novel object, PS fish showed significantly less fear-related behaviour, less freezing and higher activity levels than Control fish. PS fish also showed slower acquisition of a learning task than controls. AS fish did not differ from controls in any test situation. Our results show that in ovo exposure to a natural but not an abiotic signal is a prominent inducer of rainbow trout behavioural plasticity across a number of contexts. Our study provides evidence that the expression of neophobia by fish fry may be modulated by the level of risk perceived by embryos in the environment.

AB As animal behaviour theory has developed over the past 70 years, much attention has gone towards social behaviour. While our basic knowledge of social systems has grown substantially, it has rarely been applied to human issues. Here, we attempted to bridge the gap between animal behaviour theory and human psychology by conducting social experiments involving fish. As in many species, minnows (family: Cyprinidae) repeatedly exposed to risky situations can develop a behavioural phenotype characterized by neophobic tendencies, pacing and stereotypic behaviours. Here, we tested whether the simple presence of calm (or un-calm) conspecific models could lead to a weakening of the high-risk phenotype in minnows that acquired fear either in isolation or within a group. We first documented that the social context of risk exposure impacted the intensity of the high-risk phenotype, with minnows exposed to risk in isolation showing stronger high-risk traits compared to those that were exposed to risk in groups. However, individuals exposed to risk in isolation were more influenced by calm models, despite their more pronounced phenotype. We argue that group exposure led to social reinforcement of risk, which in turn decreased the information transfer about safety in these individuals. We also demonstrate that a group of calm models, and not un-calm models, was required to weaken the high-risk phenotype. These findings highlight the interplay between social reinforcement of risk and safety in social groups and the impact of groups on information transmission. Moreover, our results parallel anecdotal reports of successes or failures of social therapies for post-traumatic stress (PTS) patients based on the social context of symptom acquisition, suggesting that understanding the transfer of information in social animals could prove fruitful in understanding and modelling PTS recovery.

AB Several factors are involved in determining the outcome of sperm competition. In addition to sperm number, sperm quality and male phenotype, insemination order is often associated with skewed paternity share. Patterns of sperm precedence can be produced by the mechanics of sperm storage and fertilization, or by active processes under male or female control. However, as males and females always interact during copulation, it is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible. The Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, is a polyandric species characterized by last-male sperm precedence in natural matings. During such matings, females allow attractive males to inseminate more sperm by controlling copulation duration. We used artificial insemination to clarify the extent to which female control of sperm transfer influences the observed pattern of sperm precedence in this species. This technique allowed us to experimentally manipulate the number of sperm transferred and the timing of insemination. We found a significant first-male fertilization advantage. This advantage, however, declined as the time between insemination and parturition increased. Presumably, the anatomy and the physiology of the female genital tract favour egg fertilization by the first ejaculate inseminated, whereas sperm mixing is likely to be responsible for the reduction in first-male advantage associated with longer insemination-parturition intervals. Our results suggest that the last-male precedence detected after two consecutive natural matings is caused by cryptic female preference for attractive males associated with a female trading-up strategy (i.e. the second male is more frequently more attractive than the first male), rather than by insemination order per se. As the pattern of sperm precedence has important consequences for male reproductive strategies (for example mate guarding and male mate choice copying), unravelling its dynamic represents an important contribution to understanding the sexual behaviour of this model species.

AB Boredom is likely to have adaptive value in motivating exploration and learning, and many animals may possess the basic neurological mechanisms to support it. Chronic inescapable boredom can be extremely aversive, and understimulation can harm neural, cognitive and behavioural flexibility. Wild and domesticated animals are at particular risk in captivity, which is often spatially and temporally monotonous. Yet biological research into boredom has barely begun, despite having important implications for animal welfare, the evolution of motivation and cognition, and for human dysfunction at individual and societal levels. Here I aim to facilitate hypotheses about how monotony affects behaviour and physiology, so that boredom can be objectively studied by ethologists and other scientists. I cover valence (pleasantness) and arousal (wakefulness) qualities of boredom, because both can be measured, and I suggest boredom includes suboptimal arousal and aversion to monotony. Because the suboptimal arousal during boredom is aversive, individuals will resist low arousal. Thus, behavioural indicators of boredom will, seemingly paradoxically, include signs of increasing drowsiness, alongside bouts of restlessness, avoidance and sensation-seeking behaviour. Valence and arousal are not, however, sufficient to fully describe boredom. For example, human boredom is further characterized by a perception that time 'drags', and this effect of monotony on time perception can too be behaviourally assayed in animals. Sleep disruption and some abnormal behaviour may also be caused by boredom. Ethological research into this emotional phenomenon will deepen understanding of its causes, development, function and evolution, and will enable evidence-based interventions to mitigate human and animal boredom.

AB Despite the ubiquity of energetic costs as an explanation for behavioural evolution, the proximate basis of these costs is often unclear. One candidate that predictably regulates energetic expenditure in insects is the lipid metabolism pathway, which is used in behavioural activities such as flight. Here, we investigated lipid metabolism and its role in parental behaviour of males and females in two species of burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis and Nicrophorus vespilloides, which provide pre-hatching care by burying and preparing vertebrate carcasses before larvae arrive, and then post-hatching care by directly regurgitating food to begging offspring. We took two approaches: first, we investigated changes in the lipid stores of parenting beetles during pre-hatching and post-hatching care by measuring triglyceride concentration, compared to beetles not involved in care. Second, we quantified expression of the lipid transporter gene apolipophorin-III (apoLp-III) in these three behavioural states. Females and males of both species were similar in triglyceride use, but there were species differences. We observed a loss of triglycerides during pre-hatching but not post-hatching care in N. vespilloides, but no change in triglycerides during either pre-or post-hatching care in N. orbicollis. There were both species and sex differences in apoLp-III expression. Expression decreased during caring in both male and female N. orbicollis, and male N. vespilloides, but only decreased in female N. vespilloides providing post-hatching care. This roughly corresponded to changes in triglyceride abundance. These results indicate that either parental care is not energetically costly or, more likely, that lipid metabolism plays only a partial role in regulating energetic expenditure during Nicrophorus parental care. We suggest that the energy source used varies, perhaps between species but certainly across behavioural states. Furthermore, our results suggest that ApoLp-III may provide an alternate behavioural or immune function during parental care besides its canonical role as a lipid transporter.

ID SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION; BIRDS; INFORMATION; RESPONSES; CLASSIFICATION;
   TERRESTRIAL; SIGNALS; CONTEXT
AB Many vertebrates have alarm calls that warn conspecifics about danger, and some species even communicate about the type of predator or its behaviour, allowing for appropriate responses. However, such 'functionally referential' communication has been shown experimentally in only a handful of species, and requires demonstrating that individuals give acoustically distinct calls to different threats, and that the calls alone are sufficient to prompt listeners to behave as if a specific threat is present. We carried out model presentations, acoustic analyses and a playback experiment to test whether the alarm calls of noisy miners, Manorina melanocephala, are functionally referential. Miners gave different calls to airborne raptor models compared to terrestrial or perched raptor models, and even switched from 'aerial' alarm calls to 'chur' alarm calls when a hawk glider landed on the ground. They also behaved differently to these two types of threats, showing avoidance to aerial threats, including fleeing or freezing, but deterrent behaviour to terrestrial threats, including vigilance, approach and mobbing. The two alarm call types were acoustically distinct, and consistent with calls to live predators. Blind scoring of video revealed that birds responded appropriately to playbacks of alarm calls alone, typically fleeing to aerial alarm calls yet becoming vigilant, approaching and calling to chur calls. Noisy miners produce alarm calls that therefore meet both criteria for functional reference, and thus become one of the few bird species in which such calls have been confirmed. Many birds appear to give different calls to airborne predators compared to during mobbing of terrestrial or stationary predators, so functionally referential alarms are likely to be common and may often categorize predators by their behaviour and not simply their taxonomic type.

AB Social information, acquired through the observation of others, has been documented in a variety of adaptive contexts. The transmission of social information relies on social connections and therefore it is important to consider that individuals may vary in their access to, and use of, such information. Social network analysis allows for the consideration of individual variation in social connections, which until recently has been ignored in the study of social processes. Furthermore, few previous studies of social information use have considered the potential effects of traits such as dominance and personality, which have been found to influence group social structure. We used network-based diffusion analysis, which incorporates information on individual social associations, to examine whether wild flocks of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, utilize social information when locating novel foraging patches. Additionally, we incorporated individual traits (age, sex, dominance and exploratory personality) while examining flocks from rural and urban environments, to assess the influence of individual and habitat level characteristics on the rate of information transmission. Social information transmission was found to occur in all flocks, as individual time of discovery of the novel foraging patches was explained by network connections as predicted. However, the only individual level variable found to influence social transmission was dominance rank: dominant individuals had higher rates of information transmission than subordinates. We also found that the rate of social information transmission was higher in rural than urban environments. Our results highlight the importance of considering social associations when examining social information use. Additionally, our results suggest that dominant individuals have greater access to social information than more subordinate individuals, which may demonstrate a previously undocumented additional benefit provided by social dominance.

AB In social insects, individuals infected by pathogens withdraw from the nest, preventing the spread of diseases among genetically related nestmates and thereby contributing to the 'social immunity' of the colony. Here we investigated the extent to which the isolation of sick ants correlates with changes in their behavioural responses to environmental stimuli that serve as nest-related cues, including light, colony odour and physical presence of nestmates. Myrmica rubra ant workers infected by Metarhizium brunneum fungus showed a weak but constant attraction to light. By contrast, the progressive withdrawal of moribund workers from the nest appeared to be concomitant with a decline in their attraction towards nestmates or colony odour, which started on the third day after infection. We hypothesized that the fungus impaired the olfactory system of infected ants, preventing them from adequately reacting to chemical blends involved in colony marking and nestmate recognition. Instead of being an active behaviour, the social seclusion of sick ants appears to be the simple outcome of their increasing difficulty in orienting themselves towards nest-related cues. This phenomenon was reinforced by minor positive phototropism and the progressive dysfunction of motor skills as the infection progressed. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In polygynandrous mammals, females rarely form affiliative relationships with unrelated males outside the mating context. The antiharassment hypothesis provides one explanation for why such relationships have evolved in some gregarious primates: it states that females receive less aggression from group members in the presence of a male partner and gain his support when being harassed by others. This lowers the costs of competition and increases the female's access to resources, as it also reduces interruptions to feeding. Our aim was to test this hypothesis by investigating the benefits that wild female Assamese macaques, Macaca assamensis, in Thailand derive from bonding with particular males. In support of the antiharassment hypothesis, we found that the strength of affiliative relationships lowered the aggressiveness of a male towards a female, and predicted how much support a female received from a particular male in agonistic interactions with other group members. Additionally, relationship strength predicted the time that females spent co-feeding with a particular male as well as her feeding efficiency in the presence of that male. Hence, female Assamese macaques benefit from forming a social bond with a particular male by reducing the costs of competition.

AB Adjusting ejaculates to sperm competition can lead to sperm limitation. Particularly in polygynous species, males may face a trade-off between investing sperm in current or future mating opportunities. The optimal sperm allocation decision should depend on the relative intensity of sperm competition experienced in a mating sequence. Here we asked how males respond to this trade-off in polygynous fish with alternative male mating tactics, intense sperm competition and sperm limitation. Large bourgeois males of the shell-brooding cichlid Lamprologus callipterus build nests consisting of empty snail shells, in which females spawn and raise offspring. During spawning, nest males release ejaculates into the shell opening. Genetically distinct, parasitic dwarf males enter shells during spawning to fertilize the eggs from inside the shell. These dwarf males were previously shown to be superior sperm competitors to nest males. Here we showed that when spawning with several females simultaneously, nest males reduced the spawning duration for each clutch and the number of ejaculations per female tended to decrease, reflecting sperm limitation. Experimental exposure of nest males to sperm competition with dwarf males reduced the number and duration of ejaculations by roughly half. Hence, when exposed to competition with a superior rival, nest males did not increase their sperm expenditure as predicted by sperm competition risk models, but in fact saved sperm for future mating opportunities as predicted by sperm competition intensity theory. This seems to be adaptive because of the considerable sperm demands in this species, which is partly due to their high degree of polygyny. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The functions of birdsong include attracting a mate and repelling competitors. It is therefore not surprising that, in males in the temperate zone especially, birdsong is often produced in the context of reproduction. Testosterone of gonadal origin increases during the reproductive phase of the annual cycle and can significantly influence song production as well as song development via effects on song crystallization (testosterone secretion at the time of sexual maturity is essential for full crystallization to occur). In males, testosterone of gonadal origin can exert its effects in the brain on song and other reproductive behaviour via its oestrogenic and androgenic metabolites. The widespread distribution of nuclear androgen receptors in the song system and the occurrence of oestrogen receptors in one key forebrain nucleus in certain species as well as the presence of both receptor types in the diencephalon and the midbrain raises questions as to where and how testosterone is exerting its myriad effects on song. By selectively implanting testosterone into specific brain regions of castrated male canaries, Serinus canaria, we have identified the medial preoptic area as a critical site for the induction of a generalized increase in motivation that includes the motivation to sing. Testosterone action in the forebrain song nucleus HVC in contrast increases song stereotypy. Canaries receiving testosterone in the preoptic area and HVC sing stereotypic songs but at a much lower amplitude, indicating that testosterone's effects on amplitude are regulated elsewhere in the brain or the periphery. The lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus anterior nidopallium (LMAN) is a song nucleus that expresses a high density of androgen receptors and plays a role as a song variability generator during song learning. When adult female canaries are treated with testosterone, their song becomes more complex. Lesions to LMAN attenuate these effects on adult behavioural change, suggesting that testosterone may act in LMAN during song ontogeny to modulate changes associated with song crystallization. These anatomically specific effects illustrate how a single hormone can coordinate changes in many aspects of a complex behaviour to facilitate successful reproduction.

AB Conformity to the behavioural preferences of others can have powerful effects on intragroup behavioural homogeneity in humans, but evidence in animals remains minimal. In this study, we took advantage of circumstances in which individuals or pairs of captive chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, were 'migrated' between groups, to investigate whether immigrants would conform to a new dietary population preference experienced in the group they entered, an effect suggested by recent fieldwork. Such 'migratory-minority' chimpanzees were trained to avoid one of two differently coloured foods made unpalatable, before 'migrating' to, and then observing, a 'local-majority' group consume a different food colour. Both migratory-minority and local-majority chimpanzees displayed social learning, spending significantly more time consuming the previously unpalatable, but instead now edible, food, than did control chimpanzees who did not see immigrants eat this food, nor emigrate themselves. However, following the migration of migratory-minority chimpanzees, these control individuals and the local-majority chimpanzees tended to rely primarily upon personal information, consuming first the food they had earlier learned was palatable before sampling the alternative. Thus, chimpanzees did not engage in conformity in the context we tested; instead seeing others eat a previously unpalatable food led to socially learned and adaptive re-exploration of this now-safe option in both minority and majority participants.

AB The founding individuals of a new group or lineage are uniquely poised to have long-lasting effects on their descendants. Here we explore how the behavioural traits of new foundresses influence their task allocation strategies and the downstream collective behaviour of their colonies. We collected individual paper wasp (Polistes metricus) queens from the wild and measured their boldness, aggressiveness, exploration, activity and time budgets in the laboratory. We then provided queens with food and nest materials and waited for their workers to eclose. We subsequently tested for links between queen behavioural traits (e.g. boldness, aggressiveness) and the collective aggressiveness of their colonies, as estimated by the number of workers that responded to and stung a model predator. We found that bolder queens (i.e. queens that were less likely to leave their nests after repeated exposure to an agonistic stimulus) spent more time nest guarding, reared more workers and produced groups that were less responsive to a model predator. Thus, there appears to be parent-offspring, or queen-worker, resem-blance in the degree to which individuals remain on their nests in different social contexts (solitary queen versus queen + her worker group). To our knowledge this represents the first study to explicitly test for links between individual variation in foundress behaviour, worker production and intercolony collective behaviour; the results highlight the possibility that cross-contextual and transgenerational behavioural links could be a reasonably common and potentially important phenomenon in complex societies.

AB In social species, fighting in intergroup conflicts is one of the riskiest cooperative activities group members engage in, particularly for individuals of the smaller sex. In a number of species, female group members are significantly smaller than males, so the costs associated with intergroup aggression outweigh the potential benefits and females avoid participating. Studies conducted on species in which females are active participants have consistently found that they fight to defend access to food resources and that high-ranking females tend to be more active than low-rankers. However, additional factors may modulate the costs and benefits of participation, creating differences between individuals and variability within individuals over time. In this study, we investigated costs and benefits that potentially affect female vervet monkey, Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus, participation in intergroup conflicts. We observed the participation of 35 females in three groups, during 115 intergroup conflicts. Our findings suggest that female vervet monkeys defend access to valuable food resources, as well as to areas that are intensely used in the long term; however, rank also influenced female participation indicating that the potential benefits gained from resource defence vary with one's priority of access to these resources. We found that females were more likely to participate aggressively when they did not have an infant, and when they received more male support throughout the intergroup conflict, suggesting these factors influence the perceived risk, or costs, of intergroup aggression. Because we observed considerable temporal variability in both the proportion of female group members with infants and the number and identity of male group members (i.e. amount of male support provided), the relative fighting ability of neighbouring groups will inevitably fluctuate. Thus, our findings may help explain the lack of stable intergroup dominance relationships observed in many studies of intergroup conflict. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The aim of this study was to determine whether visual recognition of conspecifics exists in zebra finches, and if so, whether the strength of this recognition is a function of the social relationships among flock members. To achieve this aim, we trained adult female zebra finches to indicate their preference by pecking on one of two photographs presented on a digital screen. We found that female zebra finches possessed a very good ability to recognize their mates, and a slightly lower but still good ability to recognize other, socially closely related males that were members of their own small flock. Moreover, we found that the individual integrity of the small flocks continued to be maintained, as subgroups, even after these were combined to form one large flock, indicating that zebra finches demonstrate different levels of social relationships between flock members, and that these relationships are long-lasting and stable. However, when part of a larger flock, the females were unable to recognize males that were socially distant to them. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Species vary in the ease with which they can solve apparently similar problems. This can be due to a variety of features. For instance, the ecological context of a problem will be interpreted differently by different species. This could relate to how they interpret the problem, but also, more basically, to which cue they see as key. Differences in the latter may influence the ability to solve the task not because of variations in cognitive ability per se, but because one species has to first learn which cue is relevant before it is able to solve the task. In our previous work, cleaner fish learned faster than three species of primates to give an 'ephemeral' food source priority over a 'resident' food source, where the relevant cue was the colour, pattern and shape of the plates on which the food sources were placed (but the foods were identical). To determine the degree to which this cue influenced the primates' ability to learn the task, relative to cleaner fish, we here repeated the task with capuchin monkeys and cleaners, using two variations designed to be more salient to capuchins (the cleaners were also tested to see whether these changes negatively affected their performance). In the first, we changed the cue from the colour of the plate presenting the food (original plate task) to the colour of the food itself (now the plates were identical). In the second, we hid the food rewards, as primates are known to have difficulties inhibiting responses to visible rewards. Primates improved their performance on both adapted tasks. Interestingly, and contrary to our predictions, fish performed at the same level across all versions of the task. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Vigilance can be targeted at predators or competitors, but there has been little work on the factors that affect vigilance aimed at competitors, which is known as social vigilance, and how it should be structured to detect and avoid conspecific threats. Social vigilance might be expected to play an important role in foraging groups with frequent conflicts over resources. I examined social vigilance in skimming semi-palmated sandpipers, Calidris pusilla, which exploit minute prey at the surface of the substrate using a head-down position that leaves them vulnerable to aggressive displacement by neighbours. Attacks over resources occurred frequently in skimming sandpipers. In these groups, vigilance increased when neighbours were closer, suggesting that close neighbours posed a threat and that vigilance has a non-negligible social component in skimming groups. The negative exponential distribution best fitted the empirical distribution of intervals between successive vigilance bouts during skimming. This type of distribution implies that a bout of vigilance is initiated at the same rate regardless of the time spent head down in the current skimming bout, a feature that would prevent would-be attackers from targeting sandpipers at times of predictable vulnerability. This study shows that the occurrence of threats from within the group can promote randomness in the temporal organization of vigilance. (c) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The snowdrift game is a model for studying social coordination in the context of competing interests. We presented pairs of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, with a situation in which they could either pull a weighted tray together or pull alone to obtain food. Ultimately chimpanzees should coordinate their actions because if no one pulled, they would both lose the reward. There were two experimental manipulations: the tray's weight (low or high weight condition) and the time to solve the dilemma before the rewards became inaccessible (40 s or 10 s). When the costs were high (i.e. high weight condition), chimpanzees waited longer to act. Cooperation tended to increase in frequency across sessions. The pulling effort invested in the task also became more skewed between subjects. The subjects also adjusted their behaviour by changing their pulling effort for different partners. These results demonstrate that chimpanzees can coordinate their actions in situations where there is a conflict of interest. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When confronted with an unfamiliar object, dogs, Canis familiaris, engage in social referencing, i.e. synchronizing their reaction with that of their owner. The question of whether, like infants, they do so when confronted with an unfamiliar person, has not yet been studied. We tested the reactions of 72 pet dogs (36 shepherds and 36 molossoids) that were confronted with an unfamiliar person who approached them in a neutral manner. The dogs' owners were instructed to behave in one of three ways towards the stranger: stay still, approach or retreat. The dogs performed referential looks and gaze alternations between the experimenter and their owner. In the retreat condition, the dogs looked at the stranger significantly sooner and took significantly more time before first contact with the stranger compared to the approach condition. Moreover, in the retreat condition the dogs interacted more with their owners compared to other conditions. Additionally, sex had an effect on dogs' behaviours, with males looking towards their owner for information less than females. Breed also influenced dogs' reactions, with molossoid dogs behaving more independently than shepherd dogs. This study shows that pet dogs use social referencing with their owner in an approach paradigm involving a stranger. These findings provide evidence of similar processes in dogs with their owners and human infants with caregivers, and suggest a new way to manage dogs' reactions in public places.

AB For food-caching animals inhabiting environments with strong seasonal variation, harsh winter conditions may limit access to naturally available food and favour the evolution of enhanced spatial memory. Spatial memory enables animals to remember the locations of food caches for overwinter survival, therefore animals in harsher conditions may benefit more from more accurate spatial memory than conspecifics living under relatively mild conditions. Despite numerous laboratory studies lending indirect support to the hypothesis that a harsh environment favours the evolution of spatial memory, there is no direct evidence showing fitness consequences of variation in spatial memory. As a step towards evaluating this hypothesis in natural populations, we established spatial arrays of programmable bird feeders equipped with radio frequency identification technology (RFID) to test for individual variation in spatial memory in food-caching mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, at two elevations differing in winter climate severity. Individuals could only access food at a single rewarding feeder within an array of eight, and each individual had to learn the location of their unique rewarding feeder. Birds at higher elevations visited the arrays significantly more frequently than birds at lower elevations, suggesting more intense food caching. They also performed better at locating their rewarding feeder than birds from lower elevations. Individuals showing better performance participated in more overall trials, suggesting a link between food-caching propensity and memory performance, but higher overall levels of activity within each array yielded less accurate memory performance. Finally, rotating the arrays showed that birds relied specifically on spatial memory in order to locate their rewarding feeder. To our knowledge, this is the first explicit test of spatial memory performance in food-caching birds under natural conditions. Our results corroborate earlier laboratory-based work showing large individual variation in spatial memory performance and lay the groundwork for future investigation into the fitness consequences of individual variation and the evolution of spatial memory.

ID SOCIAL THERMOREGULATION; COLONIALITY; BEHAVIOR
AB Social thermoregulation is a cooperative strategy in which animals actively aggregate to benefit from the warmth of conspecifics in response to low ambient temperatures. Emperor penguins, Aptenodytes forsteri, use this behaviour to ensure their survival and reproduction during the Antarctic winter. An emperor penguin colony consists of a dynamic mosaic of compact zones, the so-called huddles, included in a looser network of individuals. To maximize energy savings, birds should adjust their huddling behaviour according to environmental conditions. Here, we examined the dynamics of emperor penguin aggregations, based on photo and video records, in relation to climatic factors. Environmental temperature, wind and solar radiation were the main factors contributing to huddle formation. The analysis of individual movements showed that birds originating from loose aggregations continually joined huddles. Sometimes, a small number of birds induced a movement that propagated to the entire huddle, causing its breakup within 2 min and releasing birds, which then integrated into looser aggregations. Different parts of the colony therefore appeared to continually exchange individuals in response to environmental conditions. A likely explanation is that individuals in need of warmth join huddles, whereas individuals seeking to dissipate heat break huddles apart. The regular growth and decay of huddles operates as pulses through which birds gain, conserve or lose heat. Originally proposed to account for reducing energy expenditure, the concept of social thermoregulation appears to cover a highly dynamic phenomenon that fulfils a genuine regulatory function in emperor penguins.

AB Animals can insure themselves against the risk of starvation associated with unpredictable food availability by storing energy reserves or gathering information about alternative food sources. The former strategy carries costs in terms of mass-dependent predation risk, while the latter trades off against foraging for food; both trade-offs may be influenced by an individual's developmental history. Here, we consider a possible role of early developmental experience in inducing different mass regulation and foraging strategies in European starlings. We measured the body mass, body condition, foraging effort, food consumption and contrafreeloading (foraging for food hidden in sand when equivalent food is freely available) of adult birds (>= 10 months old) that had previously undergone a subtle early life manipulation of food competition (cross-fostering into the highest or lowest ranks in the brood size hierarchy when 2 - 12 days of age). We found that developmentally disadvantaged birds were fatter in adulthood and differed in foraging behaviour compared with their advantaged siblings. Disadvantaged birds were hyperphagic compared with advantaged birds, but only following a period of food deprivation, and also spent more time contrafreeloading. Advantaged birds experienced a trade-off between foraging success and time spent contrafreeloading, whereas disadvantaged birds faced no such trade-off, owing to their greater foraging efficiency. Thus, developmentally disadvantaged birds appeared to retain a phenotypic memory of increased nestling food competition, employing both energy storage and information gathering insurance strategies to a greater extent than their advantaged siblings. Our results suggest that subtle early life disadvantage in the form of psychosocial stress and/or food insecurity can leave a lasting legacy on foraging behaviour and mass regulation even in the absence of food insufficiency during development or adulthood.

AB Parents play a key role in determining the phenotype of their offspring. However, relatively few studies have investigated whether parents can change their offspring's behaviour in a sustained way that persists into adulthood. With experiments on the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides, we investigated how the developmental environment created by parents affects their offspring's wing morphology in adulthood, and the correlated effects on adult flight behaviour. Burying beetles exhibit complex biparental care, but offspring can survive without parental provisioning. By removing parents just prior to hatching, while holding the nutritional environment constant, we investigated the downstream consequences for offspring morphology and behaviour. Larvae that developed in the absence of their parents had relatively long and more slender wings than those that developed in their parents' presence. Flight mill tests revealed that flight performance was dependent on the presence of parents during development but not on wing shape. Our results demonstrate that parents have long-lasting effects on the behaviour of their offspring, by influencing the morphology and flight behaviour of their young even after they have matured into adults.

AB Game theory models provide a useful framework for investigating strategies of conflict resolution in animal contests. Model predictions are based on estimates of resource-holding potential (RHP) and vary in their assumptions about how opponents gather information about RHP. Models can be divided into self-assessment strategies (energetic war-of-attrition, E-WOA; cumulative assessment model, CAM) and mutual assessment strategies (sequential assessment model, SAM). We used laboratory-staged contests between male giant Australian cuttlefish, Sepia apama, to evaluate RHP traits and to test game theory models. Mantle length was a key indicator of RHP because it predicted contest outcome, whereby larger individuals were more likely to win a contest. Winners and losers did not match behaviours, ruling out the E-WOA. There was no relationship between contest outcome, duration and escalation rates, arguing against the CAM. Persistence to continue a contest was based on RHP asymmetry, rather than loser and/or winner RHP, providing support for the SAM. Motivation to fight was determined from a male's latency to resume a contest following the introduction of a female during a contest. The latency to resume a contest was negatively related to the size of the focal male and positively related to the size of their opponent. These results show that competing males are able to gather information concerning RHP asymmetries, providing support for mutual assessment. Furthermore, males showed significant behavioural differences in their responses to relatively larger than to relatively smaller opponents. Using an integrative approach, our study provides a well-substantiated example of mutual assessment. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB During the breeding season, seabirds may use many behavioural strategies to reduce the time and energy spent searching for patchily distributed prey. Seabirds breeding at a large colony on the northeast Newfoundland coast (Funk Island), primarily common murres, Uria aalge, and northern gannets, Morus bassanus, predominantly feed on capelin, Mallotus villosus. Within foraging ranges, high-abundance capelin aggregations can be predictably located at deep-water (<40 m) spawning sites during the spawning period in mid-to late July, before which capelin are distributed in small, ephemeral schools. To investigate the 'local enhancement' hypothesis, we conducted a field-based experiment by deploying seabird-mimicking plastic models, or 'decoys', during July-August in 2009 and 2013, to determine whether breeding murres, gannets and Atlantic puffins, Fratercula arctica, respond to seabird aggregations. We used three decoy treatments: 'Murre', 'Gannet' and 'Hotspot' (both murre and gannet decoys). Pursuit-diving and plunge-diving birds were 4-7 and 17 times, respectively more likely to respond to decoy treatment relative to control periods. All species responded more to conspecifics, or to species within the same foraging guild, during single-species treatments (i.e. Murre, Gannet), but responded similarly (i.e. murres, puffins) or more (i.e. gannets) to the Hotspot treatment, suggesting that predator density in general is an important cue. Fewer murres responded to decoys during capelin spawning relative to pre-spawning, suggesting that murres use local enhancement to a lesser degree when prey can be predictably located nearby. This study provides experimental evidence that seabirds use local enhancement as a search strategy, but to varying degrees under changing prey conditions.

AB Disruptive coloration is a camouflage strategy proposed to function by breaking up an animal's boundary and mask its characteristic shape, thereby impairing its recognition by onlookers. Recent studies on disruptive coloration have consistently shown an association between putative 'disruptive' edge coloration and heightened survivorship, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. If edge markings enhance survivorship through disruption, then the success of this camouflage strategy should depend on the visibility of the animal's boundaries and its shape. Here, we experimentally tested the hypothesis that the disruptive camouflage of a prey improves its survivorship in a manner that is conditional on the visibility of its boundaries and its overall shape. We found that both boundary visibility (solid versus translucent boundary) and boundary shape (straight versus ruffled outlines) affected survivorship of artificial moths in a human computer-foraging task. Furthermore, as expected, the observed survival benefits of edge markings were conditional upon the boundaries' visibility. Surprisingly, however, no such interaction was found between edge markings and body shape on overall survivorship. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether disruptive edge markings affect shape perception per se. Collectively, however, our results add further support to the contention that edge markings provide camouflage by breaking up an animal's boundaries in a manner independent of background matching.

AB In multispecies communities, animals may come to recognize the signals of other species both by responding to common signal features and by learning about associations between signals and relevant threats. However, some signals are produced in multiple contexts. To a given receiver, such a signal may only sometimes be relevant. Here, I demonstrate that receivers use contextual variation in signal form as a cue to their relevance. Individuals from 15 species of songbirds repeated their calls rapidly when confronting widely threatening predators, but repeated the same calls more slowly during other types of social interactions. In playback experiments, repetition rate was a cue to nestling Ficedula flycatchers, which reduced their activity in response to quickly but not slowly repeated calls, and also to adult birds from a variety of species, which responded more strongly to the calls of their own and other species produced at faster rates. These results show that repetition rate is an innate or early learned contextual cue and, in combination with learning about heterospecific signals, allows receivers to fine-tune their responses to the calls of their own and other species according to their relevance, suggesting that simple rules facilitate widespread heterospecific communication networks.

AB The evolution of status badges presents a challenge to animal communication theory because no obvious production costs prevent low-quality individuals from cheating. From mammals, evidence of visual status badges remains rare with most examples to date found in birds. Here we report that drastic fluctuations in the facial ornamentation of male eland antelope, Tragelaphus oryx, reliably indicated two aspects of social status: dominance in all-male herds and access to mates as the master bull in mixed-sex herds. The finding suggests that visual status badges may be more widespread in mammals than hitherto recognized, especially in taxa with complex social systems. The peak frequency of loud knee-clicks explained additional variation in male social status. Supporting a function as a body size indicator, the peak click frequency was in turn dependent on body depth and facemask darkness, the latter possibly related to testosterone levels and hence muscle development. Dewlap size reflected dominance in all-male herds but not master bull status in mixed-sex herds and, after controlling for the effect of age, no link with social status remained. Thus whether the primary function of the ungulate dewlap is in communication or rather in thermoregulation is still an open question. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Parthenogenesis is an asexual mode of reproduction that is rare in nature compared to sex. Parthenogenetic animals are derived from sexual progenitors, but little is known about how transitions to parthenogenesis evolve and persist. One hypothesis is that selection promotes transitions to parthenogenesis when males are rare or when mating is impossible (the mate scarcity hypothesis). However, we hypothesized that selection might also favour sex-to-parthenogenesis transitions when sexual interactions are costly (the sexual conflict hypothesis). These hypotheses lead to contrasting predictions about the nature of male-female interactions and their effects on female fitness. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a series of life history and behavioural experiments on the facultatively parthenogenetic spiny leaf stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. As predicted by sexual conflict theory, we found that females appeared to neutralize the costs of sex by utilizing counterevolved resistance traits: male-paired females resisted matings by curling their abdomens and kicking their legs during copulation attempts, prereproductive virgin females produced an antiaphrodisiac that repelled males, and parthenogenetic females made themselves inconspicuous to males by altering their pheromonal signals. Although measures of offspring viability point to possible advantages of sexual reproduction, females that were experimentally switched from a parthenogenetic to a sexual reproductive mode suffered elevated mortality and egg production costs that were not observed in exclusively parthenogenetic or exclusively sexual females. Our results suggest that females can benefit by avoiding mating in at least some circumstances, therefore supporting the hypothesis that sexual conflict mediated by female resistance could contribute to the evolution of facultative parthenogenesis.

AB Recent research suggests that individuals across a variety of taxa express consistent behavioural differences, or personality, which may affect reproductive success. Most previous studies of avian systems investigated the effects of individual personality on offspring recruitment and other fitness correlates, even in species with biparental care. Here we tested the potential for behavioural similarity within mated pairs of wild eastern bluebirds to impact reproductive success. Specifically, we quantified nest defence behaviour of males and females to address three hypotheses: (1) the individual personality hypothesis, which predicts that individuals with more aggressive personalities will have more nestlings survive to fledging; (2) the pair coordination hypothesis, which predicts similarly behaving pairs will have more nestlings survive to fledging; and (3) the pair intensity hypothesis, which predicts pairs with more aggressive personalities will have more nestlings survive to fledging. Pairs that had similar nest defence strategies produced more fledglings in support of the pair coordination hypothesis. We found no support for either the individual personality hypothesis or the pair intensity hypothesis. Thus, particularly in species with biparental care, it is important to consider the behaviour of both pair members to predict effects on reproductive success.

AB Many passerines adjust song attributes to avoid potential masking by anthropogenic noise. The costs of masking should be particularly high for vocalizations important for survival (e.g. alarm calls), but few studies have investigated how such calls are affected. We compared urban and rural silvereye, Zosterops lateralis, alarm calls across southeastern Australia, and found that urban calls had lower average, peak and maximum frequencies than rural calls. The average, peak and maximum frequency of alarm calls also decreased linearly with increasing background noise. The direction of this frequency shift runs contrary to expectations and previous findings of higher-pitched avian vocal signals in urban habitats, including higher-pitched song and contact calls in urban silvereyes. However, assuming no change in call amplitude, acoustic modelling indicates that the observed frequency shift would lead to a 20% increase in the predicted active space of alarm calls (i.e. the distance over which the calls can be detected by a conspecific bird) in urban noise, and therefore may be potentially adaptive. Our findings highlight the importance of considering behavioural and ecological contexts in urban acoustic-adaptation studie. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The recent application of social network analysis to animal populations has provided a tool to quantify group dynamics and individual social positions, which may enhance our understanding of the costs and benefits of sociality and the evolution of behavioural strategies within societies. Despite this, uncertainties remain about whether comparisons can be drawn between studies in which different sampling techniques have been used. We compared social networks constructed from two interaction and three proximity techniques that are frequently used in the literature, at both the ego network and global network levels, using data collected annually for two troops of chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, over 3 years. We obtained very different results at both the global and individual levels, demonstrating the clear distinction between networks built using different interaction and proximity techniques. While interaction techniques may be comparable at the whole global level, proximity techniques were not, and we found the opposite at the ego network level: proximity techniques could be compared whereas interaction techniques could not. As there was a clear distinction between the networks created, caution should be taken when using proximity as a proxy for social interactions (and vice versa) in social network studies. Further, our results showed high variation between troops and study seasons, reemphasizing the importance of incorporating temporal change in the analysis of social networks. Researchers should consider the effects of sampling technique on the networks produced when comparing networks created from different techniques.

AB Male courtship signals often stimulate the production of sex steroids in both female and male receivers. Such effects benefit signallers by increasing receptivity in females, but impose costs on signallers by promoting sexual behaviour and aggression in male competitors. To resolve this androgen-based conflict, males should use strategies that suppress sex steroid production in rival males. In green treefrogs, Hyla cinerea, chorus sounds (i.e. advertisement calls from aggregates of males) are known to stimulate androgen production in receiver males. Here, I examined whether males of this species counter these effects by eliciting an endocrine stress response in male conspecifics during close-range vocal interactions. I show that corticosterone (CORT) levels were higher in males that lost vocal contests in natural choruses compared to contest winners and nonaggressive males. Testosterone levels were also lower in contest losers compared to nonaggressive males, but not contest winners; dihydrotesterone levels did not differ among the three groups. Aggressive and advertisement calls were then broadcast to males in an experiment that simulated close-range vocal communication. Aggressive calls rapidly (45 min) elicited an increase in CORT and a reduction in androgens in receivers. Advertisement calls did not elicit an increase in CORT, but CORT levels were sustained relative to controls exposed to silence and were accompanied by a reduction in androgens in small males. Endocrine responses to acoustic signals in this species thus vary depending upon context, call type and size of signal receivers. Signallers benefit from eliciting CORT production in competitors because elevated CORT suppresses vocalization. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A number of prey species rely on two primary adaptations, behavioural alterations and morphological defences, to reduce their probability of being killed by predators. There should be considerable selection for maintaining adaptive trait combinations between behavioural and morphological defences in natural populations. However, our understanding of how behaviour and morphology interact has been limited to somewhat simple systems. Here we investigate patterns of covariation between behaviour and morphology in juvenile lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, a fish species with a complex antipredator phenotype. We found strong evidence for trait co-dependence between escape responses and body size, where larger fish were able to show stronger escape responses. Furthermore, we found that cover-seeking behaviour exhibited a complex multitiered relationship, representing a mixture of trait compensation and trait co-specialization that was dependent on specific combinations of mechanically independent traits. The smallest fish sought cover in rocky microhabitats more than fish of any other size (i.e. trait compensation). However, the largest fish also increased the amount of time they spent in rocky microhabitats following exposure to risk, indicating that cover-seeking behaviour may co-specialize with the ability to show strong escape responses. Cryptic fish of intermediate size did not flee from foraging grounds in response to risk (i.e. they showed trait compensation), whereas fish that lacked this pattern fled. Our results demonstrate how behaviour can integrate with complex morphological variation to produce unique antipredator outcomes. As sturgeon morphology has been largely preserved since the lower Jurassic period (similar to 200 million years ago), it may represent a highly successful morphological trait complex to which behavioural responses are finely tuned. Insight into the extent to which behaviour is linked to morphology is important in order to understand the limitations or reaches of adaptive phenotypic plasticity and the evolution of integrated phenotypes.

AB The study of the organization of dives in bouts has provided insights into the foraging ecology of many species of diving animals. In otariids and seabirds, the alternation between dive bouts and periods at the surface has been proved to reflect the distinction between time spent foraging in patches and moving between them, allowing bouts to be interpreted as foraging units. Phocid seals, however, are known to be able to travel and rest while diving, making the interpretation of bouts less straightforward. We investigated the behavioural interpretation of dive bouts and surfacing periods in harbour seals, Phoca vitulina. We propose an approach in which the organization of bouts of dives at different temporal scales is compared with information on the seals' horizontal movements and dive characteristics. We found that prolonged surfacing periods could be generally interpreted as at-sea resting events. We also examined the occurrence of potential resting behaviour while diving and found that harbour seals perform low-activity dives, with different incidence between individuals. We conclude that bout organization in harbour seals mainly reflects the alternation of periods of activity and resting and that harbour seals spend a significant amount of time resting at sea. However, dive bouts cannot be considered as behavioural units, since both movement and some of the resting activity occur within them. This approach highlights the presence in this species of behaviours of similar function (i.e. resting), expressed in different forms (i.e. haul out, prolonged surfacing, low-activity diving), the cumulative patterns of which are well related to the daylight cycle.

AB Diel rhythms of physiology and behaviour are present in virtually all taxa examined to date. However, few studies have rigorously assessed the adaptive value of physiological and behavioural rhythms in animals. We laid the groundwork for an assessment of the adaptive rhythm hypothesis by assaying diel rhythms of foraging and antipredator behaviour in the trashline orb-weaver Cyclosa turbinata (Araneae: Araneidae). When confronted with a predator stimulus in experimental arenas, C. turbinata showed thanatosis behaviour more frequently and for longer durations during the day. However, assays of antipredator response within webs revealed more complex diel patterns of avoidance behaviours and no pattern of avoidance behaviour duration. A preliminary assay of prey capture behaviour suggested that C. turbinata also shows nocturnal patterns of foraging aggression. A refined foraging experiment, in which we randomized prey stimulus frequency, found that time of day and spider ID strongly predicted the likelihood of showing prey capture behaviour. Only spider ID predicted latency to attack the prey stimulus despite low individual repeatability (r = 0.10). These results support our prediction that C. turbinata modulate foraging aggression over the diel cycle, but we found no evidence of a trade-off between foraging behaviour and predator vigilance. However, overall patterns of vigilance may be masked by diel changes in antipredator strategies that correspond to fluctuations in the relative abundances of predator types.

AB Levels of juvenile hormone (JH) are elevated during parental care in burying beetles (Nicrophorus) at a time when ovarian activity is suppressed, suggesting that JH plays an alternative role to its better known gonadotropic function. Because parental activity in burying beetles is time-intensive, it might be expected to be energetically stressful and to impart longevity costs. We predicted that the active (feeding) stage of care would be associated with elevated JH and greater energy expenditure (higher metabolic rate, lower body mass), and that this stress would result in shorter life span. Parents experimentally manipulated into providing more care for young had increased levels of JH. For females, there was a significant longevity cost associated with parental care but not with mating or egg production. During carcass preparation, females and males that would later regurgitate to larvae showed an initial increase in body mass followed by a significant decrease in mass during the intense period of parental provisioning of young (during and just after the JH peak). Males that provided little care (on small carcasses with a female partner) showed no such anticipatory weight gain. An indirect measure of metabolic rate (VCO2) was nearly twice as high in caregiving females compared to nonbreeding females. These results suggest that the energy demands and/or high JH levels during care extract a significant cost on longevity. We propose that JH has evolved to play a novel role in parental care in burying beetles associated with extreme energy demands during feeding of offspring.

AB The evolution of nonreproductive castes is a fundamental question in evolution biology. The honeybee Apis mellifera L. has a reproductive division of labour: the queen is the primary egg-layer in a colony and has more than 200 ovarian filaments (ovarioles), whereas a worker normally does not reproduce and has fewer than 20 ovarioles. The number of ovarioles influences worker foraging behaviour and the propensity to become an egg-layer in the absence of the queen, suggesting that reproductive regulatory networks evolved with foraging division of labour in honeybee workers. Cooperation between nurse bee feeding behaviour and larval developmental programming results in the differentiation of queens and workers along with variation in ovariole number, body mass and foraging behaviour. Here, we tested how nurse bees affect ovariole number and body mass in workers, and how larvae respond to food delivery during different larval life stages. Our findings demonstrate that nurses control larvae growth and ovariole number by temporally manipulating food delivery and that the response of larvae to food differs with larval life stage and genotype. Body mass of larvae was more sensitive to nutrition during the first to the fourth instar (L1-L4), whereas ovariole number was more sensitive during the fifth instar (L5). Overall, we were able to decouple the nurse feeding program and the larval development program in honeybees. We conclude that nurse feeding behaviour during L5 is critical for modulating ovariole number in workers. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mate choice has long been appreciated as a key component of sexual selection. However, how we measure mate choice, both in the field and in the laboratory, remains problematic. Mating preferences may be tested using either no-choice or choice tests, but explicit comparisons between these two experimental paradigms remain limited. It has been suggested that preferences may be stronger in choice tests as they allow simultaneous comparison, and some studies have indeed found stronger mating preferences in choice tests compared to no-choice tests. Here we explicitly tested the effect of experimental choice paradigm on the measurement of sexual selection on male and female morphology in the promiscuous seed bug Lygaeus equestris (Heteroptera, Lygaeidae). We performed mating trials in which we varied the amount of choice presented to each sex, giving four choice treatments: no-choice, male choice, female choice and mutual choice. Overall we found evidence for significant positive directional selection on female body length and stabilizing selection on an overall measure of male body size. However, we found no significant effect of choice paradigm on the patterns of sexual selection for males or females. We suggest this may be because of the method of mate assessment in L. equestris, which appears to be primarily via contact cues, which may limit simultaneous comparison between options.

AB One of the first applications of game theory in the field of animal behaviour was to show that respect for ownership (Bourgeois behaviour) can arise as an arbitrary convention to avoid costly disputes. However, this same theory indicated that a mirror-image dispute-avoiding convention in which owners concede their property to intruders (anti-Bourgeois) is also stable under the same conditions. It has since been shown repeatedly that the first individuals to find resources are frequently left unchallenged, while evidence for the alternative convention, according to which owners relinquish property to intruders without conflict, is rare at best. By far the most commonly invoked explanation for the rarity of anti-Bourgeois is that two individuals employing such behaviour over repeated rounds would be swapping roles continually, a potentially inefficient outcome known as 'infinite regress.' Here we set out to test the validity of this verbal reasoning by analysing a Hawk-Dove model with ownership asymmetry but introducing a fixed probability w that two individuals meet again. While assuming that the resource has value to the winner (realized either at the end of the interaction, or after each round) and losers of fights pay costs, we also assume that individuals incur costs in taking ownership and relinquishing it. Contrary to expectation and despite the inefficiency of the anti-Bourgeois equilibrium, 'infinite regress' does not always render anti-Bourgeois unviable. Indeed if fighting is cheap, then repeated interactions can generate an anti-Bourgeois equilibrium where previously only obligate Hawk was a stable population strategy. Nevertheless, when probability w exceeds thresholds determined by the costs of taking and relinquishing ownership, Bourgeois can become the only stable convention. Collectively, our model demonstrates that although infinite regress can facilitate the evolution of Bourgeois-like conventions, it is no panacea.

AB Unidirectional grooming is a low-cost behaviour for which the groomer is repaid via kin selection or reciprocity. Return benefits can come in the form of increased probability of being groomed or social benefits such as coalitionary support. By contrast, the reasons for mutual grooming, which occurs when two individuals simultaneously groom each other, are not understood. In this study, we test three hypotheses regarding the function of mutual grooming among wild male chimpanzees, using 16 years of data. The social bonding hypothesis posits that mutual grooming promotes a return benefit by serving to strengthen and maintain social bonds, whereas the immediate investment hypothesis states that it functions as a signal to indicate willingness to invest in (continue) the grooming bout. The switching hypothesis states that mutual grooming results from overlap created when the direction of the grooming interaction is switched. The social bonding hypothesis was not supported: measures of association were not correlated with the probability of mutual grooming. We also found no support for the switching hypothesis, asmutual grooming was equally likely to occur without a switch in the direction of grooming as when a switch occurred. The immediate investment hypothesis was supported by our finding that bouts with mutual grooming (1) were longer, (2) contained a more equitable distribution of unidirectional grooming and (3) had more unidirectional grooming switches than bouts without mutual grooming. We conclude that male chimpanzees use mutual grooming to obtain short-term benefits in the form of prolonging a grooming bout, and suggest that mutual grooming thus represents a form of overlapping parcelling.

AB The application of information theory to birdsong research provides insights into the internal organizational structure of the communication systems of nonhuman animals, which can be integrated with behavioural data. We applied information theory to test for trade-offs between two birdsong features, complexity and duration, which may be costly for the individual. We determined and quantified the internal structure of the song in a wild passerine, the spectacled warbler, Sylvia conspicillata, and tested for differences in song variability between song bouts of different lengths. We found (1) no correlation between song bout length and internal complexity, since song bouts of different durations presented the same degree of complexity, (2) a high potential for communication capacity because of the equilibrium between the unification and diversification of the song repertoire, and (3) a communication system that followed a first-order Markov chain with a high degree of variation and individuality, giving rise to a complex and highly variable song. The fact that both short and long songs showed high internal complexity suggests that no clear constraint exists between these features, and that the spectacled warbler may sing intrinsically complex songs throughout the display. This complexity is enhanced by the lack of sharing among individuals, which would otherwise homogenize songs and constrain individual innovation ability.

AB The evolutionary basis of women's orgasm is unknown, but the most favoured theory involves putative physiological processes that accompany orgasm and increase the likelihood of fertilization during intercourse. In a sample of over 8000 female twins and siblings, we show a substantial genetic basis to both orgasm rate and number of offspring. While there was a very weak but significant phenotypic correlation between the two variables, there was no corresponding genetic correlation, suggesting the involvement of environmental confounders. Controlling for relationship length and frequency of sexual intercourse eliminated the significant phenotypic correlation between orgasm rate and number of offspring, which suggests no substantive causal relationship between orgasm and fertility. These results cast doubt on the predominant functional theory of female orgasm. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Siblings living together compete with each other for resources, yet they may also cooperate to maximize their inclusive fitness. In social spiders, siblings share prey and may both compete and cooperate to obtain this resource. In the laboratory, the social huntsman spider, Delena cancerides, readily shares prey captured by other colony members; however, these spiders only occasionally share prey in the field, making the importance of prey sharing to their social system difficult to assess directly. We examined the importance of prey sharing indirectly by measuring the body condition of spiders from 90 colonies at the time of collection. We compared body condition to colony demographics to determine whether the patterns were consistent with the hypothesis that younger spiders benefit from sharing prey captured by older siblings. We tested several alternative hypotheses that might also explain associations between condition and the presence of siblings. We further conducted a laboratory experiment to directly determine whether feeding on prey captured by older siblings improves the condition of younger spiders. Younger spiders collected from the field were heavier in the presence of older siblings, but there was no effect for older spiders or for any spider with younger siblings. Laboratory spiders gained access to additional prey captured by older siblings. We rejected the alternative hypotheses and concluded that younger spiders indeed benefit from the presence of older siblings. This system provides evidence that the exploitation of others' resources can provide a benefit of group living and act as a form of cooperation.

AB The social network approach provides a set of statistical tools to analyse associations between individuals. The 'half-weight index' (HWI), the association index most commonly used in social network analyses, does not take into account differences between the gregariousness of individuals. Thus, the HWI may not be a good measure of relationships between individuals: it could indicate strong affinities that do not exist and vice versa. Here we present a new index, the HWIG, that corrects the association index between two individuals for their respective levels of gregariousness. We compared the HWIG to the HWI by simulating populations in which individuals varied in their gregariousness and their affinities for each other. Unlike the HWIG, the estimation of associations made by the HWI was strongly influenced by the gregariousness of individuals: the HWI was systematically less strongly correlated with the true (input) affinity than the HWIG and this discrepancy increased when variation in individual gregariousness increased. We recommend using the HWIG, or similar variants of other common association indices, as unbiased measures of association between individuals.

AB Patterns of variation in mate preferences provide information about the processes influencing the evolution of mate choice behaviour. We measured variation in female mate preferences using preference functions, which are curves that describe female responses across variation in male signals. Over 3 weeks of testing, we repeatedly measured female Enchenopa binotata 'Ptelea' treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) for their preference for male signal frequency (Hz). We then calculated the consistency of differences in mate preference functions among females (i.e. repeatability) and variability across females for the preference functions. We then measured traits describing different aspects of variation in mate preferences, including peak preference and selectivity. We found repeatability in the overall preference functions, indicating a potential for preference functions to respond to selection. Furthermore, we found substantial repeatability and variability in selectivity traits and low repeatability and variability in peak preference. Finally, we found only weak covariation between peak preference and selectivity. We discuss the implications of our results within the framework of the evolution of mate preferences, both in terms of past selection shaping mate preferences, and the potential for preferences to respond to current selection.

AB Social learning is widely used among vertebrates to acquire information about a variable environment. We conducted a study of social learning in the wild which involved cross-fostering eggs of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, to nests of great tits, Parus major, and vice versa. This allowed us to quantify the consequences of being reared in a different social context but in an environment otherwise natural to the birds. We studied choice of nest site by offering to the local recruits either a small or a large nestbox. Most blue tits bred in small nestboxes, whereas most great tits used the large boxes. Size of the natal nestbox affected subsequent box choice. In addition, in blue tits, more cross-fostered birds than controls nested in large nestboxes, with an opposite result for cross-fostered great tits. Apparently, as a consequence of sexual misimprinting on their foster parents, the cross-fostered young used members of the foster species as models for subsequent nest site choice. Such social copying may apply broadly to other types of behaviours and not only to the choice of nest site. This study demonstrates both vertical and horizontal transmission of nest site preference of two vertebrates in the wild. Future studies should try to find out how animals balance the use of personal experience with the information socially acquired. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Previous research has shown that men prefer higher-pitched women's voices and women prefer lower-pitched men's voices. However, both men and women can modulate their voice pitch, which can affect others' perceptions of the voice. Here we tested whether deliberate pitch changes affect speakers' vocal attractiveness. Our results suggest that deliberately exaggerating sex-typical voice pitch (i.e. lowering pitch in men and raising pitch in women) does not necessarily increase vocal attractiveness but that exaggerating sex-atypical voice pitch (i.e. raising pitch in men and lowering pitch in women) may decrease vocal attractiveness. By contrast with these findings for attractiveness, listeners interpreted lowered-pitch voices as sounding more dominant than habitually pitched voices in same-sex voices, which may aid in avoiding the costs associated with intrasexual competition. These findings suggest that the way humans perceive deliberate manipulations of voice pitch can mitigate the potential costs of using an alterable cue to assess attractiveness, and that functional honesty may only evolve in domains where such honesty would be favourable to perceivers.

AB Males of many species produce conspicuous mating signals to attract females, but these signals can also attract eavesdropping predators and parasites. Males are thus expected to evolve signalling behaviours that balance the sexual selection benefits and the natural selection costs. In the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, males sing to attract females, but these songs also attract the lethal parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea. The flies use male crickets as hosts for their larvae, primarily search for hosts during a 2 h period following sunset and prefer the same song types as female crickets. We tested whether males from high-risk populations reduce the risk of parasitism by singing less frequently or by shifting their singing activity to a time of the night when the risk of parasitism is low. We compared male singing activity and its temporal pattern between six high-risk and six low-risk populations that were reared in a common environment. There was no effect of parasitism risk on either total male singing activity or the temporal pattern of male singing activity. Males from high-risk populations thus sang as frequently as males from low-risk populations. These results suggest that sexual selection on male singing behaviour may be substantially stronger in high-risk populations than in low-risk populations. It is possible that other traits may have evolved to reduce parasitism risk without compromising mate attraction. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The spatial distribution of foraging animals at a given time simultaneously depends on (1) exogenous environmental variables such as resource availability and abiotic habitat characteristics, and (2) the endogenous variable social aggregation made up of the opposing mechanisms of conspecific attraction and repulsion. We developed an exogenous environment-social aggregation model to analyse the spatial distributions of six abundant shorebird species in the Dutch Wadden Sea at resolutions of 150 x 150, 200 x 200 and 250 x 250 m. We used these resolutions to check the robustness of the estimates to the modifiable areal unit problem. We estimated the model parameters by spatial autoregression. This approach enables, among others, estimation of the direct and indirect effects of an exogenous environmental variable on animal density. The former is given by the regression coefficient and the latter, which is due to the amplification of the direct effect by social aggregation, by the spatial multiplier. At all resolution levels and for all species, the explanatory power of social aggregation, measured by Nagelkerke R-2, was larger than the combined contribution of the exogenous environmental variables food availability, silt content and mudflat elevation. Social aggregation was stronger for dunlin, Calidris alpina, red knot, Calidris canutus, and curlew, Numenius arquata, than for oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus, grey plover, Pluvialis squatarola, and bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica. The total impacts (that is, direct effect plus all indirect impacts) of the exogenous environmental predictors tended to exceed substantially the direct effects (which tend to be the only ones examined in studies on foraging distributions).

AB During their offshore movements, leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea, associate frequently with ocean currents and mesoscale oceanographic features such as eddies, and their movements are often in accordance with the current flow. To investigate how individual turtles oriented their ground-and water-related movements in relation to the currents encountered on their journeys, we used oceanographic techniques to estimate the direction and intensity of ocean currents along the course of 15 leatherbacks tracked by satellite during their long-distance movements in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. For all individuals a non-negligible component of active swimming was evident throughout the journeys, even when their routes closely followed the currents, but overall the turtle water-related orientation was random with respect to current directions. For turtles in the North Atlantic, the ground-related movements largely derived from the turtles' active swimming, while in the Indian Ocean currents contributed substantially to the observed movements. The same pattern was shown when distinct parts of the routes corresponding to foraging bouts and travelling segments were considered separately. These findings substantiate previous qualitative observations of leatherback movements, by revealing that turtles were not simply drifting passively but rather swam actively during most of their journeys, although with a random orientation with respect to currents. Our analysis did not provide any indication that leatherbacks were able to detect the current drift they were exposed to, further highlighting the navigational challenges they face in their oceanic wanderings.

AB Corvids such as jays and ravens cache food for future consumption and can remember the location of caches that they have seen others make. Given the risk of caches being pilfered by observers, corvids limit opportunities for conspecifics to witness caching events. Faced with cache protection tactics, pilferers should also utilize tactics to maximize their success. Cacher-pilferer interactions and their underlying cognition have largely been investigated in semisocial ravens, Corvus corax, and western scrub-jays, Aphelocoma californica. However to understand the factors influencing the development of these abilities, data are required from species that differ in their socioecology from ravens and western scrub-jays. In the current study, we tested the caching and pilfering behaviour of territorial Eurasian jays in two social contexts. In one context, subjects competed with a dominant conspecific, while in the other the same individuals interacted with a subordinate competitor. When subordinate, birds initially suppressed caching, before caching more in less exposed locations. In contrast, when socially dominant, birds cached more and moved items multiple times. As subordinate pilferers, birds took longer to approach cache sites and approached when the cacher was at a distance, while when dominant, birds rapidly approached the conspecifics' cache sites, frequently when the cacher was still in the process of caching. Individual jays therefore flexibly switched caching and pilfering tactics in response to the relative dominance of their competitor. We discuss the implications of our results for competing theories on the origin of behavioural flexibility and its underlying complex cognition in the corvid lineage.

AB Nitrogen is a key nutrient for fitness in insects, but host plant defence can deter herbivores from acquiring it. Therefore, coping with host plant defence is a predominant issue for herbivores. Butterflies have the ability to compensate for a nitrogen-poor diet both as herbivorous larvae and as nectar-feeding adults. We examined whether silica (S), the main antiherbivore defence in grasses (in both fertilized nitrogen-rich (F+) and nitrogen-poor (F-) Festuca rubra host plants) affects larval development and accordingly adult feeding behaviour in the small heath butterfly, Coenonympha pamphilus. High silica levels in nitrogen-poor host plants (F-/S+) negatively affected larval performance, and, as a consequence, female and even male butterflies preferred to consume amino acid-rich nectar. Our findings show for the first time that plant defence in larval host plants affects feeding behaviour in adult butterflies, and that even male butterflies, which have so far been thought to be indifferent to nectar amino acids, preferred to consume amino acid-rich nectar. Hence larval food quality can influence plant-pollinator dynamics. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Alternative mating tactics (AMTs) may show different trade-offs between current reproduction and survival; however, the proximate mechanisms underlying this pattern remain unclear. Among them, the relationship between reproductive effort and parasite resistance mediated by hormonal secretion has received increasing attention. We monitored 19 marked adult male chamois, Rupicapra rupicapra, within the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy) between the pre- and postrut 2011, to investigate the trade-off between mating effort and parasites associated with AMTs, and the underlying physiological mechanism. Territorial males sharply increased mating effort, faecal androgen and cortisol metabolites, and parasite levels during the rut, whereas nonterritorial ones displayed a similar pattern only for androgen metabolite levels. During the rut, territorial males invested more in rutting activities, while having higher levels of hormone metabolites and greater faecal counts of parasites than nonterritorial males. Before and after the rut, differences between male types (territorial and nonterritorial males) were smaller. Our analysis suggests that a trade-off between mating effort and parasitism exists, and that the proximate mechanism underlying this pattern may be found in the secretion of androgen metabolites. The greater investment in rutting activities, which territorial males make, suggests potentially high mating benefits. However, mating benefits could be counterbalanced by greater risk of injuries, consumption of fat reserves and higher hormone levels, which might favour the suppression of immunological defence and the subsequent decrease in parasite resistance.

AB Many models from foraging theory and movement ecology assume that resources are encountered randomly. If food locations, types and values are retained in memory, however, search time could be significantly reduced, with concurrent effects on biological fitness. Despite this, little is known about what specific characteristics of foods, particularly those relevant to profitability, nonhuman animals can remember. Building upon previous observations, we hypothesized that chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, after observing foods being hidden in a large wooded test area they could not enter, and after long delays, would direct (through gesture and vocalization) experimentally naive humans to the reward locations in an order that could be predicted beforehand by the spatial and physical characteristics of those items. In the main experiment, various quantities of almonds, both in and out of shells and sealed in transparent bags, were hidden in the test area. The chimpanzees later directed searchers to those items in a nonrandom order related to quantity, shell presence/absence, and the distance they were hidden from the subject. The recovery sequences were closely related to the actual e/h (energy/handling time) profitability of the foods. Predicted recovery orders, based on the energetic value of almonds and independently measured, individual-specific expected pursuit and processing times, were closely related to observed recovery orders. We argue that the information nonhuman animals possess regarding their environment can be extensive, and that further comparative study is vital for incorporating realistic cognitive variables into models of foraging and movement.

AB We used a combination of inexpensive camera equipment and statistical analysis of optical flow patterns to analyse the behaviour of 24 commercial broiler (meat) chicken flocks, Gallus gallus. Individual birds were not tracked or marked but the skew and kurtosis of flow patterns produced by the collective movements of the flocks were significantly correlated with key welfare measures such as % mortality, numbers of birds with hockburn (damaged leg skin) and abnormal walking behaviour (poor gaits) in individual birds. These correlations were already apparent in birds as young as 15-20 days. Optical flow patterns provided an information-rich link between flock and individual that could be important in the development of new ways of assessing the welfare of, and managing, broiler chickens. It could also have wider application to the study of other animal groups as an alternative to more invasive or intrusive methods. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behaviour is generally plastic to some degree and allows an animal to react appropriately to changing and novel conditions. Consequently, a degree of plasticity is predicted to be a key determinant of an organism's ability to cope with novel (e. g. urban) environments. Yet behavioural plasticity is often genetically determined and many animals exhibit personalities (i.e. consistent between-individual differences in behaviours). We explored the degree of behavioural plasticity versus personality in the bridge spider, Larinioides sclopetarius, which occurs in extremely high densities in urban areas over the Holarctic. The spiders show extraordinary plasticity in life history. We investigated between-and within-individual variability, correlations and heritability for aggressiveness, boldness, behaviours in novel environment, and voracity towards prey. We predicted that these spiders would show high individual behavioural plasticity or that there would be a mix of individuals with different personalities. We found temporal consistency and moderate heritability in intra-sex aggressiveness and boldness, whereas behaviours in novel environment were repeatable but not heritable. Most behavioural traits showed high between-individual variability. We discuss the idea that low heritability of behaviours related to foraging success and a lack of behavioural correlations may be a result of developmental plasticity as a mechanism that promotes success in cities. In the next step, we experimentally tested whether composition of aggressiveness types affects spiders' mass gain and survival in a high-density group. Groups of only aggressive types had highest mass but also showed highest mortality, although not significantly. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that living in high densities does not necessarily require a reduction of mean aggressiveness levels but that a polymorphism in aggressive personalities maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection would be a possible scenario.

AB Individuals of many avian and mammalian species produce antipredator calls when they encounter a predator. These calls often vary in acoustic structure depending on the type or level of predation risk, thereby eliciting the appropriate escape responses in conspecifics. Such complexity in communication may also be advantageous in situations in which animals recruit other individuals to mob predators because different risks may sometimes require different mobbing responses. I tested this idea in Japanese great tits, Parus major minor, which produce acoustically distinct mobbing calls for two different nest predators: 'chicka' calls for jungle crows, Corvus macrorhynchos, and 'jar' calls for Japanese rat snakes, Elaphe climacophora. A playback experiment revealed that adult great tits responded to different mobbing calls with qualitatively different behaviours: they scanned the horizon in response to 'chicka' calls and gazed towards the ground in response to 'jar' calls. These two responses help adults search for and detect the corresponding predators since crows fly to the nest and snakes approach from the ground. This study demonstrates that the mobbing calls of Japanese great tits transmit referential information about predator types and elicit the appropriate predator-searching behaviours in adults.

AB Ratings of chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and orang-utan, Pongo pygmaeus and Pongo abelii, personality reveal dimensions resembling those found in humans. Critics have argued that this similarity derives from anthropomorphic projection or other rater-based effects. We developed two forms of data reduction analyses to determine whether these dimensions can best be explained by the inherent tendencies of the animals (e.g. orang-utans that are curious are playful) or anthropomorphic projections of raters (e.g. believing that orang-utans that are curious should be playful). We found that personality dimensions derived after differences between rater means and rater*item interactions had been removed from ratings replicated the previously discovered dimensions. Conversely, we found a different set of dimensions when analysing items from which differences between animal means and animal*item interactions had been removed. Finally, we used multilevel factor analysis to examine whether the published structure was replicated when we extracted factors based on the within-level animal differences in item scores effects while allowing between-rater differences to covary freely. Again, the personality dimensions were similar to those described in previous studies. These analyses can be used in combination with interrater reliability, temporal stability, and correlations between personality and other external variables to validate animal personality ratings. These analyses confirmed that personality similarities between humans and great apes are best explained by genetic and phylogenetic affinity and not by anthropomorphic artefacts.

AB Many studies of animal personality are completed in the laboratory with animals collected from the wild. However, there is some concern that studies that trap individuals to perform assessments of personality may not collect a representative sample of personality types, as some individuals may be trap-shy. We investigated the relationship between boldness and trappability using males of a species of lizard, the Namibian rock agama, Agama planiceps, whose boldness could be assessed in the wild prior to trapping. We observed known individuals between nine and 15 times each over several weeks, which revealed that boldness consistently differed across individuals and was not influenced by factors such as body size or environmental variables. Lizards habituated to the behavioural assay, but there was no evidence of plasticity (individual differences) in the rate of habituation. As predicted, bold individuals entered the trap sooner than shy individuals and we had higher success at trapping bold individuals. Using a simple simulation model, we show that such bias leads to underestimates of effect size and reduces the power to detect correlations between behavioural traits (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We suggest that studies that trap animals for laboratory assessments of personality may consistently underrepresent the extent of personality trait variation in the populations that they sample, and recommend that future studies either develop methods for testing personality in the field that control for obvious confounding variables or make every effort to ensure minimum bias when sampling animals for use in a laboratory setting.

AB The Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea, one of the world's rarest otariids, is notable for an asynchronous, aseasonal breeding chronology. Determining the ecological features that shape the genetic structure of marine predators such as Australian sea lions is challenging because their demersal foraging habitat is difficult to observe and quantify. Recent developments in stable isotope screening techniques using milk-dependent pups as proxies for maternal isotope signatures identified temporally stable, alternative (inshore and offshore) foraging ecotypes in adult female Australian sea lions. We combined this technique with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis of samples of 40-60% of all pups produced at 17 of the largest South Australian colonies to determine whether ecological specialization in foraging ecotype within and between colonies has shaped maternal population structure within the species. Genetic isolation by distance was apparent at very fine geographical scales with three distinct clusters of colonies that share multiple haplotypes being interspersed with isolated breeding sites. There was no congruence between mtDNA haplotype distribution and foraging ecotypes suggesting that observed behavioural specialization was not maintained along matrilines. We propose that foraging specialization within discrete fine-scale foraging areas and habitats at the individual level limits the dispersive capacity of adult female Australian sea lions which in turn drives population structure. Given this species' vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts and the high degree of female population structure, determining the extent of male-mediated gene flow in this species is critical. Only then can breeding colony connectivity be established and appropriate management units identified for the species. Crown Copyright (C) 2011.

AB Habitat selection is an important decision in the life histories of many animals and has implications for many issues in ecology, evolution and conservation biology. Natal experiences may shape adult habitat selection behaviours, but the effects of natal social environment on these decisions are largely unknown. Here we provide an experimental test of the effects of natal social experience on adult habitat selection in the cactus bug, Chelinidea vittiger (Hemiptera: Coreidae). We found that females reared in groups were more likely to forage socially as adults than females that were reared alone; however, males consistently avoided joining conspecifics regardless of natal social experience. Our work reveals that cues gathered early in life can have effects that extend across life stages to influence adult habitat selection and social behaviours. Furthermore, the discovery of these patterns in a subsocial invertebrate demonstrates that adult responsiveness to natal social conditions is not restricted to highly social species, and may be common across taxa.

AB Duets are a form of poorly understood signal created by two individuals temporally coordinating their vocalizations. It has been hypothesized that duetting functions in (1) joint resource defence, (2) avoiding usurpation from a partnership, (3) preventing a partner from being usurped, and (4) signalling commitment to a partner. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we need to determine the intended receiver of the duets and whether duetting is a collaborative act. Steere's liocichla (Timaliidae: Liocichla steerii) is an endemic passerine bird found in the forest edge habitat of mountains in Taiwan. Mated pairs engage in duetting typically initiated by males. We conducted a stereo duet playback experiment, controlled for position effects, to examine the function of duetting in Steere's liocichla. Playback stimuli included conspecific stranger female solo song, stranger male solo song, stranger duet song and neighbour duet song. During the playbacks, males initiated nearly all vocalizations. The propensity for males to sing was not significantly different between the stranger treatments but was lower in neighbour duet playback. However, females responded more to their partner's song, thus creating the duet, after stranger female solo and stranger duet playbacks. Pair members tended to approach the playback source together rather than move separately towards different speakers. When pair members did approach different speakers, however, the birds approached the speaker singing their sex-specific song. Our findings indicate that in addition to joint resource defence, duets in Steere's liocichla also serve a mate-guarding function to avoid being usurped.

AB The evolutionary consequences of parent-offspring conflict have received considerable attention, yet the extent to which parent-offspring conflict influences life history traits remains uncertain. In particular, it is unclear whether hatching patterns are parental strategies to manipulate competitive dynamics among offspring, or whether they are instead consequences of physiological or ecological variables affecting the payoffs of adjusting the onset of incubation. Here we describe an experiment in which we manipulated the hatching pattern of wild free-living zebra finches. We examined the consequences of hatching pattern on parental feeding behaviour and sibling competition, with the aim of identifying selective pressures that underlie differing hatching patterns. Increasing hatching asynchrony reduced the overall quantity of food that parents delivered and the equitability of its distribution among nestlings compared with synchronous broods. However, for each unit of food received, the begging intensity of nestlings from asynchronous broods was lower. As a consequence, the growth rate of first-hatched nestlings in asynchronous broods was significantly greater than those in synchronous broods, and there was no significant difference in growth rate between last-hatched nestlings in asynchronous broods and nestlings from synchronous broods, even though they received less food overall. The reduced scramble competition and energy wasted on begging behaviour in asynchronous broods supports the sibling rivalry hypothesis, suggesting an adaptive function for hatching asynchrony in wild zebra finches.

AB Studies of behaviour are increasingly focusing on acquisition of traits through cultural inheritance. Comparison of patterns of spatial population structure (FST) between neutral genetic loci and behavioural or cultural traits can been used to test hypotheses about demography, life history, and the mechanisms of inheritance/transmission of these traits in humans, chimpanzees and other animals. Here, we develop analytical expectations to show how FST in cultural traits can differ strongly from that measured at neutral genetic markers if migration is largely restricted to one sex but social learning is predominantly modelled on the other (e.g. males migrate, females serve as models for cultural traits), if one individual is the learning model for many, or if rates of innovation (individual learning) are high or rates of social learning are low. We discuss how comparisons of FST between genetic loci and behavioural traits can be applied to evaluate the importance of innovation in shaping patterns of cultural differentiation, as even low rates of innovation can considerably reduce FST, relative to observed structure at neutral genetic loci. Our results also suggest that differentiation in neutral cultural traits should occur over much smaller scales in species with male migration and female enculturation (or the reverse).

AB Recent theoretical approaches using dynamic models have tried to explain the so-called 'lek paradox' arguing that female preferences for more heterozygous males could evolve in the absence of direct fitness benefits associated with mate choice. However, these models do not specify the degree of inbreeding depression required for the evolution of these preferences, nor what kinds of benefits promote this process. To answer these questions, I analysed one of these models considering different degrees of inbreeding depression. Paradoxically, choosy females had a higher chance of mating with siblings and achieved similar or even lower reproductive success than nonchoosy ones. Nevertheless, the allele determining female preferences for heterozygous males could still spread in some populations if the presence of this allele was correlated with male ornament expression, as in a runaway process. However, preference never prevailed over nonpreference under any of the following circumstances: limited dispersal, incest avoidance (which constrained top males' mating success), exclusive maternal transmission of female preferences (which impeded correlations between preferences and ornament), inbreeding depression or low heterozygosity-ornament correlation. In the light of these results, the hypothesis of mate choice based on heterozygosity can hardly be advocated as a general solution to the lek paradox.

AB Anthropogenic influences on the natural world are widespread and well studied from various ecological vantage points. Their behavioural implications, however, are comparatively less well understood. We review four categories of influence on natural animal mating systems: habitat fragmentation, climate change, pollution and selective harvesting. We adopt a predictive approach, first reviewing the ecological determinants of mating system variation and then investigating how these determinants may be affected. Habitat fragmentation and climate change are directly altering the two fundamental predictors of mating system variation: the spatial and temporal distributions of resources. Pollution has implications for mating systems, via, for example, feminizing effects of endocrine disrupters and impeded efficacy of sexual communication. The influences of selective harvesting arise from the removal of phenotypic (and in some cases, genetic) variation in sexually selected traits. The ecological (e. g. by serving as an underlying mechanism contributing to Allee effects) and evolutionary (e. g. by driving microevolutionary trajectories that run counter to sexual selection) consequences of mating system disruption may be severe. The current lack of data, however, makes rigorous assessment of these consequences premature. Nevertheless, there is an analytical framework that can be used to make quantitative predictions, and we argue that applying it more broadly will help improve our understanding of the causes and consequences of anthropogenic influences on natural animal mating systems.

AB Because of scaling trends in physiology and morphology, very small animals are expected to suffer especially strong selection to reduce the cost of the central nervous system, which may make them more likely to sacrifice behavioural capacities to economize on nervous tissue. This 'size-limitation' hypothesis predicts reduced behavioural capabilities in smaller animals. I tested this hypothesis by comparing web construction behaviour of young nymphs and adults of a very small orb-weaving spider, Anapisona simoni (young nymphs similar to 0.005 mg, adults similar to 0.8 mg), with those of relatives up to 104 times larger. In these comparisons I took advantage of the special opportunities offered by orb webs to study fine behavioural details during web construction, because the webs represent precise records of large numbers of behavioural decisions. Combining these results with those of a previous study, the size-limitation hypothesis was not supported: very small spiders failed to show three predicted trends, and they showed four other trends that were in directions opposite to those predicted by the hypothesis. Two additional intraweb comparisons (at least one of which was probably biased against equal performance by the smallest species) gave a mix of support and lack of support for the predictions, while only one interspecific difference supported the predictions. Other studies have shown that small spiders have relatively large central nervous systems for their body sizes, suggesting that they may maintain behavioural capabilities comparable to those of larger orb weavers by paying the material and metabolic costs of building and maintaining large volumes of nervous tissue. These considerations may have general consequences for the probability of evolving small body sizes and egg sizes in spiders and other animals. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Directional communication, in other words the use of body orientation to increase transmission of directional signals, has been widely neglected in studies of animal communication. Here we propose that the experimental analysis of singing direction in birds can provide insights into the function of song. We studied three populations of sedge warblers, Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, in Austria, Britain and Germany. In this species, song is thought to be primarily a mate attraction signal, as males cease to sing once they are paired. Using behavioural observation during playback experiments, we found that males approached a loudspeaker simulating a rival male and also oriented themselves towards the loudspeaker while singing. This finding shows that sedge warbler songs are also directed at rival males and that the dual functions of mate attraction and territory defence were only hidden from the human observer because singing ceases after pairing. We argue that the study of directed communication is an additional tool in addressing functional questions, and that animal orientation should be taken into account when conducting investigations of signalling behaviour.

AB There is currently considerable interest in the evolution of parasite manipulations of hosts that facilitate transmission. The classic examples of such adaptive manipulations typically concern trophically transmitted parasites that increase host conspicuousness or in other ways maximize the likelihood of their intermediate host being consumed by the parasite's predatory definitive host, thereby completing the parasite's life cycle. However, examples of manipulations not involving trophically transmitted parasites are rare. Here we present evidence of a novel parasite-induced change in host coloration that we suggest acts as a warning signal to deter predators from consuming infected hosts, which would result in termination of the parasite's life cycle. When insect larvae are infected by the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora they become bioluminescent and change to a vivid pink-red colour. We used field trials involving wild European robins, Erithacus rubecula, and showed that infected larvae were rarely handled by these avian predators and, on the rare occasions that infected larvae were handled, they tended to be rejected. Our results suggest that the parasite-induced colour change in the host may act as a visual deterrent or warning signal to avian predators, which may be reinforced by the production of a distasteful chemical that, together, reduce the likelihood of infected prey being consumed. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a parasite-induced host manipulation involving warning coloration, and so broadens the range of examples of this fascinating adaptive behaviour.

AB The evolution of cooperation between unrelated individuals has been a central issue in evolutionary biology. The main problem in most theories of cooperation is how a cooperative player selects individuals to 'trust' so that he does not get exploited by noncooperators. While early models emphasized the role of direct experience with individuals in deciding who to trust, more recent work has shown that individuals can eavesdrop on interactions between other individuals to identify cooperators and noncooperators. This second route to cooperation is called indirect reciprocity. In spatially structured populations with repeated interactions between players, both sources of information (direct experience and observed reputation) are readily available. Most models and empirical studies to date, however, have considered indirect reciprocity only in one-shot interactions when direct experience is not available. We examined the role of indirect reciprocity in the maintenance of mutual restraint in aggression (Dear Enemy cooperation) between territorial male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. We found that territory owners eavesdropped on simulated defections by a neighbour (intrusions onto a third bird's territory) and subsequently retaliated against these defecting neighbours. Taken together with our previous results, these results suggest that both direct and indirect reciprocity can be at work in repeated-interaction scenarios, and together lead to emergence of cooperation.

AB We investigated the orientation in relation to wind of common swifts, Apus apus, during nocturnal spring and autumn migration. Swifts are highly adapted to a life in the air, showing wind-dependent orientation during nocturnal roosting flights, and may be expected to be more efficient in their wind drift/compensation behaviour than nocturnal passerine migrants, which are usually subjected to full or partial wind drift. A tracking radar at Lund in southern Sweden was used to record the orientation of common swifts (identified by their characteristic radar echo signature) on nocturnal migration flights and to measure wind conditions at the altitudes at which the birds were flying. Comparing track and heading directions under easterly and westerly winds revealed that the swifts shifted their heading distinctly into the wind, with the result that track directions were similar under the different wind conditions. As this pattern of complete compensation for drift from cross-winds occurred during both spring and autumn migration, there were no indications of differences between age classes. In addition, we found an effect of side-winds on equivalent airspeeds, with swifts increasing their airspeed with increasing wind speed. Such a response has been theoretically predicted as part of an optimal behaviour for counteracting wind drift but has hereto not been empirically demonstrated. There was also a positive correlation between overall wind speed and equivalent airspeed, making it difficult to interpret whether the swifts respond to the total wind speed rather than specifically to the side-wind effect. Our results suggest that important differences may exist between species in their capacities to orient in relation to the wind and that the swift may be particularly efficient in adjusting heading direction and airspeed to obtain complete compensation for wind drift during high-altitude nocturnal migratory flights.

AB The great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, is one of the most intensively studied species in the area of vocal behaviour and an important model in studies of sexual selection. We evaluated performance of the whistles produced by different males and examined whether individuals improved their performance over consecutive seasons. Finally, we tested whether the performance of whistles reflected males' philopatry and harem size. We assessed whistle performance based on duration and consistency. Our analyses showed that great reed warbler males improved the performance of their whistles in subsequent seasons. Whistles became both longer and more consistent from one year to the next. We also found that males' harem size was significantly related to whistle performance, which in turn reflected philopatry. Subsequent analyses revealed that the performances of polygynous and philopatric males differed significantly from those of monogamous, unpaired and new males. As philopatry is preferred by great reed warbler females, it is in the males' interest to advertise this feature. Coding philopatry in the songs of individual males seems to be an easy and efficient way of informing females about males' familiarity with the breeding grounds. The proper performance of difficult double-element whistles, the mastery of which may be time consuming, seems to be a good candidate for indicating males' philopatry. If so, the quality of whistle syllables may also reflect differences in the general quality of individual males as high performance levels may be associated with both males' longevity and their ability to learn.

AB Human mating success has been associated with phenotypic characteristics proposed to signal genetic quality. However, whether genetic quality is directly associated with mating success in humans is unknown. Genetic diversity in general, and particularly at genes important for immune functioning within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), has been associated with individual fitness and opposite-sex preferences for facial appearance, and may therefore be subject to sexual selection in humans. We investigated whether general and/or MHC genetic diversity, measured as microsatellite heterozygosity and standardized mean d(2), was associated with mating success, defined as number of sexual partners and age of first sex. Both measures of MHC diversity predicted number of sexual partners in females. Females with greater MHC diversity were more successful at obtaining mates than less diverse females. Mating success in males, however, was not significantly associated with any of the genetic diversity measures. These results provide partial support for a role of genetic diversity in human mating success. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, navigate individually in the inhospitable saltpans of Tunisia using path integration for long-distance navigation, and visual and olfactory landmarks for fine-scale orientation in the vicinity of the nest entrance. Here, we show in a field experiment that the ants are able to locate the nest entrance within a two-dimensional olfactory array. Ants were trained to forage in an open channel and to memorize the nest entrance relative to four odours that were applied at the corners of an invisible quadratic array. In a test situation, the ants pinpointed the fictive nest only when the odours were present at their learned positions. Our results suggest that the ants had learned the olfactory scenery around their nest. Furthermore, unilaterally antennectomized ants could not pinpoint the nest within a two-dimensional array. Hence, this kind of orientation depends on the simultaneous input of both antennae, that is, on a stereo sense of smell. Until now, insects and mammals, including humans, have only been known to use bilateral sensory input to follow a concentration gradient of an odour. Our evidence suggests that desert ants require a stereo sense of smell to make use of the olfactory scenery around their nest for homing. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Multimodal signals convey information that can be detected by receivers using two or more sensory modalities. The information transmitted through secondary channels may be mostly useless, redundant, complementary, or essential. Although each option implies different evolutionary scenarios, the relative role of signal subcomponents in a secondary channel has rarely been tested. Anuran amphibians are known for their extensive use of auditory signals, but growing evidence suggests their common use of multimodal signals where the visual component represents the secondary channel. Territorial males of the nontoxic frog Allobates femoralis use bimodal (acoustic + visual) signals to recognize conspecific intruders. We used playback experiments to test the relative importance of three visual subcomponents (body coloration, body size and body movement) in a multimodal signal to elicit agonistic reactions in males. The probability of attack was highly related to the movement and size of a dummy frog but very poorly related to dummy's coloration. The results suggest that any body movement, and not only vocal sac movement, is a nonredundant component of a bimodal signal that probably modulates male aggression. Against our expectations, males readily attacked dummy frogs painted to mimic the co-occurring frog Ameerega trivittata as well as models lacking some of their own pattern's subcomponents (white lines and yellow patches). Colourful frogs did not use body coloration as a visual cue for conspecific recognition. Both patterns recall the importance of carefully manipulating the availability of visual information in interpreting the origin and evolution of multimodal signals.

AB The benefit of monopolizing a limited resource is influenced by competitor density and by the relative competitive ability of defenders and intruders. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the effect of density on resource defence in groups with large asymmetries in competitive ability, as a consequence of, for example, age and/or body size. We used two age classes (i.e. size groups) of stream-living brown trout, Salmo trutta, to investigate this issue. While old (and large) trout are assumed to be superior during interference competition, younger individuals may be both numerically dominant and constitute more than half of the total population biomass. In this experiment, the ability of one yearling to monopolize a concentrated food source was observed at four densities of under-yearlings (zero, two, six and 12) in an indoor seminatural stream. We predicted that the success of defence would decrease with increasing under-yearling density and that the frequency of defence (i.e. aggression) would peak at an intermediate density. As predicted, yearlings made significantly more unsuccessful foraging attempts and adopted darker body coloration at high density of under-yearlings, suggesting increased stress levels. However, in contrast to our second prediction, the number of aggressive interactions increased progressively with density. These novel findings suggest that the cost of defence increases with under-yearling density, probably as a consequence of stress from interference with under-yearlings employing alternative competitive strategies. However, the difference in size seems to enable yearlings to defend the food resource at higher density of competitors than predicted from the resource defence theory.

AB Apollo butterflies in Fennoscandia differ from most butterflies because they oviposit almost randomly, away from the host plant. We studied whether this apparently maladaptive behaviour could be compensated for by high accuracy of newly hatched larvae in locating host plants through either olfactory or visual cues. Olfaction capacity was quantified in a two-choice set-up (host plant versus control) in an olfactometer. Visual capacity was quantified in a small-scale open-air arena with a host plant and a dummy control placed randomly at the edge. We found no evidence that larvae oriented themselves towards the host plant in either of these experimental set-ups; instead, larvae moved in the direction of the sun, and arrested movement in the presence of a smell common to the control and treatment of the olfaction test. Because larvae do not locate their host plant at a distance, the probability of finding a host plant is likely to be critically dependent on host plant density. We tested this assumption by releasing larvae in open-air arenas with three different host plant densities. The probability of larvae reaching a host plant depended strongly on host plant density. A comparison with host plant densities observed in nature suggests that Apollo butterfly larvae require a relatively high host plant density in order to have a reasonable probability of locating a host plant before perishing. Our findings provide a clear proximate link between host plant density and larval mortality, a presumed key factor affecting population processes in the Apollo butterfly.

AB The immediate movement and behaviour of individuals arriving in novel environments influence long-term survival and population establishment. Studies have previously investigated exploratory behaviour in novel laboratory environments, but never during colonization of natural systems. Experimentally releasing and monitoring animals would allow testing of laboratory and computer-simulation hypotheses. We sequentially released and tracked three adult male brown rats, Rattus norvegicus, on a rat-free island, monitoring their movements hourly for 3 weeks to test laboratory and simulation-generated hypotheses of how animals explore and move in novel environments. We found that (1) individual movements are apparently random; (2) range size increases most rapidly in the first week after arrival; (3) range size is larger than for individuals at high density; (4) movement is mediated by central place foraging behaviour. These findings contradict laboratory hypotheses of nonrandom exploration but support simulation search strategy hypotheses. Random movement and increased ranges at low density have implications for understanding animal colonization dynamics and intercepting invasive species arriving at new locations.

AB Birdsong is an important sexually selected trait, and its acoustic features are socially transmitted in the process of song learning. The preference of some female songbirds for song complexity as measured by repertoire size has driven the evolution of many song traits and song-learning programs in males. If juvenile birds adopt the attractiveness of model birds by copying their repertoires, tutor choice in the early song-learning period should be crucial for future reproductive success. Thus, we hypothesized that the song quality of tutors influences the tutor choice of chicks in the Bengalese finch, Lonchura striata var. domestica. Each subject chick was reared by a foster pair in an individual breeding cage. At around the fledging period, we introduced another unrelated adult male (subtutor) into each cage to simulate the natural social environment in which chicks have opportunities to hear the songs of nonfather males after fledging. Subject chicks learned from both tutors when the total note repertoire size of the two models was small; they tended to learn from the subtutor when the father had a smaller note repertoire size. The acquired note repertoire size was not affected by whether subjects learned songs from the foster father or not. Song learning from the subtutor contributed to a larger note repertoire. Observed patterns in tutor choice, in particular song learning from a subtutor, could be an adaptive strategy that helps chicks compensate for exposure to smaller repertoire size in models.

AB Birds of most species regularly bathe in water, but the function of this behaviour is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that water bathing is important in feather maintenance, and hence should enhance flight performance. We manipulated European starlings', Sturnus vulgaris, access to bathing water in a 2 x 2 design: birds were housed in aviaries either with or without water baths for a minimum of 3 days (long-term access) before being caught and placed in individual cages either with or without water baths for a further 24 h ( short-term access). We subsequently assessed the speed and accuracy of escape flights through an obstacle course of vertical strings. Birds that had bathed in the short-term flew more slowly and hit fewer strings than birds that were deprived of bathing water in the short term, whereas long-term access to bathing water had no significant effect on flight performance. Thus recent access to bathing water alters flight performance by altering the trade-off between escape flight speed and accuracy. We hypothesize that lack of bathing water provision could increase anxiety in captive starlings because of an increase in their perceived vulnerability to predation. This study therefore potentially provides an important functional link between the expression of natural behaviours in captivity and welfare considerations.

AB In birds, the chick's physical state at nest departure is critical for survival, especially for seabirds that shift from a terrestrial to a marine life. The timing of this life history transition should therefore be finely tuned by proximate factors reflecting the relative influence of parents and chicks. Using king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, as a model, we investigated how food provisioning and chick developmental status and/or body condition interact with chick fledging behaviour to optimize the physical state at colony departure. During the month preceding colony departure, movements, developmental status and body condition were compared between naturally and experimentally fed chicks. Parents stopped feeding their moulting, obese chick on average 16 days before colony departure and no offspring anorexia was observed. All chicks left their feeding site at the time of moult end, indicating that complete feather development is a prerequisite for departing. The time between moult end and colony departure reduced both intra- and intergroup variation in body condition at departure, suggesting that this condition was optimized in terms of a trade-off between fat stores and buoyancy. After moult end, chicks increased their locomotor activity and energy expenditure, which contributes to the regulation of body condition. Our results indicate that the cessation of parental feeding does not trigger colony departure. Rather, the timing of departure depends on the chick's physical state, regardless of its recent feeding history. Thus, in king penguins, the parental decision to desert the chick seems to reflect a compromise between the offspring's body condition and its developmental status.

AB Numerous field researchers have described cooperative hunting in social carnivores, but experimental evidence of cooperative problem solving typically derives from laboratory studies of nonhuman primates. We present the first experimental evidence of cooperation in a social carnivore, the spotted hyaena, Crocuta crocuta. Eight captive hyaenas, paired in 13 combinations, coordinated their behaviour temporally and spatially to solve cooperation tasks that modelled group-hunting strategies. Unlike many primates that cooperate infrequently or require extensive shaping, spotted hyaenas displayed a natural aptitude for teamwork: all teams achieved success rapidly, repeatedly, and without specific training. Social influences on cooperative performance included an audience effect that could influence party formation and hunting success in the wild. Performance also varied across dyads, notably with rank-related aggression between partners impairing performance. Efficiency improved as partners increasingly attended to one another and coordinated their actions. Lastly, experienced cooperators modified their behaviour to accommodate a naive companion, using visual monitoring and tracking to promote coordination. We suggest that social carnivores should be considered relevant models for the study of cooperative problem solving, as their abilities provide a comparative framework for testing theories about the mechanisms of social learning and the evolution of intelligence.

AB Adult males of some species of fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) are chemically defended and produce bioluminescent courtship signals while flying in search of females. These signals may have positive or negative consequences unrelated to mating. Eavesdropping Photuris fireflies use bioluminescence to locate and prey on smaller Photinus. We examined whether flash signals of Photinus act as aposematic signals against insectivorous bats. We used field observations of four species of North American bats, diet and controlled behavioural experiments to assess taste aversion and responses to simulated fireflies. Fireflies were absent from the bats' diet even though these species co-occurred at our field sites and bats consumed other coleopterans and firefly-sized prey. Caged bats rejected mealworms coated with homogenized fireflies, and flying bats responded differentially to moving lures based on a combination of flash cues and lure size. Flash signals of fireflies probably operate as aposematic warnings to the common bat, Eptesicus fuscus, supporting the idea that bioluminescent courtship in fireflies operates under competing selective pressures.

AB Many territorial animals, despite being in direct competition for resources such as space, food and mates, show reduced aggression towards their neighbours. This situation is called the Dear Enemy effect. One explanation of the Dear Enemy effect is that it is due to a conditional strategy like Tit for Tat where territory holders cooperate by reducing aggression towards neighbours that also show reduced aggression, but retaliate against aggressive neighbours. Previous research found evidence for such a conditional strategy in migratory species but not in species with long-term association between neighbours, suggesting that long-term neighbours might be engaged in more 'forgiving' strategies. We tested this hypothesis in male song sparrows, Melodia melospiza, which are resident year-round in our population (leading to long-term associations between neighbouring birds) and display the Dear Enemy effect. We found that following a simulated intrusion by a neighbour, song sparrow males responded more strongly to playback of this neighbour than to playback of a neutral neighbour from their respective boundaries, consistent with a conditional retaliation strategy. We suggest that the primary effect of an intrusion by a neighbour might be to increase the perceived risk of cuckoldry by the intruding male, and increased aggression and vigilance towards this neighbour might be a strategy to prevent cuckoldry.

AB The importance of temporal variability in predation risk has recently come to the forefront of research examining the behavioural ecology of predator-prey relationships. Temporal variability has been known to drive patterns of behavioural responses associated with foraging, reproduction and territorial defence of prey animals. We investigated whether larval woodfrog, Rana sylvatica, tadpoles learn to adjust the intensity of their antipredator responses to match (1) the temporal patterns of risk they experience throughout the day and (2) the risk level of a predator. We also examined how tadpoles incorporate temporally conflicting information on the risk posed by the predators. Our results indicate that tadpoles show dynamic adjustments in their behaviour, adjusting their response to predators according to the level of threat associated with the predator and the time of day at which the predator represents the most significant threat. Moreover, tadpoles responded to conflicting information by adjusting their response intensity depending on the nature of the change in vulnerability (whether the risk increased or decreased) and the time that the conflicting information was experienced (whether it was recent or old information). We discuss our results within the context of predator predictability in natural systems and game theory approaches to the behavioural response race between predator and prey.

AB Contextual imitation of intransitive actions within a third-party copying setting was tested in 180 household dogs. A demonstrator dog, in sight of observer dogs, performed one of two trained actions upon hearing verbal commands given by an experimenter. Observer dogs were later tested to see whether they produced more target actions than control groups who had not seen demonstrations of those actions. In all conditions, except one, the demonstrated actions had been previously trained in the observer dogs by their owners, but had been attached to a different verbal command to that used in our study. For these 'pretrained' actions we further investigated whether reward contingency, the relationship of the dog to the human experimenter and ostensive cues had an effect. In no condition did we find any contextual imitation. A subsample of all tested dogs had, during their lifetimes, received extensive training in a diverse range of tasks outside of social learning, but this background similarly did not lead to contextual imitation. We conclude that dogs, even when highly trained, fail to show evidence of contextual imitation for intransitive actions within a third-party copying paradigm.

AB The function of dispersal is best examined in species, such as horses, Equus caballus, where breeding groups' ranges may overlap entirely such that social and spatial dispersal are decoupled. We hypothesized that mares disperse from natal groups to avoid incest, but avoid dispersing spatially, thus revealing the importance of philopatric advantage. We examined dispersal by 97 mares among 26 breeding groups occupying 46 km(2) of the Kaimanawa Ranges, New Zealand, from August 1994 to March 1997. We recorded group membership, location and habitat, mare body condition and reproductive state, and 201 temporary and 135 permanent dispersal events. All mares emigrated from natal groups during a 2-3-year process beginning with sexual maturity in yearlings. Dispersal rates peaked seasonally with sexual receptivity and were highest in 1-2 year olds. Group fidelity was established around 3-4 years of age and mares older than 5 years rarely dispersed. Dispersal and the stability of group membership were not explained by characteristics of breeding groups or their home ranges, or the body condition and maternal status of mares. Groups into which mares immigrated, however, were predicted by their proximity to a mare's previous group. Mares dispersed socially, but favoured philopatry despite competition so long as incest could be avoided. The apparent contradiction whereby females disperse socially but remain spatially philopatric is possible because dispersal to breed can occur without dispersing in space which means that dispersal in space is not obligatory for inbreeding avoidance.

AB For altricial birds, detailed studies of parental care include egg incubation, brooding and chick feeding, all of them being crucial to offspring survival. Few studies have explored nest building and maintenance from this perspective, although the nest is the first environment experienced by hatchlings. On Corsica, blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, incorporate fresh fragments of several species of aromatic plants in the nest cup throughout the nesting period, and replenish the nest with fresh fragments of the same plant species quickly after experimental removal. In this study, we experimentally tested whether aromatic plants used by blue tits affect the growth and condition of nestlings. Because we expected the effects of plants to depend on environmental conditions, we tested this hypothesis both in enlarged and in control broods. Aromatic plants positively affected chick mass gain in enlarged broods. Chicks in nests containing aromatic plants also had higher haematocrit levels. In addition, in 1 of the 2 study years, feathers developed faster in aromatic-treated nests than in nests where aromatic plants had been replaced by a neutral nest material (moss). However, no significant effect of aromatic plants on chick body size at. edging was found. We propose several hypotheses on the proximal mechanisms whereby aromatic plants affect chick growth and condition. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Size-assortative mating is one of the most common mating patterns in nature. Nevertheless, the underlying behavioural mechanisms have received little attention. Assortment is typically assumed to result from mate choice, which can be coupled with differences in competitive potential. We investigated the behavioural mechanisms underlying size-assortative mating in a monogamous, biparental goby cichlid, where mutual mate choice should be expected. We performed three field experiments with females and males of Eretmodus cyanostictus to test for the existence of mate preferences in general and with regard to size: (1) a sequential presentation of differently sized potential partners; (2) a removal of partners combined with surveillance until re-pairing with a new partner; and (3) the simultaneous release of new and original partners on the experimental territories. In the removal experiment, we found evidence for weak preferences for large partners relative to own size and to the original partner's size, but pairs were formed irrespective of these preferences. The ecological importance of being paired appears to reduce choosiness and to override mate preferences. Territory ownership was quickly decided by aggressive interactions between original and new partners, and in both sexes the larger contestant won and was immediately accepted as partner by the resident. Our results suggest that strong intrasexual competition can be a powerful promoter of size-assortative mating even in the absence of active mate choice.

AB Most vertebrates respond to acute stressors with rapid plasma glucocorticoid elevations. Variation within species in this hormonal response should correlate with differences in physiological responses and behavioural tactics, yet this is rarely documented. We measured behavioural and hormonal responses of free-ranging male tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) during staged encounters with a collared lizard predator (Crotaphytus nebrius) or a control (stick). In our study population, males express alternate reproductive tactics that correlate with throat colour pattern: territorial males have a central blue patch on an orange background (OB males) and nonterritorial males lack the blue patch (O males). We also studied a previously uncharacterized male type with a mottled orange and blue throat (M males). A single encounter with an approaching predator initiated an elevation in plasma corticosterone that was similar among the male types (mean +/- SE 9.64 +/- 3.17 (OB), 9.72 +/- 2.49 (O), 10.19 +/- 2.82 (M)). Despite this similarity, male types differed behaviourally. Compared to OB and M males, O males initiated flight when the predator was further away and stayed hidden longer after seeking refuge. The M males showed responses similar to OB males and may functionally be the same morph. Among individuals of all morphs, total corticosterone levels after the predator encounter correlated strongly with their flight initiation distance and hiding duration during the encounter. We conclude that male tree lizards with alternative reproductive tactics show alternative antipredator behavioural tactics, and that individual variation in escape responses is directly correlated with corticosterone levels.

AB Despite decades of theoretical interest in the role of kin recognition in mate choice and nepotism, data on both the mechanisms and functions of recognition are available for only a few species. Even less common are demonstrations of direct causal links between the production and perceptual components of recognition and subsequent social preferences. Belding's ground squirrels, Spermophilus beldingi, produce odours that vary with kinship and can be used to discriminate classes of kin. However, the links between odours, recognition templates and differential treatment of conspecifics have not been shown empirically. Here I examined whether the manipulation of odour recognition templates influences juvenile behaviours. I induced recognition errors by exposing young to odours from a foreign mother before natal emergence. According to phenotype-matching mechanisms, developing young should incorporate all encountered odours into their kin template and later treat individuals matching the template as kin. As in previous studies, the most preferred play partners were littermates, but young also interacted preferentially with juveniles from the foreign family, whose odours were similar to the foreign mother and therefore matched their templates, compared with unfamiliar, unrelated juveniles. This preference for juveniles of the foreign family could not be due to relatedness or direct familiarity prior to emergence. Patterns of nasal investigations mirrored those of play bouts. This is a novel demonstration of a causal link between recognition cues, recognition templates and 'kin'-differentiated behaviours, and highlights the potency of social odours during development on later social dynamics.

AB The expression of most life history traits, such as immunity, growth and the development of sexual signals, is negatively affected by high levels of oxidative stress. Dietary antioxidants can reduce oxidative stress and have therefore been the focus of numerous studies in behavioural and evolutionary ecology in the last few decades. Most of this research has focused on carotenoids, neglecting a number of more common, more potent, and thereby potentially more important, antioxidants, such as polyphenolic antioxidants. However, the effects of several classes of antioxidants on different life history traits have been thoroughly investigated in medical and animal-breeding studies. We suggest that behavioural and evolutionary studies will benefit from incorporating these advances. By reviewing the literature on the effects of antioxidants on life history traits in fish, birds and mammals, we develop a broad framework for dietary antioxidants. Fundamental properties of antioxidants, in particular their biochemistry, their potency and the interactions between them affect their relative relevance for life history traits. Based on tissue affinity, we distinguish between two categories of dietary antioxidants: focal antioxidants that are intrinsically important for a given trait and nonfocal antioxidants that influence traits only indirectly. Furthermore, we show how temporal and spatial environmental variability in antioxidant availability, as well as individual variation in food selection, may generate interindividual differences in the expression of life history traits. Finally, we suggest future research lines and experimental designs that may provide basic information needed to advance our knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary relevance of dietary antioxidants.

AB We studied the behavioural consequences of 'traumatic', painful experiences. These consequences were fundamentally asymmetric. Fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, learned two kinds of prediction regarding a 'traumatic' experience. If an odour preceded an electric shock during training, it predicted shock, and flies subsequently avoided it. When the sequence of events during training was reversed, that is odour followed shock, the odour predicted relief from shock and flies approached it. We call this latter effect 'relief' learning and showed that, in terms of psychological mechanisms, it established genuinely associative conditioned approach behaviour. Parametric analyses showed that relief learning was reproducible across experimenters; it did not depend on the flies' gender and reached asymptotic levels after six training trials. Of five chosen odour-pairs, two supported relief learning at all concentrations tested; for one odour-pair, we observed optimal relief learning at an intermediate odour concentration; for two odour-pairs, relief learning could not be demonstrated. Furthermore, relief learning was maximal with relatively mild shocks, supporting stable retention for the first 2 h after training. Knowledge of these parametric features should aid uncovering relief learning in other experimental systems. In terms of psychological mechanism, context-shock pretraining had no effect on subsequent relief learning, suggesting that it is not mediated by context associations. These analyses may further our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying behavioural changes after traumatic experience. They facilitate research into the neurobiology of pain relief learning, enabling the implementation of truly bioinspired learning rules for technical devices.

AB Previous work has found that adult female brown-headed cowbirds, who do not sing, shape male vocal structure when in restricted housing. The present work extends this finding to a flock setting to examine the role of social behaviour in shaping male vocal development. We housed juvenile males with either adult or juvenile females in large flocks. Over the course of a year, we recorded their song and social behaviour. We found in early autumn that juvenile males housed with adult females improvised more song elements than males housed with juvenile females. During late autumn, we switched the males across female age-class conditions for 6 days. The males switched to the adult female flocks increased the number of improvised elements in their vocal repertoires. Analysis of the sequences of female-male social contact revealed that juvenile females, but not adult females, interacted indiscriminately with the males. Social network measures such as betweenness and closeness centrality further showed that adult females are more selective in their interactions with males than juvenile females. This study suggests a systemic role for selective social behaviour in shaping male vocal development. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The American lobster, Homarus americanus, becomes more aggressive just before moulting. This increased aggression is accompanied by an increase in the blood and urine titres of the moulting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). During combats with conspecifics, lobsters urinate upon each other to signal their aggressive and/or sexual status. We videotaped staged combats between large intermoult nongravid female lobsters exposed to 20-HE, alpha-ecdysone or artificial sea water (ASW) and small nongravid female lobsters that could not smell. The nephropores of both combatants were plugged to prevent urine-release. Aggressive, defensive and avoidance behaviours were ranked according to aggressiveness in a rank of aggression hierarchy, which included opponent-directed and (nonopponent) redirected behaviours. Exposure to 20-HE increased the state of arousal of large lobsters: they performed more highly aggressive behaviours, more defensive and more avoidance behaviours than either alpha-ecdysone-exposed or ASW-exposed lobsters. The small opponents of large 20-HE-exposed lobsters performed more aggressive behaviours. The summed aggressive intensity of all behaviours of both lobsters in a fight was greater in 20-HE fights than in ASW or alpha-ecdysone fights. The difference in aggressive intensity of all behaviours between the 20-HE-exposed lobsters and their opponents was significantly smaller in 20-HE fights than in alpha-ecdysone or ASW fights. Our results indicate that 20-HE exposure alters the agonistic behaviour of a lobster, which then evokes an increase in the aggressive behaviour of an opponent lobster. The findings suggest that 20-HE acts as a pheromone modulating aggressive interactions in lobsters. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although digger wasps are good models for the study of nest site selection, the behaviour of females in relation to time of nest establishment has rarely been considered despite this being the key to discrimination between substrate availability-based and a female attraction-based selection. We carried out a study on nest establishment by the digger wasp Stizus continuus (Klug), giving to all nests dug by the wasps both spatial (nearest neighbour distance to nests, proximity of vegetation, soil hardness) and temporal (day of excavation) attributes. Stizus continuus females dug more nests under bush edges, where the soil was much softer. There was no tendency for females to maximize distance between nests at the moment of establishment. On the contrary, as shown by different nearest neighbour statistics, females preferentially tend to dig close to conspecific nests (if one considers both the whole study area and two subareas free of vegetation and at different times of the nesting season). Moreover, those nests that were active (still provisioned) attracted more females than the inactive nests at the moment of nest establishment. We conclude that female S. continuus are attracted by conspecifics at the moment of nest establishment and that clumped patterns of nests are a result of such social attraction rather than a result of limited available substrate; moreover, such attraction could be better detected when comparative analyses are employed and best at a multiple-scale view.

AB How foraging animals respond to changes in energy costs is poorly understood. Energy costs are especially important for central-place foragers because they determine transit costs as well as foraging costs. For example, oxygen consumption during diving determines the minimum surface pause for a given oxygen store, dive depth and dive duration. A theoretical model based on the marginal value theorem suggests that dive duration should decrease and surface pauses should remain constant when energy expenditure during foraging increases, because divers balance oxygen gains and losses over a dive cycle for a given time at the surface. We tested this hypothesis by increasing hydrodynamic drag on Brunnich's guillemots, Uria lomvia, using wooden blocks attached to their backs. Handicapped guillemots decreased dive duration without altering surface pauses, as expected. This occurred because they increased surface pauses for a given dive depth and duration. The relationship between dive depth and duration and that between bottom time and dive duration did not differ for handicapped and unhandicapped guillemots. Dive duration did not increase and dive depth only slightly increased with sequential dives within a bout. The change in dive depth decreased with the number of dives in the bout and an index of patch quality, suggesting that guillemots maintained a constant dive depth when a high-quality prey patch was encountered. Although increasing energy expenditure altered the relationship between surface pauses and dive duration, it had little effect on time allocation within a dive ( transit time, bottom time).

AB In diverse animal taxa, offspring produce signals that serve the function of soliciting parents to provision care. In birds, such 'begging' signals may consist of vocal and visual displays that influence parental decisions on allocation of critical food resources among the progeny. According to sex allocation theory, parents may gain fitness benefits from favouring offspring of either sex, depending on ecological conditions or parental quality. However, adaptive allocation of care can occur only if parents can identify the sex of their offspring, which, however, appear to be sexually monomorphic in most bird species. Begging displays may be a vehicle of such sex-specific signals. However, only very few studies have investigated sex differences in begging calls and none has analysed sex differences in a main component of begging displays of passerine birds, that is, mouth coloration. In the present study, we show that male nestling barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, have more brightly coloured mouths than their female broodmates early in the nestling period. Sex differences in mouth coloration disappear later in the nestling period when, however, differences in begging calls develop, confirming the results of a previous study. Thus, begging displays carry sex-specific components whose nature ( visual or acoustic) changes during offspring ontogeny and might mediate the differential access of male and female offspring to parental care observed in this species, particularly under adverse rearing conditions.

AB Signals emitted preceding and during combat can aid in sequential assessment of opponent quality and motivation. Signal reliability can be maintained by physical constraints, by costs of production or receiver retaliation, or can be cost-free, when contestants have a common interest. In staged dyadic contests over a shelter, male brown ghost knifefish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, modulate the frequency of their electric organ discharge (EODF) and perform increasingly costly behaviours as fights escalate. Relative body length was the best predictor of fight duration and victory, and although there were initially no differences in electrical signalling rates between contestants, through the course of the interaction ultimate winners made increasingly more abrupt EODF increases ('chirps') and fewer gradual frequency rises ('GFRs') than losers. This is consistent with previous hypotheses that chirps signal aggression and dominance, whereas GFRs indicate submission. However,. ne temporal analysis revealed that both signal types are good predictors of impending attack: paradoxically, just prior to bouts of combat, combat initiators gradually increase EODF significantly more than receivers and continue to do so throughout the bout. We discuss the putative functions of these signals. 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wolf, Canis lupus, recolonization of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem provides a rare opportunity to identify behaviours facilitating coexistence between sympatric canids. We investigated interactions between coyotes, Canis latrans, and recolonizing wolves at ungulate carcasses in Montana's Madison Range. We used a field-experimental study design consisting of a two-level carcass treatment (wolf presence, wolf absence) to assess factors influencing coyote risk assessment, carrion consumption and aggressive encounters with wolves. Socially dominant coyotes (alphas and betas) responded to wolf presence by increasing the proportion of time spent vigilant while scavenging. Vigilance behaviour was more pronounced when scavenging closer to structurally complex vegetation where lateral occlusion inhibited the ability of coyotes to scan for, and possibly escape from, returning wolves. Despite greater time spent vigilant, alpha coyotes consumed the greatest amount of carrion biomass by feeding on carcasses in earlier stages of consumption when organs and large muscle tissues were still present. This finding suggests that alpha coyotes might trade off greater risk for higher-quality food items. Coyotes would aggressively confront wolves: numerical advantage by coyotes and the stage of carcass consumption were influential in determining whether coyotes were able to displace wolves from carcasses. Coyotes relied on a gradient of risk-sensitive behaviours, ranging from elevated vigilance to aggressive confrontation, to manage risk associated with wolf presence. Identification of these behaviours, and their sensitivity to numeric and social factors, is an important step in elucidating mechanisms of resource partitioning in social canids.

AB We investigated spatial organization and patterns of interaction in a population of the little- known striped hyaena, Hyaena hyaena. We use the resulting data to test hypotheses of group formation that predict that female striped hyaenas will be solitary in response to overdispersion of food resources and males will be solitary in response to overdispersion of females. Based primarily on anecdotal or historical information, striped hyaenas have been described as solitary. We show that, as predicted, striped hyaenas of both sexes are behaviourally solitary. However, they form stable, polyandrous spatial groups composed of multiple males and a single female. We suggest that male coalition formation may be the result of male strategies to optimize trade- offs between the number of female ranges defended and the effectiveness of that defence when females are solitary and maintain large territories. Nevertheless, the joint male defence of a territory ( of any size) containing only a single female would not be predicted by any major hypothesis for the evolution of group living, in this or any other species.

DE coloration; countershading; crypsis; predator; prey
ID COLOR; PERCEPTION; PATTERNS
AB Of the many traits seen in cryptic prey animals, countershading (darker pigmentation on those surfaces exposed to the most lighting) is one of the commonest, and paradoxically one of the least understood. Countershading has been hypothesized to enhance crypsis by shadow-obliteration, in which lighter coloration on the undersides compensates for increased shadow in these regions, thus reducing detection by visually hunting predators. We tested the hypothesis that countershading enhances crypsis in two experiments with artificial prey presented to free-living birds. In the first experiment, artificial prey were presented on lawns to a range of bird species. In the second experiment, the prey were presented on green boards to individual blackbirds, Turdus merula. In both experiments countershaded prey had significantly lower levels of predation than controls. Our results show that countershading can enhance cryptic protection and has important implications for the evolutionary ecology of prey defences.

AB The measurement of sociality has been primarily concerned either with the quantification of pairwise associations between individuals or using network approaches to describe multiple relationships between individuals in a group. However, these approaches may not be appropriate or necessary for all studies, for instance, where group dynamics are more biologically relevant than individual associations or interactions. Such a case occurs when the changes to a number of different social groups are to be compared over varying temporal and spatial scales. Methods for assessing comparative group dynamics have been conspicuously lacking from the biologist's toolbox. Here, we investigated the suitability of indexes derived from quantification of diversity as methods for direct quantification of changes in social group composition. First, we specified the requirements of a suitable index for social stability, then we reviewed indexes available for such a task, examining their suitability, through tests of their mathematical properties, in this new context. Finally, we used the specific model of the breeding female grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, on North Rona, Scotland to conclude that the Jaccard index is the most suitable tool for quantifying social stability in this system. We advocated that this approach can offer advantages in any study where social stability rather than any specific interaction is the principal focus.

AB We examined variation in the echolocation calls of Brazilian free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis, on a broad geographical scale and in response to local environmental variables. Significant differences in call structure were observed among populations throughout the species range in the United States, but this variation was not associated with geographical distance or local weather conditions. Observed variability between sites was primarily due to differences between bats, and the flexibility in call structure that can be achieved by individuals. During this study, we observed that bats recorded in the presence of highfrequency sounds from chorusing insects used higher call frequencies than bats recorded in silence. This led us to test the hypothesis that bats adjust echolocation call structure in response to local ambient noise. We broadcast experimentally manipulated ultrasonic insect sounds to free-flying Brazilian free-tailed bats and found a positive correlation between the frequency of the insect sound stimulus and the call frequencies used by bats. These results document that bats adjust echolocation call structure to avoid acoustic interference from ambient noise in their local environment.

AB How animals use space has important consequences for feeding ecology, social organization, mating strategies and conservation management. In white rhinoceros, female home ranges are much larger than male territories, suggesting that movement patterns are influenced by factors other than resource distribution. In this study we placed radiotransmitters on 15 female white rhinoceros, recording 1758 locations and collecting behavioural data during 1671 observation sessions, making this the largest data set of its kind in this species. We investigated how habitat variables and male territories influenced female movement and reproductive behaviour. Female home ranges were approximately 20 km(2) and core areas were 5 km(2), with male territories roughly the same size as female core areas. Female range size did not vary with season, but the pattern of space use did vary. Females used grassland habitat preferentially, utilizing these areas significantly more than expected based on availability. Findings relevant to the mating strategy include: (1) the amount of grassland in a male's territory predicted female use of the territory; (2) the time that a female spent in a male's territory was a significant predictor of reproductive activity with the male, indicating that females probably mate with the most familiar male; and (3) the temporal pattern of female space use suggests that females did not increase mate sampling behaviour nor did they become more choosy about which males they visited when reproductively active. These findings suggest that males may maximize reproductive success by defending areas containing more grassland habitat. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behavior.

AB Like other areas of animal science, the study of animal behaviour is becoming increasingly subject to ethical regulation and legislation. Sensible and well-informed regulation is to be welcomed both on compassionate grounds and because misuse of animals is likely to compromise the science itself. However, it is evident that much of the impetus and direction in the regulation debate is coming from one particular corner of animal science: that concerned with utilitarian and commercial interests taking place in controlled laboratory environments. This is sustained by an overemphasis on potential medical benefits as the perceived key selling point for animal science to a hostile public. Such a bias risks potentially unfortunate consequences for wider aspects of animal science, and is unlikely to serve the best welfare interests of animals when viewed from their own biological perspective. I review some of the concerns that arise from this, and suggest that the study of animal behaviour has a uniquely important role to play both in the development of animal welfare science itself and in the public debate about the regulation of animal science as a whole.

AB We evaluated four factors that may influence the process of male natal dispersal in wild female-philopatric blue monkeys: aggressive eviction by adults, attraction to oestrous females, social integration in the natal group and survivorship risk. Observations of nine males and. ve females of dispersal age allowed us to compare the social behaviour of males and females and that of dispersing and nondispersing males. We also studied the circumstances of 26 natal dispersals ( 1997-2006). Aggressive eviction did not appear to be important in most dispersals. We found no significant differences in rates or types of aggression received by juvenile females and males or by dispersing and nondispersing males. Sexual attraction also did not appear to influence dispersal, because males did not disperse more often than expected by chance during conception seasons or during breeding-season influxes of males. Our results con. rm low social integration as a correlate of sex-biased dispersal. Juvenile males groomed and sat in contact with groupmates significantly less than females did, although we found few differences between dispersing and nondispersing males. Our results also suggest that males timed dispersals to minimize risks, because dispersal was most likely to occur during months of low rainfall and least likely to occur when fruit was least available. Endogenous factors are probably important in stimulating dispersal, because all males disperse but females never do. Although aggressive eviction may occasionally influence the dispersal process in blue monkeys, given their unimale group structure, our results implicate social integration much more uniformly and strongly.

AB Long-tailed dance flies, Rhamphomyia longicauda (Diptera : Empididae), show a striking reversal in the typical pattern of animal sexual dimorphism. Whereas male R. longicauda are mosquito-like in appearance, females sport rows of scales on their legs and have elaborate eversible pleural (abdominal) sacs that are inflated just prior to entry into a female competitive mating swarm. Both sets of ornaments appear to exaggerate female size to choosy males ascending through the swarm. To explain previous results showing a female bias in R. longicauda caught in spider webs near swarm sites, we hypothesized that females either encounter spider webs more frequently than do males because female flight patterns are more risky (e. g. there are usually more flying females than males in mating swarms) or that the ornaments per se inhibit escape from webs. We tested the hypothesis that female ornaments are an encumbrance and we provide evidence that secondary sexual devices hinder escape from predators. We also briefly discuss the implications of sex-biased mortality for male mating preferences and the evolutionary maintenance of female ornaments.

AB Although many animals use refuges to avoid predators, it is often costly to do so. The longer an individual remains in a refuge, the less time it has available for other essential activities, such as foraging and mate searching. Animals should therefore optimize the time spent in a refuge after an attack by adopting a flexible approach to predator avoidance. I examined refuge use in the fiddler crab, Uca mjoebergi, under variable foraging and mating contexts on a mudflat in Australia. There were no sex or size differences in refuge use, suggesting that there are no morphological or gender biases in predation risk. Risk-taking behaviour in U. mjoebergi was, however, highly flexible and appeared to be strongly dependent on the trade-off between the costs and benefits of hiding. Refuge use varied between optimal foraging and reproductive periods of a semilunar cycle. Loss of foraging time influenced risk-taking behaviour in both males and females since both were quicker to re-emerge when food levels were high. During the reproductive period, crabs took longer to re-emerge because of few foraging opportunities, as well as few mating opportunities since receptive females were rare. However, when mating opportunities for males were experimentally increased by introducing a tethered female, actively courting males engaged in highly risky behaviour and re-emerged after a few seconds, with some males abandoning refuge use completely. Refuge use in U. mjoebergi is therefore highly flexible, with the decision to re-emerge influenced by fitness benefits. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Several benefits may be gained from staggered hatching in birds but asynchrony sometimes appears to cause unnecessary starvation of the youngest nestlings. We present a solution to this paradox by suggesting that foraging parents are sometimes constrained by complex interactions between prey size, energy demands and foraging efficiency (the feeding constraint hypothesis). The requirement to provide smaller nestlings with small and soft food items while at the same time satisfying the greater food demands of larger nestlings may cause a conflict that results in the starvation of junior siblings. We examined the hypothesis in a field experiment where pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, were video filmed while provisioning synchronous and asynchronous broods. Prey size and load size increased with nestling age suggesting that larger prey were more profitable to bring to the nest than smaller prey. Although small nestlings had difficulty swallowing large prey, parents of asynchronous broods brought large items suitable for the size of the older nestlings. Hence, junior nestlings suffered from reduced growth and increased mortality. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Decreased risk of predation is a key benefit of group living, and selfish herd theory predicts competition for the relative safety of central positions. Spatial position also affects behaviour, as individuals trade-off their feeding and vigilance to mitigate the risk of predation. Female eiders, Somateria mollissima, often pool their broods and share brood rearing, and anti-predatory vigilance is a core parental care activity. Females are assumed to trade-off vigilance and feeding, as efficient recovery of condition is crucial for energetically stressed postincubating females. Evidence shows that a female's own ducklings are closer to her than unrelated young in amalgamated broods and that predation of ducklings by gulls is edge biased, so a female's spatial position should correlate with the survival prospects of her brood. We identified determinants of female spatial position (aggression, structural size, body weight, age, clutch size) within multifemale brood-rearing coalitions, and explored whether spatial position affected female activities. Female aggression frequency was the only significant predictor of centrality in brood-rearing coalitions, and female age was positively associated with aggression. Investment in vigilance, but not investment in feeding, increased with spatial centrality; instead, central females devoted less time to other activities (resting, preening and moving). We conclude that central eider females do not need to trade-off vigilance and feeding. Heavy body weight did not guarantee a favourable position in brood-rearing coalitions, which may help explain our previous finding that female eiders in best body condition when their brood hatches tend their brood alone.

AB It is widely known that the adverse effects of stress must be considered in animal conservation programmes. However, a full consideration of how and where stress occurs in animal conservation programmes has not been undertaken, especially in translocation and reintroduction programmes. The literature concerning these types of programmes shows high levels of mortality, despite researchers' consideration of the effects of stress. However, an analysis of the literature shows that many conservation biologists have only a superficial knowledge about stress. For example, most do not understand the importance of subclinical stress or the fact that the effect of successive stressors can be additive or accumulative. While most conservation biologists know that stress is bad for animal health, few have considered its adverse effects on cognitive abilities, which an animal needs to survive in the wild (e.g. memory). In this paper we conclude with suggestions for improving the efficiency of animal conservation programmes in terms of the number of animals surviving after reintroduction or translocation. The most important conclusion from this review of the literature is that there needs to be a greater interchange of information between animal welfare and animal conservation scientists.

AB We examined the ability of Trigona recursa, a scent trail-laying stingless bee, to allocate foragers to the more profitable of two food sources. Imbibing time and imbibed volume of individuals were the same at feeders containing 20% or 40% w/w (weight in weight) sugar solution. However, sugar intake rate and sugar per crop load were significantly higher for the 40% solution, which was therefore more profitable. Collective foraging of two colonies was observed without interference with the recruitment process. One bee was trained to a 20% food source and another at the same time to a 40% source. Recruitment to both food sources started simultaneously. In all trials the majority of recruits landed at the 40% food source. This cannot be the result of bees comparing the two sugar concentrations because less than 1% of the recruits landed at both feeders. When we offered the 20% food source 90 min before the 40% source, the newcomers at the 40% food source never outnumbered the newcomers at the 20% source. Significantly more recruits landed at the less profitable food source. This is likely to be caused by a positive feedback resulting from the large number of bees that had already exploited the poor source and reinforced the scent trail. New recruits presumably selected the more intensively marked trail, neglecting the new and weakly marked one that would lead them to the richer food.

AB In monogamous and migratory birds that do not have continuous pair bonds throughout the year, an important cost of mate fidelity is waiting for the previous mate at the breeding site. Assessment of new mates, however, also requires time and energy investment. We analysed the behaviour of common terns during the mating period in the light of this conflict. We predicted that mating behaviour should effect spatial and temporal patterns of movements within the colony site. Therefore, we analysed attendance of transponder-marked individuals at resting places during courtship, supplemented by courtship observations. We found clear differences in the spatial behaviour depending on sex, breeding experience and mate fidelity. Females used more sites than males did, first-time breeders more than experienced breeders and unfaithful birds more than faithful ones. These results indicate a stronger affinity of males, experienced and faithful birds to their territory. Furthermore, we detected seasonal changes in attendance during courtship. The number of courtship partners was independent of sex or experience, but tended to decrease with increasing pair bond duration. Courtship behaviour differed between temporary partners and final pair mates. Our results support the hypothesis that common terns search for a mate immediately after arriving at the colony site without waiting for their, possibly delayed, previous mate, but with the option to switch back if it returns within a given period. Consequently, the time costs seem to outweigh the energy costs for a potentially unnecessary mate assessment. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Because of their constantly dark habitat and microphthalmia, subterranean African mole-rats have hitherto been considered as blind. Recent morphological findings, however, revealed a qualitatively rather well-developed, although quantitatively reduced, visual system and questioned the prevailing idea of blindness. We investigated the reactions of Zambian mole-rats of the bathyergid genus Fukomys (formerly Cryptomys) to white light during nest building. Using a two-armed test chamber with a choice between strong halogen light and darkness, we found that mole-rat pairs avoided the illuminated chamber and nested significantly more often in the dark box. With the same protocol in an eight-armed maze, we confirmed this heliophobic (or scotophilic) behaviour under natural daylight conditions. Zambian mole-rats can thus perceive natural light intensities and use photic information, for example to decide where to nest.

AB The dominance score (number of wins divided by the total number of interactions) is the most widely used procedure in field studies to rank individuals. Its reliability depends on the number of interactions on which it is calculated. However, most authors use it without any estimate of the associated error. We describe the precision associated with a dominance score estimate as a function of the number of interactions on which it is based, and hence provide a tool to plan field protocols and effort. The precision error decreases according to a power function with increasing number of interactions, but with more precision for extreme scores for any given number of interactions. We discuss the fact that the minimum number of interactions should be based on the precision associated with the 50% score, the least precise of all scores. We also emphasize the trade-off between recording effort and precision of the estimator, and give an example of our choice of 26 interactions for fieldwork on ducks and geese. When comparing individual ranks based on dominance scores with ranks given by the dominance matrix, we found a good correlation, with more mismatches around the middle of the hierarchy. This was consistent with the precision calculated with our model. We conclude that dominance score is a reliable tool, but conclusions must take into account the number of interactions on which the calculations are done. We also discuss the importance of initial assumptions and sources of bias in field studies. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The house gecko Hemidactylus frenatus is currently displacing an ecologically similar, all-female parthenogenetic gecko H. garnotii on a global scale. We tested the previously proposed hypotheses that resource competition is responsible for this displacement, and that competitive interference occurs through male aggression. We quantified consumption of insect resources and behavioural interactions in dyads and triads composed of different combinations of sexes and species. Geckos consumed fewer insects when in pairs than when they were alone, indicating general evidence of resource competition. However, resource consumption of parthenogenetic H. garnotii was not negatively affected by the presence of invasive H. frenatus, suggesting that resource competition is not the primary mechanism of displacement. Males were aggressive towards conspecific males, but showed little aggression towards conspecific females and parthenogenetic females; females and parthenogens displayed little aggression. Male H. frenatus courted and copulated with both conspecific and heterospecific females in dyads and in triads and, by some measures, showed a preference for larger H. garnotii females. When paired with females or parthenogens, males consumed fewer resources because they turned their attention to courtship. Evidence of interspecific courtship suggests that sexual interference may be a more likely mechanism of displacement. Our results exclude the possibility that courtship decreases resource consumption in H. garnotii, but further study is required to determine whether interspecific mating disrupts parthenogenetic reproduction. This study demonstrates the importance of testing commonly invoked mechanisms of invasion and displacement by quantifying individual behaviour in an experimental setting.

AB Models of vigilance in groups usually assume instantaneous randomness in scan initiation and sequential randomness in the duration of successive interscans, thus predicting a negative exponential distribution of interscan durations and no predictability in the duration of successive interscans. However, recent models suggest that scanning should instead occur regularly rather than randomly when foragers are threatened by nonobservant predators, thus predicting interscans of constant duration and predictable interscan sequences. I examined whether vigilance patterns departed from instantaneous and sequential randomness in greater flamingos wintering in a tropical lagoon complex in Venezuela. Predation risk in this large species is almost nonexistent, and it is argued that disturbance by people, the most probable threat, should best be detected using a regular pattern of scanning. As predicted, the distribution of interscan durations showed a strong central tendency and differed significantly from the expected negative exponential distribution. Interscan intervals of similar duration occurred in succession more often than predicted by chance. Despite obvious departures from instantaneous and sequential randomness, substantial variability remained in the distribution of interscan durations, and several interscan sequences were quite unpredictable. I relate these findings to potential variation in food supply within the confine of a flock and preemptive scans to detect potential threats.

AB In social groups, subordinates may gain dominant breeding status either by inheriting the top position in their current group or by dispersing to join a new group. The pathway to breeder status is likely to vary between males and females as a result of sex differences in the costs of dispersal and inbreeding. We report results from a field study conducted to explore sex differences in the rates of territory joining and inheritance in a cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. We experimentally created 34 breeding vacancies and investigated the effects of breeder removal on the degree of cooperative behaviour and how changes in status influenced reproductive physiology. We found that 71% of male vacancies were filled by joiners (incoming fish, not previously members of the group) entering the territory. In contrast, only 15% of female vacancies were filled by joiners entering the group from elsewhere. Helpers increased their frequency of cooperative behaviour following the removal of a female breeder, but not following removal of a male breeder. Our results suggest that female breeder vacancies are typically filled by subordinate helpers who inherit from within the group and that male breeder vacancies are commonly filled by joining individuals (existing breeders or former helpers from other groups). Male social status and gonadal investment were positively correlated. This study represents one of the first experimental attempts to examine sexual differences in the pathway to breeding status in a cooperatively breeding species.

AB Over the last two decades a large number of experiments have been conducted in which two conspecifics, mainly vertebrates, could obtain rewards through cooperation. At least three different motivations to perform such experiments can be distinguished: (1) detecting the mechanistic basis of naturally occurring forms of cooperation; (2) analysing behavioural strategies specific to cooperation; and (3) testing game-theoretical models. Experimenters in the latter two categories, on which this review concentrates, make use of highly artificial devices. The impression of cooperation in the third category is created because two animals are tested simultaneously after having been trained to interact with an apparatus individually before the experiment. These results can be explained most parsimoniously as the product of instrumental ('trialand-error') learning, hence my label 'instrumental cooperation'. The underlying philosophy of several studies is reminiscent of the strongly disputed ideas of the 'behaviourist school'. Results from experiments in the second category highlight the importance of communication; therefore I call thin 'communicative cooperation'. The crucial role of communication identified by studies in the second category calls into question the relevance of the most popular paradigm used in the third category, the two-player Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Its stringent conditions, which are hardly ever fulfilled in nature, are very difficult to fulfil in experiments too. I propose that future studies concentrate on experiments that emphasize the role of communication and partner choice with the aim of explaining the emergence and maintenance of naturally occurring forms of cooperation.

AB Females of many species preferentially mate with males that produce courtship displays at a high intensity or rate; however, males do not always display at their maximum intensity during courtship. Evidence suggests that this behaviour may be adaptive in satin bowerbirds, because overly intense displays can disrupt courtship by startling females. Females signal the display intensity that they will tolerate from a male; males that respond by adjusting their intensity reduce the likelihood of startling females and increase their courtship success. However, even the most responsive males occasionally startle females. When this occurs, males could avoid further threat to females by decreasing the intensity of their subsequent displays. We used robotic female bowerbirds that mimicked female startling to test the hypothesis that males reduce the intensity of their courtship displays after startling females. Supporting this hypothesis, males displayed at significantly lower intensity after robots were startled in experimental treatments than when they were not startled in control treatments. We found no evidence that the degree of male response to startling was related to male courtship success. In spite of evidence that female bowerbirds prefer the most intensely displaying males as mates, we found that males did not always display at maximum intensity, but rather reduced their intensity in response to female startling during courtship. Our results suggest that males adjust the level of expression of their display traits in response to female behaviours during courtship, and by doing so, males may increase their chances for successful courtship.

AB Resident killer whales off British Columbia form four acoustically distinct clans, each with a unique dialect of discrete pulsed calls. Three clans belong to the northern and one to the southern community. Resident killer whales also produce tonal whistles, which play an important role in close-range communication within the northern community. However, there has been no comparative analysis of repertoires of whistles across clans. We investigated the structural characteristics, stability and group specificity of whistles in resident killer whales off British Columbia. Acoustic recordings and behavioural observations were made between 1978 and 2003. Whistles were classified spectrographically and additional observers were used to confirm our classification. Whistles were compared across clans using discriminant function analysis. We found 11 types of stereotyped whistles in the northern and four in the southern community with some of the whistle types being stable over at least 13 years. In northern residents, 10 of the 11 whistle types were structurally identical in two of the three acoustic clans, whereas the whistle types of southern residents differed clearly from those of the northern residents. Our study shows that killer whales that have no overlap in their call repertoire use essentially the same set of stereotyped whistles. Shared stereotyped whistles might provide a community-level means of recognition that facilitates association and affiliation of members of different clans, which otherwise use distinct signals. We further suggest that vocal learning between groups plays an important role in the transmission of whistle types. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In the evolution of species recognition mechanisms, the differential reactions of receivers towards a signal may be as important as variation in the signal features. In many animals, the auditory system's most sensitive range often matches the dominant frequency range of the signals. The degree of spectral matching, however, can be modified by stimulus intensity and, therefore, patterns detected in the laboratory should ideally be confirmed by field experiments. Territorial males of the dart-poison frog, Epipedobates femoralis, approach vocally active conspecific intruders. Since phonotaxis (followed by fighting) affects male fitness, the auditory system is predicted to discriminate against heterospecific calls. We tested the role of spectral and temporal call features in call discrimination by conducting playback experiments in the field with synthetic calls. To study the effect of heterospecific interference on the male's phonotactic reaction, we measured signal parameters and signalling activity of four sympatric species. The highest probability of response coincided with the spectral and temporal features of the population's advertisement call and the probability of approach was matched to the average frequency of this call. In addition, the degree of matching was sensitive to the number of notes per call. The decrease in the probability of response, however, was steeper at lower than average frequencies, where the probability of heterospecific interference was highest. Our results suggest that under field conditions frequency tuning interacts with temporal call features in maximizing the detection of conspecific signals and reducing the probability of heterospecific interference.

AB In this paper we focus on the potential advantage song repertoires may provide in singing interactions between two birds. We have previously shown that neighbouring song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, in our population countersing with shared songs: a bird escalates an interaction by replying with the same song type his neighbour just sang ('type matching'), or sends a directed but less threatening signal by replying with a different but still shared song ('repertoire matching'). In the present study we tested and confirmed two predictions: (1) that a bird would be more likely to perceive a neighbour's song as directed at him if it was shared than if it was unshared; (2) that an unshared song would be a more effective de-escalation signal than a shared song. In the first of two playback experiments, subjects responded with shorter latencies to neighbours' shared songs than to their unshared songs. In the second, 'interactive' playback experiment, a playback trial began when the subject sang a shared song type. We replied with the neighbour's matching type (an escalation signal), until the subject approached, and then switched to either a different shared song (a 'repertoire match') or to an unshared song. As predicted, subjects responded less aggressively and departed sooner when the switch was to an unshared song than when it was to a shared song.

AB We examined the effects of infection by the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta on mate choice in a wild strain of grain beetle, Tenebrio molitor. Female beetles mate multiply, so both precopulatory and postcopulatory behaviours are important to sexual selection in this species. When virgin females were allowed to choose between tethered males, one infected and one noninfected, they spent more time near and copulated more often with noninfected males than with infected males. During the 90-min trials, the majority (65%) of control females, presented with two noninfected males, copulated with both males at least once. However, females presented with one infected and one noninfected male were much less likely (30%) to be polyandrous. Among monogamous females, 81% mated exclusively with the noninfected male. Within the group of polyandrous females, contact with the second male was made earlier for those that copulated first with the infected male. Mass of males also influenced female remating behaviour. Females that first mated with larger males copulated fewer times than females that mated with smaller males. Infected males were not less sexually responsive than noninfected males, so these results are consistent with female mate choice. Overall, these results demonstrate that female beetles prefer noninfected males in both precopulatory and postcopulatory choice. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Every studied animal engages in sleep, and many animals spend much of their lives in this vulnerable behavioural state. We believe that an explicit description of this vulnerability will provide many insights into both the function and architecture (or organization) of sleep. Early studies of sleep recognized this idea, but it has been largely overlooked during the last 20 years. We critically evaluate early models that suggested that the function of sleep is antipredator in nature, and outline a new model in which we argue that whole-brain or 'blackout' sleep may be the safest way to sleep given a functionally interconnected brain. Early comparative work also suggested that the predatory environment is an important determinant of sleep architecture. For example, species that sleep in risky environments spend less time in the relatively vulnerable states of sleep. Recent experimental work suggests that mammals and birds shift to relatively vigilant (lighter) states of sleep in response to an increase in perceived risk; these results mirror the influence of stress on sleep in humans and rats. We also outline a conceptual model of sleep architecture in which dynamic changes in sleep states reflect a trade-off between the benefits of reducing a sleep debt and the cost of predation. Overall, many aspects of plasticity in sleep related to predation risk require further study, as do the ways in which sleeping animals monitor predatory threats. More work outside of the dominant mammalian paradigm in sleep is also needed.

AB Creching behaviour in penguins is defined as the rearing of chicks by their own parents in large flocks called 'creches'. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the behaviour, the factors inducing chicks to aggregate remain relatively poorly understood, in particular for colonial seabirds. We studied creching behaviour in the king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, by looking at the dynamics of creche formation and possible costs and benefits associated with this strategy. Creches increased in size but declined in number throughout the austral winter. They were located preferentially in the central parts of the colony. Lone chicks suffered the most aggression from unrelated adults, whereas chicks in a creche suffered the least. Chicks attacked by unrelated adults preferentially joined a creche. Adult aggression appeared to be a major factor inducing creching behaviour. Chicks at the periphery of a creche were more vigilant while sleeping, as measured by eye openings. Creches seemed to occasion intense competition among chicks for access to the centre. Chicks in poor condition were attacked and pushed to the periphery of the creche, where they were preyed on by giant petrels. During harsh weather conditions, chicks amalgamated into larger creches, tolerated lower interindividual distances and turned their backs to the wind and rain. Our results accord with the idea that creching behaviour in king penguins is a strategy that protects chicks from adult aggression, predation and severe weather.

AB African elephants, Loxodonta africana, are well known for their use of a low-frequency 'rumble' vocalization, which is thought to function in long-distance communication. Less work, however, has been conducted on short-distance communication within groups, and on spontaneously occurring vocal exchanges among identified individuals in particular. This is due in part to the fact that low-frequency rumbles are difficult to assign to individual callers. We collected vocal data on a group of six female African elephants housed at Disney's Animal Kingdom to determine whether they exchange rumbles in alternating sequences (also known as antiphonal calling). Subjects wore collars outfitted with microphones and radiotransmitters that allowed identification of individual callers, and behavioural and endocrine data were collected so that vocal activity could be examined in the context of social behaviour and reproductive state. First, we found that females did not produce rumbles at random, but were nearly twice as likely to produce rumbles shortly after rumbles from other group members. Second, the relative dominance rank and reproductive state of callers did not affect the probability of vocal response, but affiliative relationship with the caller had a strong influence on rumble response. Females were most likely to respond in kind to the rumbles of their most affiliated partners compared to less affiliated group members. Third, video analysis showed that rumble exchanges occurred in variable contexts, including when animals were out of contact, during reunions, and while in close proximity. Also, affiliated partners often vocalized in sequence when approached by dominant individuals. The results of these analyses show that affiliated female African elephants exchange rumbles antiphonally, and imply multiple functions for such vocal exchanges.

AB An adult female orang-utan used an untutored series of physical manipulations to guide humans to food placed beyond her reach. Through a series of experiments that involved different visual occlusions, this orang-utan appeared to take into account humans' visual states when using them to retrieve inaccessible goals. These data suggest that she was able to use her experience with visual barriers to model the visual perspective of visually impaired humans in a manner similar to that of 2- to 3-year-old human children.

   EVOLUTION; SURVIVAL; SIZE
AB In eusocial invertebrates, queens commonly show morphological and behavioural modifications to their role as the principal breeders in their colonies. With the exception of naked mole-rats, Heterocephalus glaber, morphological modification of breeders has yet to be shown in cooperative vertebrates, but the behaviour of dominant individuals may be modified so as to maximize reproductive success. We studied the cooperative behaviour of dominant and subordinate adults in meerkats, Suricata suricatta, and found that the decision rules governing the contributions of dominant breeders differed from those of subordinate helpers. Dominant breeders contributed less than adult helpers to babysitting and pup feeding, but raised their individual contributions to pup care to a greater extent when helper:pup ratios were low. In contrast to subordinates, dominant breeders did not increase their contributions when they foraged successfully. Finally, while subordinates of both sexes assisted in rearing the young when dominants bred, dominant females contributed little when subordinates attempted to breed, and male helpers (but not females) reduced their contributions to the care of pups. Our results suggest that the division of labour between breeders and helpers in meerkats is intermediate between that of facultatively cooperative species, where parents are principally responsible for rearing young, and that of specialized eusocial species, which show a well-defined division of labour between breeders and workers.

AB Social insects often show an extreme reproductive skew. In queenless ants, colonies consist of morphologically identical workers that can all potentially reproduce sexually. Similarly to that in social vertebrates, aggression in these ants functions to select the reproductive(s). We investigated the mechanisms underlying reproductive skew in the monogynous queenless ant Streblognathus peetersi. Behavioural observations of disturbed hierarchies were integrated with physiological measures of fertility (vitellogenin titre in the haemolymph) and chemical analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons, which are putative fertility pheromones. This multifaceted approach revealed that the colony reproductive is determined as a result of aggression between high-ranking workers, but once an alpha is established, chemical signalling is enough to maintain reproductive skew. As already reported in several species of ants and also in a social wasp, egg layers have distinct profiles of cuticular hydrocarbons compared with infertile workers. Importantly, 'high rankers' who are unable to lay eggs also have a specific cuticular profile; this is consistent with their intermediate state of fertility indicated by vitellogenin levels. Rather than just ovarian activity, the cuticular hydrocarbon profile thus reveals the individual hormonal state that underlies reproductive activity. We compare the fertility signal in queenless ants with the `badge of status' reported in various birds. We discuss the evolutionary stability of this communication system and give special emphasis to ecological constraints and the high degree of intracolonial relatedness typical of social insects.

AB We developed a method to assess the substitutability of two reinforcers by using the divergence of the cross point of two demand functions. Two kinds of water were used as reinforcers, namely distilled water and quinine water. We tested 16 rats, Rattus norvegicus, from two strains in a closed economy. A single demand function for each kind of water was established. Then, two reinforcers were presented on concurrent fixed-ratio schedules. Finally, a control condition with distilled water for both responses was run. Demand functions were generated on scales with fixed-ratio values on the X axis and number of reinforcers obtained on the Y axis. The cross point of the functions differed significantly between the two strains of rats in both conditions within each condition. Furthermore, there was a significant difference within strains between the conditions. On evaluating the single demand functions, we found a significant difference between the slopes of the two demand functions, but no strain differences in demand. In addition, the results revealed a disagreement between demand assessed by using the slope of the single demand function and the results using the double demand function, with the results of the double demand function being in accordance with simple choice behaviour of the rats in their home environment. Using the cross point of two demand functions provides a measure of substitutability and, furthermore, the method appears to be a more sensitive measure of animal priorities than single demand functions.

Females produced ultrasonic vocalizations at higher rates when they were reunited with a familiar conspecific if one member of the reunited pair had eaten an unfamiliar food while the pair members were separated. However, the influence of demonstrator rats on food choices of their observers was as great in pairs of rats that had been devocalized surgically as it was in sham-operated controls.

AB In mammals, the duration of lactation varies much more than other life history parameters in relation to body mass, both within and between species. The causes of this variation are poorly understood and seem to result from varying conditions of mothers and young. We studied the effect of long-term maternal food restriction on litter mass at birth, duration of lactation and offspring development in the precocial guinea pig. Mild experimental food restriction during reproduction resulted in prolonged nursing behaviour of mothers. Evidence for a threshold mass at weaning was, however, equivocal. In the guinea pig, benefits of prolonged lactation prove hard to understand, because nutritional benefits are minor. Independently of maternal food regime, pups terminated suckling attempts several days after mothers ceased nursing behaviour. The time between the last nursing behaviour and the last suckling attempts was not longer in litters with higher need, that is, in litters of food-restricted females, than in litters of females fed ad libitum. Under food restriction, mothers maintained their own body mass, leading in pups to lower mass at birth, reduced postnatal growth and lower body mass at maturity. Guinea pig mothers appear to be selected to value their own condition more than that of a litter. We suggest that lengthening of the nursing period under poor conditions is a life history response primarily of precocial mammals. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Several studies have shown that inbreeding causes low hatching success. However, it is not always clear under which parental genetic characteristics hatching failure occurs. We examined the effects of parental homozygosity and parental genetic similarity on egg hatchability in the spotless starling. We evaluated whether low hatchability was a consequence of genetic similarity of the parents producing a zygote or because the parents themselves had reduced fertility because of their own genetic characteristics. We found a significant detrimental effect of both highest and lowest female homozygosity on hatchability. Parental genetic similarity was negatively related to egg hatchability. In contrast, we found no significant effect of male homozygosity on hatching success. Our results suggest that effects of homozygosity on hatching success may be relevant even in populations of abundant and colonial wild bird species without geographical barriers that could limit. immigration or dispersal. We also highlight the importance of the analyses of male and female homozygosity and parental genetic similarity when investigating related fitness consequences of inbreeding.

AB In the majority of cooperatively breeding bird species, subordinates help the dominant pair to provision the young, regardless of the origin of groups and relatedness between members. Within the family that includes speckled warblers, Chthonicola sagittata, there is considerable variation in social organization and parental behaviour, but the societies of other group-living species in this family are of kin, and subordinates provision the young of breeders. Speckled warblers differ in that offspring are never philopatric, and breeding groups comprise unrelated individuals. We used behavioural observations and DNA fingerprinting to examine genetic parentage and the mating system of the group-living speckled warbler in Canberra, Australia. Speckled warblers breed as pairs or in trios consisting of a female with two males. Alpha males are socially dominant to beta males and maintain dominance through aggression. Beta males never helped to feed nestlings or fledglings, even though they competed for copulations and in one case gained paternity of two of three young in a brood. The social system is therefore polyandrous but not cooperative. As well as competing for copulations with females on their own territories, beta males and single males (those that had lost their breeding partner) regularly undertook extraterritorial forays, most often when the neighbouring female was fertile. Failure by beta males to help even with broods containing their own offspring may be adaptive in this species and may result from increased opportunity for extrapair fertilizations or enhancement of prospects for future reproduction through the formation of alliances with females.

AB Divergent mate choice patterns between populations may lead to premating isolation and speciation. However, similar or identical mate choice patterns may also constrain phenotypic divergence, although not necessarily genetic divergence, across populations. We examined spectral characteristics necessary for male mate choice of abstract female models in sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, in experiments conducted on the breeding grounds and under controlled conditions in the wild. Males preferentially selected and spawned with models with a red hue, the predominant colour of females. Small changes in wavelength, saturation and brightness affected preference. Sexually naive males showed the same preference as experienced males, suggesting that a preference for red hue might be innate. We discuss these results in relation to female colour, the transmission environment and the visual physiology of salmon to evaluate further the possible role of a pre-existing bias for red in the evolution of red breeding colour in nonanadromous (kokanee) salmon. Our results suggest that a sensory bias can account for the re-emergence of red in kokanee, after its loss during the initial development of a freshwater morph.

AB We present behavioural data demonstrating that the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, and the northern long-eared bat, M. septentrionalis, can glean prey from surfaces and take prey on the wing. our data were collected in a large outdoor flight room mimicking a cluttered environment. We compared and analysed flight behaviours and echolocation calls used by each species of bat when aerial hawking and gleaning. Our results challenge the traditional labelling of M. lucifugus as an obligate aerial-hawking species and show that M. septentrionalis, which is often cited as a gleaning species, can capture airborne prey. As has been shown in previous studies, prey-generated acoustic cues were necessary and sufficient for the detection and localization of perched prey. We argue that the broadband, high-frequency, downward-sweeping, frequency-modulated calls used by some bats when gleaning prey from complex surfaces resolve targets from background. First, because calls of lower frequency and narrower bandwidth are sufficient for assessing a surface before landing, and second, because there are few, if any, simple surfaces in nature from which substrate-gleaning behaviours in wild bats would be expected.

AB Although sound production requires energy, it has been unclear how much singing increases metabolic rate in passerine birds. We measured the rate of oxygen consumption of two breeds of canary that sang inside a respirometry chamber. Metabolic rate increased with the proportion of. time that birds spent singing. Average metabolic rate during singing at 15-20degreesC was 1.05-1.07 times that of standing quietly in the same temperature range or 2.2-2.6 times basal metabolic rate (BMR). Whether an increase in metabolic rate during song of this order would represent a fitness cost to free-living passerine birds would depend upon the circumstances. Singing rather than perching during the day would raise metabolic rate only slightly. Singing at night or at dawn, instead of sleeping with a metabolic rate closer to BMR, would cause a greater increase in metabolism. Birdsong could act as a condition-dependent signal, since birds that are easily able to achieve energy balance could afford the cost of singing, but those close to their energy limits might not.

AB Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are long-chain fatty acids and their derivatives that protect insects from desiccation. They can also be important semiochemicals in insect reproduction. We used behavioural and chemical assays to examine the potential role of CHCs in sexual communication in a solitary burrowing bee, Amegilla dawsoni. Washing CHC blends from the cuticle of emerging virgin females made them unattractive to mate-searching males. Returning the CHC blends restored their attractiveness. Nesting females were unattractive to mate-searching males, whether they were washed or not. Chemical analysis identified significant differences between male and female CHC blends and between virgin female and nesting female blends. Some of these differences were due to specific compounds. Loss of attractiveness is unlikely to be due to antiaphrodisiac compounds delivered by males, because male-specific compounds were not found on nesting females, and because recently mated females with intact CHC blends were attractive to searching males. Nesting females could not be made attractive to searching males by removing their CHC blends. Adding virgin female CHC blends tended to improve attractiveness but the effect was weak, suggesting that some form of volatile compound may also be involved in signalling unreceptivity.

AB The mechanisms of aposematism (unprofitability of prey combined with a conspicuous signal) have mainly been studied with reference to vertebrate predators, especially birds. We investigated whether dragonflies, Aeshna grandis, avoid attacking wasps, Vespula norwegica, which are an unprofitable group of prey for most predators. As a control we used flies that were painted either black or with yellow and black stripes. The dragonflies showed greater aversion to wasps than to flies. Black-and-yellow-striped flies were avoided more than black ones, suggesting that aposematic coloration on a harmless fly provides a selective advantage against invertebrate predators. There was no significant difference in reactions to black-painted and black-and-yellow wasps, indicating that, in addition to coloration, some other feature in wasps might deter predators. In further experiments we offered dragonflies artificial prey items in which the candidate warning signals (coloration, odour and shape) were tested separately while other confounding factors were kept constant. The dragonflies avoided more black-and-yellow prey items than solid black or solid yellow ones. However, we found no influence of wasp odour on dragonfly hunting. Dragonflies were slightly, but not significantly, more reluctant to attack wasp-shaped prey items than fly-shaped ones. Our results suggest that the typical black-and-yellow stripes of wasps, possibly combined with their unique shape, make dragonflies avoid wasps. Since black-and-yellow stripes alone significantly decreased attack rate, we conclude that even profitable prey species (i.e. Batesian mimics) are able to exploit the dragonflies' avoidance of wasps.

AB Male mosquitofish allocate a large proportion of their time budget to attempting to inseminate unreceptive females. Because females invest considerable time and energy in avoiding unwanted copulations, sexual harassment is expected to conflict with other activities such as foraging. We found that sexual harassment more than halved the foraging efficiency of the female in a task requiring the retrieval of food items scattered on the water surface. The presence of shoalmates relieved the female from harassment and foraging efficiency increased with the number of females in the group. Small males attempted to mate significantly more than large males, causing a greater reduction in the female's foraging efficiency. When several males competed for the same female, the larger, dominant male prevented all the other males from attempting to mate and so had fewer opportunities to attempt copulation. Harassment from solitary males appeared to be more costly, as females foraged more efficiently when chased by a group of males. Because male sexual activity has a large impact on a female's feeding efficiency and possibly on her survival and reproduction, sexual conflict is expected to be important in shaping association patterns of female mosquitofish with conspecifics of both sexes.

AB Several studies have shown that seabird colonies consist to a large extent of young nonbreeders (prospectors). These individuals appear at the colony later in the season than established breeders. The reasons for this late arrival have remained unclear in most cases, mainly because of technical difficulties in collecting sufficient data from nonbreeding individuals. We used a novel transponder system to identify remotely the members of a common tern colony, including nonbreeders, during eight breeding seasons and we combined the system with automatic balances. Ninety-two per cent of prospectors returned for the first time when 2 years old and 88.9% of recruits to the breeding population had spent at least one previous season at the colony as prospectors. In both sexes, most individuals prospected for one season, but more males than females prospected for more than one season, although a higher proportion of females started breeding without a previous prospecting phase. Terns arrived earlier in the season the older they were and the more experience of the colony they had, but experience proved to be more important than age. Prospectors gained about 3 weeks with a previous prospecting season whereas an additional year of age allowed birds to arrive only about 6 days earlier. Prospectors returning later in the season arrived with lower body masses. Males on average arrived earlier at the colony than females.

AB In many animals, variance in male mating success is strongly correlated with male dominance rank or some other measure of fighting ability. Studies in primates, however, have varied greatly in whether they detect a relationship between male dominance rank and mating success. This variability has led to debate about the nature of the relation between rank and mating success in male primates. We contribute to the resolution of this debate by presenting an analysis of the relationship between dominance rank and male mating success over 32 group-years in a population of wild savannah baboons. When data were pooled over the entire period, higher-ranking males had greater access to fertile females. However, when we examined successive 6-month blocks, we found variance in the extent to which rank predicted mating success. In some periods, the dominance hierarchy functioned as a queue in which males waited for mating opportunities, so that rank predicted mating success. In other periods, the queuing system broke down, and rank failed to predict mating success when many adult males were in the group, when males in the group differed greatly in age, and when the highest-ranking male maintained his rank for only short periods. The variance within this single population is similar to the variance observed between populations of baboons and between species of primates. Our long-term results provide strong support for the proposition that this variance is not an artefact of methodological differences between short-term studies, but is due to true variance in the extent to which high-ranking males are able to monopolize access to females.

AB Previous studies have shown that reed warblers, Acrocephalus scirpaceus, are more likely to reject a cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, egg if they have seen a cuckoo, at their nest. This suggests that they would benefit from watching out for cuckoos. We tested whether presentations of a cuckoo mount near the nest (to simulate nest inspection) led to increased nest attendance by the warblers. Cuckoo presentations at completed nests before laying, when males guarded their females closely, led to desertion at 40% of nests before any eggs were laid (there were no desertions after presentations of a jay, Garrulus glandarius, a nest predator). In the remaining cases, there was no effect of the cuckoo, on nest attendance before laying began, but a marked increase in male nest attendance (compared with jay and no-presentation controls) on the days the first and second eggs were laid. Cuckoo presentations at the one-egg stage led to the same increase in male nest attendance as did the prelaying presentations. Increased male nest attendance at the one-two-egg stage was not at the expense of mate guarding, because this declined anyway when laying began, and it did not lead to increased paternity loss compared with controls. Overall, 15% of broods had one or two extrapair young (6% of all young extrapair). We conclude that male reed warblers do increase nest guarding in response to cuckoos, but only after their females have begun egg laying, when there are less likely to be costs in lost paternity. Females did not increase nest guarding, perhaps because they need to spend more time foraging during the egg-laying period. Our results, suggest that cuckoos should be secretive not only when they lay but also when they monitor host nests beforehand. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Several empirical studies have reported a positive relation between male viability and the expression of sexually selected traits, but others have reported a significant negative relation. Using the ability to evade predators as an indicator of male viability, we evaluated the direction of this relationship in a free-ranging population of common pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, which have multiple ornaments and are sexually dimorphic in tail length and in ornaments such as wattles and tarsal spurs. We translocated 72 males into a protected area and radiotracked them during the breeding seasons of 3 years. Before releasing them, we measured their body weight, wing and tail length, wattle height and spur length. Male survivors had larger multiple ornaments, regardless of age, than males that were killed by predators but survival selection on wing length and body weight was nonsignificant, showing that selection on male ornaments was not the result of selection on correlated traits.

ID MATE-CHOICE
AB In a series of three experiments, we examined the hypothesis that female Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, are motivated to form aggregations to reduce the probability of harassment by conspecific males. When in the presence of a conspecific male, female quail both sought others of their sex and remained near them. However, if no males were present, females were indifferent to or tended to avoid one another. We interpret these data as consistent with the hypothesis that one function of aggregations of female quail is to avoid harassment by conspecific males. Skew in male mating success would be a probable consequence of such aggregations of females. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

   METABOLISM; ECOLOGY; POCHARD
AB Although theoretical models predict that the quality of foraging patches has little effect on optimal dive time with increasing depth, many empirical studies show that dive time at a given depth may vary. We developed a model that incorporated patch quality as a parameter of energy intake as a nonlinear function of time, and applied it to the diving behaviour of Brunnich's guillemots, Uria lomvia. The model indicated that optimal dive time can vary widely depending on the parameter. It also explained the convergence of observed dive times with travel time. Assuming the birds dived optimally, this parameter can be estimated from travel time and dive time for each dive. Foraging patches with larger estimated parameter values were favoured by the birds, suggesting that the parameter indicated patch quality. We used this parameter to test an optimal patch use model in divers. The results indicate that Brunnich's guillemots adjust their diving behaviour adaptively depending on patch quality, and that the optimal diving model is valid for prediction of observed dive patterns if patch quality is incorporated appropriately.

AB Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain the evolution of host responses to parasites: the arms race-evolutionary lag and equilibrium hypotheses. We investigated predictions from these hypotheses based on interspecies host preferences and adaptations in an obligate spawning relationship between a freshwater fish, the European bitterling (Cyprinidae) and four species of freshwater mussels (Unionidae), which the fish use as hosts for their eggs. We found a significant trend in preference by the fish for mussels in the following order: Unio pictorum, U. tumidus, Anodonta anatina and A. cygnea. Male and female bitterling both showed this ranking and the clutch sizes deposited into each species also followed this trend. These host preferences proved to be adaptive in terms of egg ejection, which was lowest in the most preferred species (U. pictorum). Furthermore, these hierarchical host preferences were flexible, as females switched species when individuals of the preferred species ejected a greater number of eggs. The similarity in mussel defences between the U.K. population and. a European population of ancient sympatry suggests that the absence of a defence in some mussel species may not be due to evolutionary lag. Mussel ejection behaviour may have reached an evolutionary equilibrium in each host species, or alternatively the fish may have evolved adaptive preferences that coincide with generalized mussel responses to foreign objects in their gills.

AB The vibration signal of the honeybee functions as 'modulatory communication' because it elicits a general increase in activity that may help integrate the behaviour of workers that perform different, interrelated task sets. Workers that produce vibration signals contact numerous other bees, some of which receive the signal while others are 'bypassed' (antennated but not vibrated). Vibrating bees may therefore select among, potential recipients. We monitored vibration signal behaviour in six observation colonies to investigate the possible selection of recipients by vibrating bees and the factors that might influence these choices. Vibrating bees roamed throughout the nest and bypassed more than half of all workers contacted. Vibration signals were not directed towards specific worker age groups. There were no differences in the mean age of vibrated versus bypassed workers or the proportion of recipients that were of preforaging versus foraging age. The likelihood of receiving vibration signals was influenced by recipient activity level. Significantly more workers were vibrated if they were inactive versus active when contacted by a signalling bee. Signal production was not consistently influenced by relatedness. Vibrating bees from only a single patriline in one of our study colonies were more likely to perform signals on supersisters than on half-sisters. In all other colonies no kin preferences were observed during signal performance. Thus, vibrating bees may choose among potential recipients and direct their signals towards inactive workers of all ages and levels of relatedness. This, in combination with their movement throughout the colony, could help to activate simultaneously multiple worker groups that perform interdependent tasks, but which may be spatially segregated in the nest.

AB A review of behavioural studies of hybridization and mixed pairing in birds led to the following conclusions. (1) Hybridization is more common where one of two hybridizing species is rare. (2) There is no tendency in mixed pairs or in interspecific copulations for females to belong to a rarer species than males, as would be predicted by theory based on female choice. (3) There is no evidence that females prefer males of a larger species when hybridizing, in sympatric or in parapatric species. I propose three hypotheses to account for these findings. (1) Scarcity of conspecifics facilitates hybridization in general, no matter which sex is the rare one. (2) Mistakes in mate recognition cause hybridization, especially when females choose wrongly. (3) Supernormal stimuli may sometimes cause hybridization. It is not possible to judge which of these hypotheses Is the best supported, and hybridization is likely to have multiple causes.

AB The 'scent-matching' hypothesis predicts that competitors could identify resource holders by investigating scent marks from a given area and matching these with the owner's odour when they meet. Previous studies on small rodents have supported the use of scent matching among males with mutually exclusive ranges. We designed an experiment to evaluate the potential role of scent matching in the snow vole, a species in which males have largely overlapping ranges but individually use specific locations within shared areas. Initial exploration of enclosures containing a choice between a scent-marked and an unmarked area established that males were more attracted to recently occupied areas. During a subsequent social encounter with either the donor of the scent marks present in the enclosure (matching opponent) or another male (nonmatching opponent), males were less aggressive towards matching than nonmatching opponents. Furthermore, during exploration of enclosures after encounters, males spent significantly less time at the scent-marked side after meeting a matching male but not after meeting another male. These results suggest that male snow voles may use scent matching to identify potential opponents and to respond differentially to occupied areas. By modifying their behaviour after assessing the identity of their opponents, males may be able to minimize current and prospective costly encounters with resource holders. Our findings show that the mechanism of scent matching is also compatible with spatial systems in which competing conspecifics possess overlapping ranges.

AB Both the pattern of exploration and the manipulation efficiency of young keas attempting to open a complex food container proved to be influenced by the observation of an experienced group member. Five individuals were allowed to observe a trained conspecific that iteratively demonstrated several techniques to open a large steel box. The lid of the box could be opened only after several locking devices had been dismantled: a bolt had to be poked out, a split pin had to be pulled, and a screw had to be twisted out. The observers' initial manipulative actions were compared with those of five naive control subjects (nonobservers). Although the observers failed to open the box completely and thus to get the reward in their first attempts, they explored more, approached the locking devices sooner and were more successful at opening them. Although their initial attempts did not match the response topography or the sequence of the model's actions (movement or sequence imitation), their improved efficiency at unlocking the devices seemed to reflect the acquisition of some functional understanding of the task through observation (emulation learning).

AB Paedomorphosis, in which individuals retain ancestral characteristics in the adult stage, is widespread in newts and salamanders and is suspected to play an important role in evolution. In some species, paedomorphosis is facultative with some individuals forgoing metamorphosis. Optimality models have been proposed to explain the maintenance of this polymorphism, but require the integration of reproductive patterns into the models. We investigated the frequencies of inbreeding and outbreeding in two syntopic heterochronic morphs of the Alpine newt. The two morphs are sexually compatible: encounters between and within morphs were equally successful in terms of spermatophore transfer. Behavioural observations were in agreement with the sexual compatibility observed. Nevertheless, paedomorphic males displayed to females less frequently than metamorphic males. The two morphs differ largely on the basis of sexual secondary characteristics, but the majority of these traits did not affect mating success. Because of the large flow of genes between the two heterochronic morphs and because of the absence of spatial and temporal isolation, these results do not support sympatric speciation models, but are in favour of the maintenance of polymorphism in natural populations.

AB Recent findings have challenged the notion that song development in many oscines ends in crystallized, stereotyped motor programmes. Evidence here indicates that delayed auditory feedback can result in immediate changes in song syllable syntax and phonology. Zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, when exposed to their own song that was delayed 50-250 ms, promptly produced anomalies such as stutters, omissions and novel sounds. As soon as the auditory feedback stopped, the birds returned to normal, stereotyped song. The effects are compared to those obtained from human speakers subjected to delayed auditory feedback.

AB Nest site selection is a frequent context for decision making in ants, but little is known of the criteria used to make a choice. We tested the nest site preferences of Leptothorax curvispinosus, both by measuring hollow acorn nests occupied in nature, and by inducing laboratory colonies to choose between artificial nests of different design. Three criteria were examined. (1) Entrance size: the ants preferred small entrance holes, presumably for their greater defensibility and crypsis. Natural nest entrances were small, and 52% of them were reduced still further by the addition of rims of soil and leaf litter. In choice tests, colonies selected nest entrances near the median size of rimmed natural holes, rejecting those near the larger end of the distribution of raw natural holes. (2) Cavity volume: acorn cavity volume was weakly correlated with the size of the occupying colony. In choice tests, colonies rejected cavities near the median size of natural nests, preferring instead larger cavities near the upper end of the natural size distribution. This may reflect active size matching of colonies to nests, because the colonies used in the choice test were bigger than those from the natural nest sample. Alternatively, all colonies may prefer big nests, but face limited availability of large cavities in nature. (3) Cavity shape: colonies preferred shapes roughly similar to that of an acorn interior, rejecting thin crevices in favour of compact, high-ceilinged cavities.

AB I investigated the relationship between the sun compass and the magnetic compass in zonal orientation of the equatorial sandhopper Talorchestia martensii. I carried out experiments in Kenya, in a confined environment, during the equinoctial phase, in which it is theoretically difficult to use the sun as an orienting cue because of the marked variation in the hourly azimuthal speed and zenithal distance. My results show that the sun compass and the magnetic compass coexisted but were not always used contemporaneously or, at least, did not have the same importance. At the equinox this depended in large part on the height of the sun: when the zenithal distance was < 10 degrees the magnetic compass prevailed. The relationship between the two compass mechanisms revealed in the present study overcomes the problem of the need to postulate a differential compensation for the apparent motion of the sun by equatorial sandhoppers.

AB Data on over 950 natural matings of red-sided garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, in Manitoba revealed size-assortative pairing: large males tended to mate with large females, and small males with small females. Unlike previously reported cases of size-assortative mating, the causal mechanism in these snakes involved a size-related shift in active mate selection by males. In the field, courtship as well as mating was size assortative (albeit, with considerable scatter around the trend line). Staged trials in outdoor arenas showed that males of all sizes preferred to court large rather than small females, but this preference was stronger in large males. Males adjusted their courtship intensity in response to the numbers and sizes of females and competing males, but did not change their preferences with respect to female body size. Thus, size-assortative mating was not a direct consequence of large males excluding their smaller rivals from large females. Males may be selective courters in this species because they have a limited supply of sperm and mating plugs, and hence can copulate effectively only a few times within the mating season. Given intense competition from large males (which primarily court large females), small males may benefit from focusing on small females. Alternatively, small males may be less Capable of inducing sexual receptivity from large females. Mark-recapture data confirmed that males grow rapidly from one year to the next. Thus, the size-related shift in male mate choice was due to an ontogenetic change rather than the existence of multiple male morphs differing in both body size and courtship preference.

   TACHYCINETA-BICOLOR; NEED; PREDATION; EVOLUTION; RULES; RISK
AB The begging displays used by altricial nestling birds to solicit care from parents include vigorous movements and loud calling. These begging signals have attracted considerable interest, mainly because their intensity seems excessive for the function of transmitting information about nestling need to parents. However, how information on need is encoded in the various components of the signal, especially its acoustic components, is poorly understood. We examined how begging calls of large and small nestling tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, changed during a short period of food deprivation and cooling, as a first step in determining the role that various call characteristics played in advertising nestling need. In contrast to previous studies, we examined several call variables, and related them not only to need for food but also need for warmth. When nestlings were deprived of food, their calls increased in rate and length. Large nestlings also increased the amplitude of their calls. When nestlings were cooled during food deprivation, they decreased the frequency of their calls and their call rate. The latter trend was especially evident in small nestlings. Our results suggest that begging calls carry information not only on the overall hunger level of broods, as emphasized in previous studies, but also on the size, hunger and thermal need of individual nestlings. Further tests are needed to determine whether parents use this information and whether begging calls are optimally designed to convey it. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In the Mingan Islands, northern Gulf of St Lawrence (eastern Canada), the whelk Buccinum undatum displays a strong escape response to its predator, the asteroid Leptasterias polaris, nevertheless large sexually mature individuals occasionally approach feeding L. polaris to obtain food. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that reproductive requirements increase the tendency of sexually mature whelks to approach feeding asteroids. Prior to egg laying, females (which invest more energy than males into the production of reproductive structures) represented 72% of the adult whelks that approached feeding L. polaris, but only 36% of the adults randomly collected from the study area. Furthermore, females that were attracted to feeding asteroids had smaller reproductive organs (after accounting for body size) than females randomly collected from the study area. Similarly, prior to egg laying, females fed longer and ingested more food than males when tested in the presence of L. polaris in the laboratory. After egg laying, however, females and males displayed a similar tendency to feed in the presence of a predator, both in the field and in the laboratory. Predator-impact indices, computed by contrasting the feeding activity of whelks in the absence and presence of a predator, indicated that females (but not males) responded more boldly to predators prior to than after egg laying, despite a general decrease in feeding activity at that period. Taken together, our observations indicate that the tendency of adult whelks to approach feeding predators is influenced by potential reproductive gains. Because such gains are presumably more directly linked to a given feeding opportunity in sexually active individuals, whelks may be selected to display increased levels of boldness towards predators with the onset of sexual maturity. Thus, potential reproductive benefits may partly explain the size-dependent tendency of whelks to approach feeding asteroids. (C) 2001 The Association far the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Variation in vocal signals among populations and social groups of animals provides opportunities for the study of the mechanisms of behavioural change and their importance in generating and maintaining behavioural variation. We analysed two call types made by two matrilineal social groups of resident killer whales, Orcinus orca, over 12-13 years. We used a neural network-based index of acoustic similarity to identify mechanisms of call differentiation. A test for structural modification of the calls detected significant changes in one call type in both groups, but not in the other. For the modified call type, the rate of divergence between the two groups was significantly lower than the rate of modification within either group showing that calls were modified in a similar fashion in the two groups. An analysis of structural parameters detected no strong directionality in the change. The pattern of call modification could have been caused by maturational changes to the calls or, if killer whale dialects are learned behavioural traits, cultural drift in the structure of the calls together with horizontal transmission of modifications between the two groups. Such vocal matching between members of different matrilines would suggest that vocal learning is not limited to vertical transmission from mother to offspring, which has important implications for models of gene-culture coevolution.

AB Animals commonly approach (i.e. 'inspect') potential predators. Glowlight tetras, Hemigrammus erythrozonus, have previously been shown to inspect the combined chemical and visual cues originating from novel predators and to modify their inspection (approach) behaviour depending upon the predator's diet. We conducted two experiments to determine whether tetras would inspect the chemical cues of injured prey or the dietary cues of a novel predator in the absence of any visual cues. Shoals of glowlight tetras were exposed to either distilled water (control) or the skin extract of swordtail (lacking ostariophysan alarm pheromones) or the skin extract of tetra (with alarm pheromones). There was no significant difference in the frequency of predator inspection behaviour towards swordtail or tetra skin extract compared to the distilled water controls. In the second experiment, we exposed shoals of tetras to either distilled water or the odour of Jack Dempsey cichlids, Cichlasoma octofasciatum, which had been food deprived, or fed a diet of swordtails or tetras. There was no significant difference in the frequency of predator inspection behaviour towards the odour of the starved cichlids and the odour of the fed cichlids in either of the two diet treatments. However, when tetras were exposed to the odour of cichlids fed tetras, they took significantly longer to initiate an inspection visit, remained further from the source of the chemical cues and inspected in smaller groups, compared with the odour of a starved cichlid or a cichlid fed swordtails. These data strongly suggest that tetras will inspect chemical cues alone, but only if the cue contains information about the predator. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Song learning in birds is paradoxical. Without tutoring, songbirds do not develop normal songs. Yet despite this inability, birds possess extensive foreknowledge; in a mechanistic sense, about the normal song of their species. When given a choice of tape recordings, young, naive songbirds select sounds of their own species for imitation. We tape-tutored white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha, with a set of manipulated songs to investigate whether the introductory whistle universally present in white-crowned sparrow song guides selective song learning in this species. Our results confirm that this whistle serves as a cue for song learning, enabling acquisition of normally rejected sounds of other species, including hermit thrush, Catharus guttatus, notes, which have a sound quality distinct from that of natural white-crowned sparrow phrases. Our results support the conclusion that sensory mechanisms rather than motor constraints are primarily responsible for the selectivity seen in song learning.

ID GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS; POPULATION DIFFERENCES; 3-SPINED STICKLEBACKS
AB I examined biased patterns of habituation that occur when reproductive male three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, respond to a choice of two dummy females, one displaying the head-up posture of a sexually receptive female and an otherwise identical dummy lacking this sign Stimulus (i.e. a dummy in a 'neutral' horizontal posture). Males initially courted both dummies about equally, but within 5 min, their courtship to the horizontal dummy began to habituate and was eventually replaced by attack behaviour, which increased about four-fold during the 1-h trial. Courtship to the head-up dummy continued unabated throughout the trial and by 5 min exceeded courtship to the horizontal dummy. Attack to the head-up dummy increased slightly in the first half of the trial then leveled off to about one-third that directed to the horizontal dummy. Both dummies were stationary and unreactive so could not directly provide differential feedback to the males. It is speculated that the self-arousal males obtain when responding to head-up posture reinforces their response to that cue. The salience of this sign stimulus may develop through an interactive process wherein the male's predisposition to recognize and court the head-up posture and the sexual self-arousal he obtains by doing so counter habituation and help maintain his sexual response to that cue. The stimulus-response specificity of male courtship is assumed to have an innate basis but requires experience to become fully differentiated. The results also illustrate that rate or extent of habituation to different stimuli, even on the same dimension, can differ within the same individual and in an adaptive manner.

AB We address the organization of workers in social insect societies. We distinguish between changes in behavioural role over the nurse to forager role sequence, which may depend on changes in physiology, and potentially more rapid changes of task within role. We investigated the association between role and nutrient status in the ant Leptothorax albipennis. Worker lipid stores were quantified using a new body size-controlled method, and were related to worker behaviour. Worker lipid stores were evenly distributed amongst colony members at the end of winter, splitting rapidly into two distinct modes (replete nurses and lean foragers) in spring. The proportion of lean foragers increased throughout spring and summer, until most colonies contained only workers of this type. Callow workers then eclosed with intermediate lipid stores. We developed a computer vision system that tracks all nest ants to extract detailed behaviour of individuals of known lipid stores. Lipid storage was negatively correlated with a worker's foraging propensity, and with measures of spatial occupation in the nest and of activity. Different colonies showed a similar quantitative correlation between lipid stores and behavioural role, suggesting that lipid stores were not only correlated with the relative organization of individuals within each nest, but may also have influenced their absolute role. We reviewed the literature and found evidence that nutrient status influences role predisposition in social insect workers. We conclude that the distribution of worker roles may be linked to the balance between foraging income and energetic consumption within the colony directly via worker nutrient status.

AB Two main paternity assurance strategies are generally found in birds: mate guarding and frequent copulations. The latter is expected particularly in species such as raptors that cannot guard their mates efficiently because of ecological constraints, such as frequent courtship feeding. I investigated the prelaying behaviour of red kites, in which the males courtship feed. I compared pair behaviour in situations of varying breeding density and simulated male territorial intrusions by presenting decoys. Males' certainty of paternity was likely to decrease with increasing breeding density, because of the proximity of other males and more frequent male territorial intrusions during the presumed fertile period. The percentage of time spent by males within their breeding territory during the prelaying period was positively related to the number of close breeding neighbours, suggesting territory surveillance and mate guarding. The kites copulated frequently and over a long period. Copulation frequency prior to and during laying increased with breeding density, and in isolated pairs in response to simulated male territorial intrusions. The results support the idea of paternity assurance through frequent copulations during the presumed fertile period of the female, and suggest that early copulation activity is related to functions other than fertilization, such as pair bonding or mate assessment.

AB To understand the behavioural aspects of sperm competition, the costs and benefits to both sexes should be considered. However, few studies have addressed the costs to females of their social mate engaging in extrapair copulations (EPCs). Measures of female mate guarding have concentrated on female solicitation and copulation; however, females may also control access to their mate by maintaining close proximity, as is common in males. I recorded the maintenance of pair proximity behaviour of an urban population of the socially monogamous European blackbird, Turdus merula, over three breeding seasons. There was no evidence that females guarded their mates to prevent them from engaging in EPCs, nor were there any effects of the potential quality indicators of age, body site or male bill colour on the intensity of mate guarding between individuals. The study adds to a small body of literature suggesting that female mate guarding may be found in (facultatively) polygynous species, but not in socially monogamous ones.

AB The relative abilities of individual cichlids, Tilapia zillii to obtain food under scramble competition was highly repeatable between trials using a single input source, regardless of whether the input was constant or variable. However, when given a choice between two patches differing only in their temporal variability in input about an identical mean, an individual's rank based on intake in one patch was uncorrelated with either its intake in the other patch or its intake in the single-patch trials. In the two-patch trials, certain individuals both spent more time in food patches and visited patches more often than others, and overall the fish spent more time in the constant rate patch than the variable patch, leading to more items being consumed from the constant rate patch. We discuss possible causes and consequences of this dependence of relative competitive ability on the context of the foraging situation. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Guppies are a model vertebrate for studies of sexual selection and life history evolution. None the less, there have been few investigations of the factors responsible for maintaining extreme within-population genetic variation in male coloration. In a laboratory study, we tested the hypothesis that frequency-dependent mate choice contributes to the maintenance of this variation. We attempted to avoid biases inherent in earlier studies of the 'rare male effect' by familiarizing females to males bearing a particular colour pattern and later presenting them with alternate male types, in equal numbers. Females were significantly more likely to mate with males having novel colour patterns than with males having a colour pattern with which they were familiar. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that mate choice is frequency dependent. Other factors such as male and female size were unrelated to mate preference. Implications of the results for theories of sexual selection and the maintenance of variation are discussed. (C)1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PERMANENCE; BEHAVIOR
AB We investigated how positional and directional cues affected the way single domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, searched for a concealed imprinting object. The chicks were 4 or 12 days of age and had been reared in enriched pens that allowed them to move out of sight of the imprinting object, or control pens that did not. In experiment 1, 44 chicks viewed a positional cue, which was a stationary imprinting object placed for 1 min in front of one of two possible hiding locations (each concealing an identical imprinting object) either to the left or right of the chick. When released, chicks moved towards, and spent more time in, the side in which the positional cue had been presented. We presented a further 44 chicks with a directional cue, which involved an imprinting object moving from near one possible hiding location towards the other and its occlusion midway between the two possible hiding locations. When released, chicks moved towards, and spent more time in, the opposite side to that indicated by the visible direction of movement of the imprinting object. Additionally, chicks reared in enriched pens spent more time in the side in which the imprinting object was seen than chicks reared in control pens. We examined the relative influence of positional and directional cues in experiment 2, by providing both cues sequentially to 88 chicks. Chicks spent more time in the positional cue side, when the directional cue offered complementary information, but no side preference was found when cues provided contradictory information. We conclude that in this study, orientation towards a concealed object was based on previous spatial location alone, with little influence from the temporal aspects of the presentation such as movement before occlusion or last-seen location. We discuss the possibility that chicks imprinting on a stationary object develop a strategy for locating a concealed social stimulus that is unrepresentative of chicks reared by a hen.

ID MICE MUS-MUSCULUS; SOCIAL CONTACT; MARKING; FEMALES
AB Using male and female Alderley Park (Wistar-derived) rats housed in single-sex groups in standard laboratory cages, we looked at the effect of group size (one, three, five or eight) on competitive behaviour and time budgeting (initial and longer term), changes in their serum testosterone (males), corticosterone and antibody concentrations, and organ pathology at age 16 weeks, together with the interrelationships between behavioural measures and pathophysiological indices of social stress. Group size had only limited long-term effects on overall time budgeting and did not affect pathophysiological responses, although there were highly significant differences between individuals in replicate cage groups. Pathophysiology within both sexes showed strong and highly specific correlations with a small subset of behaviours suggesting frustrated attempts to escape from cages, including chewing the cage bars. Escape-related behaviour also correlated strongly with one component of competitive behaviour, Aggressive Grooming within both sexes, although Aggressive Grooming correlated with pathophysiological responses only among males. Females generally showed greater escape-related behaviour associated with greater signs of pathophysiology regardless of the level of aggression shown between cagemates. Major differences in intercorrelated behavioural and pathophysiological responses between replicate groups implied that the individual composition of groups rather than their size had the greater impact on the welfare of the rats, especially among females. This may be consistent with adaptive sex differences in their competitive reproductive strategies. The frequency of apparent escape-related behaviours and Aggressive Grooming, particularly when rats are first introduced into their cage groups, may provide a simple assessment of the welfare implications of particular cage groupings.

AB When queenless honeybees, Apis mellifera, rear new queens, the relative frequencies of subfamilies found in the queen and worker brood are often very different, suggesting that certain subfamilies are reproductively dominant. At least two mechanisms could account for the observed differences in queen and worker broods. First, kin selection theory predicts that if honeybee workers are able to distinguish levels of relatedness, they should act nepotistically by favouring super-sisters over less-related half-sisters during emergency queen rearing. Alternatively, selection might result in royalty alleles that make their possessors more favoured for rearing as queens. Documented genetically based tendencies to rear queen or worker brood might interact with either of these mechanisms. To determine which of these effects might best explain reproductive dominance, we removed brood from the queenright section of one colony and offered it to the queenless section of the same colony and to three unrelated queenless colonies. We used two microsatellite loci to determine the paternity of queen and worker brood reared by these colonies. Variance in the proportions of subfamilies in queen and worker brood was greatest when the rearing bees were related to the brood. The results suggest that nepotistic interactions are more important than royalty alleles or other factors in causing reproductive dominance, but that there are complex interactions between the genotype of the nursing workers, and the genotypes of the larvae favoured for rearing as queens.

AB We tested risk sensitivity towards variability in volume of reward with harnessed honeybees, Apis mellifera, in a proboscis-extension conditioning paradigm. We conditioned each subject to turn its head and extend its proboscis towards one of two presented odours; one odour was associated with a constant reward volume and the other with a variable reward volume that was either low or high, with probabilities P=0.75 and (1-P)=0.25, respectively. The volumes of rewards were varied among three experimental conditions. In conditions I and II, the variable reward option included a low reward of zero (i.e. reinforcement was withheld in the low reward value); in condition I, the mean of the variable and of the constant reward options were the same, and in condition II, the variable reward option had a higher mean reward than the constant reward option. The behaviour of subjects did not differ between treatments and the majority of individuals were risk averse. In condition III, the variable reward option did not include a zero reward and the mean reward did not differ between options. Very few of the individuals assigned to condition III developed a preference for either reward option. Thus, honeybees are risk sensitive to variability in volume of reward in some conditions and the degree of risk sensitivity depends on characteristics of the reward distributions. The most salient characteristic may be a relative measure of variability, such as the value of the coefficient of variation of reward. The experimental paradigm that we developed is a powerful tool for studying the mechanism of risk sensitivity in bees,as well as other aspects of learning, decision making, perception and memory.

AB Sperm competition in sex-role reversed, polyandrous jacanas is intense because females copulate with multiple male mates before laying each clutch. These males may be unable to attempt to maximize their share of copulations by mate guarding or forcing copulations. Instead, males in polyandrous harems may compete for sexual access to the female by giving a call, termed the 'yell', to attract her. Male bronze-winged jacanas, Metopidius indicus, yelled at higher rates in larger harems, and when the female was further from the yeller or on a comate's territory. Half of all yells were given at mating platforms where all copulations occurred. Males that received the clutch yelled at lower rates during the incubation and chick care periods. Yells attracted the female when she was far from the yeller or with a comate. When the yell of a polyandrous male was broadcast from his territory the female was more likely to By to his territory during playback than during control periods. Within polyandrous harems the males that yelled at the highest rates received the most copulations, and three out of four females gave clutches to the male that gave the longest and most frequent yells, so females may have used yells to assess male quality. Intrusions by females, but not males, increased during yell playbacks, and tended to be more frequent on the territories of males with high yell rates. Females may therefore respond to their mates' yells because yells may attract female intruders which may attempt to take over the territory.

AB In many species of colonial seabirds, young birds visit colonies in the years before they start breeding. This prospecting behaviour may allow them to obtain information that could enhance their future breeding success. We examined the reproductive consequences of prospecting behaviour in the colonial great cormorant, and found support for this idea. New breeders that had been prospecting actively in the previous year obtained breeding sites of higher quality (i.e. closer to sites where conspecifics had fledged young in the previous year) and had higher breeding success than those that had been less active. Prospecting occurred mostly late in the breeding season, and coincided with the time when the majority of the eggs had hatched but before the chicks started hedging, that is, when breeding success in the colony reflected habitat suitability. These results are thus consistent with the use of conspecific reproductive performance as a cue for the quality of a breeding habitat as expected from the 'performance-based conspecific attraction hypothesis'.

AB The categorization of behaviour patterns into separate classes is crucial to the study of animal behaviour. Traditionally researchers have classified behaviour patterns through careful observation by eye. Recently this method has been increasingly replaced by computer methods. While the definition and fine scale analysis that can be achieved with computers is desirable, only a few studies have actually looked at how these methods perform in comparison with human observation. I compared the classification of bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, whistles by human observers with the performance of three computer methods: (1) a method developed by McCowan (1995, Ethology, 100, 177-193); (2) a comparison of cross-correlation coefficients using hierarchical cluster analysis; and (3) a comparison of average difference in frequency along two whistle contours also using hierarchical cluster analysis. The whistle sample consisted of 104 randomly chosen whistles from a group of four captive bottlenose dolphins recorded both during periods when one was separate from the rest of the group and while they all swam in the same pool. The sample contained five individual-specific signature whistles and several nonsignature whistles. Five human observers, without knowledge of the recording context, were more likely than the computer methods to identify signature whistles that were used only while an animal was isolated from the rest of the group. I discuss the limitations of methods commonly used for pattern recognition in communication studies. The discrepancies between methods show how crucial it is to obtain an external validation of the behaviour classes used in studies of animal behaviour.

AB Studies of prey detection have typically focused on how search image affects the capture of cryptic items. This study also considers how background vegetation influences cryptic prey detection. Blue lays, Cyanocitta cristata, searched digitized images for two Catocala moths: C. ilia, which is cryptic on oak, and C. relicta, which is cryptic on birch. Some images contained moths while others did not. The ability of blue jays to detect prey during repeated presentations of one prey type within a session was compared with their performance during randomly alternating presentations of both prey types within a session to examine search-image formation under two background conditions (informative and ambiguous). In the informative background condition, both trees in the image were of the same species and therefore, the background was a reliable indicator of which prey type might be present. In the ambiguous background condition, there was one tree of each species in the image and either prey type could be present. The results indicate that: (1) a search-image effect was observed only for the more cryptic prey type and only when the background was informative; (2) as accuracy on prey images (those with moths) increased, response latency remained unchanged; (3) performance on nonprey images (those without moths) was primarily determined by the difficulty of searching the background and not by the prey type in the accompanying prey images; and (4) search-image effects disappeared with extended practice. These results suggest that the ability to detect prey is influenced by background and that the presence of either multiple backgrounds or multiple prey types interferes with search-image formation.

AB Nestling birds may honestly signal their need for food to provisioning adults, or begging might be a manipulative attempt to coerce additional food from providers, but in either case, providers respond to an increase in begging with an increase in feeding. We used playback of begging calls recorded from nestlings to determine whether male and female red-winged blackbirds increase their feeding rates in response to an apparent increase in begging. Both females and males fed broods at significantly higher rates after 5-min begging call playbacks than before, although only eight of 30 males were observed to feed nestlings in this study. In contrast, using the same playback design, neither females nor males altered their feeding rates significantly in response to broadcasts of noise. These results and others suggest that begging vocalizations are a basis for short-term adjustments in the rate at which nestling birds are provisioned. These results are also compared with those of a similar study of the same species, in which playback had no significant effect on rates of provisioning.

AB Blackstarts, Cercomela melanura, Turdidae, construct a rampart of stones at the entrance to their nests. These ramparts may reach remarkable proportions, containing hundreds of flat rocks. We investigated several hypotheses regarding the function of stone ramparts, by monitoring individually marked blackstarts at the En-Gedi Nature Reserve, Israel. Stones were collected solely by females, who carried them in their beaks, while flying to the nest, at a rate of up to one stone per min, after pair formation had occurred. The number and total weight of stones as well as rampart height showed a highly positive correlation with the size of the nest cavity opening. The rampart decreased the size of the cavity entrance to some nests by as much as 67%, which suggests an antipredator barrier function. Survival rates of eggs and chicks were extremely low and the major cause of reproductive failure was predation. Successful nests tended to be located higher off the ground than predated nests, and often contained fewer stones. Furthermore, larger females in terms of wing and tail length nested in cavities higher off the ground: and built smaller ramparts containing lighter stones. An artificial nest predation experiment did not reveal a difference in predation rates between nests with and without stone ramparts. Spiny mice, Acomys sp., were the main egg predators. However, in 37% of nests with ramparts that were predated, the perpetrator flattened the rampart, suggesting that they may serve as a barricade, forcing the predator to invest time in clearing the stones in order to gain access to the nest, and perhaps allowing the nesting female sufficient time to escape. We propose, therefore, that owing to such high nest predation rates, females nesting close to the ground build stone ramparts as an 'early warning' mechanism to prevent themselves from being trapped inside nest cavities and predated.

TI Management of fat reserves in tufted titmice <i>Baelophus bicolor</i> in
   relation to risk of predation
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SMALL BIRDS; STURNUS-VULGARIS; WINTERING BIRDS; BODY-MASS; ENERGY
AB Fat reserves are an important energy source for animals wintering in temperate zones. Long nights, low ambient temperature and often unpredictable food all increase the probability of death from starvation, and to survive, animals carry energy reserves as fat. Based on the assumption that extra weight makes birds more vulnerable to diurnal predators, it has been hypothesized that predation risk places an upper limit on avian fat reserves. The hypothesis leads to the prediction that birds should decrease their mass in response to increased risk of predation. We tested this prediction with a resident species, the tufted titmouse, Baelophus bicolor. During a 3-day period, we presented a taxidermic mount of a sharp-shinned hawk, Accipiter striatus (predator treatment) or a mourning dove, Zenaida macroura (control treatment) to seven titmice housed individually with food ad libitum. Even though vigilance and delay in time to resume foraging were significantly higher after exposure to the hawk model, the body mass of titmice after exposure to the hawk increased rather than decreased, a result opposite to that predicted. In particular, the birds significantly increased their evening body mass and mean daily mass gain during the treatment period. Our results suggest that risk-dependent foraging appears to regulate avian body fat reserves by limiting foraging time. When food is unlimited, as in our experiment, birds may be able to obtain high energy reserves even while maintaining intense vigilance for predators, and under such conditions, the energetic costs of flying may control upper level energy reserves.

AB A procedure for ordering a set of individuals into a linear or near-linear dominance hierarchy is presented. Two criteria are used in a prioritized way in reorganizing the dominance matrix to find an order that is most consistent with a linear hierarchy: first, minimization of the numbers of inconsistencies and, second, minimization of the total strength of the inconsistencies. The linear ordering procedure, which involves an iterative algorithm based on a generalized swapping rule, is feasible for matrices of up to 80 individuals. The procedure can be applied to any dominance matrix, since it does not make any assumptions about the form of the probabilities of winning and losing. The only assumption is the existence of a linear or near-linear hierarchy which can be verified by means of a linearity test. A review of existing ranking methods is presented and these are compared with the proposed method. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We studied path integration in dogs, Canis familiaris, required to return to the starting point of L-shaped outward paths in the absence of landmark information. The analysis of the distributions of errors in the return direction and distance showed that the dogs made both systematic and random errors. They tended to overestimate by about 6 degrees the amount of turning required at the end of the outward path to take the correct return direction. Random angular errors were characterized by a standard deviation of about 9 degrees. The dogs also tended to underestimate the correct return distance by about 6%, and random distance errors were characterized by a standard deviation of about 13% of the correct return distance. While random errors are assumed to stem simply from inaccuracies in kinaesthetic and vestibular systems, systematic errors are likely to be generated because path integration is implemented at the neural level through approximate rather than mathematically exact solutions. A path integration model in which the moving animal is assumed to overestimate slightly the inferred motion parallax of the starting point can roughly account for the dogs' directional bias, but not for systematic errors in distance estimation.

AB Examination of the mechanism of reproductive suppression includes determining which cues are involved and the context in which they occur. We studied groups of pine voles, Microtus pinetorum, that were disrupted by the replacement of the breeding male and compared them with intact family groups. If reproductive suppression is mediated by chemical cues, then soiled bedding should be sufficient to prevent production of litters by daughters. If reproductive suppression involves a behavioural component, we should observe aggressive behaviours or those indicative of dominance interactions directed from the mother towards the daughter or the replacement male. If replacement of the breeding male leads to conflict between the breeding female and her daughter, then more aggression or dominance interactions would be expected in disrupted than in intact families. The presence of the mother decreased reproduction by daughters, but chemical cues alone were not sufficient to prevent the daughter from mating with the replacement male. Rather, this decrease in reproduction seemed to be mediated by behavioural interactions. We propose that the mother's tugging on the daughter may lead to subordination of the daughter. The mother's presence may also alter the behaviour patterns of the male and daughter, which could delay reproductive activation of the daughter, prevent the formation of pair bonds or inhibit sexual behaviour. These behavioural interactions appear to depend on the presence of an unfamiliar male, because tugging, for example, was less frequent in intact family groups.

AB Scream vocalizations of group-living rhesus macaques provoked by higher-ranking aggressors were examined in two contexts: encounters in which the rank difference between opponents was either large or small. Such vocalizations are important in eliciting support from the caller's allies in the group (usually matrilineal kin). Five acoustically distinct recruitment screams encode specific information about features of the agonistic context, for example, relative rank of the opponent and the severity of the attack. Against higher-ranking opponents, noisy screams are most likely to be given during encounters that involve contact aggression, and tonal or undulated screams are most likely for non-contact aggression. We predicted that scream bouts directed to small rank difference opponents would be more likely to comprise calls from scream classes other than the expected type, and that scream bouts from large rank difference encounters would be more in accord with the expected class. For large rank difference bouts, on average 74.2% of calls were of the expected class; for small rank difference bouts, a significantly smaller per cent (53.8%) of calls was accurately predicted. In the large rank difference encounters, 65.6% (55/84) of bouts were composed entirely of expected scream types, but only 47.6% (39/82) were uniformly correct for small rank difference encounters. Large rank difference interactions also yielded significantly fewer bouts where none of the screams produced by the victim of attack belonged to the predicted class. We suggest that a multi-valued or fuzzy logic system, that is one with more than two truth values, might be a more realistic way to conceptualize the categorization of certain referents of monkey vocalizations.

AB When approaching prey, a stalking predator should consider trade-offs between the probabilities of early detection (by the prey, before the strike), spontaneous departure (of prey, before the strike), prey escape (following the strike) and interference (by rivals or predators). In this study we tested the response of a jumping spider, Plexippus paykulli, to a background with two different camouflaging properties, and two different prey types (maggots versus adult house flies). Spiders jumped towards adult house flies from greater distances on a non-camouflaging background, but background colour had no effect on jumping distance when the prey were maggots. Spiders stalking both prey types approached more slowly when camouflaged. Our experiments suggest that jumping spiders may be responding to changes in the trade-off relationships between the probabilities of early detection, spontaneous departure, escape and interference.

AB Little is known about male reproductive strategies in aquatically mating pinnipeds. To study the mating patterns of harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, VHF telemetry was used to relate the distribution and behaviour of adult males to the distribution of females during the summer pupping and mating season. Prior to July males occupied large and variable ranges. At the beginning of July, males decreased their mean range size, but continued to spend much of their time in the water where they made characteristic short dives. Acoustic recordings in the presence of several radiotagged males suggested that these short dives were associated with underwater vocal displays. Throughout July, males varied in the geographical areas which they used to perform these displays. Some individuals were found in the water around haul-out sites; others were located on foraging grounds, up to 50 km from pupping sites, and some were consistently located displaying on transit routes between these two areas. This study supports previous suggestions that vocalizations and diving displays may be associated with male mating behaviour, but suggests that males may display over a much wider geographical area than was previously recognized. This system of dispersed but small display territories is suggestive of lekking. However, further research on the distribution of the clumping of displaying males is required to confirm this.

AB This paper presents a framework for analysing the social structure of populations in which interactions between some identified individuals can be observed. Statistics describing the nature, quality and temporal patterning of one or more interaction measures are used to define relationships between pairs of individuals or classes of individual. Multivariate techniques can then be used to display the social structure of the population. These displays indicate the social complexity of the population and can be used to classify relationships and examine patterns of relationship between classes of animal. They can also be used to define and delineate groups. This framework and these techniques should be particularly useful when analysing complex fission-fusion societies, as are found among the primates and cetaceans.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID SPATIAL MEMORY; CACHE RECOVERY; PERFORMANCE; LIVIA
AB Clark's nutcrackers, Nucifraga columbiana, were studied to determine what spatial cues may be important to searching behaviour when finding a hidden goal. In the first experiment birds were trained to find seeds buried beneath wood chips on a stationary tray (following Cheng & Sherry 1992, J. comp. Psychol., 106, 331-341). The seeds were located near a glass landmark and one edge of the tray. During unrewarded test trials, the glass landmark could be in the same position as in training (control), or else moved parallel, perpendicular or diagonally with respect to the edge. Parallel movement caused the birds to shift their search, but perpendicular movement did not, suggesting that the local landmark did not influence searching in the perpendicular as much as the parallel direction. In a second experiment, the glass landmark was removed with the tray stationary or shifted. When the tray was shifted, the birds tended to search in the same place relative to global room cues as they did when the tray was not shifted. This use of global cues suggests that they may have also been important in the first experiment. In the third experiment, the tray was placed in a different position for each trial, making global cues unreliable. The birds were much more sensitive to landmark displacement in test trials, confirming the role of global cues during the first experiment. Clark's nutcrackers may be particularly sensitive to global cues in these kinds of spatial tests due to their caching behaviour. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The costs and benefits for partners in interspecific, mutualistic relationships can vary from one interaction to the next, or change with time during an interaction, which might influence the mutualistic contributions. Such flexible behavioural responses could be important in regulating the interaction. Partners could also have special adaptations for the purpose of influencing each other. An individual might, for instance, signal its need for the services provided by the partner. In interactions between lycaenid butterfly larvae and ants, the larvae deliver nutritious droplets from a specialized gland and, in return, are protected from enemy attacks by the ants. Lycaenid larvae have several ant-related adaptations, one being a pair of eversible tentacular organs. In this study, the relationships between tentacle display, the delivery of droplets and ant attendance were investigated in a number of experiments, where the interaction between larvae of Polyommatus icarus and either Lasius niger or L. flavus ants was manipulated. High rates of both droplet delivery and tentacle display were found at the first contact with ants, after an interruption in attendance and, for low levels of attendance, after a simulated enemy attack. Under steady state conditions, displays were most frequent at low levels of attendance, but droplet delivery had a maximum at intermediate levels. Manipulation of a larva's ability to use its tentacles also showed that ants respond to tentacle display by increasing their attendance. Larval behaviour was interpreted as aimed at regulating the, number of attending ants. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The songs of singing honeyeater, Meliphaga virescens, populations on an island and the mainland of Western Australia were compared. For the island population as a whole, the pool of syllable types (memes) from which whole songs are constructed was smaller than for the mainland meme pool. The island population also had fewer song types, syllable types per song, total syllables per song and notes per song. The reduction in signal diversity is likely to be caused by a founder effect. A previous report on these same populations showed that island and mainland birds do not respond to each other's songs. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Two fundamental questions in the study of cooperatively breeding birds are (1) do auxiliaries increase the reproductive success of a flock, and (2) if so, how? This paper addresses these questions in the white-throated magpie-jay, Calocitta formosa. This social corvid was studied for three consecutive breeding seasons in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. Detailed information was gathered on 16 breeding flocks attending a total of 56 active nests. Auxiliaries were divided into three classes depending on their residency patterns and relative contributions to the breeding effort. The influence of auxiliaries was examined on eight measures of nesting success, and on five factors that influence reproductive outcome in this population: (1) onset of first laying, (2) predation, (3) hatching failure, (4) clutch desertion and (5) starvation. The results support three major conclusions. First, helpers directly enhanced nesting success at every stage in the nesting cycle. Second, all helpers did not help equally. Flock size alone bore no relationship to nesting success, but both the number of full-time helpers and helper score (a weighted measure of auxiliary contributions) were significantly related to reproductive outcome. Third, helpers increased breeding success by hastening the onset of first laying, reducing predation on eggs and chicks, and decreasing hatching failure; helpers did not affect the incidence of clutch desertion or chick starvation. These findings provide strong quantitative support for the anti-predator hypothesis and provide the first unequivocal evidence that helpers can enhance nest success by increasing hatchability.

ID FARROWING CRATE DESIGN; PREDATION; WEIGHTS; HUNGER; SIZE
AB Accidental crushing by the sow is a major cause of death among domestic piglets. Piglets risk being crushed if they are underneath the sow as she lies down, but they may benefit from staying close to the sow by improving their access to teats during nursings and by increasing milk production. The prediction was tested that piglets with relatively low weight gains, and thus in greatest need of energy or nutrients, would spend more time in close proximity to the sow and therefore assume a higher mortality risk from crushing. Piglets (N = 138 from 17 litters) were highly variable in birth weight, weight gain, and the amount of time they spent in the risky area underneath a standing or sitting sow. As predicted, piglets that had gained less weight spent more time in this risky area. The relationship held both within and between litters, and was largely because poor-gaining piglets spent more time actively nuzzling the sow's udder, an activity that may increase milk production of a teat.

AB Reproductive male three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, were presented with pairs of videotaped images of another male played back at three different colour intensities: brightly coloured, moderately coloured and dull. Males attacked all three images but the proportion of attacks each received depended on the other image with which it was simultaneously presented. The moderately coloured image received the majority of attacks when presented with the brightly coloured or dull image, whereas the latter two images were attacked equally when presented together. Thus, nuptial coloration increased the capacity of an opponent to elicit attack from males but this increase was not open-ended. A dual-effect explanation for these colour effects suggests that dull males stimulated relatively low levels of aggression and little fear, whereas brightly coloured ones stimulated a high level of aggression but a level of fear sufficient to inhibit full expression of attack. Moderately coloured males received the highest levels of attack presumably because they stimulated high levels of aggression but relatively little fear. This interpretation emphasizes the importance of intensity of nuptial coloration in stimulating aggression and fear in an opponent and the role that these tendencies may play in determining a male's response to rivals.

AB The possibility that laying hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, limit their movements in order to minimize the number of high-ranking or unfamiliar birds encountered was investigated. Two experiments measured the time taken by individual birds to move past other birds in order to reach a preferred area. Birds were trained to move out of a small, empty cage (cage 1), down a runway and into a larger cage containing food, water and shavings (cage 2). In experiment 1, a third cage (cage 3) protruded into the runway. In the four treatments, cage 3 contained a dominant bird, a subordinate bird or an unfamiliar bird, or was empty (control). Compared with the other three treatments, birds took significantly longer to enter cage 2 when cage 3 contained an unfamiliar bird. In experiment 2, there were four middle cages in order to vary the number of unfamiliar caged birds (0, 2 or 4) which the test bird had to pass. Test birds took longer to enter cage 2 as the number of caged birds that they had to pass increased. Thus, social factors appeared to influence the movement of individual birds in this small-scale experimental situation.

AB Learning when and how to perform displays could be important for the development of normal aggressive behaviour. This paper examines the effects of associating threat displays with the disappearance of an opponent in three-spined stickleback fish, Gasterosteus aculeatus. It was predicted that making the opponent 'go away' each time the test subject displayed should reward the use of head-down threat: trained fish should increase the probability of threat relative to other aggressive acts. Threat became more common and was more quickly used by rewarded fish. Continuous-time Markov chain models of the sequence of actions showed that the relative chance of changing from other acts to the threat display was increased in reinforced fish. However, none of the changes was outside the range of normal variation seen in untrained individuals.

   RESIDENCY; ASYMMETRY; DISPUTES; SYSTEM; SIZE; WAR
AB Male Calopteryx maculata (Odonata) damselflies engage in prolonged, highly escalated aerial contests for mating territories. A previous study (Marden and Waage 1990, Anim. Behav., 39, 954-959) found that winners of contests had a higher fat content than losers in 88% of cases, whereas differences in physical variables related to size and flight ability were not related to the outcome of contests. Here that study is extended in order to determine whether contests proceed until one contestant reaches a lower physical limit in fat reserve, or alternatively, whether contestants are able to assess each other's fat reserves and thereby settle contests before physical limits are reached. The physical limitation hypothesis was not supported, as losers showed no reduction in variability of fat content relative to winners. The assessment hypothesis was supported by an increase in the accuracy of the 'fatter wins' rule with increasing contest duration. Winners were fatter in 17 of 25 (68%) short contests (duration <500 s), versus 20 of 21 (95%) long contests (>500 s), which suggests a gradual accumulation of information during contests. The assessment hypothesis was supported further by a negative relationship between contest duration and energetic asymmetry between contestants in long contests. Duration of long contests was also positively related to the total fat content of the two contestants, which suggests that the ability of contestants to perceive relative energetic status may vary depending on absolute levels of energy reserves. A model that assumes an asymptotic increase in flight performance with increasing fat content (i.e. Michaelis-Menten or 'saturation' kinetics) is proposed to explain the simultaneous effects of relative and absolute fat content on contest duration, and to examine possible mechanisms that damselflies use to assess each other's energy reserves.

AB Prolonged contact with urine odours from grouped non-breeding female house mice can delay puberty and inhibit oestrous cycling in female conspecifics, while urine cues from males and pregnant females have the opposite effects. The hypothesis that females regulate their exposure to conspecific odours according to the reproductive priming effects of the cues was tested by measuring the initial (within 15 min) and longer-term (after 24 h) behavioural responses of females towards paired nest and feeding sites carrying different odours. Individual pre-pubertal and adult subjects from grouped housing conditions, and adults that had been isolated, were provided with a choice of clean versus female-odoured resource sites (either own group, unfamiliar group, pregnant or non-pregnant isolate female odours), or with a choice of sites carrying odours having opposite priming effects (male or pregnant female versus grouped female odours). Results were not compatible with the hypothesis that females responded according to the potential priming effects of the odours. Instead, females appeared to respond according to the familiarity or novelty of an odour, while avoidance of odours from isolated pregnant or non-pregnant females suggested that adult females may use marks to avoid potentially defended nest sites. Adult and pre-pubertal females showed very different responses to familiar and novel stimuli, consistent with the more restricted ranges of juvenile mice within the parental territory.

AB The status of temporarily captive dippers was assessed in a laboratory arena with dyads competing for access to a perch. In this way dominance scores and a dominance ranking were obtained for each individual, which were largely independent of site-specific factors. Dominance scores were compared with basal metabolic rates (BMR) obtained by prior overnight measurement on the same individuals: dominant males had a higher BMR. Neither plumage colour nor body size measures (with one exception) were related to mass-specific metabolism. The energy cost of dominance was relatively small, however, when compared with daily energy expenditure of free-living dippers. It is concluded that the obligate metabolic costs of dominant behaviour were unlikely to have a significant effect on energy balance or survival.

TI TERRITORIAL SALAMANDERS ASSESS SEXUAL AND COMPETITIVE INFORMATION USING
   CHEMICAL SIGNALS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Adult male and female red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, gain information about gender and body size of conspecifics through chemical signals. Responses to information about gender differed between the sexes: females produced faecal pellets (territorial pheromonal markers) fastest when exposed to their own pheromones while males produced faecal pellets fastest when exposed to pheromones of females. These data suggest that for females the primary pheromonal function of faecal pellets is advertisement (i.e. defence) of their own areas, and that faecal pellets produced by males are of primary importance in the attraction of mates. Two types of responses to information concerning body size were found. (1) Both male and female intruders exposed to the pheromones of resident males tended to produce larger faecal pellets when the intruder and resident were of similar body sizes. This phenomenon was not observed when the resident was female. (2) Male intruders were significantly more aggressive when exposed to the pheromones of individuals of similar body size and more submissive when exposed to pheromones of individuals that were larger. Therefore, information about body size (an indicator of competitive ability) of males may be transmitted via chemical signals and may cause changes in the behaviour of conspecifics.

TI FEMALE HOUSE FINCHES PREFER COLORFUL MALES - SEXUAL SELECTION FOR A
   CONDITION-DEPENDENT TRAIT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, vary in plumage coloration from pale yellow to bright red. Mate preferences of wild-caught female house finches relative to male coloration were tested in controlled laboratory experiments. In experiments in which they had a choice of four males, test females displayed a significant association preference for the most colourful male presented. Male coloration was independent of age, size, dominance, vocal activity and movement rate in these  experiments, and females showed no significant association preference for any of these male characters. When they had females to choose among, test females displayed no association preference. In a concurrent field study in southeastern Michigan, paired males were significantly more colourful than males in the population at large. Variation in male plumage coloration is a function of dietary intake of carotenoid pigments. Female choice based on such a condition-dependent trait supports a key  prediction of the honest advertisement model of intersexual selection.

TI FEMALES OF THE LEK-BREEDING GREAT SNIPE, GALLINAGO-MEDIA, PREFER MALES
   WITH WHITE TAILS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The great snipe is an almost monomorphic, lek-breeding bird. One of the characters that differs between the sexes is the amount of white on the tail feathers, males having more white than females. The amount of white also increases with age. In this paper the function of a white tail in intersexual and intrasexual selection is examined. Males with experimentally enlarged white areas on the tails did not enjoy an advantage in male-male competition between territorial birds. This may be because  males test each other''s fighting ability directly rather than by using morphological cues. On the other hand, females appeared to use the amount of white as a cue in mate choice. It is proposed that females use this cue primarily at short distances.

TI SLEEP-SITE FIDELITY IN 2 PUERTO-RICAN LIZARDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations on the sleep behaviour of the brown anole, Anolis gundlachi, and the crested anole, Anolis cristatellus, were conducted at two ecologically distinct sites on the island of Puerto Rico. Lizards returned nightly to specific sleep locations, and for at least 5 consecutive nights, up to 98% returned to within 1 m of their initial night''s sleep site. Additionally, 55% of the A. gundlachi and 21% of the A. cristatellus returned to within 10 cm of the original night''s sleep site.  Daytime activity ranges were significantly greater than nightly variation in sleep-site location. Additional data were collected on (1) sleep posture and body dimensional plane, (2) sleep-site height, and (3) the type of vegetation used for sleep sites (e.g. broad leafed plants versus narrow leafed plants etc.). Lizards selected sleep sites in proportion to the plant type available in the respective habitat. Sleep-site height was positively correlated with lizard size, and the modal pattern of sleep posture included a snout direction toward the stem of the leaf and the head above or aligned with the horizontal body plane. The consistent selection of a site near the previous night''s location suggests that lizards have reserved a specific area of their home range for sleep. A survey of nocturnal predators and observations of a predatory event on a lizard displaced from its sleep site suggest that immobilization on the foliage surface is an adaptive strategy for avoiding predation.

TI VOCAL RECOGNITION OF PUPS BY MOTHER MEXICAN FREE-TAILED BATS,
   TADARIDA-BRASILIENSIS-MEXICANA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability of Mexican free-tailed bat mothers and pups to recognize vocalizations of their presumptive kin (pup isolation calls and mother echolocation calls, respectively) was tested using playbacks of recorded calls. Captive individuals were presented with calls of two bats, one presumptive kin and the other a stranger, from opposite sides of a circular wire arena. Response was determined by amount of time spent on each side of the arena, time spent in contact with a cloth bat model in front  of each speaker, and number of separate contacts with each model. For the latter two measures, mothers showed a significant preference for the calls of their presumptive pups. Pups were attracted to adult echolocation calls, but did not show preference for calls of different mothers. The ages of pups appears to have had no effect on the responsiveness of either pups or mothers to the playbacks. This study demonstrates vocal kin recognition by mothers, and suggests an important role for acoustic cues in mother-pup reunions in this species. The findings do not preclude the possibility that vocal recognition of mothers by pups also occurs.

TI TESTS OF THE SEQUENTIAL RANDOMNESS OF VIGILANT BEHAVIOR USING
   SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many animals interrupt feeding bouts in order to scan for predators; the initiation of a vigilant scan has been interpreted as a random event because the inter-scan interval (ISI) has a frequency distribution that does not differ from that produced by random models (e.g. the negative exponential distribution). This in itselt, however, is a test only of instantaneous (or ''local'') randomness and not of sequential (or ''complete'') randomness, since it does not consider the temporal sequence of  ISIs. Spectral analysis of data sets for a purple sandpiper, Calidris maritima, and Barbary doves, Streptopelia risoria, showed that, while the frequency distribution of ISIs may indicate instantaneous randomness in scanning behaviour, there are significant periodicities such that long and short ISIs cycle with a degree of predictability. Some functional costs of instantaneous randomness and benefits of sequential predictability in scanning behaviour are suggested.

TI QUEUING MODELS OF PREDATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINGENT BEHAVIORAL
   CHOICES FOR OPTIMAL FORAGERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Queueing models are developed for predators that make captures while handling. The predator ''serves'' prey by eating them, and ''customers'' captured while the predator is feeding represent a queue of prey awaiting ''service''. Holling''s disc equation for the type II functional response is shown to be a special case of a queueing model. Optimal foraging models for queueing predators predict that behavioural choices by predators should be contingent upon current queue size. For predators choosing between prey types, the decision to attack low-quality prey depends on queue size at intermediate densities of high-quality prey. At these densities, low-quality prey should be attacked if the predator is unoccupied, but ignored if the predator is already handling prey. For predators choosing when to abandon prey and resume searching, the giving up criterion is predicted to depend on current queue size. Predators should tolerate a greater degree of depletion of the food available in a prey item  (longer handling times) when there are no prey waiting in the queue. Studies of foraging in queueing predators have ignored the potential importance of such contingent behavioural choices. However, observations on the relationship between handling time and queue size in one queueing predator are consistent with predictions of the queueing model.

TI LEAVING HOME - PREDATION AND THE DISPERSAL OF LARVAE FROM THE MATERNAL
   BURROW OF BLEDIUS-SPECTABILIS, A SUBSOCIAL INTERTIDAL BEETLE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Females of the intertidal subsocial beetle, Bledius spectabilis Kraatz (Staphylinidae), look after their eggs and young larvae in burrows in saltmarsh mud. Field observations showed that the beetle larvae disperse from the maternal burrow towards the end of the first instar. The dispersing larvae belonged to a restricted age-group and dispersed only once, at night (between 2200 and 0400 hours). They moved rapidly on the surface of the saltmarsh soil in search of cracks and holes in which to start their own independent burrows. The nocturnal dispersal of the Bledius larvae overlapped with the activity on the soil surface of the predatory carabid beetle Dicheirotrichus gustavi Crotch. The ability of larvae of different ages to survive attack by the carabid was tested in field experiments. Young larvae taken from the maternal burrow were always eaten by the first carabid that attacked them. Older larvae taken from the maternal burrow and the dispersing larvae survived on average at least one attack by the carabid. By delaying dispersal until the latter part of the first instar, the larvae can significantly increase their chance of countering an attack by this predator during this critical phase. The maternal burrow therefore provides not only protection against the tide but a safe place in which the larvae can grow large enough to repulse predator attack.

TI LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN BLUEGILL FORAGING -
   HABITAT-SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Bluegill sunfixh, Lepomis macrochirus, are generalist predators that feed routinely in the vegetated and open-water habitats of North American freshwater lakes. These habitats differ in physical structure and resident prey communities, each requiring different searching behaviours for effective foraging. Laboratory feeding trials were conducted in aquaria containing vegetation and open-water habitats to detail the behavioural modifications used by bluegill to improve their habtitat-specific  foraging rates. In general, bluegill foraging in the open-water habitat learned to increase their searching speed, whereas bluegill foraging in the vegetation learned to search more slowly. These changes are interpreted within the context of a model of bluegill searching behaviour. Although individuals modified their searching behaviour to match the requirements of particular prey types, density and habitat structure, individuals were not equally flexible and differed in their asymptotic  searching tactics. These differences in searching tactics translate into differences in habitat-specific foraging efficiency.

TI SIMULTANEOUS CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR AND IN LATERALIZATION DURING THE
   DEVELOPMENT OF MALE AND FEMALE DOMESTIC CHICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Chicks reared by a broody hen under semi-natural conditions showed sharp changes in behaviour at ages when there are sharp changes in lateralization of function in the central nervous system. On day 8 of life sustained examination of mobile objects (other than the mother) appeared suddenly and peaked. Day 8 was also the day when there was unique bias towards control of response by the visual systems fed by the right eye (''right eye system''). On day 10 for the first time chicks began to move independently of the mother, going out of sight and further from her. On day 10 there was also a shift towards control by the left eye system, which has special interest in spatial relations of stimuli and greater ability to orient by environmental features. Female chicks remained closer to the mother, which may reflect lesser specialization of the left eye system than in male chicks. Obvious and functionally important changes in behaviour during development therefore appear to be closely linked with shifts in which eye system controls behaviour.

TI THE ACTIVE SPACE OF BLUE MONKEY AND GREY-CHEEKED MANGABEY VOCALIZATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The audible distance of 11 primate vocalizations uttered by blue monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis, and grey-cheeked mangabeys, Cercocebus albigena, and the human utterance ''hey'' were determined experimentally. Calculations were based on measurements of (1) sound power of vocal signals (Brown: Bioacoustics, in press), (2) the attenuation rates of sound of different frequencies in east African forests (Waser and Brown: Am. J. Primatol., 1986, 10, 135-154), and (3) sensitivty of conspecific listeners to vocal signals presented in forest noise. Calculations were made of the active space, the area over which a call is signals presented in forest noise. Calculations were made of the active space, the area over which a call is audible, and the expected number of recipients of signals in nature. Masked threshold for test vocalizations ranged from 21.1 dB for the mangabey ''staccato bark'' call to 41.3 dB for the blue monkey ''boom'' vocalization. The audible distance of the test signals ranged from 79 m for the blue monkey ''chirp'' call to 1951 m for the mangaey ''chorused grunt'' vocalization. Calls could be grouped into short- and long-range signals. The audible distance of primate long-range calls a varied between 2.4 and nine times that of a typical yell given by human subjects. The active space of the test signals ranged from 1.4 to 1031.8 ha. The mean active space of monkey long-range calls (445.4 ha) was more than an order of magnitude greater than the loudest human yell.  The average blue monkey long-range call was audible for 1880 m. The typical mangabey home range is four times that of the blue monkey, and in both species the average long-range call had an audible distance twice the diameter of the median home range of each species.

TI FORAGING DECISIONS - PATCH CHOICE AND EXPLOITATION BY PIGEONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six pigeons, Columba livia, served as subjects in a foraging analogue testing the predictions, both qualitative and quantitative, of optimal foraging theory as applied to patchy environments. The operant procedure modelled the events of a foraging episode, including depletion of patch resources. The encounter rates with the rich and poor patch-types were varied, either together or separately, in each of four experiments, and the effects on patch choice behaviour and patch exploitation were  noted. Most of the qualitative predictions of optimal foraging theory were supported: (1) rich patch-type opportunities were nearly always accepted; (2) as the encounter rate with the rich patch-type decreased, subjects became less selective and began to accept poor patch opportunities; and (3) the acceptance of the poor patch-type closely, though not always, approximated an all-or-none pattern. However, contrary to optimal foraging theory''s prediction, variation in the encounter rate with only the poor patch-type did influence patch choice behaviour. As predicted, the extent of patch exploitation increased as environmental quality decreased; however, subjects over-exploited patches relative to the quantitative predictions of optimal foraging theory.

TI FEMALE FEMALE AGGRESSION AND MALE INDIFFERENCE IN RESPONSE TO UNFAMILIAR
   INTRUDERS IN LION TAMARINS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of intolerance toward unfamiliar conspecifics in promoting exclusivity of mating and preferential association among breeding pairs was examined in captive golden lion tamarins, Leontopithecus rosalia. In their home cage, resident breeding pairs were presented with an intruder that varied in sex and age (adult or subadult). Resident female tamarins directed high levels of attack, agonistic displays, and approaches toward subadult and approaches toward subadult and adult female  intruders. Male residents, in contrast, showed virtually no attack responses to intruders of any sex-age class, and showed only moderate levels of agonistic displays in the presence of adult male intruders. Attacks and threats by resident females were associated wth the number of subadult helpers present in the social group: females in groups with more helpers present exhibited higher levels of aggression to intruders. The results suggest that female intolerance of conspecifics may be important  in the regulation of sociosexual relationships in breeding pairs, and that female-female reproductive competition is particularly extreme in this species.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF RELATEDNESS AND DISPLAY EFFORT ON THE MATE CHOICE OF
   CAPTIVE FEMALE AMERICAN KESTRELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Females American kestrels, Falco sparverius, were given the opportunity to choose between two males differing with respect to relatedness and nestling experience. Females did not discriminate against sibling males when choosing mates. Male display activity (number of nestbox inspections) was recorded and significantly more females chose the most active male. American kestrels suffer high yearly mortality, and the scarcity of suitable nesting cavities limits their breeding densities. Thus, there may be little selection pressure for incest avoidance by means of kin recognition. However, male display efforts may play a role in the choice of mates.

TI GROUP-STRUCTURE, WITHIN-GROUP CONFLICT AND REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS IN
   COOPERATIVELY BREEDING GALAPAGOS MOCKINGBIRDS, NESOMIMUS-PARVULUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Reproductive conflict within groups can be an important feature of cooperative breeding systems, especially when more than one individual of a sex breeds within a social group. Relationships between group structure, dominance, within-group conflict and reproductive tactics of cooperatively breeding Galapagos mockingbirds were examined on Isla Genovesa. Territorial groups of 2-24 adults included up to three breeding females, with 42% of the groups containing more than one (plural groups);  females in most plural groups nested separately. Territory size increased with group size, but the area available per pair in plural groups was smaller than in singular groups (groups with only one breeding pair). Most pairings were monogamous, and males usually outnumbered females; high-ranking males obtained mates more frequently than subordinate males. In 3 relatively dry years, but not in a wet El Nino year, subordinate pairs in plural groups fledged fewer young than dominant pairs or pairs breeding in singular groups. Interference by dominant breeders, often leading to abandonment of nests by subordinate pairs, appears to account for these differences: through nest disruption in drier years, dominant individuals may reduce the cost of sharing their territories and increase the chances of recruiting helpers. Dominant males in plural groups may also father young through extra-pair copulations with subordinate females. Despite costs imposed by within-group conflict, subordinate  breeders have higher long-term reproductive success than birds than defer breeding. Plural group structure is maintained because unpredictable climatic variation favours opportunistic breeding by subordinates.

TI MARKOV-MODELS FOR SOCIAL INTERACTIONS - ANALYSIS OF
   ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION IN THE HYPOTHALAMIC AGGRESSION AREA OF RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The analysis of experimental effects on social interactions is extremely difficult since animals usually react to one another''s behavior as well as to the experimental treatment. Methods are described to analyse both treatment effects and social influence, based on a description by a continuous time Markov chain model, where the states represent combinations of acts of the interacting individuals. These methods were applied to agonistic interactions of rats under the influence of subthreshold  electrical stimulation at a specific site in the hypothalamus. Above the threshold intensity such stimulation induced attacks in a situation where there is normally no violent behavior. Subthreshold experiments at different intensities were performed to study the relation between the activated neural mechanism and agonistic interactions without fighting. There were two behaviorally different periods during each observation period. The opponent''s behavior as well as current intensity  significantly affected the experimental animal''s behavior in both periods, although the effects were different in the two periods. Both effects were most profound in the second period. In this period increased current intensity made experimental animals more self-directed and yet more reactive to the opponent''s behavior. Furthermore, opponents reduced the amount of contact behavior shown by the experimental animals. Indeed it appears that their behavior is aimed at reducing contact.

TI PREFERENCES OF CEDAR WAXWINGS IN THE LABORATORY FOR FRUIT SPECIES, COLOR
   AND SIZE - A COMPARISON WITH FIELD OBSERVATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Fruit preferences of cedar waxwings, Bombycilla cedrorum, in the laboratory were compared with preferences in the field to identify fruit characteristics that influence choice by avian dispersers. Waxwings ate 12 of 13 species of fruits offered individually in laboratory tests, but in the field ate only 8 of the same 13 spercies. When given a choice of 10 fruits species offered simultaneously, waxwings showed a strong preference for fruits that were small or red. Preferences for fruit species in the laboratory were not correlated with morphological or nutritional characteristics of the fruits. When offered food that differed only in color, waxwings initially preferred red over blue, yellow and green. In later tests, preference for red fruit was less marked. In tests for size preference, waxwings preferred small pieces of fruit (6 mm) over medium pieces (9 mm), and medium pieces over those that were large (12 mm). Sizes of fruits preferred in the field and in the laboratory tests  were approximately 6.0-7.5 mm. Thus, waxwings can discern differences in food items and they have definite preferences. The lack of complete agreement between preferences for fruits in the field and in the laboratory suggests that factors important in the field but controlled in the laboratory (e.g. abundance, location) override preferences for certain fruits. However, some fruit characteristics, particularly size, were consistently influential in the laboratory and in the field.

AB The hypothesis that specialists have evolved behavioural adaptations to handle their preferred food types more efficiently than related generalist species were tested. Naive workers of the specialist bumblebee, Bombus consobrinus, were more efficient than those of generalist species is acquiring flower-handling skills on their speciality plant, Aconitum (monkshood). With no previous foraging experience, B. consorbrinus workers began probing in the vicinity of the nectary and quickly located the nectar. Generalists, on the other hand, showed no predisposition toward correct foraging on Aconitum. They probed in the wrong places, and many gave up before finding the nectar.

TI NESTMATE RECOGNITION IN CAMPONOTUS-FLORIDANUS CALLOW WORKER ANTS - ARE
   SISTERS OR NESTMATES RECOGNIZED
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Callow workers of the Florida carpenter ant, Camponotus floridanus Buckley, reared with their sisters displayed more aggressive acts towards unrelated unfamiliar foragers than towards related unfamiliar foragers. When callows were reared with foreign nurses they were more aggressive towards their own unfamiliar sisters than towards the unfamiliar sisters of their nurses. Thus callow workers recognized the sisters of the workers they were reared with as nestmates. This ability was not  dependent on whether or not callows received cues from older ants during their emergence. Similarly, a forager was less aggressive towards unfamiliar callows reared with its sisters than towards those reared with nurses unrelated to itself. In addition, foragers were less aggressive towards their callow sisters than towards unrelated callows, regardless of the relatedness between the foragers and the rearing nurses.

TI MALE QUALITY AND TERRITORY QUALITY IN THE GREAT TIT PARUS-MAJOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In this study there was no positive significant relationship between the quality of male great tits, as measured by average strophe length (a strophe is a short burst of song), and territory quality. (1) Males singing longer strophes did not defend territories in areas of higher recruitment, and (2) naturally settling males were better singers than replacement birds were. The second result was probably caused by a difference in age composition of the two groups, because naturally settling yearlings and replacement yearlings did not differ significantly in average strophe length. These observations on a non-migratory species are in contrast to those of several other studies on passerine birds, which were mostly concerned with migratory species. The relationship between male quality and territory quality is predicted to be closer in species that migrate than in non-migratory species.

TI WINTER TERRITORIALITY AND FLOCK COHESION IN THE BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEE
   PARUS-ATRICAPILLUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In northwest Massachusetts [USA], black-capped chickadees shifted foraging groups repeatedly each day during the winter. As a result, there was no clear distinction between flock members and floaters, but instead of a continuous gradation from birds that formed relatively stable association to those that shifted groups more frequently. Group territories were absent and individual territories were at most poorly defended, if present at all. This picture differs from other recently studied populations, where flock membership is stable and flock territories are clear. Comparison with other populations indicates that winter social structure in the black-capped chickadee may be sensitive to both winter food levels and the proportion of year-round residents. This indicates that cost-benefit analyses of winter social organization should consider factors acting throughout the year as well as the residence status of the wintering birds. The data suggest that flock size, population  density and home range size are sensitive to winter food on the study area, whereas territoriality and flock cohesion may respond more clearly to the local availability of breeding resources or the proportion of year-round residents.

TI EFFECTS OF BODY SIZE AND RESOURCE VALUE ON FIGHTING BEHAVIOR IN A
   JUMPING SPIDER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Fights between male Euophrys parvula, a New Zealand salticid spider, consist of a number of discrete ''stages'', of increasing intensity. Two aspects of these contests were investigated: (1) relative body size of the two opponents, and (2) the presence of a ''resource'' (a female model). In 92% of all contests where a size difference existed, the larger of the two opponents won. Content intensity (measured as the highest intensity behaviour elicited during the contest) was inversely correlated  with relative body size of the two opponents (measured as carapace width). Contests escalated further when the female model was present. No relationship was found between contest duration and either relative body size or the presence of the model. It is suggested that for contests in which a number of behaviours of different intensity are used, contest intensity may be a better estimate of contest cost than duration. The results are discussed in terms of theoretical models of contest behaviour.

TI SIBLING RECOGNITION IN THE WHITE-FOOTED MOUSE, PEROMYSCUS-LEUCOPUS -
   ASSOCIATION OR PHENOTYPE MATCHING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study was an attempt to determine whether sibling recognition in P. leucopus is mediated by phenotype matching or by association. A measure of social preference in a two-way choice apparatus was used to infer sibling recognition. Experiment 1 demonstrated that, when given a choice in the preference apparatus, adult mice spent significantly more time on the side with a familiar sibling (a sibling that had been reared together with the test animal) than on the side with an unfamiliar  non-sibling (a non-sibling that had been reared apart from the test animal). In experiment 2, pups were cross-fostered within the first 3 days of birth such that four combinations of sibship and association were formed: siblings reared together, siblings reared apart, non-siblings reared together, non-siblings reared apart. Mice showed a significant preference for siblings reared together versus siblings reared apart, and for non-siblings reared together as compared to siblings reared apart.  There were no significant differences in time spent near siblings reared together versus non-siblings reared together, nor between siblings reared apart versus non-siblings reared apart. These results demonstrate that association during early life, and not genetic relatedness per se, is the most important factor mediating sibling recognition and preference in this species. It is suggested that the major difference between phenotype matching and recognition by association is that, in the former  case, animals learn family-specific identification cues, while in the latter, they learn individually-distinctive cues that cannot be generalized to unfamiliar relatives.

TI SAMPLING OF SCHEDULE PARAMETERS BY PIGEONS - TESTS OF OPTIMIZING THEORY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In three experiments, pigeons (domesticated Columba livia) were exposed to concurrent random-ratio schedules of reinforcement in a keypecking apparatus, as a simulation of foraging in an environment containing two patches of unknown food density. All reinforcements were given for pecks on a single key, but different patch densities were associated with different key colours, and the colour was changed following pecks to a second key. Patch densities varied from day to day, and no colour reliably signalled the better patch from session to session. In the first experiment, either 256 or 1024 pecks were allowed per session. As predicted by optimal sampling theory, the proportion of the first 256 pecks made in the denser patch, and the number of reinforcements gained during them, were higher in the short than in the long sessions. These results were simulated using principles derived from operant conditioning theory. In the second experiment, the number of different patch densities used was varied between conditions. Birds made fewer patch changes when the density range was more restricted. In the third experiment, the colour cues differentiating patch densities were dropped in one condition, and the birds were less successful at finding the better patch in this condition. These results show that pigeons are sensitive to aspects of a foraging situation that are predicted by optimal sampling theory (e.g. the session length), and also in ways that have been considered so far (e.g. patch density range). But they also show that cues that are not logically necessary (e.g. patch key colour) may in practice be an essential part of an animal''s mechanism for achieving efficient foraging.

TI LANDMARK LEARNING BY HONEY-BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB There are two published models for landmark learning by honeybees: (1) bees remember only the presence or absence of landmarks in each of several sectors around a food source, or (2) bees store a visual image of the landmarks. Experiments reported here indicate that bees are able to remember landmarks pictorially, and store their location, shape and color. The angular resolution of the memory near the visual horizon is about 3.1.degree. horizontally and about 5.5.degree. vertically; this suggests that landmark memory has a higher resolution than the 8-10 measured for flower memory.

TI EFFECTS OF GENEALOGICAL RELATIONSHIP AND COLONY AGE ON THE DOMINANCE
   HIERARCHY IN THE PRIMITIVELY EUSOCIAL BEE LASIOGLOSSUM-ZEPHYRUM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Dominance interactions between queens and workers of the primitively eusocial bee Lasioglossum zephyrum (Hymenoptera:Halictidae) were affected by the genealogical relationship between them and by the age of the colony. The tendency of the queen to display certain dominance behaviours toward the workers was unaffected by genealogical relationship, but decreased with time, possibly indicating better colony integration. However, levels of aggression displayed by queens toward workers, and the reproductive status of the latter were higher when levels of genealogical relationship within colonies was low, indicating that kin recognition was important for the evolution of social behaviour in halictine bees.

TI COMPARISON OF THE BAND-COLOR PREFERENCES OF 2 SPECIES OF ESTRILDID
   FINCHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Band-colour preferences of the double-bar finch (Poephila bichenovii) were compared with those of their relative, the zebra finch (P. guttata), in order to test the hypothesis that attractiveness of leg band colour reflects naturally occurring differences in species coloration patterns. In both species, colours preferred in heterosexual tests were typical of that species while colours that were avoided were species-atypical and characteristic of the other species. These preferences probably reflect selection for species identification mechanisms in a taxon in which colour pattern appears to have played an important role in speciation.

TI VOCAL DEVELOPMENT IN VERVET MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations and playback experiments were used to study the development of grunts and alarm calls among free-ranging vervet monkeys. Results indicate that the production of vocalizations, their use in appropriate circumstances, and the response to the vocalizations of others emerge gradually during an individual''s first 4 years. Particularly in the case of grunts, different acoustic components develop at different rates. Immatures respond appropriately to the calls of others before they product appropriate vocalizations themselves. Finally, immature vocal development may be aided by cues received from adults. If an infant gives an alarm call to a genuine predator (as opposed to a non-predator), adults respond more strongly. When infants hear a playback of an alarm, they are more likely to respond appropriately if they first look at an adult.

TI COURTSHIP FEEDING IN DROSOPHILA-SUBOBSCURA .2. COURTSHIP FEEDING BY
   MALES INFLUENCES FEMALE MATE CHOICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male Drosophila subobscura provide females with a drop of regurgitated food during courtship. Males that were physically prevented from producing this drop (1) had reduced courtship success with starved, but not with fed, females; (2) positioned themselves in front of the female less frequently than males providing drops; and (3) had a smaller proportion of frontal displays which led to copulation. Males that produced small or watery drops also had reduced courtship success wtih starved, but  not with fed, females. The starved females moved away from such males more frequently than from males providing large or yeasty drops. Evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that the drops of food offered by males during courtship slow the moving female down, making it easier for the male to complete a frontal display, and to circle and attempt to mount before the female moves away after taking the food. The effectiveness of the drop in this role depends on its attractiveness to the  female, which is influenced by the drop''s size and content and by the female''s nutritional status.

TI SOME FACTORS INFLUENCING MALE MALE-AGGRESSION IN THE FIELD CRICKET
   GRYLLUS-INTEGER (TIME OF DAY, AGE, WEIGHT AND SEXUAL MATURITY)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male field crickets (Gryllus interger; Orthoptera: Gryllidae) stridulate aggressively and fight vigorously in competition for females. We studied the degrees to which male-male aggression is influenced by time of night or day, sexual maturity, age and weight. Trials were observed between males matched for age and/or weight that had not previously been exposed to each other. Data were gathered on attack latency, aggressive stridulation, time spent in aggressive interactions and the winner of a  trial. Aggression was equally likely to occur at any time of the day or night. Sexually mature males were more aggressive than adult males which had not yet produced a spermatophore. Age past sexual maturity did not greatly influence aggression, and heavy males were more aggressive than lighter ones. In repeated trials between the same males, one male in each pair won significantly more contests.

TI PERCENTAGE REWARD IN AN OPERANT ANALOG TO FORAGING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pigeons (Columba livia) responding on an operant conditioning analogue to foraging could either accept or reject a variable-interval 20-s schedule which always led to food or a variable-interval 5-s schedule which led to food on only a percentage of trials. The probability of accepting the certain alternative increased as the percentage of food trials for the uncertain alternative decreased. The probability of accepting the uncertain alternative increased with the percentage of food trials for this alternative. Subjects receiving all of their food in the experiment (''closed economy'') and those requiring supplementation (''open economy'') perferred whichever alternative provided the higher overall mean rate of reinforcement.

TI AGE-DIFFERENCES IN KLEPTOPARASITISM BY LAUGHING GULLS (LARUS-ATRICILLA)
   ON ADULT AND JUVENILE BROWN PELICANS (PELECANUS-OCCIDENTALIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The choice of victims by a population of adult and first-winter laughing gulls (L. atricilla) making attempts to steal food from adult and juvenile brown pelicans (P. occidentalis) were recorded. Adult gulls made food theft attempts on juvenile pelicans with a disproportionately great frequency; first-winter gulls appeared to select pelican victims at random. Adult pelicans were more frequently successful in their foraging attempts than juvenile pelicans, suggesting that adults may be more reliable as potential food sources for gulls making theft attempts. Juvenile pelicans attempted to evade kleptoparasitizing gulls less frequently than did adult pelicans, suggesting that the fish prey of juveniles may be more easily stolen. These patterns are discussed in relation to optimal victim choice by gulls, and to deferred maturity in both species.

TI CONCEPTS IN VERTEBRATE NEUROETHOLOGY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Neuroethology is concerned with the analysis of the neural substrates and mechanisms that underlie behavior. In 1951, Tinbergem implied the following goals of ethophysiology, today known as neuroethology: recognition and localization of behaviorally meaningful stimuli, e.g., key stimuli; sensorimotor interfacing and feedback interactions; modulations according to internal states and acquired information; motor pattern generation; and ontogenetic and phylogenetic aspects. Using the toad''s (Bufo bufo) visually-guided prey-catching behavior as an example, experimental strategies and concepts of vertebrate neuroethology are demonstrated. During early ontogeny the acuity of sensory discrimination and the performance of motor patterns are subject to maturation paralleled by neural differentiations in the brain. Those are programmed and, in amphibians, presumably less dependent on the interaction with the environment than in mammals. This of course does not exclude the possibility of modulating, modifying, specifying and/or extending the visual pattern recognition system of toads due to internal states and individual experience.

TI PIGEON HOMING - CHANGE IN NAVIGATIONAL STRATEGY DURING ONTOGENY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pigeons of various ages and experience were prevented from collecting meaningful information during the outward journey by being transported in either a distorted magnetic field or in total darkness. In very young, inexperienced birds, these manipulations caused disorientation, the effect decreasing as the birds grew older. Experienced, trained pigeons did not seem to be affected. These results suggest a switch in strategy during the development of the pigeons'' navigational system: young  pigeons first determine their home direction using information collected en route during the outward journey, but with increasing age and experience, they switch to using local ''map'' information obtained at the release site. The advantages of using a navigational ''map'' are discussed.

AB A series of tests with 4 tufted ducks, Aythya fuligula, feeding on fresh-water mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, was performed to test the hypothesis that tufted ducks select suboptimal mussel sizes to avoid the risk of taking items that are too large to be swallowed, or at least, have highly variable profitabilities. The largest mussel size class available influenced the overall pattern of selection and an increasing risk of taking unprofitable mussels caused a decrease in mean mussel size eaten. Some of the recorded differences between the birds tested could be explained by differences in the shape of the profitability curves for each individual.

TI SIBLING RECOGNITION IN THE PRAIRIE VOLE, MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Since mating is seldom observed between sibling prairie voles, M. ochrogaster, this behavioral discrimination was used to investigate sibling recognition in this species. Cross-fostering of 1-3-day-old pups demonstrated that unrelated pups reared together did not breed; siblings reared apart bred readily when paired at weaning. When unrelated voles were paired at 14 days of age, prior to sexual maturity, significantly fewer pairs bred than when strangers, were paired at 21 days of age.  Separation of 21-day-old siblings for 8 days before pairing overcame incest avoidance; a 15-day separation was required for breeding by siblings that had remained together until they were 50 days old. Sibling recognition and incest avoidance may depend on association prior to weaning.

LA English

AB Hybridization between the viviparous fishes Poeciliopsis monacha and P. lucida of northwestern Mexico has resulted in the formation of diploid and triploid all-female species, P. monacha-lucida and P. monacha-2 lucida. These females reproduce by mating back to P. lucida, and are essentially clonally reproducing sexual parasites superimposed on that species. In a series of behaviorial experiments, on diploid clone proved to be significantly more aggressive than one triploid and 4 other diploid clones. No differences in aggression were exhibited among the other 5 clones. The aggressiveness of this one clone may explain why only 2 clones live in the small tributary where it is found but up to 10 diploid and triploid clones occur where it is absent.

AB When vocal variability, here measured by song repertoire size, increases in songbirds, it may become increasingly difficult to encode genetically all the information which is required to ensure the learning of only conspecific songs. Marsh wrens (Cistothorus palustris) have sizeable song repertoires and while no vocal mimicry is evident in the field, males will readily learn heterospecific songs in the laboratory. These data, together with data from the literature, support the proposed relationship between increased repertoire sizes and reduced specificity of the innate auditory template which guides vocal learning.

TI THE FEEDING SUCCESS OF CATTLE EGRETS IN FLOCKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The feeding rates of grouped (< 1.5 m from conspecifics) and solo (> 5 m from conspecifics) cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis) in loose flocks away from cows were compared, to test the hypothesis that grouped cattle egrets benefit from feeding on prey flushed inadvertently by nearby conspecifics. The flock feeding rates were also compared to those of grouped and solo egrets near cows, to determine the effets of flock membership on feeding rates. Birds in flocks captured prey faster than those with cows, and tended to capture larger prey, but field observations and captive experiments failed to show that the feeding success of flock members was enhanced by the hypothesized beater effect. Increases in prey density, however, always resulted in higher feeding rates, so some cattle egret groups may form in response to local concentrations of prey. Prey size may also play a role in group formation, because birds in the field tended to feed at greater distances from their neighbors when larger prey were captured, regardless of prey density. When small groups did form among cattle egrets feeding on relatively large prey, group members occasionally captured prey items that had been discovered by nearby conspecifics. This beahavior was not observed among birds in dense aggregations, which fed on small, highly abundant prey. There was a potential cost associated with feeding too near others unless the prey are relatively small and abundant.

AB Behavioral effects of tactile stimulation were investigated in newly-born lambs, which had, or had not, been suckled. A smooth or woolly, warm or cold stimulus which covered 1 side of the face elicited in unsuckled lambs a forceful response resembling its teat-seeking approach to the dam: vigorous forward and upward head movements, munching and sucking. Smaller amounts of tactile stimulation applied at discrete facial sites showed that most head movements occurred in response to touch on the  upper surfaces of the face and most oral activity in response to touch on the muzzle. The response to touch was less in lambs which had been suckled, even when age was kept constant. Results were discussed in terms of the natural situation and of the response to touch in the 40-80 day fetus.

TI THE FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF LACEWING LARVAE ON VERTICAL RODS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The foraging behavior of lacewing larvae (C. carnea Stephens, Chrysopidae, Neuroptera) on verticle lucite rods was observed under a variety of experimental conditions to investigate the decision processes responsible for the distribution of foraging effort. Food deprivation increased the duration of searching on all parts of the rod: contact with prey at the rod tip induced only a local enhancement of searching activity. Searching at the rod tip did not decline with repeated trials on the same rod, but the duration of searching on the rest of the rod was reduced, evidently reflecting recognition and avoidance of previously searched substrates. There were indications that the larvae compensated for changes in the surface area, radius of curvature and length of the rod. Searching patterns at the tip and on the rest of the rod proved to be independently modifiable, suggesting a 2-tiered hierarchy of foraging decisions. The total duration of the search depended primarily on the pattern of vertical movement and the number of reascents, rather than the searching effort/unit area. Evidence of a negative geotaxis was found only during the initial ascent of the rod and no sequential pattern in the lengths of vertical excursions was observed. The decision process appeared to involve a combination of variable control factors interacting with a generally constant, random probability of change or reversal of direction. The resulting investment of foraging time corresponding surprisingly well with expectations derived from optimal foraging theory, thereby testifying to the power of approximate, semi-random decision processes.

TI THE CONTRIBUTION OF TEMPORAL SONG CUES TO SPECIES RECOGNITION IN THE
   RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The trill portion of red-winged blackbird (A. phoeniceus) song is necessary and sufficient for species recognition. Trills of red-winged blackbird songs near Ithaca, New York [USA] contain 40-107 pulses/s. Playbacks of unpulsed sound matched in spectral structure to eastern red-winged blackbird trills and of California blackbird trills with average pulse repetition rates of 32.5, 120 or 200 pulses/s, elicit little or no response from Ithaca red-winged blackbirds. These birds respond strongly to presentation of a California red-winged blackbird trill with 50 pulses/s. Ithaca red-winged blackbirds discriminate against spectrally-appropriate signals with temporal structures not normally heard in the songs of this population. The upper and lower temporal limits to species recognition are sharply defined. Fine temporal intra-pulse structure was analyzed in red-winged blackbird trills of varying pulse repetition rate and in the trill portion of a northern mockingbird (Mimus  polyglottos) imitation of red-winged blackbird song, which evoked a vigorous response when played to blackbirds. Pulse duration remains relatively fixed even though pulse period changes widely in true red-winged blackbird trills. Red-winged blackbird trill pulses are much shorter in duration than mockingbird pulses. For a given trill rate both signals share a common frequency emphasis. The equivalence of these 2 signals in playbacks with red-winged blackbirds suggests that pulse repetition rate and frequency composition are important in species recognition.

TI BATTERY HENS NAME THEIR PRICE - CONSUMER DEMAND THEORY AND THE
   MEASUREMENT OF ETHOLOGICAL NEEDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of an ethological need has assumed a prominent place in recent discussions of animal welfare, although the term itself is surrounded by confusion. Some of this confusion might be overcome by applying consumer demand theory to some of the problems of animal welfare. The postulated need of battery-caged hens to scratch and dustbathe is reinterpreted in this light, using the economic definition of a necessity. Two attempts to measure the value that hens put on access to litter are reported. In experiment 1, birds were required to make an instantaneous choice between food and litter under different degrees of food deprivation. In experiment 2, choices were observed over longer periods of time under changes of income (time available). In neither case was there evidence of hens regarding litter as a necessity but these results should be regarded only as preliminary.

TI SENSORY CONTROL OF SUCKLING-ASSOCIATED BEHAVIORS IN THE DOMESTIC NORWAY
   RAT, RATTUS-NORVEGICUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A detailed parametric study of suckling under different stimulus conditions in rat pups of different ages was presented. The effects of deprivation, nipple odors and background female (dam vs. virgin) odors on suckling-associated behaviors in 7, 13 and 18-day-old domestic, albino Norway rats (R. norvegicus) were examined by placing pups individually on the ventrum of anesthetized adult female rats and videotaping the behavior of the pups for 5 min. Suckling deprivation (deprivation time increased with each progressive age-group) markedly increased most active behaviors and reduced resting. Deprivation also sensitized pups to the olfactory configuration formed by the combination of nipple odors and background female odors. The presence of configurations discrepant from that of the normal dam greatly augmented both searching in Day 7 pups and licking in Day 18 pups. Nipple odors exerted direct control over probing.

TI RESPONSES TO CONTEXT-SPECIFIC AND INDIVIDUAL-SPECIFIC CUES IN COTTON-TOP
   TAMARIN LONG CALLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two variants of cotton-top tamarin long calls that occur in different situations were identified: communication between troops and intratroop calling. A discriminant analysis differentiated between the forms of the 2 variants with a classification accuracy of 98%. Discriminant analyses and analyses of variance also differentiated between the call structures of individual animals for each type of long call. A playback experiment elicited alerting, arousal and aggressive responses only to the calls of non-troop members. Aggressive behavior patterns were elicited by the intertroop long call variant (normal long call) and not by the within troop variant (quiet long call). The long call variants are perceived as different by the monkeys and elicit functionally different responses. Several parallels exist between the long calls of tamarins and the song of birds.

AB Oystercatchers feeding on mussels foraged in small, overlapping areas and aggressive encounters were common among all birds irrespective of their method of opening mussels. Individuals varied consistently in aggressiveness. The more aggressive birds were more frequently present on the mussel bed, fed in those parts where food was most abundant, and were more successful in stealing mussels from other birds. Only the more aggressive birds stole more mussels than they had stolen from them, and stealing increased their rate of food intake.

AB The water collection behavior of colony foundresses of a Japanese paper wasp, P. c. antennalis, was recorded. A single round-trip of water collection consists of an outward flight, water-sucking and a homeward flight. The rate of water intake decreased as the length of water-sucking increased. The duration of the outward flight correlated positively with that of water-sucking. The variance of time for outward flights was larger than that for homeward flights. The data were consistent with the predictions of the central place foraging model of Orians et Pearson (1979).

   (MIROUNGA-LEONINA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The aggressive and maternal behavior of 44 individually-marked female southern elephant seals, M. leonina, were studied at South Georgia. Evidence of dominance and subordination could be determined in only 29% of 1315 encounters, but dominance-subordination relationships were observed in 49% of known cow dyads. Status was not necessarily size- or age-related, but most young, small cows were of low status. High-status cows reared larger pups which were bitten less frequently than pups of low-status cows. Orphaned pups were bitten at least 3 times as frequently as pups with mothers. Cows with pups initiated more interactions than pregnant cows, and were dominant more frequently. Older cows responded to their newborn pup more rapidly and intensively than did younger cows; this difference can be important in crowded breeding assemblies. Cow and pup behavior in M. leonina at South Georgia is compared with that of M. angustirostris in California, USA. The main differences are thought to relate to differences in population density.

TI MECHANISMS UNDERLYING EATING-DRINKING TRANSITIONS IN RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB McFarland (1969) suggested 2 mechanisms whereby a switch could occur from 1 activity to another: competition, which he depicted as a gradual increase in the causal-factor strength (CFS) of activity 2; and disinhibition, which he depicted as a sudden decrease in the CFS of activity 1. Two further mechanisms are postulated: satiation, depicted as a gradual decrease in the CFS of activity 1, and inhibition, depicted as a sudden increase in the CFS of activity 2. Disinhibition may be a less common mechanism of behavioral switching than is usually supposed. Three experiments are described suggesting that eat/drink and drink/eat switches in the rat occur by competition and/or satiation rather than by disinhibition and/or inhibition. In experiment 1, varying degrees of water deprivation affected the timing of eat/drink switches in food-deprived rats; in experiment 2, varying rates of food availability affected the timing of drink/eat switches in water-deprived rats; in experiment 3, drink/eat switches were delayed by allowing rats to drink air instead of water.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB D. melanogaster carrying either of the mutations sev or dipp6 show defective phototactic behavior owing to deficiencies in the processing of visual information perceived by the central retinula cells (R7, R8). Mutant females show increased time to mating because the deficient visual input via this subsystem has an inhibitory effect on female receptivity. Similarly. deficient input through the peripheral retinula cells (R1-R6) also makes females sexually unreceptive. Thus females require appropriate visual stimulation through both subsystems to become maximally sexually receptive. One major source of this stimulation is the red eye of the male.

Although males'' rates of behavior did not differ from females'' rates when the sexes were compared regardless of group composition, males from all-male groups played at higher rates than females from all-female groups. Females'' rates of behavior declined as the number of male companions decreased. Males'' behavior was little influenced by the number of females in the group. Females with male companions behaved more like males than did females with no male companions, but this was not because they directed behavior to brothers at higher rates than to sisters.

TI GROOMING IN CRICKETS - TIMING AND HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The variations in structural and timing principles underlying grooming are examined in the cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus. Two situations were studied: normal grooming and grooming that appears with locomotion in an unfamiliar environment. Normal grooming appears to be controlled by a hierarchy of random processes. Transitions between grooming acts are based on anatomical proximity, while hierarchical clusters are based on body regions. Acts per bout, acts per cluster, and clusters per bout are all random variables that follow geometric distributions; pauses between acts are also randomly distributed. In the unfamiliar environment, time-sharing appears to control the transition between locomotion and grooming. The study shows how a hierarchy can account for timing and structure in a behavioral sequence and how control principles changes with variations in functional priority.

TI INCREASED PREFERENCES FOR FAMILIAR FOODS IN SMALL MAMMALS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB After being confined to a diet of oats or wheat, individuals of 4 small mammal species [Mus musculus, Apodemus sylvaticus, Clethrionomys glareolus, Microtus agrestis] showed an increase in preference for the more familiar diet. There was no difference between the 4 spp. in the extent to which the preference increased. In only 1 sp. did the new preference show a decline during 30 days after a return to a mixed diet of oats and wheat. A likely ultimate evolutionary explanation for the change in preference is an increase in digestive efficiency on current diets. Such changes in digestive efficiency will mean that the optimal food choice will vary with what the animal has recently eaten.

TI SONG REPERTOIRES IN THE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD (AGELAIUS-PHOENICEUS) - A
   TEST OF THE BEAU-GESTE HYPOTHESIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Song repertoires in the red-winged blackbird (A. phoeniceus) were studied to test the hypothesis that song repertoires have evolved to mimic high density. Song types within a repertoire were as variable as those sung by different males. Males often switched song type when they switched perch. Males with large repertoires sang at faster rates than those with small repertoires, but repertoire size did not affect bout length or bout rate. Rate of habituation was a function of repertoire size. Empty territories occupied by speakers broadcasting song repertoires were more successfully defended than those occupied by speakers broadcasting single song types. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that song repertoires function to signal the status of the singer.

TI SYSTEMS OF MATE SELECTION IN A COCKROACH SPECIES WITH MALE-DOMINANCE
   HIERARCHIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The system of mate selection in the cockroach, N. cinerea, was studied experimentally. The dominant male in a group mates more often than expected if random mating were occurring. The presence of a female usually does not result in changes in the dominance hierarchy, but the frequency of certain behavioral patterns in intermale interactions changes after introduction of the female. Females can discriminate between dominant and non-dominant males on the basis of odor. The experimental approach to this question is somewhat confounded by turning tendencies of the females; data are presented relating female choice to turning tendency.

TI DOMINANCE AND DISPERSAL BETWEEN FEEDING SITES IN THE HERRING GULL
   (LARUS-ARGENTATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The feeding behavior and movements of individually marked herring gulls at refuse tips were observed during the winters of 1973-1976. Refuse tips were used more by adult than by immature gulls. Adult female and immature gulls were more transient than adult males, changed their feeding sites more often, and used the secondary rather than the main feeding area of a tip more than the adult males. Individuals feeding in the main area fed at a higher rate and were involved in more aggressive encounters than those in the secondary area. Competition between adults and immatures and a tendency for adult males to be the most dominant bring about the dispersal between feeding sites of the adult females and the immatures.

TI EFFECT OF SCHOOL SIZE ON THE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF MINNOW SCHOOLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Varying the number of fish in schools of minnows (P. phoxinus) affects their 3-dimensional structure and internal dynamics. Single pairs of fish may be considered a school, but internal organization and structure of 2-fish schools are quantitatively different from those for longer schools. Time series analyses show that correlations between fishes'' instantaneous velocities increase with school size and as interfish distances decrease. Average cross-correlations of fishes'' velocites indicate that leader/follower relationships are common in 2-fish schools, but they are not seen for schools with more fish in them. Pairs of fish tend to swim one behind another and on the same level, but larger schools take on a more 3-dimensional appearance.

TI TRAIL-FOLLOWING BEHAVIOR IN 2 SPECIES OF WOLF SPIDERS - SENSORY AND
   ETHO-ECOLOGICAL CONCOMITANTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The trail-following behavior of male Lycosa rabida and L. punctulata (in response to draglines of females) was analyzed by high-speed cinematography (36-180 frames/s). L. rabida exhibited 2 modes of following, while L. punctulata showed 3 modes. One mode, palpal-sliding, was common to both species. During all modes of trail-following both species utilized the medial surface of the palpal tarsus, the surface having the highest concentration of chemosensitive sensilla. Film analyses suggested that male L. rabida used mechanical cues more than did L. punctulata. A significantly higher number of chemosensitive sensilla in male L. punctulata was related to this species'' greater reliance on chemical rather than mechanical cues, the reverse being true in L. rabida. Different microhabitat preferences of the 2 spp. may have shaped the differential use of cues for trail-following.

AB Twelve pairs of Mongolian gerbils were observed raising 15 litters. Both parents performed parental activities. Within pairs, associations were found between the behaviors of the parents. If one parent was active outside the nest, the other was likely to be relatively inactive in the nest. These non-random behavioral associations existed even though overall activity tendencies of members of pairs were similar. As a consequence of these patterns of behavior, the pups were seldom left unattended; the adaptive significance of parental presence is discussed.

TI MECHANISMS OF SPACING IN GROUPS OF JUNCOS - MEASUREMENT OF BEHAVIORAL
   TENDENCIES IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To investigate behavioral mechanisms that regulate the spacing of individuals, aggression, and approach and avoidance of captive male juncos (J. hyemalis) were studied in relation to the distance between individuls. Behavioral tendencies were measured by analyzing the terminations of social states so as to determine the instantaneous probability rates of terminal actions. These rates permit accurate comparisons of behavioral tendencies in different social situations. An individual''s tendencies to supplant, approach or withdraw from an opponent depended on the dominance relationship of the 2 birds, and on the distance between them. Interactions did not vary with the magnitude of the difference between opponents'' ranks. The dependence of aggression, and approach and avoidance on the distance between opponents controls the spacing of individuals.

AB Male flies homozygous for the gene ebony11 are partially blind, and at a disadvantage in competitive mating. The courtship of the mutant males is deficient in wing vibration stimulation, which is characterized by a low proportion of sine song and a high intra-pulse frequency. Males heterozygous for ebony have normal vision, but show an increase in courtship song, and are superior in competitive mating to wild type males. The auditory characteristics of courtship song produced by heterozygous males are indistinguishable from those of wild type, and their superiority in competitive mating success is due to overdominance involving this specific element of male courtship behavior.

TI TRACKS OF PIGEONS HOMING WITH FROSTED LENSES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pigeons were equipped with frosted contact lenses that prevented any detailed view of landmarks and were tracked during their homing trips by ground based and airborne radiotelemetry. Experimental birds (74) were released from various directions less than 20 km from home. Nineteen pigeons returned to the loft, 18 stopped en route and were retrieved and 37 were lost. In addition to 5 tracks of birds weaning clear lenses, 18 birds wearing frosted lenses were tracked. These experimental pigeons, despite their frosted lenses and severely restricted vision, flew generally towards the home loft. Whereas many of these birds landed in an area near the loft, no bird that was tracked landed on the loft itself. Pigeons apparently use a navigation system that does not require detailed vision and is accurate enough to lead birds to within 0.5-5 km of their home.

Feeding rate (number taken per meter) on large worms depended mainly on their density in the mud. Feeding rate on small worms was more influenced by the biomass ingested from large worms than by their own density so that small worms were only taken frequently when large ones were scarce, suggesting that small prey were least preferred. Experiments with a mathematical model of the birds foraging behavior suggested that the tendency to vary their responsiveness to small worms as a function of the biomass ingested from large ones did indeed maximize ingestion rate.

AB The effects of resident and intruder sex and size upon aggressive behavior exhibited by sunfish during 30 min observation sessions were studied. Bluegill sunfish (L. macrochirus Rafinesque) in non-reproductive condition were subjects in both experiments. Residents occupied 95 l aquaria for 7 days prior to the introduction of an intruder at the start of an observation session. The paradigm allows independent assessment of the effects of both resident-aggressor sex (or size) and intruder-aggressor sex (or size). Neither resident sex or intruder sex exerted significant effects on resident aggressiveness. Large residents exhibited more responses to both large and small intruders than did small residents. Implications of these findings for perceptual mechanisms underlying the release of bluegill aggression are discussed.

TI INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES IN AGGRESSIVENESS OF FEMALE HAMSTERS - RESPONSE
   TO INTACT AND CASTRATED MALES AND TO FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The aggressive behavior of female hamsters [Mesocricetus auratus] was studied while they were housed in large enclosures with males and in brief tests with males or females. Some females are not aggressive with any male; others are very aggressive toward all males in both testing conditions. Females that are not aggressive toward intact males may be very aggressive toward castrated males or females. When the animals are housed together for long periods of time, males dominate only if they are much heavier. Male dominance takes a relatively long time to establish, and often there is an equivocal period characterized by reversals of dominance. Female dominance is rapidly established. Unless the male is much heavier, the female determines the presence or absence of agonistic behavior.

AB Doves [Streptopelia risoria] were tested for progesterone-induced incubation after they had acquired previous experience with from 1-5 different phases of their initial breeding cycle. A 6th group had no previous breeding experience. Previous breeding experience inclusive of at least the nestbuilding phase of the cycle is a significant facilitator of incubation behavior induced by injected progesterone, but previous experience with only the courtship phase was not sufficient. Experience with phases additional to nestbuilding increased overall nest-responsiveness without significantly increasing the number of birds incubating. The nature of a ring dove''s previous experience is therefore an important influence in its behavioral response to exogenous progesterone.

TI PARENTAL INVESTMENT - PROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It is a feature of the 3 described models that 2 alternative strategies are often possible; the duck strategy in which the male deserts and only the female cares for the young, and the stickleback strategy in which only the male cares for the young. These 2 possibilities are likely if one parent is almost as effective as 2 in caring for the young, and if the prospects of a deserting parent mating again are good. In those species in which the strategy is for 1 parent to desert, it well tend to be the male which cares for the young if the female has invested so much in eggs that she cannot effectively do so, or if there is an excess of males; it will tend to be the female which cares for the young if the timing of mating is such that a deserting male has a better chance of re-mating than a deserting female, or if there is an excess of females. In contrast, if 2 parents can raise twice as many offspring as 1, or if the chance that a deserting parent will remate is small, then monogamy with both parents caring for the young is the likely strategy. The strategies observed in different vertebrate groups are reviewed. Some features which are comprehensible in terms of the analysis and some which are unexplained are indicated. In many groups of vertebrates uniparental care of the young is found in species in which the parent guards but does not feed the young. This is as expected, and a plausible explanation can be offered for some of the exceptions (e.g., geese). It is by no means so clear what determines which sex shall care for the young. In a sense, this is also expected, since theory predicts that in many cases either the duck or the stickleback strategy could be stable, so that the actual state of affairs now depends on the initial conditions in an ancestral species.

TI HABITUATION OF OBJECT CONTACT IN SOCIALLY-REARED AND ISOLATED RATS
   (RATTUS-NORVEGICUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rats reared in social isolation contacted fewer novel objects in an open-field than their socially reared litter mates. They also contacted a smaller variety of objects, and contacted them in different ways. Social animals showed more manipulatory behavior than the isolates, but there were no differences in sniffing. Employing a longer session, social animals showed more rapid habituation of object contact. This may account for previous claims that isolates show heightened levels of exploration.

TI SONG OF FINCH LAGONOSTICTA-SENEGALA - INTERSPECIFIC MIMICRY BY ITS
   BROOD-PARASITE VIDUA-CHALYBEATA AND ROLE OF SONG IN HOSTS SOCIAL-CONTEXT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The African village indigobird V. chalybeata mimics the song of its brood-host, the Senegal firefinch L. senegala. Firefinches in large aviaries did not respond to mimicry of their song and calls by indigobirds in the same aviaries. The lack of agonistic reaction by the firefinches is related to the non-agonistic meaning of song in the social behavior of the firefinches. Song was not given during experimentally induced aggressive behavior in the firefinches, but was given during courtship and by both male and female firefinches separated from their mates. The main communicative function of song in L. senegala is in pair-bond maintenance.

TI BEHAVIOUR OF SOCIALLY LIVING RHESUS MONKEYS IN THEIR FIRST 2 AND A HALF
   YEARS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of behavior in eight rhesus monkey infants (Macaca mulatta) living with their mothers in small social groups was studied for the first 2 1/2 yr. Eight others were observed for their 1st 24-30 weeks. The changes in various aspects of behavior and mother /infant relations with age were assessed, using both quantitative and qualitative methods of observation. The relations between the age-changes of various measures of mother/infant relations indicate that the mother plays a large part in the increasing independence of the infant with age, although at any particular time both infant and maternal characteristics are important in determining the time spent off the mother and related measures. The rank order of individual infants with respect to one another showed considerable stability over time. Some factors determining individual differences between infants are discussed.

TI SUCCESSIVE REVERSAL LEARNING IN BOB-WHITE QUAIL (COLINUS VIRGINIANUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Four Bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) were run on a series of 25 reversals of a discrimination involving simultaneous presentation of horizontal and vertical stripes. Analysis of 5 reversal blocks revealed a significant decrease in errors to criterion between the 1st and last block. Closer analysis indicated that there was no improvement after the 4th reversal, and little improve ment at all on the 1st 20 trials of each reversal. This "limited" improvement is consistent with previous results for the pigeon, thus providing some support for use of reversal learning as a tool in comparative learning studies. Analysis of individual performances, however, brought out certain methodological problems primarily involving consideration of the influence of absolute levels of performance on progressive improvement trends.

TI NON-ASSOCIATIVE AVOIDANCE LEARNING IN NEREID POLYCHAETES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The polychaete Nereis can learn to avoid an electric shock at the end of a narrow channel by refusing to crawl along it. The possibility that nereids learn non-associatively was tested by testing animals in training procedures in which associative learning is difficult to establish. Groups of 10 N. diversicolor were trained by punishing them before entering in the apparatus and after leaving it. The mean times to crawl along the channel and the number of refusals that occurred were not significantly different (p > 0.05) from a group punished at the exit of the channel. Pretraining punishments also affect subsequent behavior in the apparatus.

TI SENSORY CONTROL OF HYPOTHALAMIC ATTACK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of several senses in hypothalamic attack were reviewed with regard to 2 aspects of attack location of the target and biting. Vision and tactile cues from the forepaws and the anterior portion of the snout play the major role in location of the target rat. Loss of vision severely impedes location in a large space but has only slight effects in a small enclosure where contact with forepaw or snout is highly probable. Olfaction appears to have no significant role in the cat''s location of a target rat during hypothalamic arousal. Sensory denervation of the anterior region of the snout dramatically reduces the incidence of biting attack and alters the quality of those biting attacks which do develop. These changes are attributed to the loss of the afferent limb of trigeminal reflexes critical to biting during hypothalamic arousal. Vision also functions in the development of the biting attack: loss of vision in addition to sensory denervation of the snout reduced biting attack to zero in those cases in which trigeminal section had not already done so.

TI MATERNAL BEHAVIOUR IN GOLDEN HAMSTER - RESPONSIVENESS TO YOUNG IN VIRGIN
   PREGNANT AND LACTATING FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three groups of 8 female golden hamsters without prior breeding experience were presented with 3 newborn pups for a 15 min test period. Group V were virgin females, group P pregnant females and group L lactating females. Groups P and L were tested within 24 hr of parturition. Group V attacked and killed all pups presented. Group P showed maternal responses after initial attacks while group L accepted the pups. Groups P and L did not differ significantly on measures of maternal responsiveness but all three groups differed significantly from one another on measures of attacking behavior and the eating of young.

TI DROSOPHILID MATING BEHAVIOUR - BEHAVIOUR OF DECAPITATED FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female drosophillds, in common with many other Diptera, will live for several days after they have been decapitated. Such beheaded females assume an upright stance comparable to that of a normal fly and can and do engage in complex actions such as preening, flying and, under duress, walking. Although species specific variations occur, males of most spp. of Drosophila will court their decapitated females. All decapitated females of all spp. studied to date treat the courting overtures of the males as if they were noxious foreign stimuli. If by forcible assault the male achieves genitalic intromission with a decapitated female, then the copulation proceeds normally in all respects. Male courtship behavior with decapitated females clearly shows that the initiation of courtship by the female is determined by a number of stimuli that he receives from the female and that the relative importance of any 1 of these diverse female-produced stimuli varies between spp. Males of closely related spp., however, show considerable similarity in their responses. The use of decapitated females can serve as an efficient tool for the analysis of courtship behavior and the sexual isolating mechanisms of the genus Drosophlla.

TI OBSERVATIONS ON PRE-COITAL BEHAVIOUR OF MALE GOAT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the course of a study on the reproductive behaviour of the male goat, which was made during semen collections taken frequently and regularly under constant conditions throughout the period of a year, alteration of stance was observed in association with impotence phases. This alteration consisted of a deviation from the usual position in direct line behind the female. The positioning of the buck behind the female during the reaction time is considered to be an example of taxis. The term negative coital lineataxis has been applied to the phenomenon of deviated posture during reaction time and is considered to indicate a reduced libido in the subject. It is postulated that coital lineataxis is a manifestation of sex drive or libido, positive coital lineataxis being a function of high level libido and negative coital lineataxis being a function of low libido.

TI PERFORMANCE OF OCTOPUS OVER SERIES OF REVERSALS OF SIMULTANEOUS
   DISCRIMINATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Octopuses, unlike other invertebrates tested are capable of definite improvement over a series of discrimination reversals; 1 animal showed 1 trial reversal. A comparison of the results of Group HV (trained with horizontal and vertical rectangles) and Group O (trained with oblique rectangles) supports previous predictions. Group HV took longer to learn early reversals, but from R5 onwards were performing as well as (if not better than) Group O. One cause of improvement over a series of reversals is that during later reversals animals are able to ignore irrelevant cues, by which in early reversals they are hindered. Adaptation of responses to irrelevant cues might come about in either of 2 ways. Animals might either learn through experience of a particular irrelveant cue that it is irrelevant, or they might learn that a particular cue is relevant, and thus come to pay attention to this cue and ignore others. One way to test these explanations is to equate the opportunity given to 2 groups to learn that a particular cue is relevant, but to give only 1 group experience with the irrelevant cue. In the present experiment, all animals had equal opportunity to learn that brightness was the relevant cue, but only Group HV had the opportunity to learn that orientation was irrelevant. In spite of this, the 3 subjects in Groups O confronted with the 2nd irrelevant cue from R9 onwards, both learned subsequent reversals as fast as Group HV, and showed no greater tendency to respond to orientation. The results are consistent with those obtained in a previous experiment with rats (Mackintosh, 1963), and support Sutherland''s theory of discrimination learning.

AB Birdsong is a critical behaviour for reproductive success and therefore exhibits features that reach physiological performance limits. Only few examples of production constraints have been studied in detail. To address this gap in our knowledge, we ask whether singing during flight reaches respiratory and energetic limitations. Male common whitethroats, Curruca communis (formerly Sylvia communis), display three singing modes, perched stereotyped song, variable song during flight and variable song after landing. We compared temporal and frequency modulation characteristics of song for these three modes. When flying, males reduced the duration of syllables and increased silent periods between syllables, which resulted in markedly reduced sound density. These changes in temporal structure and similar minimal pause duration for all singing modes imply that ventilatory changes induced by flight drive these changes in song rhythm, while neither respiratory nor syringeal dynamics indicate limitations in oxygen delivery to vocal muscles. These findings identify song features that are potential indicators of the fitness of the singing bird.<br /> (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paradigm of 'selective females' and 'competing males' has evolved into a multifactorial interpretation of reproductive decisions, which can lead to prudence in reproductive efforts and adjustability in mate selectivity patterns. In mutual mate choice scenarios, sexual selection may act on the same or different male and female traits, with both sexes potentially assessing the quality of their partner. Meanwhile, during courtship, there is an exchange of signals that may influence mate choice patterns, establishing a sexual dialogue between behaviours and responses of the opposite sex. Scorpions are a fascinating group to study mate choice and behaviour adjustability because both sexes undergo substantial costs during mating and exhibit a wide range of elaborate behaviours during courtship. Here, we investigated the occurrence of mutual mate choice in a scorpion species for the first time, Urophonius achalensis, which is characterized by monandrous females (with genital plugs) and polygynous males. We expected a mutual mate choice scenario in this scorpion species, where both sexes are selective according to the quality of potential mates, preferring individuals of higher body condition and females without plugs in the case of males. In addition, we expected a sexual dialogue during courtship involving adjustability between male behaviours and female responses, rather than a coerciveeaggressive scenario. During this dialogue, female resistance response operates as a screening mechanism for male stimulation/ appeasement behaviours. Our results indicate the presence of mutual mate choice in U. achalensis, where female mating status influenced the initial sexual selectivity of both sexes and where male body condition affected female selectivity. We observed behavioural adjustability in both sexes influenced by their own quality and that of their partner, which could be considered a form of sexual dialogue during courtship. This research highlights the value of detailed studies that examine the interplay between behaviours and responses in courtship and contributes to the field of sexual communication and mate choice in scorpions.

AB Male genitalia and nongenital structures that contact the female during copulation diverge rapidly. Two hypotheses propose different explanations for this rapid divergence: sexual conflict and female choice. The sexual conflict hypothesis posits that differential reproductive optima of the two sexes lead to sexually antagonistic coevolution. The female choice hypothesis posits that female preferences drive rapid divergence in male courtship structures. We tested these hypotheses with sepsid flies, which have been considered case studies of sexual conflict involving males using their species-specific front legs to hold the females' wings and females resisting this hold. In terms of these flies, the sexual conflict hypothesis predicts that the male front legs function as mechanical devices to clamp the female wings. The female choice hypothesis predicts that the male front legs function as stimulatory courtship devices. We tested these predictions by carefully observing mating interactions and morphological contact in two closely related species, Sepsis fulgens and Sepsis violacea. We found that males use their front legs to perform rhythmic, stereotypic and species-specific tactile stimulation on the female wing zones that contained numerous campaniform sense organs and sensory setae. We conclude that male front legs are stimulation devices rather than species-specific mechanical clamps. These results support the female choice hypothesis and emphasize the power of attention to behavioural detail to promote discovery. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals communicate using various signal modalities, with signal structure and perception affecting mate choice and species recognition. While studies in birds have often focused on signals of a single modality (unimodal signals), birds frequently assess multiple signals simultaneously (multimodal signals). However, how females and males utilize multimodal signals in conspecific recognition remains understudied. In this study, we combined reciprocal playbacks with taxidermic mounts to investigate how two closely related species, the russet-naped wren, Campylorhynchus humilis, and the Veracruz wren, Campylorhynchus rufinucha, discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific multimodal signals (song and plumage) and to quantify the relative importance of each signal modality for conspecific recognition. We found an asymmetrical response between species, with russet-naped wrens responding significantly stronger than Veracruz wrens. Our findings align with the hypothesis of multimodal redundant signals, as both female and male russet-naped wrens displayed the most intense aggressive responses to the combination of conspecific song/mount female stimuli. Responses were intermediate when exposed to either conspecific or heterospecific song/mount and lowest when presented with heterospecific song/mount stimuli. In contrast, Veracruz wrens showed no difference in responses to any treatment, nor any sex-based differences. Both sexes of russet-naped wrens were able to discriminate between conspecific song/mount and heterospecific song/mount, regardless of whether the stimulus came from a simulated female or male intruder. In treatments with mismatched signal stimuli, both female and male russet-naped wrens exhibited a nonsignificant tendency towards stronger responses to conspecific songs from females and significantly stronger responses to conspecific songs from males, suggesting that songs might play a slightly dominant role in discrimination. Our findings suggest that both sexes of russet-naped wrens partially discriminate between species based on song and mount cues, while Veracruz wrens do not. Overall, this study sheds light on how multimodal signals are used in conspecific recognition and their implications in maintaining reproductive isolation.

AB The ability to adapt behaviour flexibly to the current situation, also referred to as 'behavioural flexibility', is crucial for survival and reproductive success. The early social environment is an important driver of variation in cognitive abilities including behavioural flexibility. However, few studies have investigated this relationship across contexts. Likewise, few studies have investigated the development of modular versus general cognition (i.e. inconsistent versus consistent performance across social and nonsocial contexts) in social species. Here, (1) we investigated the influence of the early social environment (rearing group size) on behavioural flexibility in adult helpers of a cooperatively breeding cichlid fish (Neolamprologus pulcher) and (2) we assessed the presence of general or modular cognition irrespective of early experience by using three nonsocial flexibility tests (innovation test, reversal learning, set shifting) and two social flexibility tests (hierarchy test, integration test). Overall, early social experience only influenced social but not nonsocial flexibility. Helpers raised in large social groups were less flexible in the hierarchy test but tended to be accepted more often when integrated with an unfamiliar breeding pair, compared to fish raised in small groups. The early social environment did not affect nonsocial flexibility, although fish were able to adjust behaviour flexibly in both social and nonsocial contexts. For all fish, performances were not correlated across tests, implying the existence of domain-specific cognition. Nevertheless, results of a principal component analysis suggest an association between performances in social and nonsocial contexts, which may hint at domain-general cognition, albeit with the caveat that not all tests were associated with the same principal component. Future research should develop approaches that can clearly distinguish between general and modular cognition, and that compare species with different environmental predictability.

AB Dogs have the potential to be an exceptional resource for studying ecological, behavioural and evolutionary processes. However, several widespread misconceptions limit our understanding of dog behaviour and inhibit the use of dogs as model systems in diverse areas of biological science. These include extensive anthropomorphization of dog behaviour, a profound bias towards almost exclusively studying pet dogs, a widespread belief that dog domestication was human-driven, and that the majority of dogs are not subjects of natural selection. Here we argue that dogs should be studied using speciesgeneral fundamental principles of ecology and evolution, and that the focus in dog research should shift towards free-ranging dogs, which comprise ca. 80% of the global dog population. By reviewing the available literature on free-ranging dog behavioural ecology we place the dog within an objective biological framework. We find that free-ranging dog populations express substantial variation in their behavioural ecology across their global range and propose that this variation is key to understanding dogs' great success in the rapidly developing anthropogenic niche. Since free-ranging dogs have a global distribution across various environmental gradients, including urbanization, climate and social structures, they provide an ideal opportunity to collect comparable, large-scale data across populations. Combined with in-depth knowledge of dog evolutionary history and the advanced genetic tools specifically developed using this species, dogs can be an outstanding model for the study of behavioural ecology and evolution.

AB It has long been suggested that object play facilitates the development and evolution of tool use, through enhanced perception of an object's properties and potential for manipulation. However, ecologically relevant support for this claim is scant. We examined whether a form of culturally maintained object play, named stone handling, characterized by high interindividual variation in its behavioural expression, promotes the acquisition and further expression of stone-tool use in a nonhuman primate species. We conducted a series of field experiments in a free-ranging group of Balinese longtailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis, to test whether the stone-handling profiles of different individuals predicted their ability to solve a foraging task, whose solution required the functional and action-specific use of stones as tools. Frequentist network-based diffusion analysis, Bayesian multilevel regression modelling and descriptions of individuals' learning trajectories showed that the solutions to different foraging tasks required varying reliance on social and asocial learning strategies. Our results suggest that certain stonehandling profiles may increase an individual's likelihood of expressing stone-tool use. However, other trait- and state-dependent variables may also contribute to explaining individual differences in the development and expression of stone-tool use. The behavioural idiosyncrasies associated with stone handling in longtailed macaques may serve as an exaptive reservoir for the possible emergence of stonetool use. To our knowledge, this is the first study to experimentally evaluate the role of stone-directed play in the acquisition of stone-tool use. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Nutritional coprophagy has been under-recognized in many vertebrates despite its potential impact on social behaviours, health outcomes and ecological relationships. We reviewed published instances of apparent nutritional coprophagy across all vertebrate taxa, casting a wide net to capture incidental observations as well as focused studies. We found that coprophagy is a recognized, natural behaviour in five of seven vertebrate classes (all except Agnatha and Chondrichthyes), with reports of nutritional coprophagy in over 150 species. Nutritional coprophagy is common among some families and appears to be more common among herbivores and omnivores compared to faunivores. Across all taxa in which they occur, coprophagic behaviours cluster into seven distinct groups, distinguished by source of faeces, life stage, frequency and dietary ecology, as follows. (A) Routine reingestion to fulfil nutrient requirements (20 families of mammals and amphibians); (B) Juvenile nutritional support (11 families of mammals, reptiles and birds); (C) Nutritional supplementation of adults during parental care (18 families of mammals and birds); (D) Adaptation to aphotic, nutrient-poor habitats (2 families of amphibians and bony fish); (E) Frequent supplemental feeding strategy in biodiverse environments (38 families of mammals, reptiles, birds and bony fish); (F) Rare supplemental nutrition (12 families of mammals, reptiles and birds); (G) Targeted ingestion of seeds and fruits found in faeces (7 families of mammals, reptiles and birds). We propose that these groups represent different manifestations of adaptive nutritional coprophagy. Despite the numerous reports of coprophagy that have been documented, the behaviour is still widely considered abnormal or pathological in many animals. Applying this framework may help field researchers, wildlife managers and animal caretakers recognize nutritional coprophagic behaviours and characterize them as part of a dietary strategy. The framework also suggests possible evolutionary pathways for coprophagy as an adaptive behaviour. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nectar-foraging bees change their use of floral resources as plant species appear in the environment and disappear over their lifetimes. The new flowers used may involve different cues and different nectar extraction tactics. Although bumble bees can adapt to changes in floral cues and required tactics, little is known about whether bees prioritize switching tactics or floral cues when deciding which plant species to switch to. In a laboratory assay, we forced common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens, workers either to switch the handling tactic they were using or to continue using the tactic but to switch the colour of artificial flowers foraged on. We examined whether bees' tendency to change their tactics was influenced by how similar in colour novel flowers were to familiar ones. We conducted a 2 x 2 factorial experiment using artificial flowers, manipulating the handling tactic that bees were initially trained to use (legitimate visit or nectar robbing) and the similarity between novel and trained colours (similar or distinct). We found that under most conditions bees preferred to switch flower colours and retain handling tactics. However, when given experience with legitimate visits and when novel flowers were markedly different in colour from those they had experienced previously, bees tended to switch tactics while continuing to forage on flowers of the same colour. These findings suggest that the similarity in colour of a new floral resource to the currently exploited resource and the flower-handling tactic used by bees both play an important role in decision making by foraging bumble bees.

AB Migratory connectivity describes the degree to which migratory populations are mixed across space and time. Unlike adults, subadult birds often exhibit distinct migratory patterns and continually refine their migratory behaviour and destinations as they mature. Consequently, the influence of subadult movements on overall migratory connectivity might be different from that of adults. However, current studies on migratory connectivity often overlook population age structures, predominantly focusing on adults. In this study, we investigated the role of subadult movements in shaping population level connectivity by using satellite tracking data from 214 black-necked cranes, Grus nigricollis, in western China. We first assessed the variances in spatial separation in different age cohorts using the continuous temporal Mantel correlation coefficient with data from 17 juveniles tracked in the same year for 3 consecutive years. We then calculated the continuous temporal migratory connectivity for the entire population (comprising various age groups) from 15 September to 15 November and compared the result to that of the family group (consisting of juveniles and adults only). Our results revealed a positive correlation between temporal variation in spatial separation and age after the juveniles separated from the adults, suggesting that subadults may have fine-tuned their migration paths. Moreover, the migratory connectivity of the all-age cohort was moderate (below 0.6) in the winter season, and notably lower than that of the family group during the autumn period. Given the considerable impact of subadults on migratory connectivity, we recommend using data collected from birds across all age categories to improve the precision of population level migratory connectivity estimates.

AB Empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that getting injured during combat decreases an individual's chances of winning. Thus, it has been hypothesized that species that engage in injurious fights may evolve armour. However, much remains unknown about the role that male-male combat has in promoting the evolution of such damage-reducing structures. Here, we tested the hypothesis that male -male combat can increase the damage resistance of structures using the giant mesquite bug, Pachylis neocalifornicus. When males in this species fight over access to mates, they use their weaponized hindlegs to puncture the dorsal side, but not the ventral side, of their rivals. We found that structures on the dorsal side of males could generally withstand the forces of combat, while structures on the dorsal side of females could not. The sexual dimorphism in damage resistance was location dependent because structures on the ventral side of both males and females also could not withstand the forces of combat. Thus, males appear to only increase their defensive capacity in the locations where strikes from rivals normally land. These results provide evidence that male-male combat can promote the evolution of damage-reducing structures (i.e. sexually selected shields). Moreover, the relatively inconspicuous nature of the sexually selected shields in this species suggests that defensive traits related to combat may be more common than currently considered.

AB Human -wildlife interactions are increasing globally due to human population growth and development. Wildlife often develop an increased tolerance of humans through the learning processes of habituation, but habituation of large predators can increase risks to humans. Aversive conditioning is a management strategy that operationalizes learning to reduce wildlife tolerance of humans and thereby improve human safety. However, developed landscapes may select for wildlife phenotypes that are resistant to learning via aversive conditioning. We investigated American alligators', Alligator mississippiensis , response to capture and release (an assumed aversive experience) in coastal resort communities as a model system for understanding wildlife learning in human -dominated landscapes. Our objectives were to investigate whether the degree of human disturbance in the landscape was associated with baseline alligator tolerance of humans or mediated alligators' learning ability. We quanti fied tolerance using flight initiation trials and estimated learning ability as the response to capture and release using a 'before -after control impact ' experimental design. Baseline alligator tolerance did not vary with disturbance, nor did the degree of disturbance impact alligator learning. However, alligators in areas where capture and release occurred were 1.5 times more likely to flee from an approaching human after treatment relative to before. Alligators in control units exhibited similar tolerance to humans over time. Alligator tolerance was also in fluenced by ambient weather, with alligators least tolerant of humans in cool and cloudy conditions and most tolerant in warm conditions, likely re flecting physiological constraints of ectothermy. While human -dominated landscapes may promote high tolerance of humans through habituation, our findings indicate that high tolerance does not preclude future learning by crocodilians and collectively lend credibility to the use of repeated capture and release as a potential form of aversive conditioning for crocodilians.

AB Acoustic signals are of critical importance to songbirds which rely on them for mate attraction and territorial defence. Interference caused by sounds that overlap in frequency and time can disturb or mask signal detection. While species differ in their song spectral properties, duration and composition, the limited acoustic space may lead to evolution of behavioural strategies aimed at minimizing competition. Using playback experiments we tested whether tropical forest songbirds use temporal or spectral avoidance to reduce competition for acoustic space. We focused on two species with different song spectral ranges: green-backed camaroptera, Camaroptera brachyura, with a broad-spectrum song, and scaly-breasted illadopsis, Illadopsis albipectus, which produces a narrow-spectrum song. We found that scaly-breasted illadopsis avoided both temporal and spectral overlap. By contrast, in green-backed camaroptera, there was no difference in the number of songs produced between the periods of silence and noise. However, when we varied the frequency of the noise, green-backed camaroptera increased the song rate during the playbacks of noise with maximal spectral overlap, suggesting increasing signal redundancy. Our results show that competition avoidance strategies may be species specific and could be related to the spectral frequency range of the species. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Poikilotherms have two major alternative strategies to deal with the inhospitable conditions of temperate winters: hibernation or migration. The vast majority of insects spend winter in a speciesspecific diapause resting stage, while others remain reproductively active after having migrated to more hospitable environments in the autumn. The butterfly clade Nymphalini offers an interesting possibility for comparisons among species adopting different strategies. Whereas most genera in this clade have evolved adult diapause, species in the genus Vanessa engage in an annual multigeneration migration cycle, leaving northern latitudes during autumn. Here, we compared two species of diapausing Aglais butterflies, A. io and A. urtica, two species of the migratory genus Vanessa, V. atalanta and V. cardui, and two morphs of Polygonia c-album, the diapausing winter morph and the direct developing hutchinsoni morph. We tested how these different species differ in resource acquisition strategy during early adult life, how the acquisition of resources affects survival in cold winter conditions and how A. io, Aglais urticae and V. atalanta differ in resting metabolism under cold conditions. The butterflies set for adult diapause (1) acquired more mass during early adult life and (2) lost less mass and had a lower resting metabolism under cold conditions. In addition, (3) the life span under cold conditions was positively related to the weight increase during early adult life in the diapausing species, but not in the migratory species. Our laboratory results demonstrate how different developmental pathways, such as diapause or direct development, can be studied by measuring mass change in living butterflies. Our expectation that migratory species would increase in mass like species set for overwintering were not met, perhaps because such studies should ideally be performed under natural conditions.

AB Urbanization is the fastest form of landscape transformation on the planet, but researchers' understanding of the relationships between urbanization and animal behaviour is still in its infancy. In terms of foraging, bold and innovative behaviours are proposed to help urban animals access, utilize and exploit novel anthropogenic food sources. Red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, are one of the most widespread carnivores on the planet. However, despite frequent stories, images and videos portraying them as 'pests' in urban areas due to their exploitation of food-related objects (e.g. raiding the contents of outdoor bins), it is unknown whether they are bolder and more innovative in terms of their likelihood of exploiting these resources compared to rural populations. In the current study, we gave novel food-related objects to foxes from 104 locations (one object per location) across a large urban-rural gradient. To access the food, foxes had to use behaviours necessary for exploiting many food-related objects in the real world (e.g. biting, pushing, pulling or lifting human-made materials). Despite foxes from 96 locations acknowledging the objects, foxes from 31 locations touched them, while foxes from 12 locations gained access to the food inside. A principal component analysis of urban and other landscape variables (e.g. road, greenspace and human population density) revealed that urbanization was significantly and positively related to the likelihood of foxes touching, but not exploiting, the objects. Thus, while urban foxes may be bolder than rural populations in terms of their willingness to physically touch novel food-related objects, our findings are inconsistent with the notion that they are more innovative and pose a general nuisance to people by regularly exploiting these anthropogenic resources on a large geographical scale.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Social organisms benefit from division of labour and collective behaviours. However, if individuals overlap widely in their efforts, these benefits may not be proportional to the number of individuals that take part in an activity. We examined foraging behaviour and route fidelity in colonies of the ant Dinoponera grandis (formerly Dinoponera australis), a large species with relatively few active foragers that lack nestmate recruitment and chemical trailing behaviour. For 12 colonies, we marked individual foragers and mapped their foraging routes to test the hypothesis that each ant specializes in a particular area around the nest and that this route fidelity increases the overall area covered by the colony. For each individual, we recorded the mean direction and duration of each foraging trip, foraging success and maximal distance from the nest. For each colony, we measured the number of workers and the total foraging area. Additionally, we measured Shannon's entropy to describe foraging behaviour structure of the colonies. Overall, we mapped 272 foraging routes from 95 different foragers. The total area used by each colony averaged 66.2 m2. Within colonies, over 68% of foragers exhibited a high degree of route fidelity, with most foragers following different foraging directions. Most colonies had a high Shannon's entropy, suggesting an even exploration of the foraging territory. Our results suggest that D. grandis exhibit route fidelity and high entropy. This strategy likely increases foraging efficiency and search area and may be particularly important for species with relatively few foragers.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When multiple carers invest in a shared brood, there is likely to be conflict among individuals over how much each carer invests. This conflict results in suboptimal investment to the detriment of all carers. It has been proposed that conditional cooperation, that is, 'turn taking' or 'alternation', may resolve this conflict by preventing exploitation. This contentious idea has received some empirical support, but distinguishing active alternation from that expected via passive processes has proved challenging. The aim of this study was to use detailed observations of provisioning to examine whether carers at biparental (parents only) and cooperative (parents and helpers) nests of the long-tailed tit, Aegithalos caudatus, behave in a context-dependent manner that increases the level of alternation. First, we show that carers that had been the last to feed waited near the nest (loitering) for longer before feeding when they next arrived at the nest and allowed others to feed first, thus facilitating alternation. Second, we found that the arrival of carers near the nest and their subsequent feeds were tightly synchronized, with overlapping loitering periods, allowing them to monitor the effort of other carers. Finally, we show that measures of coordination were influenced by carers arriving in a status-dependent order, with breeding females consistently arriving first and helpers last. Together, these results show how patterns of alternation and synchrony arise in long-tailed tits, and reveal the behavioural mechanisms underpinning coordination of care. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Emerging infectious fungal diseases are responsible for the extinction of myriad species across a range of phyla. As recently shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, social transmission can be key to disease spread, and in this context, humans are not alone in trying to be alone. In group-living species, individuals have been shown to use social behaviour to avoid infection; diseased individuals can isolate from the group, or healthy animals can avoid diseased conspecifics. However, little is known about social behaviour as a mechanism to avoid fungal infection. In this study, we investigated the extent to which wild urban eastern water dragons, Intellagama lesueurii, a gregarious reptile, modify their social behaviour as a response to infection with a recently emerged infectious fungal disease, caused by the pathogen Nan-nizziopsis barbatae. Using individual data from a long-term study population inhabiting Roma Street Parkland in Brisbane's Central Business District (QLD, Australia) and focal sampling, we tested whether dragons exhibit self-isolation and social-distancing behaviours in the context of dyadic social approach events. Our results suggested that while the presence of the fungal disease had no effect on individuals' social behaviour, its severity did. Specifically, we found that (1) diseased individuals were no less social than their nondiseased conspecifics, (2) nondiseased individuals did not avoid or spend less time with diseased conspecifics, and (3) models considering the severity of skin lesions caused by N. barbatae, instead of their presence or absence, suggested that individuals avoided more severely diseased con-specifics regardless of their own disease status.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Social interactions facilitate information exchange for, among others, decision making and conflict resolution in animal societies. A central component of social interactions is the expression of signals of quality, and the role of signals can be expected to become more relevant in densely populated environments, in which social interactions are more frequent and the degree of conflict is probably stronger. We tested this hypothesis using the family context to explore whether a signal of quality expressed by the offspring modulates intrafamily interactions and whether it plays a more prominent role when the social density is increased. To this aim, we experimentally blocked a signalling trait, the ultraviolet (UV)/ yellow reflectance of breast feathers and used brood size as a proxy of social density in a small passerine, the blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus. We found that UV-blocked offspring were involved in fewer social interactions than control nestlings, suggesting that the expression of quality signals might affect the position within the family social network. Interestingly, this effect was independent of brood size. Moreover, we detected an overall preference to be in physical contact with nestmates of a different UV colour phenotype, which was stronger in small broods. Our results suggest that quality signals expressed by the offspring can influence the intrafamily social structure and that this effect is modulated by social density and, presumably, by the degree of conflict.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Background matching camouflage enables animals to evade detection with colours and patterns that resemble and blend into the environment. Effective concealment can, however, be difficult to achieve as natural backgrounds are often heterogeneous and frequently made up of spatially distinct microhabitats that differ in their visual characteristics. Many species make use of multiple microhabitat patches, and the ways in which an animal exploits different microhabitats will likely vary throughout its life cycle as behaviour, morphology and predation risk change. Here, we used the Fowler's toad, Anaxyrus fowleri, and its lakeshore habitat to investigate how camouflage changes throughout ontogeny in relation to a series of spatially structured microhabitats. These toads are predominantly light beige in colour with a haphazard pattern of brown spots. This pattern is consistent throughout life, and spot size scales along with increasing body size. We modelled how well toad colour and patterning matched each background as perceived by bird, snake and mammal predators. We predicted that background matching would be targeted to the microhabitats where toads are most likely to be found during the day and that camouflage would be most effective at the most vulnerable (i.e. younger) life stages. We found that toad colour was specialized to match the dry sandy beach microhabitats where the toads were most frequently encountered and that pattern matching varied depending on toad size. We found that the small spots of juvenile toads best matched areas of bare sand whereas the correspondingly large spots of adult toads best matched larger items of beach debris such as broken shells, pebbles and fragments of wood. Taken together, our data suggest that, as toads grow larger, background matching camouflage remains effective, and that juveniles and adults use the same pattern to match different components within the heterogenous background.

AB Colour polymorphisms are among the most striking examples of intraspecific variation. If vulnerability in a given habitat depends on body colour, heterogeneity in the environment may drive behavioural dif-ferences between differently coloured individuals. We tested this prediction in a colour-polymorphic fish species, the red devil, Amphilophus labiatus. In Amphilophus cichlids, 'dark' and 'gold' morphs have previously been linked to differences in morphology, aggressive behaviour and mate choice, but it is unknown whether the morphs also differ in other key behaviours, or whether any such differences are sensitive to environmental factors. By testing activity, boldness and exploration, our laboratory experi-ment provided moderate evidence for an environmental variable, substrate type, having colour morph-specific effects on behaviour: dark morph red devils explored their environment more extensively when the environmental background (substrate) was dark brown than when it was light coloured, whereas gold morph individuals did not differ in their behaviour in relation to substrate colour. These results show that environmentally driven behavioural differences may be context dependent and have a role in maintaining colour morph-specific behavioural strategies. Hence, the evolution of morphological traits, such as colour morphs, cannot be fully understood without considering the behavioural phenotypes that have coevolved with them in interaction with the environment.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Machine-learning-based behavioural tracking is a rapidly growing method in the behavioural sciences providing data with high spatial and temporal resolution while reducing the risk of observer bias. Nevertheless, only a few canine behaviour studies have applied this method. In the current study, we used three-dimensional (3D) tracking of the dogs' bodies to study how separation from the caregiver affected the dogs' behaviour in a novel environment. During the study, the dogs could move freely in a room equipped with trial-unique objects. We manipulated across trials whether the owner and/or a stranger was present in the room to evaluate the secure base effect, the tendency to explore and play more in the presence of the caregiver compared to another person. This secure base effect is considered a key characteristic of human attachment bonds and has also been described for the dog-caregiver relationship. The tracking data were internally consistent and highly correlated with human scorings and measurements. The results show that both the owner and stranger significantly increased the dogs' exploration; the dogs also spent more time in the proximity of the owner and stranger location when they were present. Even though the presence of both owner and stranger had a significant effect on the dogs' behaviour, the effect of the owner was more pronounced. Moreover, in the presence of the stranger the dogs spent more time close to their owner and showed a reduced tail-wagging asymmetry to the right side further supporting the distinct effect of owner and stranger on the dogs' behaviour. We conclude that machine-driven 3D tracking provides an efficient and reliable access for detailed behav-ioural analyses of dogs' exploration and attachment-related behaviours.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Mate recognition is a critical and often complex step in the premating reproductive behaviour of most organisms. Drosophila relies on multiple signal modalities such as visual, auditory, gustatory and olfac-tory cues for mate recognition. To understand the evolution and function of these signal modalities, the production and reception of these signals must be tested individually. Ablation of a single sensory channel of males and females can help us understand the role of individual modalities in successful mate recognition and copulation. In addition to ablation, measuring the courtship timing, such as courtship latency and courtship duration, will allow us to identify the stage of the courtship at which a particular signal is acting. Our study focused on Drosophila nasuta, a species belonging to the nasuta subgroup of Drosophila, which comprises a dozen morphologically similar species at different levels of reproductive isolation. We conducted no-choice mating experiments using two species of the nasuta subgroup to study the sequence of courtship behaviour. We did not observe any discernible variation in the sequence of courtship behaviour between species. We also performed no-choice mating experiments by ablating a single signal modality in D. nasuta and recorded the courtship index. Our experiments revealed that mate recognition was multimodal: eliminating visual and chemosensory signals eliminated copulation, making these signals essential for mating. Ablation of auditory cues did not affect the courtship fre-quency but significantly reduced the copulation frequency. Measuring courtship latency and duration allowed us to identify whether individual signals play a role in initiating courtship or stimulating the female to mate. We hypothesize that the females use visual cues to identify the type of pollinosity the males have on their forehead. The failure of mating in the absence of chemosensory cues is possibly due to the rapid interspecies divergence of chemosensory receptors and the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles.

AB Behavioural studies have shown that even after accounting for individual differences in contextual and temporal plasticity, considerable unexplained (residual) variation remains. Recent studies show that individuals differ in the magnitude of residual variation (1/4 their predictability), but hardly any studies exist that assess whether this individual attribute itself is repeatable and potentially subject to selection, and whether predictability is related to aspects of different underlying state variables. Using data on the latency to emerge after disturbance of 100 pill bugs, Armadillidium vulgare, measured 24 times each over time and across contexts, we found substantial among-individual variation in mean boldness (latency) and in their behavioural predictability. Individual mean boldness across weeks was highly consistent over time, as was individual predictability; by contrast, unadjusted repeatability of boldness scores (the familiar 'intraclass correlation') and repeatability adjusted for time-related behavioural changes were low to moderate, indicating substantial residual variation. Individual mean boldness was not related to individual predictability, indicating that while selection can potentially act on individual means and individual variances, correlated selection is unlikely, for the traits assessed. Neither boldness nor pre-dictability in boldness was related to mass or to sex, nor did they vary over time concurrent with gains in mass under ad libitum food conditions and in experience with the behavioural assay, indicating they were not clearly related to these potentially important life history and state variables.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mate advertisement signals can vary in their variability, with some signals or signal components being highly stereotyped and others highly variable. One hypothesis for differences in variability suggests that receivers provide stabilizing selection for signal components important for mate recognition, resulting in low variability, while also providing directional selection for signal components indicating mate quality, correlating with greater variability. Factors that affect signal efficacy, however, can also influence signal design -and might interact with receiver preferences to influence variability. We investigated these hypotheses in the duetting cricket species Lebinthus bitaeniatus Stal. Like many other insects, these crickets use call-and-response signalling to find mates. Males produce an acoustic signal, females reply with a vibrational signal, and males use these vibrations to find females. Male calls have two compo-nents: a series of isolated syllables (ticks) followed by a rapid series of syllables (a trill). The number of ticks per call is highly variable, whereas the number of pulses in the trill is stereotyped. Male size was correlated positively with the number of trill pulses per call, but not with the number of ticks. Female response amplitude was not related to the number of ticks in the male call (the variable component) and it increased with trill duration (the stereotyped signal component), contrary to the stabilizing directional selection hypothesis. We also found, however, that the latency of the female vibrational reply became erratic as the trill increased beyond the typical duration. Since males in duetting insect species rely on the species-specific latency of the female reply to recognize the signal, this reduces the efficacy of the female reply for communication despite the females' greater amplitude response. Given the prevalence of call-and-response signalling in insects, this relationship between female response amplitude and signal efficacy could be a common factor influencing signal variability across many species.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Environmental challenges are major drivers of the evolution of group living. In particular, harsh seasonal conditions can promote temporary or facultative social behaviour in primarily solitary animals. We asked how winter conditions might favour group living in a desert population of a facultatively social carpenter bee, Xylocopa sonorina Smith, that nests primarily in small groups during winter quiescence. We experimentally manipulated the social condition (social versus solitary) of bees living in observation nests in ambient winter conditions and measured effects of group living on temperature and body condition. Social bees experienced significantly warmer temperatures than solitary bees in identical nests. Furthermore, social bees experienced smaller reductions in body mass than solitary bees over the course of the 1-month observation period. These results suggest important benefits of group living in cold and resource-scarce conditions, which may allow X. sonorina to reduce risk of freezing and emerge from winter quiescence in better physiological condition. Seasonal associations such as these provide opportunities for extended social interactions among nestmates, an important context for the evolution of more complex cooperative behaviours.

AB Cognition is vital for carrying out behaviours required for survival and reproduction. Cognitive performance varies between species, but also between individuals within populations. While variation is a prerequisite for natural selection, selection does not act on traits in isolation. The extent to which cognitive traits covary with other aspects of phenotype (e.g. personality traits) may be important in shaping evolutionary dynamics. Here we adopted a multivariate approach to test spatial learning in male Poecilia reticulata and asked whether differences in cognitive performance are associated with (repeatable) differences in stress response behaviour. Functional links between cognitive traits and 'stress coping style' have been hypothesized. Furthermore, individual level studies of cognitive performance typically rely on multiple testing paradigms that may themselves be a stressor. There is a risk that variation in stress responsiveness is itself a cause of apparent, but artefactual variance in cognitive ability. Fish repeatedly experienced two spatial learning tasks (maze layouts) and an acute stress response test (open field trial). We found repeatable differences between individuals in performance within and across maze layouts. On average, performance improved with experience in the first maze, consistent with spatial learning, but not in the second. Individuals varied in the trajectory of mean performance with trial number in both mazes, suggesting they differ in 'learning rate'. Acute stress response behaviour was repeatable but predicted neither average time to solve the maze nor learning rate. We found no support for between-individual correlation between acute stress response and cognitive performance. However, we highlight the possibility that cumulative, chronic stress effects may nevertheless cause declines in performance for some individuals (leading to lack of improvement in mean time to solve the second maze). If so, this may represent a pervasive but difficult challenge for our ability to robustly estimate learning rates in studies of animal cognition. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Aggressive and submissive behaviours are commonly assumed to represent two extremes of a single personality trait, often labelled 'aggressiveness'. However, most studies focus exclusively on submissive behaviour elicited by conspecific aggression, and on rates at which aggressive and submissive behaviours are expressed, without considering either unprovoked submissive behaviour, or the intensity of the actions themselves. Utilizing a long-term data set spanning 27 years of dyadic agonistic interactions among spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, including counts and intensities of all unprovoked acts of aggressive and submissive behaviour, we assessed consistency within individuals in these behaviours. We found that counts of acts of both aggression and submission performed by adult female hyaenas varied with context, that neither measure was consistent within individuals over time and that both were strongly affected by social rank, suggesting that neither of these rate measures represent personality traits. Although rank influenced the intensity of submissive acts, intensity of aggressive acts did not vary with rank. Intensities of aggressive and submissive acts also varied with context, but both were consistent within individual females regardless of age, suggesting that both intensity measures may represent personality traits. We found no significant correlation between individual lifetime averages of intensities of aggressive and submissive behaviour, supporting the hypothesis that these may represent different traits rather than opposite ends of a single spectrum. Lifetime rates at which females performed acts of aggression and submission were uncorrelated with fitness, but analysis of the average intensity of aggressive or submissive acts performed by adult female hyaenas suggests that lifetime reproductive success may be lower at both ends of the spectrum of behavioural intensity than in its centre after controlling for rank, suggesting the action of stabilizing selection.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behaviours that are consistent across contexts (also known as behavioural syndromes) can have evolutionary implications, but their role in scenarios where the sexes conflict, such as sexual cannibalism, is poorly understood. While some research has focused on aggressive personality in females and its role in determining cannibalistic attack, effects of male personality have rarely been explored. Male activity as a personality trait could be an important mediator of sexual cannibalism if it modulates how quickly or carelessly males approach females, but such a relationship has never been tested. Here, we used the springbok mantis, Miomantis caffra, to explore effects of male activity levels and female aggressiveness on mating behaviour and sexual cannibalism. We found that male activity and subadult female aggressiveness were repeatable, although the latter only marginally so. Females that were aggressive as juveniles were not more likely to cannibalize males when adult following physical interaction, but males made physical contact with these females sooner and more often. More active males were both faster and more likely to interact with females, but were not more likely to be cannibalized in the process. We also found that female age influenced sexual interactions: younger females were more likely to cannibalize males. Taken together, our results suggest that both male and female personality influence the likelihood of sexual encounter, but have little effect on the likelihood of cannibalism. Our study highlights the potential for the personality traits of both sexes to influence mating dynamics in sexually cannibalistic species. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   AVAILABILITY; AVOIDANCE
AB When selecting a breeding site, individuals can use social information to reduce the uncertainty regarding habitat quality. Individuals of several bird species tend to reuse nests previously occupied by conspecific or heterospecific competitors but the proximate mechanisms underlying this behaviour remain unclear. Reoccupying nests previously used by competitors could result from individuals copying competitors' choices (the 'social information' hypothesis). Alternatively, it could allow individuals to fulfil their need for a soft nest substrate (e.g. by improving thermal insulation or reducing egg breakage risks) at low costs, regardless of previous occupancy (the 'comfort' hypothesis). Here, we aimed to determine which of these nonmutually exclusive mechanisms triggered the preference for old conspecific nest material in a secondary cavity-nesting raptor that does not add lining material to its nests, the lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni. Using an experimental design forcing settling lesser kestrels to choose between two adjacent nestboxes containing different substrates, we detected a strong preference for soft substrates (peat moss or old conspecific or European roller, Coracias garrulus, nest material) over coarse mineral substrate, especially when the soft substrate also provided social information about previous nest use by a competitor. Despite the apparent absence of preference when directly comparing settlement patterns in soft substrates with and without social information, early settling individuals favoured the substrate with social information, while late settling ones favoured the substrate without social information. This could reflect intraspecific competition avoidance by late arriving individuals that may be competitively inferior to early arriving ones. This hypothesis is supported by a later laying date of young breeders in our population. Our findings suggest that both comfort seeking and social information use explain the preference for previously used nest cavities, and that nest site choices may depend on individual competitive abilities and experience.

AB Vigilance behaviour in group-living animals helps to detect threats. Individual vigilance levels are thought to decrease as group size or the number of neighbours increases. However, the results of studies on the effects of group size or the number of neighbours are inconsistent, especially in primates. Since social vigilance (i.e. monitoring for group members) plays an essential role in group-living primates, discrepancies among studies may have been caused by differences in the quality of social relationships between group members. Using data from a provisioned group of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, this study examined the effects of the quality of social relationships and the number of neighbours on vigilance levels. We found that the frequency of vigilance was lower when the majority of an individual's neighbours were kin than when kin were in the minority. Since Japanese macaques show strong nepotism and cope with social threats by forming coalitions between close kin, individuals may be able to reduce their vigilance levels by relying on the vigilance of potential allies. Furthermore, when the majority of neighbours were kin, the proportion of time spent on vigilance decreased as the number of neighbours increased. However, when kin were in the minority of neighbours, the number of neighbours did not affect vigilance levels. Overall, our results indicate that the quality of social relationships with neighbours and the number of neighbours interactively affect vigilance levels.

AB Different fish species use a conditional approach strategy during predator inspection; the risk of approaching a predator is distributed across all inspectors but is not shared with the animals that keep their distance. Zebrafish, Danio rerio, a highly social fish, is increasingly being used in behavioural neuroscience, but it is not known whether it displays conditional approach. In the predator inspection task, animals are observed in a tank with a refuge in one extremity and an animated image of a predator in the other extremity, with a mirror positioned in parallel to the tank, simulating a perfectly reciprocating conspecific. In experiment 1, animals spent more time in an inspection zone when the image was turned on, but also displayed more erratic swimming, suggesting cooperation under fear. In experiment 2, animals spent more time inspecting predators when the mirror was parallel to the tank ('cooperating mirror') than when the mirror was at an angle ('defecting mirror'), suggesting retaliatory behaviour; in both conditions, animals displayed more freezing and erratic swimming. In experiment 3, no changes in behaviour were observed, regardless of mirror position, when the image was turned off, suggesting that the choice of specific zones in experiment 2 was not due to shoaling tendencies. These results suggest that predator inspection is associated with conditional approach, while at the same time inducing fearlike behaviour in the animal.

AB Game-theoretical models help us understand how and when cooperation can evolve and persist. However, current models fall short of explaining the striking amount of variation in cooperation levels that we observe in nature, even within a system. For example, an animal's ability to choose partners with which to interact can explain the maintenance of cooperative interactions, but not variation in cooperation levels among individuals with similar partner choice options. Here, we explored how partner choice options and other key partner traits predict the quality of the service provided by cleaner fish, Labroides dimidiatus (the ?chosen? partner) to their client reef fishes (the ?choosy? partner). In this marine cleaning mutualism, cleaner fish sometimes cheat and eat mucus from their clients rather than cooperate by removing ectoparasites. We examined 13 client fish species and assessed the influence of nine variables on cooperation levels by cleaner fish (i.e. the frequency of cheating events) using information theory. Variables characterizing clients and the interactions themselves were used as proxies for a client's nutritional value, partner choice options, ability to punish a cheating partner and a cleaner's temptation to cheat its client (some of these traits were characterized by more than one variable). We found that six of the nine variables were equally important in explaining variation in client jolts: the duration of an interaction, and traits of client species including their body size (a proxy for the quality of a food patch), gnathiid ectoparasite load (nutritional value), partner choice options, agility (ability to control an interaction via avoidance or termination) and mucus characteristics (a measure of the cleaners' temptation to cheat). These findings suggest that numerous factors influence variation in cooperation levels, showing a parallel with sexual selection theory, where female mate choice does not depend on a single factor such as the operational sex ratio, but also on other key variables including a male's quality relative to other males, and a female's ability to avoid male coercion.& nbsp; (C)& nbsp;2021 The Authors.

AB Acoustic courtship displays are ubiquitous among animals. Signallers use these acoustics to advertise their willingness to mate, while receivers may be able to infer something of the signaller's quality from them. However, increases in anthropogenic noise may reduce the production, transmission and reception of these signals, leading to consequences for reproductive success. In this study, we conducted behavioural observations of courtship interactions of the Mediterranean field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, under anthropogenic noise conditions. We found that the presence of traffic noise had no effect on the outcome courtship interactions in this species, and their behaviour during courtship did not appear to be altered either. However, we found that the presence of white noise led to a reduction in male signal production, resulting in fewer successful matings. Males that did signal under white noise conditions had altered signal characteristics, including increased song frequency and reduced tick rate. Mate-guarding behaviour was also found to differ between individuals that courted and those that did not. The use of typical anthropogenic noise and white noise in this experiment allows us to consider the importance of specific characteristics of the acoustic pollutant in causing this disruption.

AB A major component of Darwin's formulation of sexual selection theory is whether mate choice can contribute to the evolution of cognitive abilities. Although a correlation between cognition and attractive traits has commonly been reported, the processes that generate such associations remain elusive. Here, we investigated female preference, neophobia and spatial learning in the sailfin tetra, Crenuchus spilurus, a sexually dimorphic fish. Females chose the most ornamented males, which were also more neophobic. This is in line with the asset protection principle, which posits that attractive males should be more cautious because of their higher prospective fitness returns. After repeated exposure, more ornamented males learnt to navigate the complex maze faster, with chosen (and highest ornamented) males showing higher accuracy to solve the maze on the last day of trials. Because the asset protection principle stems from predation pressure, we propose that sexual selection through female mate choice creates a risk-reward trade-off, upon which natural selection acts by indirectly increasing learning abilities. As such, sexual selection forms the substrate, but natural selection drives enhanced cognitive abilities in attractive C. spilurus males. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In today's marine habitats, anthropogenic noise is widespread in space and time, affecting aquatic animal communities. Short-term exposure to noise is known to affect vital behaviours, such as the ability to evade predators. However, long-term noise pollution may lead to differences in short-term responses between naive and experienced animals. We investigated the interaction between short-term and longterm sound exposure on the antipredator response of free-ranging sand gobies, Pomatoschistus minutus. We tested the effects of short-term boat noise playback on the response to a simulated predator strike in areas across a range of low to high long-term noise disturbance levels. Exposure to boat noise did not affect the startle response, time frozen or response latency of gobies to a predator stimulus. However, individuals exposed to short-term boat noise playback were absent from the experimental area for shorter periods after the predator strike than gobies exposed to the silent control. Moreover, gobies in long-term noisy habitats also stopped avoiding the area after the predator strike under silent control conditions. These changes point to a decreased magnitude in antipredator response, as a function of interacting shortand longer-term levels of disturbance. Thus, prey species alter their antipredator behaviour in ways that can potentially lead to higher mortality for individual prey. This could ultimately have implications at the level of the food web.

AB Climate-mediated phenological shifts can cause species to lose access to their primary prey while increasing opportunities for alternative-prey encounters. Species that are able to capitalize on alternative resources could potentially profit from prey-switching should the benefits of procuring these alternative resources outweigh their acquisition costs. Polar bears, Ursus maritimus, use sea ice as a platform to hunt seals, and individuals inhabiting the southern-most extent of their range rely on accumulated fat reserves to sustain themselves during the increasingly lengthy ice-free season. In response to declining access to their primary prey through documented sea ice loss, some polar bears are foraging on the eggs of birds in lieu of hunting opportunities on ice, as their onshore arrival is increasingly overlapping with birds' breeding schedules. To gain a better understanding of the energetic consequences of this behaviour, we used aerial drones to record polar bears foraging on sea duck eggs (common eider, Somateria mollissima) on Mitivik Island, Nunavut, Canada. Using these data, we examined variation in individual polar bear foraging behaviours and estimated the energetic benefits and costs associated with foraging on common eider eggs. Because of low costs associated with nest searching and consumption, the energetic cost of foraging remained relatively constant throughout the 2-week observation period. However, we found that as the common eider breeding season progressed, polar bears consumed eggs at a lower rate as they depleted the nesting colony and spent proportionally more time searching for nests. Collectively, this foraging pattern led to an overall declining trend in the net energy gained from egg consumption. Foraging on common eider eggs during increasingly lengthy ice-free seasons is apparently beneficial for polar bears, but only during a limited window of opportunity. By coupling energetic estimates with detailed behavioural data collected through aerial videography, this study provides a quantification of both the benefits and costs of egg consumption for polar bears.

AB The reciprocal pilferage hypothesis argues that, despite the occurrence of pilferage, scatter-hoarding behaviour could evolve if cache loss is compensated by gains pilfered from others. However, this model has not been strictly tested because of the difficulty associated with tracking caches, including ownership, over long periods. Using infrared radiation cameras, we tracked caching of Juglans regia seeds by groups of two Pere David's rock squirrels, Sciurotamias davidianus, within a large natural enclosure. Our goal was to quantify how squirrels responded to the presence of a conspecific when seed hoarding and pilfering and test the reciprocal pilferage hypothesis. We found that the numbers of seeds harvested from the seed sources and pilfered from conspecifics was initially low, increasing as seeds were removed and then dropping off once few seeds remained at the seed sources. Additionally, the number of seeds scatter hoarded increased with a decreasing number of seeds remaining at the sources. Seeds harvested from the source and pilfered from competitors were at first cached randomly within the enclosure and then centralized to the low-competition area near the nest as seed sources declined. Overall, pilferage was not high. The proportions of seeds pilfered did not vary between conspecifics and were positively correlated with each other over trials. More seeds were harvested from the seed sources than pilfered by competitors at the early stage of hoarding. These results suggest that, under conspecific competition, squirrels appeared first to compete for food at the sources, then for caches with each other as food sources decreased, and finally cache ownership became relatively stable. Squirrels compensated for cache loss by both harvesting food from the sources and pilfering caches from its competitor. The amount of seeds gained from pilfering was sufficient to replace pilfered caches, supporting the reciprocal pilferage hypothesis. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Cryptic interactions among individuals in animal societies can be challenging to detect due to their rarity or their covert nature, but they can have important fitness consequences for the individuals involved. Using radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology, we examined the pattern and function of visits to the nests of conspecifics in western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana. Western bluebirds live in kin neighbourhoods year-round and exhibit a low frequency of cooperative breeding. Various functions have been proposed for extraterritorial visits, but few studies explore multiple potential functions. We asked whether extraterritorial visits in western bluebirds are consistent with (1) seeking extrapair copulations (EPCs), (2) prospecting for future nest sites or mates and/or (3) maintaining relationships with kin. We found some evidence supporting all three functions of visits. Postdawn visits made by males to unrelated females were significantly more likely to occur during the period in which males seek within-pair matings than outside this period. We found that visiting a given nestbox or a given potential mate was associated with an increased probability of nesting in that box or with the potential mate the subsequent year, suggesting that some visits are linked to prospecting. Finally, males preferentially visited kin: the proportion of visits to relatives was greater than the expected mean proportion of visits if males visited boxes randomly while travelling the same distance. Our work supports multiple functions of extraterritorial visits and highlights the importance of rare and cryptic behaviours to understanding social behaviour.

AB The observable diversity of antipredator defences across organisms demonstrates predation's impact on trait evolution. The functions of many traits that are presumed to have an antipredator function have never been directly tested. The spiny orb-weaving spider, Micrathena gracilis, for example, stridulates when grasped. While stridulation was first hypothesized to be an antipredator defence nearly 50 years ago, no data exist to support this hypothesis. To explore the form and function of M. gracilis stridulation, we first quantified the behavioural and acoustical properties of sound production. Next, using laboratory assays, we directly tested the effect of stridulation on survival with an avian predator - blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata. Finally, we conducted a large mark-recapture field study in which we compared the natural survival of experimentally manipulated adult female M. gracilis that could not stridulate (silenced) versus could stridulate (control). Stridulatory pulses produced broadband frequency spectra, consistent with acoustic antipredator defences in other taxa. We also observed stridulation by male M. gracilis for the first time. In staged laboratory interactions with captive blue jays, we found no differences in survival between silenced and control M. gracilis. Similarly, in our mark-recapture field study, we found no differences in survival estimates between silenced and control groups, nor an effect of stridulation rate. While M. gracilis stridulation closely resembles antipredator stridulation in other arthropods, our behavioural data do not yet provide solid support for an antipredator function in M. gracilis.

AB Behavioural thermoregulation can ameliorate thermal stress but is costly. For species that court in a thermally stressful microhabitat, sexual selection via endurance rivalry favours individuals that are able and willing to endure harsh conditions in the courtship habitat, as retreats to a thermal refuge will reduce mating opportunities. The relative costs and benefits of refuge use versus continued courtship in the face of thermal risk, which vary across abiotic and biotic contexts, determine the optimal behavioural strategy. We examined the social and abiotic factors driving behavioural decisions related to thermoregulatory retreat in the fiddler crab Austruca mjoebergi. Male fiddler crabs perform a courtship display on the thermally stressful intertidal sediment surface. Time on the surface, and thus time available for display, was limited by high temperatures; as temperature increased, surface time decreased. Yet when presented with a stimulus female, males were more likely to perform the courtship display, displayed at a higher rate and increased time spent on the surface. These results demonstrate that behavioural decisions related to thermal retreat depend both on the abiotic conditions that influence the degree of thermal stress and on the social conditions that influence the reproductive prospects of the individual.

AB Active guidance of vocal learning by conspecifics has recently been found in several species, including some cetaceans and primates. However, in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, a commonly studied songbird, vocal learning was traditionally considered the product of memorization and imitation of a song model. Only recently have specific social feedback cues been shown to enhance song learning. What mechanisms drive the superior learning associated with social interactions? We recently found that 'fluff-ups', a nonvocal female arousal cue, facilitated song learning when played over video contingently on juvenile song production throughout development. However, it is unknown whether adults naturally respond in a contingent fashion to immature song, and whether young finches incorporate naturally occurring feedback into song learning. To investigate whether social influences affect song learning, the present study addressed the nature and significance of maternal and paternal cues associated with song development. We recorded unmanipulated zebra finch families throughout juvenile development and analysed their social interactions. We found that behaviours of both parents were associated with offspring song outcomes. Juvenile song learning could be predicted by the amount of contingent 'fluff-up' behaviours they received from their mothers throughout development. Fathers often sang immediately after a juvenile had sung, and paternal singing after juvenile singing was positively correlated with more accurate song learning in their sons. Conversely, when fathers sang before the juvenile sang, juveniles learned song less accurately. Our data suggest that parental vocal and gestural feedback plays a reinforcing role for song learning in zebra finches. There are many nonavian species, including chiropterans, pachyderms and pinnipeds, that modify their vocalizations in different developmental or social contexts but whose mechanisms of vocal learning are not known. Our findings suggest that these species should be closely examined for adult sensitivity to immature vocalizations and developmental capacity to learn from social feedback.

AB Killing of unrelated young by sexually naive male mammals is taxonomically widespread, but in many species, males subsequently show paternal care or at least do not harm their own young. This dramatic and important change is due to a shift in paternal state rather than to recognition of young, the mother or the location in which mating occurred. This transition from infanticidal to paternal behaviour is timed so that the inhibition of infanticide is synchronized with the birth of their own young. Ejaculation followed by cohabitation with the pregnant female causes this transition, but the precise stimuli from the female remain elusive. However, changes in social status also cause changes in infanticide. The switch from infanticide is accompanied by physiological change in the male that can be detected by both females and pups. Hormonal changes have been implicated in the switch but establishing causal links has been difficult. Recent neuroanatomical studies show that pup odours activate the vomeronasal organ and its efferent projections to induce infanticide. The emergence of paternal care depends on the inability of the vomeronasal organ to detect pup odours. In the absence of vomeronasal input, pup odours activate a conserved parental circuit and induce caregiving behaviour. An emerging picture is of complex, antagonistic circuits competing for behavioural expression, which allow for males to commit infanticide when they may benefit from such activity but ensure that they do not damage their fitness by killing their own young. However, we stress the need for more work on the neural mechanisms that mediate this process. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Because females produce and lay eggs or nurture embryos, they are constrained in the timing of their investment in reproduction. Males may have more opportunity to concentrate reproductive investment earlier in life, mating with as many females as possible soon after becoming adult. This fundamental difference leads to the prediction that because males can bias allocation towards increased reproductive investment early in life, they will use up resources earlier in their lives and hence senesce faster than females. A first step towards testing this prediction is to determine whether there are between-sex differences in age-related changes in behaviour. To do this we recorded the behaviour of crickets, Gryllus campestris, in a natural population living in and around their burrows in a meadow in northern Spain. Following individuals of both sexes through their adult lives, we recorded a range of nonreproductive behaviours, including how often they moved in and out of their burrows, how long they spent at the entrance, how long they spent outside, how quickly they left a burrow after fleeing inside to escape predation and whether they fed. We found evidence for substantial age-related changes in two of the movement traits in males, but not in females. Males moved less often and spent less time outside their burrows as they aged, whereas females showed no age-related changes in either trait. Feeding was not affected by age in males, but females fed more often as they got older. Our findings are consistent with the prediction that males senesce faster than females; experiments in nature will be needed to determine whether this pattern arises from life history trade-offs between reproduction and other traits.

AB Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism facilitating adaptation to environmental change that often varies among individuals. One reason for this individual variation is that plasticity may depend on state variables, such as size, condition or age, which affect the costs and benefits of plasticity. Recent theoretical work predicts that plasticity will decrease as an organism ages because costs of plasticity mean that flexible phenotypic adjustments by individuals to environmental change will be less beneficial as age-related survival prospects decrease. Here we used Nicrophorus vespilloides burying beetles to test this prediction in the context of parental care. Burying beetles use the carcasses of small vertebrates as resources for breeding and have complex, extended, flexible parental care. Our experiment manipulated female age and (the order of presentation of) carcass size in a repeated-measures design to test the prediction that older beetles are less plastic than younger beetles in parental care. We found evidence in support of our central prediction: young females showed greater mean levels of plasticity than older beetles for all traits (parental care, number of offspring, brood mass) except mean larval mass (i.e. size of offspring), with the response to changes in carcass size dependent on the order of carcass presentation for young females but not for older females. Between-trait correlation analysis revealed age-related trade-offs between the size and number of offspring for older, but not young, mothers. The three age-dependent traits, which were intercorrelated, were also repeatable, indicating potential for coevolutionary responses to selection.

AB Scent marking, where individuals deposit signals on objects in the environment, is a common form of chemical signalling in mammals and is thought to play a critical role in maintaining social organization within wide-ranging, spatially dispersed populations. Senders, however, can incur scent-marking costs through mark production, time investment in patrolling and depositing/maintaining mark sites, and increased risk of detection by predators and prey. To mitigate these costs, senders can adapt spatial patterns of scent marking to increase the probabilities of their scent marks being encountered by intended receivers. Relatively little, however, is known of the spatial scent-marking placements of many wide-ranging carnivore species, with most studies focusing on scent mark form and function. Here, we used detailed observational data collected from over 7 years of following individual leopards, Panthera pardus, and high-resolution GPS radiocollar data to investigate the spatial placements of scent marks within a leopard population in northern Botswana. We found that male leopards within our study area had a boundary scent-marking strategy, investing more in maintaining marking sites in peripheral areas of their home range. We also found that leopards scent-marked over four times as frequently and investigated over three times as frequently when travelling on roads than when travelling along natural routes, suggesting that roads may function as key locations for olfactory information. Compared to leopards from less productive ecosystems, such as the Kalahari, our results (1) suggest that leopards can be highly flexible in their marking strategies, with strategies impacted by the surrounding environment, and (2) provide evidence that human modifications of the environment now play an important role in facilitating social cohesion within this solitary carnivore.

AB Geographical variation has been widely studied in oscine songbirds, with particular attention paid to the interplay between variables associated with learned song and dispersal. While most field-based studies have focused on discrete dialects, analysing data from quickly growing citizen science libraries could uncover geographical patterns in species previously thought to exhibit random variation in song. Specifically, using citizen science birdsong databases, we test whether chipping sparrow, Spizella passerina, song is geographically structured on a continental scale. The chipping sparrow is a particularly well-suited species for this study, since individuals have a simple song of one repeated syllable, have only the beginning of their first breeding season to adjust their song before crystallization and have been shown to match their song to a nearby neighbour while establishing their first territory. If most chipping sparrows adopt a neighbour-matching strategy, we might expect local syllable similarity; in contrast, field studies have shown that local syllable diversity has been maintained over time. We analyse 820 individual recordings of the simple, yet diverse, song of chipping sparrows to assess whether long-range geographical patterns have formed despite this local song variation. We found significant correlations between song features and geographical distance, associated with longitude but not latitude: chipping sparrows in the eastern United States and Canada sing at a slower rate (fewer, longer syllables) than the western population. However, comparing individual syllable types between regions, we found diverse song types persist across this species' range. To better contextualize our findings, we re-evaluate available genetic sequences of chipping sparrows to test for genetic differentiation between the eastern and western populations in which we found song differences. Our results suggest that there are two culturally distinct subpopulations of migratory chipping sparrows that are genetically indistinguishable using mitochondrial DNA, motivating future studies on migration patterns and additional sequencing of nuclear DNA.

AB The decision to take risks in the presence of a predator involves complex trade-offs between immediate survival and future reproduction. Individuals may gain fitness advantages if they are able to optimally alter their risk-taking strategies depending on the differential costs and benefits of risky behaviours across contexts. Male fiddler crabs (Austruca mjoebergi) exhibited a higher propensity to take risks in the presence of a female compared with conspecifics that were not presented with a female during both mating and nonmating periods. Contrary to predictions, however, risk-taking behaviour did not differ between mating and nonmating periods.

AB Nonconsumptive effects of predators can have knock-on effects on prey fitness, life history and population dynamics. However, the origin of cues stimulating predator avoidance behaviour and the mechanisms underlying prey responses need further investigation. Previous studies revealed that nonconsumptive effects of predatory fish on Baetis mayfly larvae are mediated by water-borne chemical cues released from fish mucus. However, there are conflicting results regarding the nature of these cues and the specific role of the activity of fish mucus-dwelling bacteria in stimulating predator avoidance by prey. To address those conflicting results, we investigated whether bacteria dwelling in fish mucus and/or chemical components present in fish mucus are responsible for the predator avoidance response by Baetis mayflies to salmonids. Results of five bioassays conducted in microcosms revealed that to stimulate Baetis predator avoidance behaviour: (1) bacteria do not need to be present in salmonid mucus; (2) the saccharide fraction of the fish mucus glycosaminoglycan component, but neither the protein fraction nor the whole molecule, functions as a kairomone; (3) specific active components of the saccharide fraction are primarily amino sugars in the form of hexosamines; and (4) there is a minimum dose of mucus and specifically of hexosamine needed. Our study provides the first experimental evidence that mayfly larvae recognize fish predators via the amino sugars naturally present in fish skin mucus. These sugars are released into the water by microbially mediated breakdown of glycosaminoglycans. Further research on the responses of different invertebrate prey species to similar predator cues are needed to understand the evolutionary history of this kairomone recognition behaviour.

AB Raising a family is not free of conflict for parents, as each parent benefits when its partner provides more care for the offspring. Resolving this conflict requires cooperation between the parents. One way to achieve such cooperation might be to coordinate parental provisioning by synchronizing (i.e. returning to the nest at the same time) or alternating (i.e. taking turns) offspring provisioning at the nest. Empirical studies in birds indicate that pair coordination of the nest visits is common; however, it is unknown whether this behaviour is directly related to different outcomes of sexual conflict, such as brood desertion. We used the rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, a species with high levels of sexual conflict, to explore whether alternation and synchrony of the nest visits were related to later brood desertion. Pairs with no desertion alternated and synchronized their nest visits more than pairs in which one sex deserted. This difference in coordination was not simply a by-product of differences in provisioning by the parents. Synchrony of the visits also increased with offspring age in the pairs with no desertion. We provide evidence, for the first time to our knowledge, that the degree of parental coordination is strongly associated with the ultimate consequence of sexual conflict, brood desertion, supporting the idea that coordination in parental behaviour might promote conflict resolution.

AB Vigilance is considered an effective antipredator behaviour in animals, and hence it should reflect fearfulness. While numerous aspects of vigilance have been extensively studied, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the role of vigilance in escaping from predators. In a multispecies approach, we measured vigilance (as the proportion of time spent in a head-up posture) and three consecutive components of escape behaviour, predetection distance, assessment interval and flight initiation distance, of wild birds in urban and rural habitats in three European countries. Escape behaviour was induced by a human observer walking towards the focal bird whose vigilance was measured beforehand. More vigilant individuals did not detect predators earlier than less vigilant ones. In addition, more vigilant individuals spent more time on risk assessment and escaped later. Body mass was positively correlated with vigilance for birds on higher perches, where we expected vigilance to be less important. Finally, urban birds were more vigilant than rural birds, suggesting that distractions in urban habitats might have a more profound impact on vigilance than the expected lower predation risk. These results challenge the underlying assumption that more vigilant individuals have a higher perceived risk of predation and hence better odds at avoiding predation. We explain our results in the context that higher levels of vigilance compensate for environmental distractions and for innate deficiencies or lack of experience that constrain the detection of predators. We suggest that a re-examination of the basic functions and markers of vigilance is needed before using it as a measure of fearfulness in birds.

AB The ability to innovate and the social transmission of innovations have played a central role in human evolution. However, innovation is also crucial for other animals, by allowing them to cope with novel socioecological challenges. Although innovation plays such a central role in animals' lives, we still do not know the conditions required for innovative behaviour to emerge. Here, we focused on interindividual differences in innovation by (1) extensively reviewing existing literature on innovative behaviour in animals and (2) quantitatively testing the different evolutionary hypotheses that have been proposed to explain interindividual variation in innovation propensity during foraging tasks. We ran a series of phylogenetically controlled mixed-effects meta-regression models to determine which hypotheses (if any) are supported by currently available empirical studies. Our analyses show that innovation is more common in individuals that are older and belong to the larger sex, but also in more neophilic and/or explorative individuals. Moreover, these effects change depending on the study setting (i.e. wild versus captive). Our results provide no clear support to the excess of energy or the bad competitor hypotheses and suggest that study setting and interindividual differences in traits related to personality are also important predictors of innovation.

AB As many long-lived seabirds are biparental and monogamous, individuals need to choose their mates wisely. While assortative mating based on physical traits is widely studied, mate choice in sexually monomorphic species based on behavioural traits remains poorly understood. We propose that personality is a possible factor on which mate choice is based and that certain personality traits within a behavioural syndrome confer a greater fitness. Here we measure boldness, a commonly explored behavioural syndrome, in black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla, nesting at Middleton Island, Alaska, U.S.A. We measured boldness by presenting subjects with a novel object and recording the response. We considered the first principal component scores from the analysis of these responses to represent an individual's boldness. Some kittiwakes exhibited the strategy of assortative mating based on boldness, and bold birds that mated assortatively exhibited the greatest reproductive success. Within a breeding season, individuals became bolder as they reached the most critical point in the breeding season (chick hatching), which supports our finding that bolder individuals have greater reproductive success. We conclude that personality should be considered when investigating mate choice because individual personality may have an important influence on reproductive success.

AB When separated, young offspring produce separation calls to attract their mother's attention, reduce distance between them and receive maternal care. Previous studies suggest that these calls arouse the caregiver's attention because of their special acoustic structure. Furthermore, under specific conditions separation calls can elicit an approach response even from heterospecific mothers and nonparent con-specifics depending on their sex and parental experience and the species' parental care system. Dogs, Canis familiaris, are good models because we can easily test the effects of a wide range of individual characteristics such as sex, sexual state, age, breed and behaviour traits due to a diverse dog population. Here, we assessed the reaction of sexually mature, intact and neutered dogs to strange 4- and 11-day-old dog pup separation calls, presented from a hidden speaker. We recorded the reactions of former mothers, inexperienced intact females and males and inexperienced neutered females and males to six different repeated playbacks of pup separation call bouts. We tested the effect of sex, sexual state, parental experience and age of the dogs, the fundamental frequency, call length, jitter and nonlinear phenomena ratio of the playbacks and the habituation effect of repeated playbacks. We found a positive correlation between the jitter level of the sound and the dogs' attention, while the fundamental frequency negatively affected the dogs' orientation to the speaker and the door leading to the speaker. The sex, sexual state and parental experience of the dogs did not affect their reactions towards pup separation calls. Based on these results, it seems that dogs' reactions are affected mostly by the acoustics of the separation calls, not their own individual characteristics.

AB Humans and their associated anthropogenic factors may strongly affect the demographics, activity and fragmentation of wild animal populations. Yet, the degree and nature of such impact on indicators of animals' social relationships remain largely under-investigated, despite the well-documented importance of strong social ties for an individual's health and fitness. Here, we examined whether interactions with humans may affect core aspects of social life in a primate species, by constraining the time available for individuals to engage in social interactions. Specifically, we predicted that individuals who spend more time monitoring or interacting with humans would reduce their time socializing with conspecifics (i.e. the time constraints hypothesis). Alternatively, human presence may result in increased levels of stress, leading to an increase in social behaviours that serve as a coping mechanism (i.e. the social stress hypothesis). We collected data between September 2016 and September 2017 on four groups of longtailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis, in Malaysia at two sites with differing levels of human impact. In support of the time constraints hypothesis, we found that at the site with moderate human impact, monkeys who monitored human activity more frequently engaged less often in grooming. In contrast, at the site with high human impact, we found evidence supporting the social stress hypothesis, as indicators of stress were positively associated with social interactions, although we could not link them to the presence of humans. Our results suggest that the nature of human impact on macaques' social behaviour is dependent upon the intensity of human activity and interaction with the macaques. These findings therefore provide insights into how humans may influence individual fitness and group social structure in animals living in an anthropogenic environment. More broadly, our results may lead to a better understanding of animal behaviour in anthropogenic environments, implementing conservation and population management strategies and mitigating human-wildlife conflict.

AB The 'positive allometry hypothesis' predicts that ornaments and weapons of sexual selection will scale steeply when among-individual variation in trait size is compared with variation in overall body size. Intuitive and striking, this idea has been explored in hundreds of contemporary animal species and sparked controversy in palaeobiology over the function of exaggerated structures in dinosaurs and other extinct lineages. Recently, however, challenges to this idea have raised questions regarding the validity of the hypothesis. We address this controversy in two ways. First, we suggest the positive allometry hypothesis be applied only to morphological traits that function as visual signals of individual body size. Second, because steep scaling slopes make traits better signals than other body parts, we propose that tests of the positive allometry hypothesis compare the steepness of the scaling relationships of focal, putative signal traits to those of other body parts in the same organism (rather than to an arbitrary slope of 1). We provide data for a suite of 29 extreme structures and show that steep scaling relationships are common when structures function as signals of relative body size, but not for comparably extreme structures that function in other contexts. We discuss these results in the context of animal signalling and sexual selection, and conclude that patterns of static scaling offer powerful insight into the evolution and function of disproportionately large, or extreme, animal structures. Finally, using data from a ceratopsid dinosaur and a pterosaur, we show that our revised test can be applied to fossil assemblages, making this an exciting and powerful method for gleaning insight into the function of structures in extinct taxa.

AB In diverse animal taxa, breeding partners coordinate their vocalizations to produce vocal duets. One seldom-studied hypothesis for duets is the paternity guarding hypothesis, which states that male animals create duets to advertise their partner's mated status and minimize extrapair mating attempts between their partner and other males. We experimentally tested the paternity guarding hypothesis in rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, a neotropical duetting songbird. We designed a two-part playback experiment: males first experienced a simulated territorial intrusion by a rival male, and were then given opportunities to answer their female breeding partner's songs to create duets. We repeated this experiment during the female's fertile and nonfertile breeding stages. In support of predictions of the paternity guarding hypothesis, male wrens created more duets with their partner's songs during the fertile period compared to the nonfertile period. Additionally, male wrens appeared to physically guard their mates with greater intensity during the fertile period but did not increase their overall song rates, demonstrating that increased duetting rates during the fertile period were a result of a change in male duetting behaviour, rather than a change in song rate. Our study is among the first to experimentally test the paternity guarding hypothesis for duet function, and suggests that male rufous-and-white wrens use both vocal and physical behaviours to guard their paternity.

AB Territoriality occurs in a wide variety of animal taxa. The defence of valuable resources, which in the case of territoriality are bound to a specific location, gives the defender priority of access to these resources. Males often defend areas in which the chance to meet females is high and territoriality frequently includes pheromonal marking. When closely related species co-occur within the same environment, different behavioural strategies frequently evolve to avoid reproductive interference. Males of the gregarious parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis exhibit territorial behaviour on the host from which they emerge. However, descriptions of territorial behaviour have been for the most part anecdotal and quantitative standardized observations in an experimental set-up are lacking. In addition, studies of the behaviour of the other Nasonia species that frequently occur in microsympatry, that is, within the same host individual, have rarely been conducted. We investigated and compared territoriality in two species of Nasonia by extensive video recording of emerging wasps in a microcosm approach. We show that males of N. vitripennis meet the concept of territoriality whereas males of Nasonia giraulti do not. Although N. giraulti females are already mated when emerging from the host and males do not show territoriality, N. giraulti males mark the substrate with their abdominal sex pheromone as often as males of N. vitripennis. For N. vitripennis we further show that, although larger males were more often territorial, experience of being in the territorial position was particularly important for winning territoriality contests. Finally, we investigated differences in the pattern of emergence and dispersal between the two species and discuss how the different behavioural strategies may help them avoid reproductive interference.

AB For many species, learning is an essential mechanism for dealing with the environment correctly and efficiently. Animals that quickly learn important information, and learn at a young age, can gain a competitive advantage in exploiting resources. Moreover, animals that learn indirectly through social observations can avoid the fitness costs of directly learning about potential dangers. Here we tested such learning capabilities in ringed salamanders, Ambystoma annulatum, a species where adults are primarily solitary and do not provide parental care. Adults lay eggs in ponds where embryos have the opportunity to learn from chemical cues in their environment before hatching, whereupon the high density of larvae provides an opportunity to learn from social information. In this study, we found that these salamanders can learn an attraction to novel food stimuli as embryos and that naive observer larvae can learn from conspecifics that show attraction to stimuli. Embryonic exposure to a novel food stimulus (shrimp odour) caused attraction to that stimulus posthatching, and this response appeared to be generalized to another potential prey stimulus (mussel odour) but not to a novel plant stimulus. In a test of social learning, only observers that were paired with models corralled near a novel food stimulus were subsequently attracted to the stimulus. This study is the first to report embryonic learning of food or social learning by salamanders, providing more evidence for generalized learning by embryos and social learning by species lacking more complex social behaviours.

AB Many aquatic animals learn to recognize novel predators when they simultaneously perceive the odours of these novel threats paired with alarm cues released by injured conspecifics. Since the odours of several organisms may be present simultaneously in the environment during this process, selection is expected to favour learning mechanisms that allow prey to respond independently to the odour of each species in a mixture of odours. We tested this hypothesis by exposing tadpoles of the edible frog, Pelophylax esculentus, to injured conspecific cues paired with either the odour of two fish species (experiment 1) or one fish and one crayfish species (experiment 2). We subsequently tested the ability of tadpoles to respond to each odour separately. We found clear evidence that tadpoles learned to recognize the odour of individual species in the mixture and that the response to each odour of a mixture was equally strong. However, the learned response was weaker overall in tadpoles conditioned with the mixture of fish and crayfish compared to those with the two fish species. Our study reveals that tadpoles can adaptively handle the presence of multiple predator odours in their environment during conditioned learning, but highlights some constraints that may due to the diversity of predators in the mix.

AB Social interactions affect the transmission of many pathogens, but infections often induce sickness behaviours that alter those interactions. Vampire bats are highly mobile and social, engaging in frequent allogrooming, which is likely to facilitate pathogen spread. Sickness behaviour is known to reduce social associations, but the effect on physical interactions between associated individuals, such as grooming, is less understood. Here, we tested the effects of induced sickness behaviour on allogrooming in vampire bats, while holding association between individuals in groups constant. To experimentally induce sickness behaviour, we used injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and saline controls in 13 female common vampire bats, Desmodus rotundus, housed in stable groups of two to four adult bats. LPS injection induced an immune response that mimicked illness. Circulating leukocytes and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios increased, while body mass and activity decreased. While LPS-injected bats did not receive less grooming from their group mates, they dramatically reduced the amount that they groomed their partners. This reduction in social interactions illustrates that sickness behaviour can potentially change transmission rates by altering directed behaviours, even under conditions of constant close proximity. The ability to manipulate social behaviours under controlled conditions should also prove useful for experiments attempting to test mechanisms underlying cooperation.

AB Sex allocation models still fail to predict the complex sex ratio patterns in broods of vertebrates. A major problem when studying mother-brood interactions is the difficulty in disentangling hypotheses involving maternal preferences from processes that do not imply maternal manipulation. We studied maternal resource allocation in mixed-sex, same-sex and single-chick broods in the great bustard, Otis tarda. Females normally rear a single chick, and previous work has shown that maternal investment influences male more than female breeding success. Therefore, mothers of two-chick broods were assumed to be in good condition and candidates to show a preference for sons. Results showed that male chicks of mixed-sex broods remained close to the mother for twice as long as their sisters, and received double the number of maternal feedings. However, sex differences in maternal feeding rate disappeared when considering only simultaneous begging approaches from both siblings. Proximity to the mother and its interaction with begging approach intensity were the factors determining the higher begging success of male chicks. In single-chick broods, females did not receive fewer maternal feedings than males. Overall, our results suggest that female chicks of mixed-sex broods become outcompeted by their larger brothers, which remain close to the mother much longer, preventing their sisters from taking a larger share of maternal feedings. We conclude that mothers do not show a preference for feeding male over female chicks, and that the sex differences in feeding rate are determined by the higher food requirements of male chicks due to their sexually selected, much faster growth rates. The higher mortality of females in mixed-sex broods contrasts with the pattern of male-biased mortality typical in this species, and supports our interpretation of an asymmetric competitive ability of male offspring as the mechanism responsible for the sex bias in maternal expenditure.

AB Patterns of individual differences in cognition have been studied empirically and systematically in the last decade, but causes and consequences of this variation are still largely unclear. A recent hypothesis suggests that one predictor of individual variation in cognition is personality, and specifically that personality types are linked to cognitive styles through a speed-accuracy trade-off. We tested specific predictions of this hypothesis, measuring individual differences in associative learning speed and flexibility, quantified via reversal learning, of 86 bank voles, Myodes glareolus, along with their activity and boldness. We found that bolder and more active individuals were fast, inflexible and persistent in the associative learning tasks, whereas shyer and less active individuals were slow and flexible. We also found evidence for a speed-accuracy trade-off: correct choices in the cognitive tasks required more time for all individuals compared to incorrect choices, but bolder, more active voles always made their decisions faster than reactive ones. The difference between the time required for a correct and an incorrect choice was most pronounced in initial learning for shyer and less active individuals, but for bolder, more active individuals it was most pronounced in the reversal learning task. We also found differences related to sex and age: females were faster than males to update information or correct incorrect choices and older animals took longer to initiate the test. Our results confirm the hypothesis that individual differences in behaviour are reflected in different 'cognitive styles', differentially trading off speed for flexibility and accuracy in cognitive tasks. Moreover, we provide the first evidence for the mechanisms of such a trade-off in a small mammal. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB How predators search for prey is a cornerstone question in behavioural ecology, which has yet to be investigated for animals foraging in 3D airspace. Do insectivorous birds such as swifts (Apodidae), swallows and martins (Hirundinidae) use similar strategies to those performed by terrestrial predators in 2D, or do they rely on different spatial search strategies because of some properties of the aerial open space? We addressed this question in the common swift, one of the most aerial birds, using a novel 3D optical tracking method. The analysis of fine-scale flight tracks revealed how birds distribute their presence in 3D space while foraging near their breeding colony. Common swifts concentrated the time spent per volume unit by adopting a tortuous path, and, to a much lesser extent, by decreasing their movement speed. By independently observing the birds' posture on tracking images, we were able to identify the occurrence of putative prey captures along flight tracks. We show that swifts' presence was concentrated mainly in the vicinity of prey captures, unveiling a volume-concentrated search (VCS) strategy in this aerial insectivore. This is an extension in 3D of the area-concentrated search classically described in terrestrial 2D space. VCS can (but does not necessarily) take place in thermal updrafts, where small insects can be concentrated in patches. In contrast to terrestrial and aquatic predators that can easily slow down or stop their movement in profitable places, a different speed-cost relationship underlying aerial movement prevents swifts from stopping in prey patches and explains why these birds rely mainly on movement tortuosity to perform intensive search. Our study thus shows how some physical properties of the environment can modulate the way an animal concentrates its search in profitable places.

AB Female octopuses are known to store sperm from multiple males they encounter throughout a breeding season, before laying a single clutch with mixed paternity. Although octopuses display a broad range of precopulatory behaviours, and both sperm competition and cryptic female choice have been hypothesized to occur, the current understanding of how these processes influence resulting paternity remains limited. This study aimed to identify behavioural factors associated with paternity patterns and the capacity of females to bias paternity postcopulation to specific males in the southern blue-ringed octopus, Hapalochlaena maculosa. Genetic markers and controlled, sequential, laboratory pairings of genotyped individuals were used to examine paternity patterns and compare them to relative signatures of male sperm remaining in female oviducal glands after egg laying. Multiple paternity was discovered in all 12 laboratory-reared clutches. There was no indication that the relative time spent in copulation affected the resulting paternity. Males that waited for females to terminate the copulation had greater paternity when they were the first candidate male, but this was not the case among second candidate males. The relative quantities of candidate male alleles detected in female oviducal glands after egg laying were consistent with relative paternity of the candidate males in all but three cases. In one of these, sibship analysis revealed that the male that obtained less paternity than expected was in fact the female's full-sibling brother. Although this study found no evidence for female postcopulatory selection of male sperm, anecdotal evidence suggests that female H. maculosa might benefit from polyandry if chemical processes can favour clutch fertilization by unrelated males. Future studies, investigating paternity bias among genotyped males of varying, but known relatedness to the female, might help to validate this pattern.

AB Reproductive skew in polygynous mating systems leads to variation in mating strategies, or the tactics within strategies, adopted by individual males. For example, variation in the timing of reproductive effort might reflect trade-offs between maximizing access to receptive females and minimizing interactions with competitors. For capital breeding grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, male mating success has been positively linked to total duration of tenure, but without differentiation of intraseasonal changes in reproductive effort. The aims of this study were to identify tactics within the tenured male strategy based on the timing of social dominance as a metric of reproductive effort, and to compare mating success across identified tactics. Our results confirm that duration of stay on the colony explained the most variation in mating success, but effect strength was reduced for tenures longer than 10 days. Additionally, there was evidence that timing of reproductive effort within a breeding season also contributed to observed variation in mating success. Males that maximized their dominance score at or after the peak in female attendance achieved greater mating success, relative to those who were dominant earlier in the breeding season. Males who timed their reproductive effort earlier in the season still achieved some mating success, but it was reduced. Individuals' tactics were flexible across years, and we found no evidence to support the hypotheses that timing of reproductive effort before or after the peak in female attendance was used by smaller tenured males, or to avoid conflict. These results highlight that understanding temporal scheduling of individual reproductive effort within a breeding season, relative to the availability of resources, constraints of fasting and intermale competition, is a key aspect to consider when differentiating individual tactics in long-lived, capital polygynous breeders.

AB Many songbird species have a predisposition to learn conspecific songs, suggesting song learning may be guided by an innate auditory template. Evidence for such a template includes preferential response to conspecific song in early life, even before song learning begins. A prime example of an innate cue for selective song learning is the introductory whistle of white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys. The songs of its sister species, the golden-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia atricapilla, also contain an introductory whistle, which differs in structure from that of white-crowned sparrows. Here we tested the ability of nestling golden-crowned sparrows in a sympatric population to discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific songs based on introductory whistles alone, prior to the onset of song learning. Golden-crowned sparrow nestlings responded with more chirps to playbacks of conspecific whistles than to heterospecific (white-crowned sparrow) whistles, and they responded similarly to full conspecific songs and conspecific whistles alone. We suggest that the introductory whistle alone is sufficient for song recognition in the golden-crowned sparrow. We discuss similarities and differences in the role of the introductory whistle between these sister taxa, and how this divergent song phrase may share a role in species recognition in both sister species. Identifying the cues underlying song recognition prior to song learning could be key to understanding the evolution of behavioural isolation between closely related songbird species.

AB Effective recognition of conspecific mating signals reduces the risk of maladaptive hybridization. Dissecting the signal recognition algorithms that underlie preferences is a useful approach for testing whether closely related taxa evaluate the same or different signal features to achieve mate recognition. Such data provide information about potential constraints and targets of selection during evolutionary divergence. Using a series of mate choice trials, we tested whether closely related, but genetically and phenotypically divergent, field cricket species (Teleogryllus oceanicus and Teleogryllus commodus) use shared or distinct recognition algorithms when evaluating acoustic male calling songs. These species overlap in sympatry, show premating isolation based on female discrimination of male calling songs, yet are capable of producing hybrid offspring. Unexpectedly, female selectivity for features of male song differed between the two species. We found that the two species use a combination of shared and unique signal filtering mechanisms, and we characterized how information about male carrier frequency, pulse rate and temporal patterning is integrated to achieve song recognition in each species. These results illustrate how comparatively few, simple modifications in key components of signal recognition algorithms can lead to striking interspecific discrimination between closely related taxa, despite apparent signal complexity. The finding that some steps during signal recognition and filtering are shared between the species, while others differ, can help to identify behavioural traits targeted by selection during evolutionary divergence.

AB To combat the threat of predation, prey species have developed a variety of ways to recognize and respond appropriately to novel predators. While there is evidence that predator recognition does not require learning in certain species, learning appears to play an important role for other species. In systems where learning is important, it is less clear whether predator identification requires prior experience with specific predators or, whether general experience with predators provides sufficient tools for identifying similar species of novel predators. Here we test whether wild-living adult birds recognize a dangerous predator that occurs in only part of their geographical range. We presented taxidermy mounts of little owls, Athene noctua, and sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, to blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, and great tits, Parus major. All populations of both tit species co-occur with sparrowhawks, but populations differ in their prior experience with little owls. We found that tits that overlap geographically with little owls responded to little owls using the same intensity of mobbing behaviour exhibited toward sparrowhawks. In populations with no historical contact with little owls, however, both blue and great tits treated little owls as a lower threat than sparrowhawks. These results suggest that blue tits and great tits do not generalize ` predatory features' to novel predators and instead need prior experience with specific predators before they assign the correct level of threat.

AB Because avoiding predation is crucial for fitness, foraging animals must trade acquisition of high-quality resources against risk avoidance when the best resources occur in locations with high predation risk. Although optimality models predict the distance at which an animal should initiate vigilance and flight, many studies have shown that animals generally flee soon after detecting an approaching threat, supporting the 'flush early and avoid the risk' (FEAR) hypothesis. Despite this, flight behaviour varies markedly depending on context, suggesting some behavioural plasticity in the response of prey to a given threat. We evaluated the degree of plasticity in the flight responses of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, a highly flexible species which thrives in human-dominated landscapes. Based on individually identifiable animals and a standardized flight initiation protocol, we measured the distance at which a deer detected an approaching threat, and the distance at which it subsequently initiated flight. Our results provide strong support for the FEAR hypothesis, suggesting that alert and flight responses are strongly coupled in roe deer. However, the perceived level of both risk (in terms of landscape openness and proximity to human infrastructure) and reward (in terms of habitat quality) influenced the time it took for a deer to detect an approaching threat, and the subsequent time for which the threat was tolerated prior to flight. Overall, our findings indicate that although roe deer minimize monitoring costs when assessing risk by fleeing early, they also adjust their monitoring and flight responses to the local risk-resource trade-off.

AB Females of many iteroparous species face trade-offs between producing one or multiple broods per reproductive season, and over fertilizing broods with sperm from the same or different mates. Both trade-offs might be affected by the availability of males (i.e. absence/presence of males) and the timing and duration of male encounters. Here, we experimentally manipulated the duration of mate availability at the first brood and mate availability per se (i.e. absence/presence of mates) at the second brood, and tested their effects on female and male reproductive success, using the common lizard, Zootoca vivipara, as a model species. Females were either exposed to males for a long period before their first annual reproduction and they could remate before their second annual reproduction (unrestricted treatment), or they were exposed to males for a short period before their first annual reproduction and were not allowed to remate (restricted treatment). Reproductive success of first clutches was not directly affected by the duration of access to males. Remating positively affected the probability of producing a second clutch, and the proportion of viable offspring. Remating by females also affected the reproductive success of males: fewer second clutch eggs were fertilized with stored sperm in unrestricted than restricted females. Sperm presence in males was high until the end of the remating period. Our results suggest a close coevolution between male and female reproductive strategies and point to facultative skipping of second broods when fitness benefits are small. This shows that behavioural strategies are at least partially responsible for multiple annual broods. These behavioural strategies are likely to be widespread, given the multitude of taxa raising multiple broods in some but not all years, and given that in most taxa some but not all individuals produce multiple annual broods.

AB Aggression between conspecific males is widespread in the animal kingdom, as is the fact that some individuals are far more aggressive than others. Consistent interindividual differences in behavioural profiles are generally regarded as a hallmark for animal 'personality' in both vertebrates and invertebrates, but their proximate causes are poorly understood. While the social experiences of winning and losing are known to lead to heightened and depressed aggressiveness, respectively, and that different fighting experiences can lead to changes in other behaviours, the extent to which interindividual variation in aggression and correlated behaviours are determined alone by fighting experience, environmental factors or inherited predisposition is unclear. In this study, we video tracked individual, virgin adult male crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, to quantify their general motility, exploratory behaviour and attraction to conspecific males after 48 h of social isolation, and compared this with their performances 24 h later, immediately after a fighting tournament that yielded cohorts of aggressive winners and submissive losers. Although all known behavioural effects of previous social experience in crickets last only a few hours at most, we found significant behavioural differences between the 48 h isolated future winners and losers, i.e. before the fight tournament. However, the experiences of winning and losing led to more pronounced and some additional changes in behaviour. We discuss whether these different behavioural profiles associated with the chances of winning and losing ('personalities') could arise from factors other than fighting experience, or possibly from dominance and subjugation experiences gathered under crowded culture conditions before social isolation with cumulative effects that may persist longer than those presently known.

AB The spatial distribution of organisms in patchy environments can be determined by the relationship between habitat quality and animal behaviour. In species with complex life cycles, such as pond-breeding amphibians, the selection of a suitable wetland is crucial. While the traditional view of amphibian ecology suggests strong site fidelity and low vagility, more recent research highlights mechanisms involving active site choice through avoidance behaviour and bet-hedging strategies in heterogeneous environments. The introduction of fish to the aquatic environment is one of the factors that may alter site selection and lead to local dispersal. In this context, we investigated the habitat choice of Alpine newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris, in networks of fish (Carassius auratus) and fishless aquatic patches. Using a laboratory design consisting of aquaria divided into two water tanks connected by a terrestrial platform, we assessed newt distribution and movement between patches. During the breeding period, we compared the reproductive success of individuals in two types of networks. We found that newts escaped fish by rapidly changing aquatic patches and then aggregating in safe aquatic patches that were free of fish. In the fish network, newts maintained reproduction, but the high local abundance resulted in decreased sexual activity and egg production and increased use of the terrestrial habitat. However, in the fishless network, newts moved between aquatic patches several times, exhibited more courtship behaviour and laid more eggs than they did in the fish networks. Our results showed both adaptive habitat switching due to environmental risks in the fish network and habitat supplementation (i.e. use of alternative resources) in the fishless network. Such studies on movement behaviour and habitat selection have conservation implications in showing that the persistence of native species in invaded networks depends on the rescue effect, with immigration to fish-free habitats potentially preventing local extinction.

AB Both human and nonhuman primates use imperative pointing to request a desired object from another individual. Gaze alternation often accompanies such pointing gestures, and in species that have no hands this can in itself function as imperative pointing. Dogs have exceptional skills in communicating with humans. The early development of these skills is suggested to have been facilitated by domestication. Adult wolves socialized with humans can use human-provided information to find food in various situations, but it is unclear whether they would use gaze alternation to show their human partner a target location they cannot reach on their own. In our experiment, we tested wolves and dogs in a task where they could indicate an out-of-reach food location to one of two human partners. One partner reacted in a cooperative way and gave the food hidden in the indicated location to the subject whereas the other responded in a competitive way and ate the food herself. Our results suggest that wolves, as well as dogs, use 'showing' behaviours to indicate a food location to a human partner, and that both can adjust their communication to the cooperativeness of their human partners, showing more indicating signals in the presence of the cooperative partner than in the presence of the competitive one. We conclude that wolves and dogs, both kept in packs under the same conditions, can use humans as cooperative partners, and point imperatively in order to receive a desired out-of-reach object. It seems that intensive socialization with humans enables both wolves and dogs to communicate cooperatively about a food location with humans, most probably relying on skills that evolved to promote social coordination within their packs.

AB Intrasexual competition in female birds is a widespread phenomenon but remains scarcely explored. Females compete for limited resources and the expression of signals that indicate their social status will be favoured by natural selection, generating a dominance hierarchy among individuals. However, which signals might be involved in female-female competition is unclear. In this study, we tested the role of rump coloration as a badge of status within a context of intrasexual competition using common kestrels, Falco tinnunculus, in two populations over 3 years. We used natural decoys with two different 'phenotypes', since the expression of this melanin-pigmented trait within the browne-grey range has been suggested to be a reliable proxy of individual quality in female common kestrels. By showing natural decoys with grey and brown rumps to breeding females, we simulated territorial invasions of high-and low-quality females, respectively. Our results show that rump coloration generates a differential response during territorial invasions. Specifically, we found that grey-rumped decoys (high quality) elicited lower levels of aggressiveness. In addition, female agonistic response was negatively associated with clutch size. Based on our results, we suggest that female rump coloration works as a badge of status in breeding female kestrels. This trait may signal female competitive ability and can generate a dominance hierarchy among individuals in our population. We also suggest that aggressiveness can be costly to females in terms of reproductive outcome. Overall, we provide evidence that melanin-pigmented traits in females can play a key role in intrasexual competition.

AB Fissione-fusion dynamics, consisting of regular shifts in the size and composition of social groups, are prevalent in animal societies and have implications for foraging success, disease and information transfer, and the fitness of individuals. Thus, the individual and environmental factors that drive social dynamics have become a focus of recent investigations. River otters, Lontra canadensis, in coastal Alaska have a plastic social system, influenced by forage fish availability. These carnivores also regularly frequent terrestrial latrine sites, where they associate and communicate through deposition of odorous substances. To investigate fissione-fusion dynamics in this system we (1) deployed camera traps to record social behaviours at latrine sites and (2) attached proximity tags to quantify encounter rates among individuals. Camera detections demonstrated that most latrine visits were of single otters and small groups (2-8 individuals). Fusion events into large groups (up to 18 individuals) were infrequent. Larger groups were recorded at crossover latrines, where trails connected bodies of water, whereas social behaviour was more frequent at spatially central latrines. Visiting otters performed signalling behaviours more frequently than social behaviours, especially at crossover sites. Proximity tag data revealed that the timing of fission and fusion events coincided with latrine visits and that spatial overlap was a good predictor of social interaction. Thus, the structural and spatial features of latrines influence their function as centres of information exchange, social activity hubs and meeting places among small social units, with implications for river otter group dynamics. We conclude that shifting social and environmental conditions may lead to high communication complexity. This unique social system provides novel evidence of the role of olfactory communication in mediating social decisions. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A strong motivation for one individual to aggregate with others is to reduce their vigilance because other group members provide coverage and warning of approaching predators. This collective vigilance means that a focal individual is usually less susceptible to predation than when alone. However, individuals differ in their vigilance levels depending on status and context. They may also differ in how they adjust their vigilance levels as group size changes. This flexibility in response means that the collective vigilance of a group, and hence its optimal size, is not intuitive. We demonstrate, in both natural and experimental systems, that male and female pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, in harems differentially adjusted their vigilance levels as harem size changed. Females became less vigilant as harems became larger, and benefited by increasing their foraging time. Conversely, males became more vigilant as harems became larger. We calculated the collective probability that a harem would detect a predator. Within natural harem sizes, a male and two females exhibited the highest probability of collective detection, with decreases as more females joined. This optimal harem size matched the average harem size observed at our study site. Females may join harems for benefits of collective vigilance. Despite both sexes having a shared interest in larger harems for mating benefits, optimal harem size is influenced by trade-offs in a nonsexual behaviour, vigilance. This results in males with relatively small harems, females associating with less preferred males and each male being surrounded by fewer females than he could mate with.

AB Changing body colour in animals generally reflects a conflict between two selection pressures, camouflage and social signalling. Chameleons are among the few organisms that resolve this conflict by rapid and temporary change in body colour for both background matching and social display. Male common chameleons, Chamaeleo chamaeleon, employ two alternative mating tactics, dominants and subordinates, both of which are associated with long-term body colour patterns and instantaneous colour displays during social encounters. Hence, males present a good model in which to study the influence of mating tactic on the decision of whether to remain cryptic or to signal. We exposed individuals to two conflicting external stimuli: background manipulations, which challenge camouflage, and the presence of a female, which stimulates sexual signalling. No individuals of either mating tactic responded to background manipulation except when the shift was from green to brown background or vice versa. Ambient temperatures affected colour matching but not sexual signalling, while body temperature affected neither. Males ignored the background colour and prioritized being distinctive when encountering females. As such, males were more likely to engage in sexual signalling than crypsis. Subordinate sneakers signalled females more frequently than the dominant, female-guarding males, suggesting that sneakers rapidly signal females their intentions when the dominant is out of range. Conversely, dominant males may gain little by frequent signalling to the females they guard, while possibly gaining more by diverting this energy towards mate guarding. Our results suggest that specific male mating tactics strongly influence the decision to use crypsis or sexual signalling. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals use social information from conspecifics as an extended sensor network to monitor their environment and may bias their preference to information from particular individuals, e.g. individuals they are most familiar with. This may be especially important for energy-constrained foragers, such as the frugivorous Peter's tent-making bat, Uroderma bilobatum. We used the outcome of a two-demonstrator social-learning test in which individual U. bilobatum had to make cue-elicited decisions based on food odours from bats from different social groups to test three alternative hypotheses. Bats could show either (1) a preference for information from roostmates ('familiar social partner'), (2) no bias in information used ('any social partner') or (3) a preference for novel cues from nonroostmates ('novel social partner' hypothesis). We found that U. bilobatum preferred food demonstrated by nonroostmates to that demonstrated by roostmates, providing support for the novel social partner hypothesis. Uroderma bilobatum bias their attention towards novel conspecifics, perhaps as a strategy for acquiring knowledge of unknown ephemeral food sources, which in turn might help them survive resource bottlenecks.

AB The rate at which infants develop can vary within species. This variation may be due to differences between infants in their nutritional intake and physiology, or the ability of females to adjust the amount and timing of maternal investment to maximize their lifetime reproductive success. This is the first primate study that uses a large sample size and multivariate analyses to investigate whether variation in early infant development (measured visually using durations of natal coat stages) is explained by differences in infanticide pressure, predation pressure or feeding competition among mothers. We recorded the number of days that infants took to transition through each of the two natal coat stages (white to grey: N = 32; grey to black-and-white: N = 22), as well as through their entire natal coats (white to black-and-white: N = 38) in a population of wild ursine colobus, Colobus vellerosus. Infant males, which are at greater risk of infanticidal attacks, transitioned coat colours earlier than females, and infants in multimale groups, where infanticide occurs more frequently, transitioned earlier than infants in unimale groups. Variation in group size did not affect natal coat durations, which suggests that the intensity of predation risk and feeding competition do not influence development. Instead of terminating investment in offspring before birth, as in the 'Bruce effect', females may invest more heavily in infants after birth in order to speed up infant development and reduce the time period during which offspring are the most vulnerable to infanticide. Mothers may therefore have flexible means of exerting choice over maternal investment in relation to infanticide risk. However, the extent to which mothers and infants are responsible for adjusting the speed of development is unknown. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Empirical testing of optimal foraging models on diving air-breathing animals is limited due to difficulties in quantifying the prey field through direct observations. Here we used accelerometers to detect rapid head movements during prey encounter events (PEE) of free-ranging benthic-divers, Australian fur seals, Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus. PEE signals from accelerometer data were validated by simultaneous video data. We then used PEES as a measure of patch quality to test several optimal foraging model predictions. Seals had longer bottom durations in unfruitful dives (no PEE) than those with some foraging success (PEE >= 1). However, when examined in greater detail, seals had longer bottom durations in dives with more PEES, but shorter bottom durations in bouts (sequences of dives) with more PEES. Our results suggest that seals were generally maximizing bottom durations in all foraging dives, characteristic of benthic divers. However, successful foraging dives might be more energetically costly (e.g. digestive costs), thus resulting in shorter bottom durations at the larger scale of bouts. Our study provides a case study of how the foraging behaviour of a central place forager foraging in a fairly homogeneous environment, with relatively high travel costs, may deviate from current foraging models under different situations. Future foraging models should aim to integrate other aspects (e.g. diet) of the foraging process for more accurate predictions. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Biodiversity often serves to reduce zoonotic pathogens, such that prevalence is lower in communities of greater diversity. This phenomenon is termed the dilution effect, and although it has been reported for several pathogens (e.g. Sin Nombre virus, SNV), the mechanism is largely unknown. We investigated a putative mechanism, by testing the hypothesis that higher biodiversity alters behaviours important in pathogen transmission. Using deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and SNV as our host-pathogen system, and a novel surveillance system, we compared host behaviours between high-and low-diversity communities. Behaviours were observed on foraging trays equipped with infrared cameras and passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag readers. Deer mice inhabiting the more diverse site spent less time in behaviours related to SNV transmission compared to deer mice from the less diverse site. The differences were attributed to the composition of behavioural phenotypes ('bold' versus 'shy') on the sites. Bold deer mice were 4.6 times more numerous on the less diverse site and three times more likely to be infected with SNV than shy deer mice. Our findings suggest that biodiversity affects pathogen transmission by altering the presence of different behavioural phenotypes. These findings have implications for human health and conservation.

AB The evolution of remating and prolonged pair bonds in animals has generally been explained in terms of improved coordination and cooperation between familiar individuals, but costs of mate familiarity have rarely been considered. A possible cost for males is increased risk of losing paternity if familiarity enables females to detect when alternative sires are desirable, evade mate guarding or invest more in infidelity. To test whether this familiarity cost exists, we examined whether extrapair paternity increases with bond length in the socially monogamous blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, using microsatellite-based analysis of 384 broods. Extrapair paternity increased from 9.4% of broods in first pairings to 21.6% in second pairings, then declined to 7.5% in third through eighth pairings. On their first remating with a female, males faced enhanced risk of losing paternity, but thereafter the risk was no greater than on first matings. However, after loss of paternity, males were no more likely to divorce. Effects of familiarity on extrapair paternity could influence the evolution and taxonomic distribution of remating and prolonged pair bonding in socially monogamous animals.

AB Lateral biases in behaviours are common across animals. Greater laterality may be beneficial if it allows for more efficient neural processing, yet few studies have considered the possible importance of individual variation in lateral biases in wild animals, particularly for social behaviours. We examined lateral biases in lekking greater sage-grouse, Centrocercus urophasianus, a species in which males show lateral orientations during aggressive encounters and courtship interactions. For aggression, we found no significant lateral bias in fights, but when examining another agonistic behaviour, the side-to-side facing-past encounter, we found a left-eye bias but only in males that successfully mated with females. For courtship behaviour, we found that successfully mating males were more strongly lateralized than nonmating males, but the direction of laterality depended on whether males were using their binocular frontal field (left-eye bias) or monocular lateral hemifield (right-eye bias). Bias depended on social context as well; nonmating males showed a bias in courtship orientation only when far from the female. Our results reveal a complex pattern of laterality depending on the mating success of the male, his behaviour and the social environment in which he is acting. We found support for the hypothesis that greater laterality may be beneficial, although the mechanism for this relationship in this species remains unknown.

AB Social recognition is an integral component of behaviour that underlies many much larger behavioural suites. For example, monogamous pair bonding is relatively meaningless if an individual cannot recall with whom the bond was with. The prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster, is a socially monogamous rodent, well known for its long-term pair bonds between males and females. Although previous work has shown that bonded males reliably spend more time with their pair-mate over an unfamiliar female, recent work has demonstrated that single male prairie voles do not discriminate between females. This discrepancy raises the important question: do paired males distinguish between nonmate females? We asked whether pair bonding alters the expression of social recognition in male voles by comparing social recognition of single and pair-bonded males using the habituation/dishabituation paradigm. We found that pair-bonded, but not single male prairie voles showed social recognition of (nonmate) females, suggesting a shift in cognitive behaviour after pair bond formation. This difference was not due to differences in motivation to engage in social exchanges, as males attempted to contact unfamiliar females at similar levels. Based on these data, we speculate that the stage of life (single or bonded) influences the relevance of attending to social information of same- and opposite-sex conspecifics.

AB How an organism deals with stressors is an integral component of survival. Recent research has shown that differences in a well-studied personality axis in fish, the shy-bold axis, relate to stress-coping behaviours. Bold fish tend to cope in a proactive manner (e.g. fighting) while shy fish cope more reactively (e.g. freezing). Because bold fish behave in a more risk-prone manner, it is likely that they encounter more stressors on average than shy fish. Greater exposure to stressful conditions may result in bold fish being less behaviourally sensitive to stressors (i.e. stress resilience). To investigate the idea of stress exposure leading to resilience, we examined whether fish personality (i.e. more bold or shy) affected anxiety-related behaviour in an open field task after fish had been exposed to a net-chasing stressor. We investigated open field behaviour in the presence and absence of a stressor (i.e. damage-induced alarm cues) to determine whether bolder fish would cope differently with a stressor than shy fish after recent stress exposure of a different type. Furthermore, we examined whether asymmetry in the habenula, an asymmetrical nucleus related to behavioural responses to stress and anxiety, is related to behaviour in the presence of stressors. We found no relationship between habenular asymmetry and behaviour in the open field. Net chasing increased activity in the open field for both sexes. We found an interaction between stress exposure and freezing behaviour in females but not in males. When females were not net-chased, shyer females showed a decrease in freezing behaviour when exposed to alarm cues, whereas bolder females showed no change in behaviour. When females were net-chased, there was no difference in freezing behaviour between bolder and shyer fish. We suggest that different parental care roles in this species lead to differential perceptions of the threat of stress between the sexes. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When and where to disperse is a major life history decision with crucial fitness consequences. Before dispersing, individuals may benefit from checking the suitability of potential future habitats. In highly social species, such prospecting may be directed towards other groups rather than alternative habitats. This may increase familiarity with neighbours and help individuals to successfully integrate into their group. Previous research on the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher revealed that individuals frequently engage in between-group prospecting. In this study, a combination of long-term observational data and experimental manipulations in the natural habitat of these fish suggests that prospecting increases survival, improves familiarity with members of neighbouring groups and serves to prepare individuals for between-group dispersal. Our findings highlight that dispersal in cooperative breeders can be a complex process involving interactions of potential dispersers with members of both the current group and groups that are possible targets of dispersal. Members of these groups may have divergent fitness interests regarding decisions of potentially dispersing individuals, which may have selected for the subtle preparation for intergroup dispersal observed in these cooperative cichlids.

AB Many vertebrates inhabit dynamic and loosely structured groups where group size and social composition continually fluctuates. The ability to sustain nonrandom interaction preferences across group changes is an important aspect in maintaining social organization. In two experiments, we explored the strength and persistence of social preferences for familiar conspecifics in brown-headed cowbirds. In the first experiment, we demonstrated that females preferentially associate with familiar females when introduced into a flock containing novel individuals. In the second experiment we investigated the consistency of familiarity preferences across a series of social introductions. Females maintained preferences to approach familiar conspecifics, and the individual strength of those preferences remained consistent across introductions. Male preferences changed across the introductions. In the first introduction, males showed a significant preference to approach familiar conspecifics, but increased their approaches towards novel conspecifics in subsequent introductions. Our findings suggest that female cowbirds are an important factor in maintaining social organization through their enduring associations with familiar individuals, whereas males facilitate social integration by extending connections towards novel individuals during periods of change.

AB In birdsong, and in most commonly studied acoustic communication systems, research has often focused on temporal and frequency-related signal parameters. However, although variations in amplitude are often overlooked and seldom measured, they are just as critical in communication. Recent studies have demonstrated that vocal amplitude plays an important role in both territorial behaviours and mate choice in birds. Several songbird species have been shown to produce low-amplitude songs, used primarily in aggressive encounters between males. On the other hand, loud songs may be an honest signal of current condition in males and recent studies have shown that females may prefer high-amplitude songs. Although it is generally assumed that louder song is more costly to produce, there is little empirical evidence to support this assumption. Here we review data on the metabolic costs of singing at different vocal amplitudes, and discuss recent studies from our laboratory showing that louder songs elicit stronger aggressive responses from territorial males. Together, these findings suggest that while the energetic costs of singing loudly are negligibly small, social aggression may be a key constraint that limits the upper amplitude of vocal signals. Finally we discuss future directions that can increase our understanding of the role that amplitude plays in acoustic communication in animals.

AB Male phenotypes vary across mating systems, but what about the female mind? In poeciliid fishes, we observe that female response towards males varies, both at inter-and intraspecific levels. By using the natural variation in poeciliid male reproductive phenotypes, we can probe female responses in different social contexts to isolate the neuromolecular components associated with mate choice. Female Xiphophorus nigrensis exhibit differential nonapeptide (isotocin, vasotocin) gene expression between social contexts that differ by social affiliation; while differential expression of synaptic plasticity genes (neuroserpin, neuroligin-3, NMDAR) is more strongly predictive of social contexts that differ by mate preference discrimination. Gene expression and pharmacological manipulation with X. nigrensis females suggests that the social cognition task of mate choice involves neuromolecular processes linked to learning at the cellular (synaptic plasticity genes) and regional (amygdala and hippocampus) levels. Comparative assays between two poeciliid species with different mating systems provide the first hint of a shared neuromolecular pathway underlying female mate preference response. Yet, it is still unclear how specific components of this neuromolecular pathway (nonapeptides and synaptic plasticity processes) interact to coordinate behavioural tasks associated with mate choice encounters (vigilance, affiliation, evaluation and discrimination). Nevertheless, this collection of studies, coupled with the natural diversity of poeciliid mating systems, pave the way for exciting new insights into the social cognition of mate choice.

AB The inverse relationship between body size and vocalization pitch has been described in a number of species. Nevertheless, the existence of size-pitch allometry within any songbird species is surprising due to the small size variation between males, the determinate growth and exceptional vocal prowess of the taxon. The phenomenon has been documented in only a few songbird species so far and the consequences of allometry remain unclear in this taxonomic group. In this study, we provide evidence that song spectral features are related to one of the body size components (tarsus length) even in a very small songbird species: the willow warbler, Phylloscopus trochilus. Moreover, the response of territorial males was affected by the pitch asymmetry between the subject and the playback stimulus: the lower-pitched the subject's song in respect to the stimulus the bolder was its response. Our results suggest that willow warbler males may use song pitch to assess the body size of their rivals (i.e. their fighting ability) in male -male competition for resources.

AB The social intelligence hypothesis argues that competition and cooperation among individuals have shaped the evolution of cognition in animals. What do we mean by social cognition? Here we suggest that the building blocks of social cognition are a suite of skills, ordered roughly according to the cognitive demands they place upon individuals. These skills allow an animal to recognize others by various means; to recognize and remember other animals' relationships; and, perhaps, to attribute mental states to them. Some skills are elementary and virtually ubiquitous in the animal kingdom; others are more limited in their taxonomic distribution. We treat these skills as the targets of selection, and assume that more complex levels of social cognition evolve only when simpler methods are inadequate. As a result, more complex levels of social cognition indicate greater selective pressures in the past. The presence of each skill can be tested directly through field observations and experiments. In addition, the same methods that have been used to compare social cognition across species can also be used to measure individual differences within species and to test the hypothesis that individual differences in social cognition are linked to differences in reproductive success.

AB Male peafowl display to females with erection and movement of their elaborately ornamented train. We hypothesized that the male's concave train serves as a radiator of acoustic signals, and thus examined both the production and perception of acoustic signals associated with these displays in Indian peafowl, Pavo cristatus. We discovered that male train displays produced infrasonic signals, which were perceived by both male and female peafowl. Both males and females responded to a subset of infrasonic signals by increasing the time they spent walking/running and being alert during playbacks relative to baseline controls. Male peafowl also increased rates of vocalization in response to infrasonic signals, but not to audible train-based signals. The apparent intra- and intersexual saliency of these signals suggests that they play a potent role in peafowl social signalling. Infrasonic signals are likely adaptive in the peacock's natural habitat, as they would attenuate minimally as they are propagated through dense vegetation that otherwise would attenuate high frequencies in audible signals and obstruct visual signals.

AB Vocalizations constitute an important channel of communication for many vertebrates. Classes of vocalizations may be closely associated with particular contexts or behaviours, and variation within classes may convey information on individual identity, sex or motivational state. Rodent vocal communication has largely been studied within a reproductive context, but rodents also utter vocalizations during aggressive encounters with same-sex conspecifics. In this work we investigated same-sex vocal behaviour of Siberian hamsters, a mammalian model species for studying aggression. Males and females produced two main classes of vocalizations: high-frequency (>20 kHz), narrowband vocalizations (ultrasonic vocalizations; USVs) and lower-frequency, broadband vocalizations (broadband calls; BBCs). USVs and BBCs were further classified into subtypes based on spectrotemporal characteristics. With these classifications, we made the predictions that hamsters would utter distinct subcategories of calls, that there would be sex differences in call usage, and that BBCs would be more closely associated with aggressive behaviours than USVs. While there were no sex differences in the total number of USVs or BBCs produced by a pair, the use of vocalization subcategories varied by sex, with females uttering more variable USVs and more 'rattle' BBCs than males. In conjunction with these differences in vocal behaviour, the sexes also differed in aggression. Across both sexes, variation in aggressive behaviour correlated with variation in the number of 'squeak' BBCs and 'rattle' BBCs, whereas USVs were not related to aggression. Thus, BBCs constitute a distinct vocalization type with an important role in aggressive communication for hamsters. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Choosing the right mate can be critical to fitness, particularly for females of species that mate only once. One key trait by which females choose mates is male age. However, while some theories predict that females should prefer older males, others predict exactly the opposite. The evidence is also mixed, with females preferring older males in some species, and younger in others. Here we examined female preference for male age in a monandrous species, the fruit fly Drosophila subobscura. We found consistent preference for older males in four populations, from the U.K., Greece, Spain and Tunisia. Preference for older males was weaker in trials in which two males were presented to a female than in single-male trials. This preference for older males is probably driven by direct benefits: females that mated with older males produced more offspring. As this species is monandrous, it is very likely that this increase in offspring production is a genuine male-derived benefit, rather than females laying more eggs after mating with a preferred male. Previous work suggests that male-male interactions prior to mating can have a major impact on mating behaviour and success in males of this species and other Drosophila. We found varying effects of prior exposure to rival males, but in general younger males suffered more when exposed to a rival than older males. This study suggests that age-based preference by females can be consistent across populations with very different environments, even when those populations differ in other key mating-related traits such as offspring production and copulation duration.

AB Animals often engage in contests that have the potential to result in substantial costs in time, energy and risk of injury. To reduce the costs of contests, animals are expected to assess the resource-holding potential of their rivals and compare it to their own as a means of economically determining a winner ('mutual assessment'). If information about the rival is difficult or costly to obtain, rivals may instead reduce the costs of fighting by withdrawing when an individual cost threshold is reached ('self-assessment'). Here we investigated the assessment strategies used by Servaea incana jumping spiders to resolve male-male contests. To examine the effects of body size on contest outcome and strategy, contests were staged between size-unmatched and size-matched pairs. Contests escalated through distinct stages that were of increasing intensity, and body size was a strong predictor of contest outcome. To gain insight into assessment strategy, we considered duration and escalation as measures of cost accrual. Overall, the relations of body size to contest duration and escalation suggest that the decision of whether to retreat during the early noncontact contest phase is largely determined by size-associated internal cost thresholds. Body size was not related to either duration or escalation in the contact phase of contests. We highlight the need to consider appropriateness of proxies used for contest costs and whether game-theoretical predictions for whole contests apply to stages within a contest.

AB Sexual conflict theory predicts a trade-off in individual parental care allocated to either current or future reproduction. The optimal amount of current parental effort is expected to differ between adult males and females, with a conflict resolution being reached by negotiation depending on multiple family cues. Currently, a debate exists on how negotiation takes place, along with its potential costs or benefits for all family members. In particular, the specific negotiation rules that male and female parents apply often remain obscure, which in part results from a shortage of empirical studies. We used captive canaries, Serinus canaria, to evaluate consequences of sexual conflict for the offspring by comparing uniparental (female cared for a half clutch) and biparental (both parents cared for a full clutch) families. Our results suggest overall less parental effort in biparental families and offspring were observed to beg harder for parental resources, weigh less as fledglings and tended to grow slower compared to uniparental families. To further increase our understanding of parental negotiation rules, we manipulated the degree of partner visibility and thus information about partner effort by temporarily splitting biparental families. Male and female provisioning strategies depended on both partner visibility and brood demand. An increase in male provisioning was observed after mate removal, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in females. Females, however, increased provisioning in response to offspring begging. We conclude that (1) sexual conflict over parental care is costly for the offspring, (2) sex-specific negotiation rules exist and probably relate to an asymmetry in gathered information and (3) changes in parental feeding strategies trigger a feedback mechanism via brood demand, highlighting the need to consider all family members in order to understand family conflicts and their potential resolution.

AB A crucial issue for understanding the evolution, functions and mechanisms of complex communicative signals such as birdsong is to disentangle signal structures that serve to convey information in different contexts. The two main singing contexts of European male songbirds are the attraction of a female and the defence of a territory from other males. The method of choice to experimentally investigate the use of song in male-male interactions is to conduct playback studies, in which song is played to a resident male. Responses to the presence of a female, however, are hardly testable this way, since females of most European bird species do not sing. However, females do call in several situations. In a playback experiment, we investigated whether free-ranging male nightingales change their nocturnal singing in response to playbacks consisting of calls produced by either female or male conspecifics. In both cases, nightingales changed their singing style as compared to their singing before playback, and these changes were different in response to male and female calls. Males sang fewer whistle songs after male call playbacks and started to produce 'initial whistles' earlier when hearing female calls. Male call playbacks also led to an increase in song duration. An analysis of the call characteristics of both sexes used in the playbacks uncovered acoustic parameters that may account for the differentiated response. We conclude that male nightingales distinguish between female and male calls, and discuss the song characteristics that might be used to specifically address either males or females. Call playbacks proved to be useful for disentangling song characteristics that serve the multiple functions of birdsong. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID SIGNAL; EVOLUTION; CHOICE; INSECTS
AB Studies of sexual communication typically focus on the design and information content of a signal of interest, but the timing of signal production relative to nearby competitors can be crucial. Male fiddler crabs, Uca mjoebergi, court females with a stereotyped claw-waving display, and males are often observed waving in synchrony with nearby claw-waving males. Using female mate preference experiments with robots that imitate male claw waves, we found evidence that females are more attracted to males whose waves immediately precede a synchronous group of waves (leaders); females also favoured males that waved in opposite phase to a synchronous group (alternators). By contrast, males whose waves lagged behind a group of synchronous wavers (laggards) were no more attractive. We discuss a simple sensory process that could explain how this female preference arises. Our results agree with past findings suggesting that synchrony in fiddler crabs occurs as an epiphenomenon of adaptive male responses to female preferences.

AB Vocalizing by males plays an important role in the reproductive activities of many species. Geographical variation in the characteristics of male vocalization is well studied in birds, but largely unexplored in mammals. This study quantified the extent of geographical variation in male Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea, barking calls and examined what drives vocal differences in this species. We recorded male barking calls from seven breeding colonies separated by ca. 5-2700 km enabling us to investigate acoustic differences on both micro- and macrogeographical scales. Our results revealed significant nonuniform geographical variation across colonies. Neither genetic nor geographical distances between colonies fully explained the observed acoustic variation. We suggest that environmental or morphological factors are likely to further contribute to differences in vocal characteristics. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Interspecific competition is an important ecological mechanism shaping the traits of the interacting species and structuring their communities. Less competitive species benefit from evading direct encounters with aggressive dominants, whereas dominant species could use cues left by subordinates to steal their resources or to chase them off. Here, we studied competitive interactions among five common and syntopic ant species in Central Europe (Formica polyctena, Formica rufibarbis, Lasius niger, Myrmica rubra and Tetramorium caespitum) and investigated their ability to react to heterospecific chemical cues. Using aggression assays, we established a clear dominance hierarchy of these species, with L. niger and F. polyctena as the most dominant species. Using Y-mazes, we then tested whether ants avoid or prefer areas with cues of either dominant or subordinate species. These cues included trail pheromones, cuticular hydrocarbons and chemical footprints. Ants of all species ignored heterospecific trail pheromone extracts, but two of the three subordinate species avoided cuticular hydrocarbons of the dominant species. In contrast, dominants either ignored or were attracted to cuticular hydrocarbon extracts of subordinates. The avoidance behaviour of the subordinates might be quantity-dependent, as footprints of the dominant species L. niger attracted two subordinates. The lowest ranking species M. rubra was unresponsive to cues of heterospecifics but avoided following the traces of their own colony members. Our study shows that ants exploit heterospecific cues either to avoid or to seek competitors and that their reaction depends on their dominance rank in the local community.

AB Conflicts may arise within a moving animal group if its members have different preferred destinations. Many theoretical models suggest that in maintaining group cohesion conflicting preferences can have an overwhelming influence on decision making. However, empirical studies, especially on wild animals, remain limited. Here, we introduce a new study system for investigating collective decision making: king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus. Their gregarious lifestyle, the colony's organization into subgroups and group travel make king penguins especially interesting for studying collective movements. Chicks spend their first year of life in groups with other chicks (creches), and if displaced will return to their creche. We examined how different levels of navigational conflict affect such homing, by comparing the performance of pairs of chicks from the same creche with pairs from different creches. The majority of chicks in both treatments travelled at least part of the journey together; when doing so they were more efficient and faster than individuals travelling alone. Chicks took turns in leading and following. Chicks with a common destination (same-creche pairs) were more precise at homing and less likely to split up than those with a conflict over preferred destinations (different-creche pairs). Our results support some, but not all, predictions derived from theoretical models. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It may seem as if behaviour is so plastic that it would not foster the establishment of a genetically determined trait, but under some circumstances, it can greatly influence whether a novel trait, such as a new morphology, spreads in a population. If the behaviours associated with the trait's function already exist, a new variant finds a ready foothold, and selection can act accordingly. Behaviours that are particularly likely to foster novel traits include those that play a role in life history, such as antipredator behaviour, sexual signalling and foraging. Examples of behaviour facilitating novel trait establishment include the spread of a silent mutant in male Pacific field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, and the propensity of juvenile fence lizards to show antipredator behaviours towards attacking fire ants, providing a selective opportunity for the evolution of longer limbs. The genetic or physiological mechanisms behind a behaviour can also influence its establishment; for example, learning may generate selection in favour of conspicuous novel traits faster, and for a wider range of traits, than genetically based sensory biases. Just as changes in behavioural traits over evolutionary time may expose populations of individuals to new adaptive zones, behavioural variation within a population may increase the diversity of environments to which individuals are exposed.

AB Extrapair (EP) paternity has the potential to enhance the reproductive success of males in socially monogamous systems, but increased success is not a given if seeking extrapair copulations is costly, causing males to lose paternity or experience reduced success of their own nests. Here we used 6 years of paternity data from a long-term study of western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, to investigate the potential for reproductive consequences of EP paternity. We predicted that if females control paternity, and males gaining EP paternity are also attractive to their social mates and can thwart competition for fertilizations in their own nests, overall reproductive success should be increased compared to non-EP sires. In support of this prediction, we found that successful EP males sired almost twice as many young as males not gaining EP paternity; in addition to EP young, they had more within-pair (WP) young in their own nests, more successful nests and more fledglings per successful nest. Furthermore, through an analysis of the components of annual fitness, we found that variation in mate number contributed substantially to variation in total reproductive success. Together these data indicate that in western bluebirds, males gaining EP paternity are extremely successful and do not gain EP paternity at the expense of WP paternity. Finally, because successful EP sires were significantly older than males who were unsuccessful at acquiring EP paternity, this study also suggests that selection for longevity may be strong in this population.

AB Animal personalities can play an important role in how individuals deal with specific social situations, which may have important fitness consequences. A link between personality and social skills seems obvious from a human perspective and it is therefore surprising that relatively few studies have looked at the effect of animal personality on communicative interactions. In this study we tested the evidence for personality-related variation in birds during vocal interactions in the field. We scored individual variation in exploratory behaviour of great tits, Parus major, in repeated trials of a novel environment test in the laboratory and related this score to approach and vocal behaviour in response to playback of conspecific songs in the field. Contrary to our expectation, we found males with low exploration scores approached the speaker more closely than birds with high exploration scores. Birds with high exploration scores seemed to respond less aggressively while dealing with the simulated intruder vocally by switching song types more often. Our results suggest that slow-exploring birds in the laboratory respond more strongly during natural interactions in the field. An independent and very similar study also revealed a correlation between personality score and playback response, but with a seemingly contrasting outcome. A comparison of the two studies provides insights into the complexity of interpreting playback results and territorial response patterns in general.

AB For a signalling system to be stable, signals must confer net fitness benefits to senders and receivers, which means that some aspect of their design must correlate with a quality that receivers benefit from knowing about. However, examples abound where this correlation is complicated by phenomena commonly referred to as deception and/or signal unreliability. We argue here that unreliability and deception are notions marred with conceptual ambiguities, often used as equivalent or as catch-all terms for qualitatively different processes. Signal unreliability refers to a pattern of design-information dissociation that can arise through different processes, some deceptive and some not, with different evolutionary implications. First, nondeceptive processes that are independent of sender-receiver conflict need to be explicitly recognized if we are not to overestimate the importance of deception as a driver of signal unreliability. Second, deceptive unreliability ( fuelled by sender-receiver conflict) occurs through two qualitatively different processes with potentially different consequences for signal design. 'Incomplete honesty' is inherent to most communication systems and reflects the underlying conflict between senders and receivers that share some common ground of interests. On the other hand, categorical deception by signal parasitism evolves between senders and receivers that share no common interests, as a form of deceptive signalling that is purely contingent on the presence of already existing signals. We contend that adopting a theoretical framework explicitly based on the evolutionary scenarios leading to signal unreliability has advantages over traditional schemes focusing exclusively on whether signals benefit receivers or not.

AB Acoustic signal variation and female preference for different signal components constitute the prerequisite framework to study the mechanisms of sexual selection that shape acoustic communication. Despite several studies of acoustic communication in crickets, information on both male calling song variation in the field and female preference in the same system is lacking for most species. Previous studies on acoustic signal variation either were carried out on populations maintained in the laboratory or did not investigate signal repeatability. We therefore used repeatability analysis to quantify variation in the spectral, temporal and amplitudinal characteristics of the male calling song of the field cricket Plebeiogryllus guttiventris in a wild population, at two temporal scales, within and across nights. Carrier frequency (CF) was the most repeatable character across nights, whereas chirp period (CP) had low repeatability across nights. We investigated whether female preferences were more likely to be based on features with high (CF) or low (CP) repeatability. Females showed no consistent preferences for CF but were significantly more attracted towards signals with short CPs. The attractiveness of lower CP calls disappeared, however, when traded off with sound pressure level (SPL). SPL was the only acoustic feature that was significantly positively correlated with male body size. Since relative SPL affects female phonotaxis strongly and can vary unpredictably based on male spacing, our results suggest that even strong female preferences for acoustic features may not necessarily translate into greater advantage for males possessing these features in the field.

AB There is a common prevailing perception that humans possess a species-unique population-level right-hand bias that has evolutionary links with language. New theories suggest that an early evolutionary division of cognitive function gave rise to a left-hemisphere bias for behaviours underpinned by structured sequences of actions. However, studies of great ape handedness have generated inconsistent results and considerable debate. Additionally, the literature places a heavy focus on chimpanzees, revealing a paucity of handedness findings from other great ape species, and thus limiting the empirical evidence with which we can evaluate evolutionary theory. We observed handedness during spontaneous naturalistic bimanual actions in a captive, biological group of 13 western lowland gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla. Our results demonstrated a significant group-level right-handed bias for bimanual actions as well as for a novel measure of handedness: hand transfer. The two measures revealed similar patterns of handedness, such that a right-hand bias for the majority of individuals was found across both measures. Our findings suggest that human population-level right-handedness is a behavioural trait linked with left-hemisphere dominance for the processing of structured sequences of actions, and was inherited by a common ancestor of both humans and apes.

AB Behavioural ecology is rife with examples of the way in which prey animals make decisions to alter when, where and how they forage or reproduce in response to variation in predation risk. Given that animals cannot have perfectly accurate information regarding the relative costs and benefits of each decision made, the process of decision making is fraught with uncertainty, particularly given that different sources of information will have different levels of risk associated with them. The consequence of ignoring accurate predator information is potentially death; therefore animals should have evolved the ability to incorporate multiple sources of information, extract important components from each source and respond accordingly. In this study, the anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, responded with antipredator behaviour to damage-released chemical cues from conspecifics and congenerics. However, the visual cues provided by the presence or absence of conspecifics and congenerics dramatically influenced the way in which individuals responded to chemical indicators of risk. Our results suggest that anemonefish have a complex decision-making process that incorporates multiple sources of information each with different degrees of uncertainty.

AB An essential challenge in invasion ecology is discerning the role that behavioural adaptations play in competition among species. When evaluating the impacts of invasive species, the mechanisms underlying coexistence among organisms and the displacement of organisms within a community mosaic are often ignored, yet these interactions are necessary for fully understanding these impacts. Here, we examine behavioural mechanisms underlying the coexistence and subsequent displacement of an established global invader, the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile Mayr, by the newly invasive Asian needle ant, Pachycondyla chinensis Emery. In individual and group assays, we show that the numerically and behaviourally dominant Argentine ant is less aggressive towards P. chinensis workers from adjacent versus distant nests. Moreover, we show that P. chinensis displays submissive behaviour through recurrent contact with L. humile, which may contribute to the reported displacement of L. humile in the field. Understanding the factors that drive the coexistence of these two ants may help explain how small populations of a behaviourally submissive exotic species become established.

DE contextual learning; corncrake; Crex crex; rail; song learning; syntax
ID VOCAL REPERTOIRE; SONG; VOCALIZATIONS; NIGHTINGALES; USAGE; SIZE
AB For many animals, the repertoires of songs or calls are relatively small and static during a lifetime. One reason for this is that there are different physiological limitations in the respiratory, phonatory and filter systems in different phylogenetic groups. Nevertheless, learning does not have to be associated exclusively with the acquisition of new vocalizations; individuals may recombine a limited number of elements already present in an individual's repertoire into new sequences. I tested the possibility of learning timing of calls in the corncrake, Crex crex, a nonpasserine bird with an extremely low repertoire of calls, using temporal patterns of calls during territorial interactions. I tested whether male are able to comprehend and use a new pattern by connecting known syntax with a new meaning through experience. Experiments with playback demonstrated that males were able to comprehend a new association between the temporal pattern and approaching behaviour of the intruder only after a few minutes of exposure to new circumstances. Additionally, apart from comprehending, males acquired a new signalling strategy; they began signalling their aggressive motivation using the new association. Because comprehension and usage of associations between the syntax of vocalizations and the approaching behaviour of males were modifiable as a result of experience, these results indicate that corncrakes' innate call structures and lack of complex and variable songs allow them to learn the temporal distribution of their calls. This suggests a much broader application and a vital role of contextual learning for the evolution of simple acoustic signalling systems. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB It is 35 years since Premack & Woodruff famously asked, 'Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?' (1978, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 1, 515-526). The first wave of experiments designed to tackle this provocative question in the context of cooperative transactions with humans offered largely negative answers. It was not until a landmark Animal Behaviour paper by Hare et al. (2000, Animal Behaviour, 59, 771-786) that a different approach based around foraging competition between conspecifics delivered an affirmative (if limited) verdict that, at least, 'Chimpanzees know what conspecifics do and do not see'. This influential paper laid the foundations for a much more productive decade of studies that provided evidence for apes' recognition in others of states corresponding to knowing, intending and inferring. It further stimulated related studies in other mammalian and avian species too. Here I set the Hare et al. paper in its historical, scientific context, provide an overview of the variety of studies that have followed in its wake and address some core questions about the scientific tractability of identifying phenomena in nonverbal creatures that may be akin to human 'theory of mind'.

AB Host plant choice in polyphagous insects can be connected with costs of being naive when confronted with several potential host plants, for example through slower decision making. Utilization of earlier experience could be one way to overcome some of these limitations. We studied whether larval feeding experience influences mate finding by males and female choice of oviposition site in the moth Spodoptera littoralis. Larvae were reared on either artificial diet or the host plants, cotton, clover or alfalfa, and we recorded the behaviour of adults from each diet. In two sets of experiments, in both the laboratory and the field, we investigated the female's oviposition choice and the male's response to female pheromone with different plant odour backgrounds. We found that experience with cotton, clover or alfalfa during the larval period induced female oviposition on the corresponding plant both in the laboratory and in the field. Furthermore, males were more attracted to female sex pheromone combined with odour from a host plant species that they had experienced as larvae than to sex pheromone combined with odour from host plant species they had not experienced. The results show convergent modulation of male and female responses to plant odour depending on their larval food plant. The influence of larval experience during the first-to-fifth instars on host preference was also stronger than the influence of experience acquired in the late larval, pupal and early adult stages. Consequences for host plant choice efficiency and fitness effects for males and females are discussed. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vectors of aggregation are well known for some arthropod species, but not for many others. We aimed to describe larval aggregation (experiment 1) in the carrion fly, Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae), and to investigate the effect of food and conspecifics on larval behaviour (experiment 2). In experiment 1, 40 larvae were placed in a petri dish with a homogeneous diet for 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 5 h or 24 h. This experiment demonstrated for the first time under controlled conditions the active aggregation of L. sericata larvae. The results indicate that the aggregation took place quickly and was reinforced with time. After only 3 h, one main aggregate comprising a majority of individuals was observed. These results also highlight the likely use by necrophagous larvae of a signal left by conspecifics as an aggregation vector. In experiment 2, we used a video-tracking system to investigate whether such an aggregative signal exists. Fed and starved larvae were tracked for 5 min in a circular area with each half marked with a different signal combination. The time spent in the signal zones, the distance travelled, the velocity, the time at the stop and the number of stops in each zone were measured. The larvae were significantly retained by a signal (mark) left by conspecifics. Together, the results of this study demonstrate the existence of a contact and/or odour-mediated signal involved in the aggregative behaviour of necrophagous larvae.

AB In decision making, speed-accuracy trade-offs are well known and often inevitable because accuracy depends on being well informed and gathering information takes time. However, trade-offs between speed and cohesion, that is the degree to which a group remains together as a single entity, as a result of their decision making, have been comparatively neglected. We combine theory and experimentation to show that in decision-making systems, speed-cohesion trade-offs are a natural complement to speed-accuracy trade-offs and are therefore of general importance. We then analyse the decision performance of 32 rock ant, Temnothorax albipennis, colonies in experiments in which accuracy of collective decision making was held constant, but time urgency varied. These experiments reveal for the first time an adaptive speed-cohesion trade-off in collective decision making and how this is achieved. In accord with different time constraints, colonies can decide quickly, at the cost of social unity, or they can decide slowly with much greater cohesion. We discuss the similarity between cohesion and the term precision as used in statistics and engineering. This emphasizes the generality of speed versus cohesion/precision trade-offs in decision making and decision implementation in other fields within animal behaviour such as sexually selected motor displays and even certain aspects of birdsong. We also suggest that speed versus precision trade-offs may occur when individuals within a group need to synchronize their activity, and in collective navigation, cooperative hunting and in certain escape behaviours.

AB Empirical studies of the reliability of sexual signals are needed to test the prediction that females should prefer males in good condition. We examined whether an attractive sexual signal used by male fiddler crabs, Uca beebei, reliably indicates male condition by measuring male blood glucose and lactate levels in the field. The signal is a mud structure, a 'pillar', that attracts females for mating. Blood lactate levels (a measure of energy expenditure) of pillar builders (P males) immediately after they built their pillars did not differ from those of nonbuilders (NP males), suggesting that the cost of building a pillar is small. However, P male lactate levels were significantly higher than those of NP males late in the activity cycle after P males had invested more in vigorous courtship using claw 'waving'. Whereas P males maintained their glucose levels (a measure of energy availability as the major fuel for ATP production) at around 30 mg/dl throughout their daily activity period, NP males showed significantly lower levels in the middle of the period. These results confirm that pillars reliably signal a male's condition, as measured by his ability to maintain a blood glucose level necessary for costly courtship, even though the construction of a pillar has minimal energetic cost.

AB Studying the causes and reproductive consequences of social variation can provide insight into the evolutionary basis of sociality. Individuals are expected to behave adaptively to maximize reproductive success, but reproductive outcomes can also depend on group structure. Degus (Octodon degus) are plurally breeding rodents, in which females allonurse indiscriminately. However, communal rearing does not appear to enhance female reproductive success, and larger group sizes are correlated with decreasing per capita pup production. To further investigate mechanisms underlying these patterns, we asked how differences in sex, season and average group reproductive success are related to degu association networks. We hypothesized that if reproductive differences mirror social relationships, then females (core group members) should show stronger and more stable associations than males, and female association strength should be strongest during lactation. We also hypothesized that, at the group level, social cohesion would increase reproductive output, while social conflict would decrease it. Females did have higher association strength and more preferred partners than males, but only during lactation, when overall female associations increased. Females also had more stable preferred social partnerships between seasons. A measure of social cohesion (average association strength) was not related to per capita pup production of female group members, but potential social conflict (heterogeneity of association strengths) was negatively related to per capita pup production of female group members. Our results highlight temporal and multilevel patterns of social structure that may reflect reproductive costs and benefits to females. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural traits are characterized by their labile expression: behavioural responses can, in principle, be up- and down-regulated in response to moment-to-moment changes in environmental conditions. Evidence is accumulating that individuals from the same population differ in the degree and extent of this form of phenotypic plasticity. We here discuss how such between-individual differences in behavioural plasticity can result from additive and interactive effects of genetic make-up and past environmental conditions, and under which conditions natural selection might favour this form of between-individual variation. We highlight how spatial or temporal variation in the environment, in combination with competition among individuals, can promote adaptive individual differences in plasticity; and we detail how differences in plasticity can emerge as a result of selection pressures induced by social interactions or as a response to between-individual differences in state. We further discuss both ecological and evolutionary consequences of individual differences in plasticity. We outline, for example, how individual differences in plasticity can have knock-on effects on the rate of evolution; and how such differences can enhance the stability and persistence of populations.

ID COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR; LEADERSHIP
AB Flocks of birds in flight represent a striking example of collective behaviour. Models of self-organization suggest that repeated interactions among individuals following simple rules can generate the complex patterns and coordinated movements exhibited by flocks. However, such models often assume that individuals are identical and interchangeable, and fail to account for individual differences and social relationships among group members. Here, we show that heterogeneity resulting from species differences and social structure can affect flock spatial dynamics. Using high-resolution photographs of mixed flocks of jackdaws, Corvus monedula, and rooks, Corvus frugilegus, we show that birds preferentially associated with conspecifics and that, like high-ranking members of single-species groups, the larger and more socially dominant rooks positioned themselves near the leading edge of flocks. Neighbouring birds showed closer directional alignment if they were of the same species, and neighbouring jackdaws in particular flew very close to one another. Moreover, birds of both species often flew especially close to a single same-species neighbour, probably reflecting the monogamous pair bonds that characterize these corvid social systems.

AB With their landmark publication 'Cuckoos versus reed warblers: adaptations and counteradaptations' (Animal Behaviour, 1988, 36, 262-284), Davies & Brooke ushered in a new era of research on avian brood parasitism. Building on centuries of rich natural history and detailed observation of common cuckoos, Cuculus canorus, Davies & Brooke (1988) performed a set of simple but powerful experiments to understand the adaptive value of a female cuckoo's behaviour as she parasitizes a host nest. In this essay, we explore the historical backdrop against which Davies & Brooke began their field experiments in Wicken Fen. We then evaluate four conceptual innovations made by Davies & Brooke (1988) involving rejection costs, egg mimicry, frontline defences and chick discrimination, and we show how these advances have shaped research in the last 25 years. Davies & Brooke (1988) paved the way for diverse and dynamic research on avian brood parasites, and we conclude by highlighting several promising new directions for the future, namely the genomics of adaptation, sensory ecology and cognition.

AB Site fidelity and migratory movements of vertebrate animals occur at many spatial and temporal scales. Larger migratory movements tend to occur in species that live in seasonal environments in which food supplies vary markedly, while species found in thermally stable environments are more site-attached. In the marine environment, seasonal migrations are often associated with predictable temporary aggregations that have largely been targeted for exploitation. We employed passive acoustic telemetry to investigate inter- and intraseasonal site fidelity of zebra sharks to an aggregation site in southeast Queensland, Australia, close to the southern latitudinal extent of this species' range. We tracked 10 zebra sharks over two aggregation seasons (21 months). We applied a generalized linear mixed-effects model to investigate the presence/absence of these zebra sharks with respect to several environmental variables. We found that different environmental factors were associated with site fidelity of zebra sharks at different temporal levels and that these may be indicative of the mechanisms driving the movements. Seasonal patterns may be driven by endogenous systems, and cues such as photoperiod and water temperature are likely to be important. Intraseasonal patterns are more likely to be indicative of direct behavioural responses to changes in environmental conditions such as increased wave heights, as well as foraging bouts away from a core refuge. Understanding the relative contributions of these environmental parameters, as well as biological factors, will be important for making predictions of site fidelity and movements of migratory marine vertebrates under differing future scenarios such as increases in sea temperature.

AB Complex social life has been characterized as cognitively challenging and recently, social relationships such as long-term social bonds and alliances have been identified as key elements for brain evolution. Whereas good evidence is available to support the link between social relations and cognition in mammals, it remains unsatisfying for birds. Here we investigated the role of avian social bonds in a nonbreeder aggregation of ravens, Corvus corax, in the Austrian Alps. We individually marked 138 wild ravens, representing approximately half of a population that uses the area of a local zoo for foraging. For 2 years, we observed the dynamics of group composition and the birds' agonistic and affiliative interactions. We identified two levels of organization: the formation of an unrelated local group and the individuals' engagement in social bonds of different length and reciprocity pattern. Whereas belonging to the local group had no significant effect on conflicts won during foraging, the individual bonding type did. Birds that engaged in affiliative relationships were more successful when competing for food than those without such bonds. Bonded birds did suffer from aggression by other bonded birds and, probably as a consequence, most of the ravens' social relations were not stable over time. These results support the idea that social bonding and selective cooperation and competition are prominent features in nonbreeding ravens. Proximately, bonding may qualify as a social manoeuvre that facilitates access to resources; ultimately it might function to assess the quality of a partner in these long-term monogamous birds.

AB Differences in play behaviour often illuminate complex ecological parameters and social differences. In primate societies, including humans, individuals acquire information through play. It is adults in every community that are most committed to managing social practices. In tolerant species, adults often participate in play to reinforce social networks and cooperation. The 20 macaque species are all organized in multimale, multifemale groups but vary along a continuum from despotic/intolerant to egalitarian/tolerant social systems. These different social styles influence a wide range of behaviours including aggression and affiliation patterns, dominance relationships, and nepotism. We tested some hypotheses by comparing play patterns in two macaque societies at opposite ends of the continuum: despotic Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, and tolerant Tonkean macaques, Macaca tonkeana. Our results show that these two species have striking differences in the distribution of social play according to the age and sex of the players. Our findings strongly indicate that play, a highly plastic and versatile behaviour, is sensitive to the quality of interindividual relationships of a species, thus reflecting the nature of its social network. The different patterns of macaque play show striking parallels with those from comparisons of different human cultures including the distribution of social play according to the age and gender, partner preference according to age, and permissiveness of mothers. The adult play propensity of Tonkean compared to Japanese macaques indicates that adult-adult play is a good predictor for the polarity of changes in aggressiveness between different groups separated either genetically (taxa) or culturally (ethnies).

AB An apparently vertically, socially transmitted foraging specialization ('sponging') in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) is observed in two adjacent gulfs within Shark Bay, Western Australia, where sponging has possibly spread from independent innovations. We designed an individual-based model based on empirical data, to investigate the conditions (of learning fidelity and fitness benefits for spongers) under which sponging could be established and maintained. Simulations show that sponging is unlikely to be established from a single innovation event but the probability increases with independent innovation events. Once established, however, it can be maintained in the absence of fitness benefits for spongers, if learning fidelity of daughters is virtually 100%. Smaller learning fidelities can be compensated for with fitness benefits for spongers, but these benefits must be 5% and 10%, respectively, to compensate for learning fidelities of 96.25% and 92%. Furthermore, we estimated the time since the emergence of sponging by tracking the average pairwise relatedness among spongers over time and comparing it to empirical estimates. For the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, we show that sponging might have been in place for at least 120 years if it originated from a single innovation event. For comparison of vertical, social transmission to other trait acquisition methods, we ran simulations in which sponging was either a genetic trait or acquired solely by innovation. In these simulations, sponging could be maintained but the simulation results and empirical data did not match. Hence vertical social transmission is a more feasible mechanism to explain the spread of sponging. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ageing is known to induce profound effects on physiological functions but only a few studies have focused on its behavioural alterations. Orb-webs of spiders, however, provide an easily analysable structure, the result of complex sequences of stereotypical behaviours that are particularly relevant to the study of ageing processes. We chose the orb spider Zygiella x-notata as an invertebrate organism to investigate alterations in web geometry caused by ageing. Parameters taken into account to compare webs built by spiders at different ages were: the length of the capture spiral (CTL), the number of anomalies per cm, and four parameters of web regularity (the angle between radii, the number of spiral thread units connecting two successive radii, the parallelism and the coefficient of variation of the distances between silk threads of two adjacent spiral turns). All web parameters were related to ageing. Two groups of spiders emerged: short-and long-lived spiders (with a higher body mass), with an average life span of 150 and 236 days, respectively. In both short-and long-lived spiders' webs, the CTL and the silk thread parallelism decreased, while the variation of the distances between silk threads increased. However, the number of anomalies per cm and the angle between radii increased in short-lived spiders only. These modifications can be explained by ageing alterations in silk investment and cognitive and/or locomotor functions. Orb-web spiders would therefore provide a unique invertebrate model to study ageing and its processes in the alterations of behavioural and cognitive functions.

AB During foraging, animals have to balance the risk of predation with the energy gain. The amount of risk animals take for a given resource depends on their energy budget but is expected also to vary between individuals of different personality types. We tested whether individuals of free-ranging grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus, forage risk-sensitively and are consistent in their risk-taking behaviour. Furthermore, we tested whether boldness towards a novel object predicts risk taking in a foraging task. In a field experiment, we simulated low and high predation risk at artificial feeding sites. During focal platform observations, we quantified behaviours related to exploration and feeding for 36 individuals. Furthermore, we used a novel object test to quantify variation in boldness for 22 of these individuals. As predicted, grey mouse lemurs foraged risk-sensitively indicated by longer latencies to enter a feeding platform and to start feeding as well as by relatively longer feeding time compared to nonfeeding in high-risk situations. Individual differences in risk taking were repeatable and repeatability increased with increasing risk. Individual plasticity was higher for low-risk individuals providing field evidence for coping styles. There was no relationship between individual body condition and risk-taking behaviour. Finally, boldness measured in a novel object test was correlated with risk taking in a foraging task, providing a rare ecological validation for this personality trait. These results suggest that intrinsic individual differences in boldness need to be considered as an important source of variation when testing predictions of risk-sensitive foraging using optimality approaches.

AB To determine the extent and geographical distribution of alternative social systems in the desert ant Messor pergandei, we conducted a large-scale study within the species' range in the United States. We found that that queen social behaviours are extraordinarily diverse, resulting in three distinct colony social systems distributed in different geographical regions. Experiments show that these differences arise from variation in queen behaviours at two distinct times in the colony life cycle, and are likely to result from underlying genetic differences between regions. Results from our population genetics analyses and the biogeography of the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts suggest that the different queen social behaviours may have evolved in previously isolated populations, with their current distributions explained in part by subsequent range expansions rather than local adaptation in situ. However, regions with alternative social forms currently meet in contact zones where gene flow and natural selection on alternative social systems should occur. The degree of geographical variation in social behaviours exhibited by M. pergandei results in an opportunity to study the role that gene flow, local adaptation, genetic drift and past history can play in the evolution of behaviour.

AB Intraspecific variability in the characteristics of fish schools is often affected by the size of individuals. In this study, juvenile and adult sardine schools detected in five hydroacoustic surveys (2004-2008) in the North Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) were analysed in an effort to identify differences in a suite of school descriptors (i.e. positional, energetic, morphometric) and define the size at which schooling behaviour changed from juvenile to adult. Juveniles exhibited discrete schooling characteristics and microhabitat preferences compared to adult fish. Specifically, schools of juvenile sardines were smaller, more elongated and irregular than those of adults, they backscattered less energy and were located higher in the water column. Based on the length frequency distributions of experimental pelagic trawl catches, the length at which 50% of sardines shifted behaviour from juvenile school structure to the more typical adult school form was estimated at 10.7 cm. This length almost coincides with several ontogenetic changes in biology (i.e. first maturity, allometric change in the length-weight relationship and onset of phytoplankton consumption). Several size-dependent school features observed in this study are partly attributed to the higher feeding demands of juvenile fish and the need to avoid intraspecific competition and predation.

AB In birds, species identity is one of the most important messages conveyed by vocalizations and is the basis for effective acoustic communication between conspecifics. Acoustic analyses can reveal which acoustic cues signal species identity, that is, the cues that could potentially be used by birds for species recognition, whereas playback experiments aim to determine which cues birds actually use for species recognition. Few studies have compared the acoustic cues used for species-specific recognition between closely related species and between sexes within species. We focused on three shearwater species (Puffinus yelkouan, Puffinus mauretanicus, Calonectris d. diomedea) breeding in the Mediterranean basin. In a previous study we showed that males and females of these three closely related species produce broadband calls strongly modulated in frequency and share a wide range of acoustic features signalling species identity. Here, we investigated whether these birds use similar acoustic cues for species recognition. Playback experiments showed that these cues were more similar between species of the genus Puffinus that rely mainly on frequency modulation than between Puffinus and Calonectris species, the latter using mainly frequency spectrum-related cues. In spite of similarities between the Puffinus species, we found substantial differences, P. mauretanicus being more sensitive to frequency value modification than P. yelkouan. We also found that females of the three species rely on more acoustic parameters to identify species than males. Our results show that the species-specific recognition system can show significant differences between closely related species and between sexes.

AB An individual's ability to identify and respond accurately to a predator greatly affects its probability of survival. Chemosensory cues are an important mechanism for predator detection in aquatic environments. Whether fish are aware of the risks posed by distinct fish species, or whether a common chemosensory cue distinguishes predatory fishes, is unknown. One possibility is that fish distinguish predatory fishes based on their diet. To test this, we manipulated the diet of three nominally non-piscivorous species and examined behavioural responses of juvenile anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, to chemical cues of nonpredators fed a diet rich in fish product. In pairwise choice trials, naive A. percula showed indifference to chemosensory cues from nonpiscivorous fishes fed their usual diet, but significantly avoided chemical cues from piscivorous and nonpiscivorous fishes fed a diet containing fish product. These results indicate that A. percula larvae innately distinguish between piscivorous and nonpiscivorous fishes based on chemosensory cues in the diet. To test for an effect of piscivorous diet in nature, we constructed patch reefs that emitted scents of dietary cues in natural concentrations. Patches that emitted scent of a piscivorous diet received on average 22% less settlement than control patches or than patches that emitted scent of an herbivore or invertivore. Chemosensory detection of recent prey provides a robust cue to assess predation risk associated with a diverse range of fishes (especially during settlement) and may be reinforced through additional sensory (e. g. visual) and learned recognition of individual species consistently associated with these distinctive chemosensory cues.

AB Behavioural innovations may have far-reaching evolutionary and ecological consequences, allowing individuals to obtain new resources and cope with environmental change. However, as innovations are rarely observed in nature, their emergence is poorly understood. What drives individuals to innovate, and what psychological mechanisms allow them to do so? We used three novel food extraction tasks to address these questions in groups of wild meerkats, Suricata suricatta. Innovatory tendencies were unrelated to body condition and foraging success, but were affected by age, rank and sex. Juvenile individuals were most likely to interact with tasks, but seldom solved them, perhaps owing to their small size or lack of dexterity. Instead, adult subordinates made up the bulk of the innovators. In cooperatively breeding societies, the inability of subordinate helpers to compete physically with dominant breeders may drive them to seek out solutions to novel problems. Most innovators were males, which, as the dispersing sex, may be particularly prone to solve novel problems, and innovators virtually always persisted longer than other group members when interacting with tasks. Most successful individuals solved tasks more than once, and learned to inhibit ineffective prepotent responses across successive presentations of the same task. They did not learn to manipulate functional parts of the apparatus more efficiently, however, nor did they extract general rules allowing them to solve novel tasks faster. Contrary to recent suggestions that innovation may be cognitively demanding, these results suggest that simple, conserved learning processes and dogged perseverance may suffice to generate solutions to novel problems.

AB To determine whether tool use varied in relation to food availability in bearded capuchin monkeys, we recorded anvil and stone hammer use in two sympatric wild groups, one of which was provisioned daily, and assessed climatic variables and availability of fruits, invertebrates and palm nuts. Capuchins used tools to crack open encased fruits, mostly palm nuts, throughout the year. Significant differences between wet and dry seasons were found in rainfall, abundance of invertebrates and palm nuts, but not in fruit abundance. Catule nuts were more abundant in the dry season. We tested the predictions of the necessity hypothesis (according to which tool use is maintained by sustenance needs during resource scarcity) and of the opportunity hypothesis (according to which tool use is maintained by repeated exposure to appropriate ecological conditions, such as preferred food resources necessitating the use of tools). Our findings support only the opportunity hypothesis. The rate of tool use was not affected by provisioning, and the monthly rate of tool use was not correlated with the availability of fruits and invertebrates. Conversely, all capuchins cracked food items other than palm nuts (e.g. cashew nuts) when available, and adult males cracked nuts more in the dry season when catule nuts (the most common and exploited nut) are especially abundant. Hence, in our field site capuchins use tools opportunistically. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although sexually selected ornaments are common across diverse taxa, little is known about mate choice and sexually selected ornamentation in social insects. Polistes dominulus paper wasps are a good system to study sexual selection, as males have a lek-based mating system as well as sexually dimorphic abdominal spots. Here, we demonstrate that the abdominal spots of male P. dominulus paper wasps function as signals in both inter-and intrasexual selection. Males with smaller, elliptically shaped spots were more dominant over male rivals and were more preferred by females than males with larger, irregularly shaped spots. Furthermore, experimental manipulation of male spots demonstrates that spot morphology acts as a signal. Males with experimentally reduced abdominal spots won a greater proportion of fights and were preferred by females as mates over control males. These results demonstrate that male ornaments are an important mediator of mating dynamics in P. dominulus paper wasps. They also highlight the importance of additional research examining sexually selected ornamentation in social insects. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Twenty years ago, a new conceptual paradigm known as 'receiver psychology' was introduced to explain the evolution of animal communication systems. This paradigm advanced the idea that psychological processes in the receiver's nervous system influence a signal's detectability, discriminability and memorability, and thereby serve as powerful sources of selection shaping signal design. While advancing our understanding of signal diversity, more recent studies make clear that receiver psychology, as a paradigm, has been structured too narrowly and does not incorporate many of the perceptual and cognitive processes of signal reception that operate between sensory transduction and a receiver's response. Consequently, the past two decades of research on receiver psychology have emphasized considerations of signal evolution but failed to ask key questions about the mechanisms of signal reception and their evolution. The primary aim of this essay is to advocate for a broader receiver psychology paradigm that more explicitly includes a research focus on receivers' psychological landscapes. We review recent experimental studies of hearing and sound communication to illustrate how considerations of several general perceptual and cognitive processes will facilitate future research on animal signalling systems. We also emphasize how a rigorous comparative approach to receiver psychology is critical to explicating the full range of perceptual and cognitive processes involved in receiving and responding to signals.

AB Pair bond duration and age are suggested to be important determinants for reproductive success in long-term monogamous pair bonding. These two effects are generally difficult to separate, however, and experimental approaches are scarce. We experimentally examined the role of the extended pair bond period, controlling for age and experience, in the bearded reedling, Panurus biarmicus. In this species pairs form in juvenile flocks and usually remain stable for life. We experimentally manipulated the pair-formation period in aviary pairs prior to their first breeding season and observed the effect of varying pair bond duration on breeding success, male parental effort and breeding coordination. This was done for pairs with long (6.5 months), medium (4 months) and short (2 weeks) formation periods. Our results suggest that the length of the bonding period does not influence male parental effort, as males with medium and short formation periods did not reduce their parental effort in nest building, during incubation or in nestling provisioning. Nevertheless, coordination of pair partners (in terms of simultaneous start of nest building) occurred more often when the pair bond period was long, and these pairs also started breeding earlier. Pairs with long bonds succeeded more often in breeding attempts and had higher hatching and fledging success than pairs with medium and short formation periods. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that the duration of the pair bond may improve coordination within a pair before the start of breeding and thereby may result in enhanced reproductive success.

AB Dolphins live in complex social systems with a wide variety of grouping and association patterns. Understanding the spatiotemporal variation of these associations (fission-fusion dynamics) is necessary to investigate the underlying factors and mechanisms shaping mammalian social systems in aquatic environments. We used boat-based surveys, photoidentification, focal observations, association analyses and social network techniques to quantify variation in the grouping patterns and fission-fusion dynamics of small, sympatric populations of Australian snubfin dolphins, Orcaella heinsohni, and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, off the northeast coast of Queensland. Schools of snubfin dolphins were larger and more stable, irrespective of behavioural activity, than those of humpback dolphins. While associations of both species showed nonrandom patterns and structure, the social network of snubfin dolphins was characterized by numerous strong associations, whereas the strength of the humpback dolphin's social network did not differ from random. Modelling of temporal patterns of association indicated long-lasting associations were an important feature of snubfin dolphins' fission-fusion dynamics. In contrast, associations among humpback dolphins over time were best described by short-term relationships. The contrasting grouping and fission-fusion dynamics of snubfin and humpback dolphins appear to be a response to different feeding habits and prey availability. Future studies involving molecular techniques and direct quantification of food availability and predation risk will help elucidate the suite of interacting ecological, social and evolutionary factors shaping their social structures.

AB To counter female resistance to mating and cannibalism, males of many animal species have evolved a variety of behavioural adaptations. Here we investigated a novel copulatory courtship behaviour, mate binding, in which the male deposits fine silk onto the female's body in between copulation bouts, in an orb-web nephilid spider, Nephila pilipes. We hypothesized that mate binding might reduce female aggressiveness and sexual cannibalism and that both tactile and chemical cues play a role. We performed a series of mating trials, in which we blocked (1) the females' tactile perception, (2) the females' chemoreceptors, and (3) both types of communication. We also manipulated male spinnerets and thus male silk production. As predicted, mate binding reduced both female resistance to repeated mating and levels of sexual cannibalism. Our results suggest that both tactile and chemical cues are crucial for mate binding to succeed in rendering females less aggressive, but that tactile cues are more important. We conclude that mate binding prolongs total copulation duration, whereby the male maximizes his paternity. Therefore, mate binding may serve as a mechanism countering sexual conflict over repeated mating and sexual cannibalism. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB There is growing appreciation that successful foraging is not simply about the quantity of food consumed, but also about food quality, as animals seek to attain species-specific macronutrient intake targets. Of the various macronutrients, protein is of primary importance, and its acquisition is central to the foraging strategies of many animals. To forage effectively, animals may use cues arising directly from a food source or indirectly from conspecifics relating to their recent foraging experience. In this latter case, successful foragers may be attractive both in a sexual context, as a high-quality mate, and in a social context, since they may hold information about foraging resources that others may be able to exploit. We tested the mate choice preference of male mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, for female conspecifics that had been fed for 72 h on a high-protein, low-carbohydrate (Pc) diet versus females that had been fed on an alternative, isocaloric diet with high-carbohydrate, low-protein content (pC). We found that males expressed a significant preference for mating with Pc females. Additionally, we tested the preference of mosquitofish for cues derived directly from each of the two diets, and indirectly from conspecifics that had been fed on the two diet treatments. We found that mosquitofish preferred both direct cues from Pc foods and cues of conspecifics from the Pc diet treatment. We discuss the role of dietary proteins in the chemical signatures of organisms and the adaptive significance of the preference for conspecifics with high protein intake in both social and sexual contexts.

AB Ecologically, spiders are both predators and prey. Therefore, they must balance being aggressive enough to forage successfully, but not so aggressive that they become overly exposed to predation. Some species of spiders actively forage during clearly defined periods of the day, leading to the hypothesis that they should be less aggressive (or more defensive) during periods when they are not foraging, predicting that antipredator behaviour should be more pronounced during inactive foraging times. We tested the antipredator 'huddle response' in a nocturnal foraging orb-weaver, Larinioides cornutus, and found that, as predicted, the spiders huddled longer in the day than at night. We then conducted tests to determine whether the cycling of the response was regulated by an internal clock (circadian), and we found that huddle duration continued to cycle under constant dark (with periodicity significantly less than 24 h) as well as under constant light (periodicity nonsignificantly longer than 24 h). This work adds a novel behaviour to the list of behaviours under circadian control and also to the surprisingly short list of studies demonstrating circadian rhythm in spiders.

AB We investigated the hypothesis that patterns of chimpanzee food sharing are influenced by whether individuals contributed to its acquisition collaboratively. In two experiments we exposed pairs of captive chimpanzees to food acquisition/sharing situations in which we manipulated (1) whether or not the two individuals had worked together collaboratively to retrieve the food and (2) the proximity of the individuals to the food at the moment of retrieval. The first experiment resembled a scramble competition scenario, with nonmonopolizable food. Proximity of individuals to the food when it arrived was the major variable affecting amount obtained by subordinates. Whether or not the food was obtained via collaboration had no effect. The second experiment resembled a contest competition scenario, as the food was a single large piece of fruit that could be more readily monopolized. In this scenario, dominants obtained more food than subordinates, the amount of food obtained by 'noncaptors' was affected by their proximity to the food when it arrived, and again previous collaboration had no effect. These results suggest that in many food acquisition situations first-arriver and first-possessor chimpanzees, as well as dominants in general, have a significant advantage in food acquisition, but being a collaborator brings no extra benefits.

AB Although there are many examples of status signalling in nature, the mechanisms that maintain the stability of these systems are still poorly understood. Here I show in terms of a simple game of aggressive communication that commitment to the need to defend a given resource repeatedly in the long term greatly increases the conditions under which signalling of strength by means of conventional badges can be honest and evolutionarily stable. Such commitment can efficiently prevent the invasion of potentially weak cheaters pretending to be strong at a very low cost of harassment suffered by such weak individuals. Moreover, as long as such commitment is present, this cost is not a function of the contested resource; thus the value of the resource can be orders of magnitude higher than the potential cost imposed on cheaters, yet the system remains honest and evolutionarily stable. While liar-strong strategies (i.e. Trojans) can invade under some conditions, in most cases there is a broad region of honesty and this honest region is always open ended towards large resource values. In this region of honesty, no other costs, either production costs or handicaps, are necessary to maintain the evolutionary stability of the system.

AB In cooperatively breeding animals there is potential for conflict among group members over reproductive sharing (skew). The outcome of such conflict depends on which individuals have power. Theoretical treatments of skewgenerally assume that power rests with those directly reproducing, but in eusocial insects, an important group for testing skew theory, nonreproductive workers are known to be influential in other colony conflicts such as sex ratio. We investigated the role of queens and workers in determining queen inheritance of a newly vacant reproductive position in a functionally monogynous (only one queen reproduces) population of the ant Leptothorax acervorum. Multiple-queen colonies with an already established reproductive queenwere split in half producing a fragment containing multiple, previously nonreproductive queens. Loss of the established queen simulates a queen turnover event as occurs in nature. We found that worker behaviour influenced which queen filled the vacant reproductive position, with this queen receiving on average less aggression and more grooming from workers than the other queens. This study shows that after loss of the established queen, workers can modify their behaviour towards individual queens, and, contrary to skew models, skewamong queens remains high despite changes in relatedness asymmetry. Our results suggest workers collectively hold considerable power over skew among queens. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eavesdropping on third-party interactions has been observed in a number of species and is considered an important source of information in decision-making processes relating to fighting and mate choice. Human beings, however, use publicly available information flexibly in many different contexts including assessing others' altruistic tendencies, which may in turn inform their choice of the most appropriate cooperative partner. We assessed whether dogs, Canis familiaris, were capable of discerning a generous versus selfish food-sharing interaction between humans, and investigated which communicative cues (voice versus gestures) may be more salient for them. Importantly a control condition was included to ascertain whether it was in fact the interaction between individuals as opposed to the direct actions of the actors that the dogs evaluated. We found that the dogs were capable of eavesdropping on human food-sharing interactions, and vocal communication was particularly important to convey the human's cooperative versus noncooperative intent.

AB To investigate the social roles of countermarking in dogs, we measured tail base position (TBP, a measure of social status), adjacent-marking and overmarking responses of male, nonoestrous female, gonadectomized male and gonadectomized female dogs to controlled presentations of urine from unfamiliar dogs and social groupmates. We also recorded dog sex, TBP, countermarking and urine investigation at a park. In urine presentations, only males overmarked, intact males (but not gonadectomized males) preferentially overmarked intact female urine, overmarking males had higher TBP than males that did not countermark and urine familiarity did not affect overmarking. In contrast, dogs adjacent-marked only unfamiliar samples, and neither sex nor TBP significantly affected adjacent marking. Gonadectomy did not significantly change the likelihood of countermarking. In dog park observations, males and females marked at and investigated 'scent posts' comprised of serial countermarks, often associated with visual landmarks. Males and females were equally likely to countermark and investigate urine and countermarks made up a similarly large portion of countermarking for males and females. Males and females with higher TBP urinated, investigated urine, and countermarked more than same-sex dogs with lower TBP. These studies suggest that although intact males may overmark female urine in part to guard mates as previously hypothesized, both sexes, intact and gonadectomized, likely countermark competitively. Social and sexual patterns also suggest that overmarks and adjacent marks may be distinct signals. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Extensive research indicates that sexually mature female fruit flies typically choose with whom to mate, a process that is crucial for the operation of sexual selection and population divergence via female choice. We followed up on field data suggesting that male fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster) force copulate with teneral females, which are recently eclosed females characterized by their folded wings and soft, light coloured bodies. Our results indicated that males succeeded in mating with about 20% of the teneral females from our Canton-S population and 15% of the teneral females from a local, wild-caught D. melanogaster population. Males were most likely to mate with recently eclosed females and failed to mate with females older than 1 h posteclosion. Close behavioural observations indicated coercion by the males and resistance by the teneral females. The teneral females continued to fight off males throughout copulation and this probably contributed to the shorter mating duration of teneral females relative to that of mature females. Although teneral females failed to foil some forced copulation attempts, they could reduce the impact of such copulations by subsequently remating with a male of their choosing. Indeed, tenerally mated females were six times more likely to remate than were control females that had mated when mature. Our results substantiate a novel aspect of sexual conflict in fruit flies, which could counteract processes driven by female mate choice. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural syndromes describe consistent and correlated individual differences in behavioural traits. Quantifying individual differences often requires researchers to capture and hold animals in captivity while short-term behavioural assays are recorded. We compared behavioural responses of adult, territorial Steller's jays in short-and long-term field assessments of behavioural traits in two ecological contexts, risk taking and exploration. Individuals' risk taking was similar in short-term and long-term contexts (i.e. alarm calling in the presence of a predator mount and while re-entering a trap, respectively). However, a measure of short-term exploration of a novel object in a feeding context was not related to a long-term index of annual habitat exploration (i.e. travel distance outside home territory). Risk-taking and exploration indices were correlated across ecological contexts, indicating that these traits contributed to a behavioural syndrome in jays. Annual assessments of risk-taking and exploration behaviours were repeatable. Individuals with high scores in risk taking and exploration were more likely to be recaptured in a familiar trap. We conclude that short-term experiments are adequate measures of specific behavioural strategies, but because short-term responses did not necessarily predict long-term annual behaviours in related contexts, expression of behavioural types and associated ecological strategies should be regarded as species and context specific. Long-lived residents are useful study species to overcome sampling biases for traits measured in captivity, because they provide opportunity to evenly sample a population over all personality types, including trap-shy individuals.

AB Polyandrous females may gain genetic benefits for their offspring through postmating sexual selection. To facilitate postcopulatory choice for males of superior genetic quality females are expected to bias precopulatory mate choice towards novel males (i.e. genetically novel sources). Preference for novel partners is also expected to maximize male lifetime reproductive success by allowing males to increase the number of mates. We investigated male and female preference for novel or former mating partners in the spider Pisaura mirabilis by offering females novel males (polyandry) or the same male (monogamy). Precopulatory (mate acceptance) and prefertilization (latency to copulation, mating interruption and copulation duration) behaviours were compared between the two treatments. Males provide females with a nuptial prey gift during courtship. Because of the direct benefit associated with nuptial feeding, females should accept males indiscriminately and exert preference only at the prefertilization level. We found that monogamous females remated more readily than polyandrous females, suggesting less resistance to remating with the same male than with novel mates. No differences in female prefertilization responses were found. Lack of preference for novel mates may suggest that direct selection exerted by the nuptial gift rather than indirect selection for genetic benefits is a more likely driver of female remating propensity. Females were nevertheless resistant to remating, suggesting a trade-off between direct benefits and costs of remating. We found no effect of mate novelty on male mating behaviour, indicating either lack of discriminatory ability or that risk of sperm competition creates paternity benefits from remating with the same female.

AB Bats use echolocation for orientation during foraging and navigation. However, it has been suggested that echolocation calls may also have a communicative function, for instance between roost members. In principle, this seems possible because echolocation calls are species specific and known to differ between the sexes, and between colonies and individuals for some species. We performed playback experiments with lesser bulldog bats, Noctilio albiventris, to which we presented calls of familiar/unfamiliar conspecifics, cohabitant/noncohabitant heterospecifics and ultrasonic white noise as a control. Bats reacted with a complex repertoire of social behaviours and the intensity of their response differed significantly between stimulus categories. Stronger reactions were shown towards echolocation calls of unfamiliar conspecifics than towards heterospecifics and white noise. To our knowledge, this is the first time that bats have been found to react to echolocation calls with a suite of social behaviours. Our results also provide the first experimental evidence for acoustical differentiation by bats between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics, and of heterospecifics. Analysis of echolocation calls confirmed significant individual differences between echolocation calls. In addition, we found a nonsignificant trend towards group signatures in echolocation calls of N. albiventris. We suggest that echolocation calls used during orientation may also communicate species identity, group affiliation and individual identity. Our study highlights the communicative potential of sonar signals that have previously been categorized as cues in animal social systems. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The role of dominant individuals in leading groups of animals is not yet well understood. We investigated whether dominant beef cows, Bos taurus, have more influence on herd movement on pasture than more subordinate cows. A herd of 15 Gasconne cows was observed for a 3-week period between dawn and dusk. The positions of all adult cows were recorded with GPS collars at 1 min intervals and the behaviour of each cow was recorded in 5 min scans. The dominance hierarchy was recorded by ad libitum sampling. Through cluster analysis of the recorded data, we distinguished three herd behaviour patterns: resting, foraging and travelling. Dominant cows were closer to the front of the herd during both travelling and foraging. During travelling, more dominant cows also had more direct trajectories and were more aligned both with their nearest neighbours and with the whole herd. During foraging, the trajectories of dominant cows were shorter than those of subordinate cows. The results indicate that foraging and short-distance travelling movements by female beef cattle are not led by any particular individual but rather are influenced by a graded type of leadership; that is, the more dominant a cow is, the stronger the influence it may have on the movements of the herd.

AB Adult house mice produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that are sexually dimorphic and have features of song. To test whether USVs play a role in sexual courtship, we examined how males produce USVs following exposure to scent from conspecifics of different sexes and ages, and also females' attraction to recorded playbacks of males' USVs. We studied wild-derived house mice (F1 from wild-caught Mus musculus musculus) since previous work has almost exclusively been on domesticated strains. Males produced USVs in response to female but not to male or immature female urinary scent, and males responded at a higher rate to urine from novel than familiar females. Males' prior social experience had no effect on their USV responses to fresh female urine, corroborating studies with laboratory mice. When presented with playbacks, females were more attracted to USVs of novel males, and showed a preference for unfamiliar nonkin versus familiar siblings. Our results support the idea that male USVs function as courtship behaviour to attract mates, and extend several previous findings on laboratory strains to wild house mice. We also show that USVs are highly diverse among males, but further experiments are needed to determine whether these vocalizations play a role in social (individual, sibling or kin) recognition, inbreeding avoidance or other forms of mate choice.

AB The larva of the ichneumonid wasp Polysphincta gutfreundi induces its host, the orb-weaving spider Allocyclosa bifurca, to build a highly modified, physically stable orb web, to which the larva then attaches its pupal cocoon, and to add an otherwise unusual linear silk stabilimentum to this web that may camouflage the cocoon. The effects of the larva are apparently due to a chemical product or products that it introduces into the spider. Behavioural modi. cation is gradual, and various behavioural effects arise in a consistent order. If the wasp larva is experimentally removed just before it kills the spider, the spider's behaviour recovers gradually in the reverse order. In addition, a greater delay in removing the larva leads to more pronounced and enduring behavioural changes, so the larval effects may depend on a cumulative or dose-dependent process. Changes in numbers and lengths of radii and numbers of sticky spiral loops could result from correlated larval effects on the reduction in the amount of silk in the spider's sticky spiral silk glands (or a signal thereof), but several other types of behavioural change are probably under separate controls; multiple larval products may be involved. The larvae may affect higher levels of behavioural decisions by spiders that determine overall web 'design', rather than lower levels, such as control of particular behaviour patterns, as may be affected by related wasps. The larva's effects are fine-tuned to details of the host's natural history. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In social insects the number of queens per nest varies greatly. One of the proximate causes of this variation may be that queens produced by multiple-queen colonies are generally smaller, and might thus be unable to found new colonies independently. We examined whether the social origin of queens and males influenced the colony-founding success of queens in the socially polymorphic ant Formica selysi. Queens originating from single-queen and multiple-queen colonies had similar survival rates and colony-founding success, be they alone or in two-queen associations. During the first 5 months, queens originating from single-queen colonies gave rise to more workers than queens originating from multiple-queen colonies. Pairs of queens were also more productive than single queens. However, these differences in productivity were transient, as all types of colonies had reached a similar size after 15 months. Mating between social forms was possible and did not decrease queen survival or colony productivity, compared to mating within social forms. Overall, these results indicate that queens from each social form are able to found colonies independently, at least under laboratory conditions. Moreover, gene flow between social forms is not restricted by mating or genetic incompatibilities. This flexibility in mating and colony founding helps to explain the maintenance of alternative social structures in sympatry and the absence of genetic differentiation between social forms.

AB A decade of research indicates that domestic dogs are sensitive to a variety of human social cues, including pointing with the hand and arm. Previous studies conducted with puppies as young as 6 weeks old have reported that puppies are able to follow a human pointing gesture, even when they have had little human contact. These results have led some experimenters to conclude that ontogeny does not contribute to dogs' ability to understand human cues. To determine the age at which domestic dogs first show the ability to understand human pointing cues, we tested puppies in their human caregivers' homes when the puppies were 9-24 weeks old. We found little evidence that puppies younger than 21 weeks had the ability to follow human pointing gestures. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nonreflexive responses to a noxious event and prolonged memory are key criteria of a pain experience. In a previous study, hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, that received a small electric shock within their shell often temporarily evacuated the shell and some groomed their abdomen and/or moved away from their vital resource. Most, however, returned to the shell. When offered a new shell 20 s later, shocked crabs were more likely than nonshocked crabs to approach and move into a new shell and did so more quickly (Elwood & Appel 2009, Animal Behaviour, 77, 1243-1246). Here we examined how increasing the time between the shock and the offering of a new shell influences the response. There was evidence of a memory of the aversive shock that lasted at least 1 day. Crabs tested after 30 min and 1 day were more likely to approach the shell and new shells were more likely to be taken 30 min after the shock. Shocked crabs approached the new shell more quickly and used fewer probes of the chelipeds prior to moving in and these results were stable over time and significant for specific times up to 1 day. Females were more likely than males to evacuate shells and did so after fewer shocks. These results extend previous work and demonstrate an extended memory of having been shocked. The findings are consistent with respect to criteria for pain that are accepted for vertebrates. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many insects undertake long-distance migrations to exploit seasonally variable conditions at high latitudes, but the mechanisms used by migrants to select and maintain beneficial flight headings are poorly understood. Using computerized flight simulators, we performed controlled experiments to test the ability of an obligate migrant butterfly (Vanessa cardui) to orient in seasonally advantageous directions (i.e. northwards in spring and southwards in autumn). We also investigated the compass mechanism used to select and maintain these headings. Laboratory-reared autumn-generation butter. flies flown in the U. K. displayed a highly significant mean orientation towards the south-southwest, consistent with return migration to winter breeding sites. However, seasonally adaptive flight headings were not observed in wild-caught adults. own at the same time. Spring-generation adults caught in Gibraltar (presumed to be migrating from winter breeding sites in North Africa into Europe) showed no evidence of northward flight headings, but produced a wide scatter of flight headings with a mean direction towards the west. Butterflies. own in the simulators when the sky was not visible produced a random scatter of flight headings and less-directed flight tracks, providing evidence that migrating V. cardui use a sun compass to select and maintain their flight headings. However, when butterflies were subjected to a 6 h clock shift, no change in orientation was observed relative to the control group. Field evidence for a return migration in autumn by V. cardui is surprisingly scarce in the literature, but we conclude that the species does attempt such southward movements and that individuals use a sun compass to select their migratory heading.

AB Interactions among parents, offspring and the environment are a critical aspect of parental care. Begging by offspring usually results in increased parental provisioning. Yet, parents also vary their behaviours to reduce offspring predation. Both begging sounds and provisioning activity can increase risk of nest predation. We predicted in a high nest-predation environment, parents would satiate young and reduce begging by increasing food load but maintaining the same provisioning rates. We also assessed whether increased begging was beneficial to offspring and whether parents changed the allocation of food to particular nestlings. We increased whole-brood begging via playbacks at nests of a tropical passerine bird, the western slaty antshrike, Thamnophilus atrinucha. We observed that parents increased provisioning rates and reduced food load in response to elevated begging. Selection may therefore favour feeding hungry nestlings even when predation risk is elevated, or begging sounds may place offspring at a higher risk than increased activity. Parents reduced the time between arrival to the nest and feeding of nestlings, potentially to reduce begging sounds. Exaggerated begging did not appear to be beneficial to offspring since parents did not deliver more food. Parents switched to preferentially feed the closest offspring during the begging treatment. This suggests that, under elevated begging, parents either allowed sibling competition to influence feeding decisions, or fed the closer nestling to reduce the time between arrival to the nest and feeding. Studying species in different environments provides insight into how ecological factors such as nest predation influence parental behaviour.

AB The acoustic structure of mammal vocalizations often encodes information on different phenotypic traits of the caller that is potentially available to receivers. Here we used a source-filter theory approach to investigate, in light of their biophysical modes of production, which acoustic features of male and female giant panda bleats have the potential to convey information on the caller's sex, age and body size. Our results revealed that both source-and filter-related acoustic features of giant panda bleats provided reliable information on a caller's sex, age and body size. However, when we considered both sexes separately we found that male and female giant panda bleats differed in their potential to signal information on the caller's age and body size: only male bleats contained reliable information on the caller's body size while female bleats were more predictive of the caller's age. We go on to discuss the anatomical basis for our findings, consider the potential functional relevance of signalling this type of information in giant panda sexual communication, and suggest future empirical investigations that should better enable us to understand this species' mating behaviour.

AB The hypothesis that large brains allow animals to produce novel behaviour patterns is supported by the correlation between brain size, corrected for body size, and the frequency of foraging innovations reported in the literature for both birds and primates. In birds, foraging innovations have been observed in over 800 species, and include behaviours that range from eating a novel food to using tools. Previous comparative studies have quantified innovativeness by summing all reports of innovative behaviour, regardless of the nature of the innovation. Here, we use the variety of foraging innovations recorded for birds to see which of two classic hypotheses best accounts for the relationship between innovativeness and brain size: the technical intelligence hypothesis or the opportunistic-generalism intelligence hypothesis. We classified 2182 innovation cases into 12 categories to quantify the diversity of innovations performed by each of 76 avian families. We found that families with larger brains had a greater repertoire of innovations, and that innovation diversity was a stronger predictor of residual brain size than was total number of innovations. Furthermore, the diversity of technical innovations displayed by bird families was a much better predictor of residual brain size than was the number of food type innovations, providing support for the technical intelligence hypothesis. Our results suggest that the cognitive capacity required to perform a wide variety of novel foraging techniques underpins the positive relationship between innovativeness and brain size in birds. We include a summary of innovation data for 803 species as Supplementary Material. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The problem of when an action should be abandoned because it is not worth further effort occurs in many situations. In the spatial domain, the relevant information can be quantified. Two essential pieces of information are the precision with which the target location and the probability of the target being present are known. We offer a quantitative description of optimal solutions to cache retrieval, treating it as a 2D investment problem with search cost proportional to area. We estimated the value of knowing the precision of spatial information and the precision of information regarding probability: how precisely should you estimate the precision of your knowledge? We compared the expected gain from assessing the precision of spatial knowledge and probability with the expected gain from decisions based on aggregate knowledge of the distribution of precision and probability. We found that heuristics, represented here as default search limits based on aggregate knowledge, are useful only under limited conditions. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   MECHANISMS
AB In species in which paternal care of offspring is important but paternity is uncertain, evolutionary theory suggests that kin recognition mechanisms (e. g. phenotype matching) should evolve. Fathers are expected to discriminate between their children and others' on the basis of phenotypic similarities, and they should allocate resources accordingly. However, studies showing that males assess paternity by phenotype matching are rare. In a polygynous human population of rural Senegal, we examined the relationships between (1) actual father-child resemblance through both the facial and the olfactory phenotypes; (2) fathers' investment of resources in each child; and (3) child nutritional condition. We found that paternal investment was positively related to both face and odour similarities between fathers and children. Additionally, such discriminative paternal investment was linked to the children's health: children who received more investment had better growth and nutritional status. This is the first evidence that paternal investment is associated with father-child resemblance in real human families, and, furthermore, that these discrepancies in paternal investment result in differences in fitness-related traits in children.

AB Antennae are important sensory organs in insects because they enable the perception of chemical and tactile cues believed to be important in sex recognition and mating in various species. To examine the role of the antennae in the mating behaviour of decorated crickets, Gryllodes sigillatus, we experimentally manipulated the chemosensory ability of males and females and altered the chemical cues present on the female cuticle. Our results suggest that males rely heavily on their antennae to recognize conspecific females, because antennectomized and chemically ablated males were less likely to produce the courtship song upon contact with a female. The chemical cues used by males to recognize females appear to be sex specific, because males courted dead females that had been stripped of their surface hydrocarbons and imbued with hydrocarbons extracted from other females, but ignored females similarly stripped of their cues and imbued with extracts derived from males. Females, in contrast, did not seem to rely on their antennae for sex recognition, because antennectomized females frequently mounted males, although they took significantly longer to do so. Males lacking antennae almost never showed mate-guarding behaviour, while males with intact antennae almost always did. Collectively, these results suggest that sensory information provided by the antennae is critical to the mating success of both male and female crickets.

AB It is known from primates that alliance partners may support each other's interests in competition with others, for example, through repeated agonistic attacks against a particular individual. We examined serial aggressive interactions between greylag goose families and other flock members. We found that repeated attacks towards the same individual were common and that up to five serial attacks by family members followed an initial attack. Family size did not affect the frequency of such serial attacks. Juvenile geese evidently benefited most from active social support through serial attacks. About 60% of the juveniles' lost primary interactions were subsequently reversed by another family member. This may be one of the reasons why juveniles rank higher in the social hierarchy than would be expected from their age and size alone. Losses in serial attacks predominantly occurred against other, presumably higher-ranking, family geese and ganders. We propose three major functions/consequences of serial attacks. Analogous to primates, serial attacks in greylag geese may serve to reinforce a losing experience of an opponent defeated in a preceding attack. On the side of the winning family, serial attacks may reinforce the experience of winning. Both winning and losing experiences are linked with physiological consequences in higher vertebrates, affecting the future social performance of winners or losers. Finally, serial attacks may signal the agonistic potential of a family to other flock members. This is supported by heart rate data, which indicate that greylags are competent to interpret third-party relationships. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The function of wolf, Canis lupus, faeces in chemical communication and the selection of raised and conspicuous substrates to increase their effectiveness as visual scent marks are well documented. Therefore, I hypothesized that faecal marks are not placed randomly on plants, and that wolves will select specific plants according to characteristics that enhance faeces as visual scent marks and ensure greater support and persistence of these marks over time. Analysis of the physical properties of plants marked by Iberian wolves showed that the choice of plants was clearly not random. The factors that determined selection were plant diameter, height and species. The mean height and diameter of faeces-marked plants were significantly greater than those of unmarked plants. Furthermore, plant use in relation to size ( diameter and height) and species did not depend on availability in the environment. Persistence time was independent of the substratum type, height and altitude, but did depend on the scat content, being longer when the scat contained bone than when it contained hair or undetermined matter. These results indicate that the physical appearance of the plant is important for the wolf when deciding where to deposit faecal marks. Thus, the use of standard species and sizes of plants maximizes visual localization of faecal marks deposited by intruder and resident wolves.

AB The function of sleep in birds is poorly understood, even though birds spend a large part of their lives sleeping. Sleep behaviour in passerine birds has not been looked at as extensively as that of nonpasserine birds. We looked at the sleep behaviour of three passerine birds occurring in southern Africa, namely the malachite sunbird, Nectarinia famosa, the Cape white-eye, Zosterops virens, and the fan-tailed widowbird, Euplectes axillaris. By using an infrared-sensitive camera, we recorded basic sleep behaviour, at various ambient temperatures, of all three species, such as sleep position and eye closure. We also investigated the incidence, or lack thereof, of unihemispheric sleep. Individuals of all three species spent most of the night asleep and woke up intermittently throughout the night, with no significant differences between temperatures. Cape white-eyes and malachite sunbirds showed an increase in back sleep and a decrease in front sleep at 5 degrees C. Little evidence of unihemispheric sleep was found, suggesting that it is more likely to occur in nonpasserines. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Songbirds undergo a sensitive period in which exposure to adult song is necessary for normal vocal development. During this period, a template is formed and later used as a model for comparison via auditory feedback. In montane white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha, whose song typically consists of four to five distinct segments (phrases), exposure to syntactically overlapping phrase pairs during the sensitive period provides the minimum sufficient information for song assembly; exposure to isolated phrases is insufficient. This suggests that a template representing phrase-pair information is sufficient for guiding normal song production. However, birds may also store and use the additional information they receive when tutored with full song. In the present study, we tutored white-crowned sparrows with a range of phrase sequence information. We found that sparrows tutored with varying levels of syntax information differed in the syntactical (phrase sequence) and phonological (phrase structure) characteristics of their final songs. Sparrows tutored with isolated phrases produced songs that were syntactically and, surprisingly, phonologically deficient. The crystallized songs of birds tutored with full song generally consisted of five phrase types, whereas those of birds tutored with phrase pairs generally had four phrase types. In addition, birds tutored with phrase pairs combined phrases from different tutors in their final songs, while birds tutored with full song did not. These results suggest that the additional syntactical information present in full song is stored and later used. Also, the ability to accurately reproduce phrase structure is linked to the availability of syntax information during the sensitive period. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID CANIS-FAMILIARIS; COGNITION
AB Domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, have been shown capable of finding hidden food by following pointing gestures made with different parts of the human body. However, previous studies have reported that hand-reared wolves, C. lupus, fail to locate hidden food in response to similar points in the absence of extensive training. The failure of wolves to perform this task has led to the proposal that the ability to understand others' intentions is a derived character in dogs, not present in the ancestral population ( wolves). Here we show that wolves, given the right rearing environment and daily interaction with humans, can use momentary distal human pointing cues to find food without training, whereas dogs tested outdoors and dogs at an animal shelter do not follow the same human points. In line with past studies, pet dogs tested indoors were successful in following these points. We also show that the reported failure of wolves in some past studies may be due to differences in the testing environment. Our findings indicate that domestication is not a prerequisite for human-like social cognition in canids, and show the need for additional research on the role of rearing conditions and environmental factors in the development of higher-level cognitive abilities.

AB Natural hybridization can produce novel traits when morphologically different populations hybridize, and can introduce variation in traits that become associated with sexual selection. Evidence from breeding experiments and genetic markers indicate that the great variation in coat darkness and the unique coat patterns found in Stone's sheep Ovis dalli stonei, populations, have resulted from an ancient hybridization event between thinhorn sheep, O. dalli, and bighorn sheep, O. canadensis. Behavioural evidence gathered in 2003 and 2004 in Yukon Territory, Canada, showed that higher dominance rank was correlated with increasing darkness in rams, and comparatively darker rams were seen more often tending oestrous ewes. The relationship between ram darkness and dominance and use of the tending mating tactic was still significant after age or horn size were controlled. In sum, our study demonstrates an interesting example of the potential for hybridization to generate diversity. In the case of mountain sheep an ancestral hybridization has resulted in a subspecies with unique coat colour characteristics that are associated with social dominance and mating behaviour.

AB Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) play an important role in insect recognition systems. A growing body of evidence indicates that insects are able to act upon the information contained in CHCs. However, investigating the behavioural response of insects to cuticular compounds usually involves the extraction and analysis of CHCs using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, which is a time-consuming and expensive process. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) may provide a much faster and less expensive technique for studying the behavioural response of insects to cuticular compounds. Here we present a case study of intercolonial aggression in the weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina. The differences between colonies detected by NIRS were reflected in the behaviour of colony members. The level of aggression expressed by colonies towards intruders increased as the spectral distance between colonies increased. The variability in the aggressive response also increased as the breadth of within-colony variation in spectra increased. This demonstrates that spectra generated using NIRS contain information to which weaver ants are able to respond. We discuss the implications of this for behavioural studies that have previously depended upon the extraction and analysis of CHCs. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Socioecological models aim to predict the effect of environmental variables on species' ecology and social behaviour. Larger groups should face more within-group food competition than smaller groups but benefit from a reduction in predation pressure and/or between-group food competition. The balance between benefits and costs of living in larger groups may vary between populations and species. Moreover, sample size is usually relatively small in field studies and this increases variation in the results. We used meta-analytical techniques to analyse the effect of group size on behaviour and fitness in an attempt to measure the benefits and costs related to group size differences in primates. Meta-analysis allows the presence of an overall effect to be determined across different studies and taxa while controlling for sample size. We selected published papers from the PrimateLit database (http://primatelit.library.wisc.edu). Larger groups travelled further per day and spent more time feeding than smaller groups. Time spent on social behaviour and resting was not affected by group size differences. We found partial support for a decrease in female fecundity in larger groups whereas no significant difference was found for juvenile survival. These results were relatively unaffected by habitat characteristics, by species' ecology and social structure, and by indirect measures of predation risk. Our findings indicate that folivores and frugivores face similar ecological pressures and suggest that the costs of living in larger groups balance or outweigh the benefits.

AB Competition over limited resources can lead to serious injury and may be minimized by the formation of social hierarchies. However, there are often physiological consequences associated with social status which can affect both dominant and subordinate animals. In salmonid fish, at least under laboratory conditions, physiological costs are mainly associated with subordinance. The structure of hierarchies formed among salmonids in the laboratory is likely to be different from those formed in complex natural environments, and yet little is known about the physiological consequences of dominance in the field. We tested the hypothesis that there are specific physiological correlates associated with specific social behaviours among natural populations of juvenile salmonid fish by observing brown trout, Salmo trutta, in small streams. Fish were tagged and their behaviour observed by video recording over several weeks at three sites along Devonport Leat (Devon, U. K.). Although diet and tissue metal concentrations differed between sites, the behaviour of the fish at the three sites was very similar. At the end of the observation period, we sampled fish for parameters including specific growth rate, plasma cortisol and osmolality, brain monoamines and gut contents. There was no relationship between social status and growth rates but, contrary to laboratory predictions, dominant fish had higher plasma cortisol. We conclude that physiological correlates of dominance do exist among these natural fish populations but they may differ to those found in the laboratory. Further research is now required to test a wider range of physiologies in the field. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Animals are expected to follow decision-making strategies that balance the benefits of choosing the best option with the costs of finding and assessing candidates. Because costs and benefits will vary across time and space, an animal may profit by adjusting its tactics according to recent experience. In particular, animals should be less selective when experience indicates that the average quality of options is low. We tested this prediction in the context of nest site selection by the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus. Colonies received prolonged exposure either to a good or to a poor nest and then were tested for their readiness to accept a mediocre nest. Previous studies have shown that colonies move more rapidly into nests that they rate more highly, as a result of faster recruitment initiation by individual ants. Hence, if exposure to a low-quality nest makes colonies more willing to accept a mediocre one, we predicted speedier moves into the mediocre nest after the poor treatment than after the good treatment. Our results showed a clear effect of treatment, but contrary to our prediction, ants moved more rapidly after living in a good nest than after living in a poor nest. We discuss three effects that may explain these results: (1) quality-dependent changes in colony condition, (2) quality-dependent changes in colony size and (3) differences in the urgency of emigration perceived by ants in the two nest types. Our finding illustrates that animal collectives, like individuals, use recent experience to tune their decision strategies. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated how plains zebras moved across a large natural landscape by analysing the movement paths of nine zebra mares foraging out from spatially confined waterholes during the dry season in the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park, Botswana. Since it was essential to investigate directed movement over a range of spatial scales to determine the correct movement behaviour and strategy, we used Nams's scaling test for oriented movement. Zebras followed directed movement paths in the lower to medium spatial scales ( 10 me3.7 km) and above their visual, and possibly olfactory, range. The spatial scale of directed movement suggests that zebras had a well- defined spatial awareness and cognitive ability. Seven zebras used directed movement paths, but the remaining two followed paths not significantly different to a correlated random walk ( CRW). At large spatial scales (> 3 km) no distinct movement pattern could be identified and paths could not be distinguished from a CRW. Foraging strategy affected the extent of directed movement: zebras with a confined dispersion of grazing patches around the central place directed their movements over a longer distance. Zebras may extend the distance at which they can direct their movement after improving their knowledge of the local environment. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In a study of the spider Pholcus phalangioides, we double-mated large or small females with large and small males in all possible combinations to investigate the effects of body size and female mating history on male copulatory behaviour and paternity success. In addition we recorded data on female struggle behaviour. Our aim was to get insights into evolutionary forces that promote and constrain adaptive plasticity in male copulatory behaviour in this species with last-male sperm priority. When mating with virgin females, small males made more movements with both inserted pedipalps (sperm transfer organs) than large males, and males of both size classes showed many more pedipalp movements (PPMs) in large, fecund females. With mated females, in contrast, matings were either very short (5 min, 82% of matings), during which PPMs were little affected by male and female size, or as long as matings with virgin females (78 min, 18%) with comparably strong size effects on PPMs. Genetic paternity analysis showed that the second male fertilized on average 88% of the eggs, independent of his size and behaviour. Variation in relative fertilization success was solely predicted by the first male's behaviour. We suggest that this difference in fertilization returns between first and second males may to a large extent explain the contrasting behavioural patterns in virgin versus mated females. The fact that female struggle behaviour contributed to variation in male copulatory behaviour further highlights that females are not merely passive during mating.

AB In many social species individuals have to make adaptive decisions about with whom to group. Self-referent matching of chemical social information specific to patterns of diet and habitat use is an important factor underlying social organization in shoaling fishes. In a series of three experiments, we gave female Whitecloud mountain minnows, Tanichthys albonubes, a binary choice between shoaling with stimulus groups fed upon the same or a different diet to themselves. Focal fish spent significantly more time shoaling with the group whose individuals had consumed the same diet as themselves, were significantly more likely to follow such a group when the two stimulus groups diverged in a simulated shoal fission event, and were significantly more likely to feed from a prey patch containing a neutral food that was situated close to the same diet stimulus group than from an identical one located close to the stimulus group fed the alternative diet. By grouping with others that are exploiting the same resources, individuals potentially gain useful information about the location of resources.

AB Animals that live in social groups have the opportunity to acquire information about foraging opportunities, mates and predators. Traditionally, social learning has been studied in birds and mammals, but few tests have been conducted on less social taxa such as amphibians. Moreover, few studies have considered cross-species learning among members of mixed-species assemblages. We examined social learning in tadpoles of the boreal chorus frog, Pseudacris maculata, and found that they do not display a fright response to the odour of predacious tiger salamanders, Ambystoma tigrinum, without prior experience with salamanders, but they can learn to recognize the salamanders when they are paired with predator-experienced woodfrog, Rana sylvatica, tadpoles. Moreover, the efficacy of learning is enhanced when the ratio of tutors-to-observers increases. Social learning has far-reaching implications for survival of individuals in mixed-species assemblages.

AB Locomotion is an important trait to individual fitness in numerous animal taxa for predator escape and prey acquisition. However, the role of locomotion in mating success has been largely unexplored. Even studies linking sprint speed with proxies of fitness (e. g. dominance) and actual measures of mating success (e. g. genetic reproductive success) have struggled to test explicit hypotheses as to how high-performance individuals attain higher fitness. We studied a free-ranging population of male collared lizards, Crotaphytus collaris, to determine why faster males sire more offspring. Specifically, we tested the alternative hypotheses that faster males are 'fast defenders' versus 'fast sneakers' by using molecular genetic techniques to examine patterns of maternity and paternity in the population. We found that females that were defended by faster males had a lower proportion of offspring sired by males that did not defend them (support for a fast defender hypothesis). In contrast, we found no relation between males' sprint speed and the proportion of their offspring that were produced by females other than those they defended (no support for a fast sneaker hypothesis). In species in which locomotor performance is important to male competition, these alternative hypotheses should be simultaneously tested and complemented with behavioural data to discriminate them from female choice.

AB Adults providing food to offspring are predicted to allocate care in a way that maximizes their fitness. Providers across taxa have been demonstrated to show preferences for particular young depending on the degree of relatedness, offspring sex or size. However, little is known about the cues providers use to discriminate among individual offspring. In the banded mongoose, Mungos mungo, a cooperatively breeding carnivore, dependent pups form long-lasting and exclusive associations with particular adults, their 'escorts', and receive the majority of care from these individuals. We performed acoustic analyses of pup distress calls and escort contact calls and found that pup distress calls are highly and escort contact calls are moderately individualized. In subsequent playback experiments, both pups and escorts were more responsive to calls of their association partners than to calls of other individuals. These results suggest that pups and escorts recognize each other vocally and mutually and that both pups and providers contribute to the maintenance of the pup-escort associations. Pups may benefit from vocal recognition of their escorts since this reduces the time spent alone, vulnerable to predators and without being fed. Escorts may be more responsive to their associated pup's calls than to another pup's calls because they preferentially care for this particular individual and/or because they were primed by constant exposure to its calls.

AB Animals may use plant compounds to defend themselves against parasites. Wood ants, Formica paralugubris, incorporate pieces of solidified conifer resin into their nests. This behaviour inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi in nest material and protects the ants against some detrimental microorganisms. Here, we studied the resin-collecting behaviour of ants under field and laboratory conditions. First, we focused on an important assumption of the self-medication hypothesis, which is that the animals deliberately choose the active plant material. In field cafeteria tests, the ants indeed showed a strong preference for resin over twigs and stones, which are building materials commonly encountered in their environment. We detected seasonal variation in the choice of ants: the preference for resin over twigs was more pronounced in spring than in summer, whereas in autumn the ants collected twigs and resin at equal rates. Second, we found almost similar seasonal patterns when comparing the collecting rates of pieces of wood that had been impregnated with turpentine (a distillate of oleoresin) and untreated pieces of wood, which reveals that the preference for resin is based on odour cues. Third, we tested whether the collection of resin is prophylactic or therapeutic. We found that the relative collection rate of resin versus stones did not depend on an experimental infection with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae in laboratory colonies. Together, these results show that the ants deliberately choose the resin and suggest that resin collection is prophylactic rather than therapeutic.

AB Underlying male quality is often reflected in the condition of sexually selected traits. In fiddler crabs, male success in both intra- and interspecific interactions is highly dependent on the size of the major claw. However, males are often forced to autotomize their major claw. Claw regeneration significantly altered the structure of a males' major claw in Uca mjoebergi. We found, however, that claw regeneration did not affect signal quality. Both males and females were unable to visually distinguish a regenerated claw from an original claw. Although regenerated males were inferior fighters, males were able to compensate for this fighting disadvantage by avoiding fights with other males. Regenerated males were, however, less likely to acquire and defend high-quality territories and consequently suffered a decrease in mating success.

AB The ability to discriminate nestmates from non-nestmates is critical to the maintenance of the integrity of social insect colonies. Guard workers compare the chemical cues of an incoming individual with their internal template to determine whether the entrant belongs to their colony. In contrast to honeybees, Apis mellifera, stingless bees have singly mated queens and, therefore, are expected to have a higher chemical homogeneity in their colonies. We tested whether aggressive behaviour of Frieseomelitta varia guards towards nestmate and non-nestmate foragers reflects chemical similarities and dissimilarities, respectively, of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. We also introduced individuals of Lestrimelitta limao, an obligatory robber species, to test the ability of guards to react effectively to intruders from other taxa. We verified that foraging nestmates were almost invariably accepted, while heterospecific and conspecific non-nestmates were rejected at relatively high rates. However, non-nestmate individuals with higher chemical profile similarity were likely to be accepted by guards. We conclude that guards compare the chemical cuticular blend of incoming individuals and make acceptance decisions according to the similarity of the compounds between the colonies.

AB In addition to sexual selection, selection resulting from social interactions in contexts other than mating can be a potent evolutionary force. Such social selection processes are facilitated whenever individual fitness varies as a result of any form of social interactions. The choice of social partners for communal care of young is such a situation in which interactants potentially experience fitness variance. In this study, we investigated the existence and impact of female social partner choice and the potential for social selection to occur in the cooperatively breeding wild house mouse, Mus domesticus. We analysed patterns of individual associations in groups of females, and compared the reproductive behaviour of females grouped with either a preferred or a nonpreferred social partner over an experimental life span of half a year, using spatial association as a measure of preference. We predicted low reproductive competition among preferred social partners and high competition, reflected in lower reproductive success, among nonpreferred. Our results showed that female house mice displayed nonrandom preferences, and that social partner choice yielded significant fitness benefits females in pairs with a preferred partner had a significantly higher probability to give birth and to establish an egalitarian, cooperative relationship, resulting in higher reproductive success than females in nonpreferred pairs. This suggests that interactions among females are subject to social selection processes, driving the evolution of female traits. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Field studies suggest that in autumn, passerine Siberian-African migrants make a detour around Central Asia. We tested whether it results from an innate spatiotemporal programme. We hand-raised juvenile pied flycatchers from Europe and western Siberia in captivity and studied their migratory orientation by testing in Emlen funnels. The birds were kept outdoors in the local natural magnetic field throughout the experiment. Siberian birds showed a purely westerly orientation in mid August-mid September, before changing direction in late September. These data suggest that juvenile Siberian pied flycatchers indeed have an innate spatiotemporal programme that brings them to Europe before migration to West African winter quarters. Siberian pied flycatchers displaced to the Baltic area as nestlings, raised and tested there showed no significant second-order orientation vector in August; in September their mean orientation direction was south-southwestern (202 degrees) and differed significantly from the western direction shown by their conspecifics in Siberia in August-mid September. A possible explanation is that the displaced birds detected displacement on the basis of the innate knowledge of some signposts. They may have 'skipped' the section of the route from Siberia to Europe and 'switched on' their migratory programme when in Europe, already towards the south-southwest.

AB In cooperatively breeding species, members of social groups will risk serious injury or even their lives by actively codefending the communal territory and young in the territory. However, individuals within the group vary in the intensity and frequency of defence. To date little is known about how sex, body size and social status interact with the degree of threat to influence defence activities. To this end, we experimentally manipulated the need for defence in wild groups of the cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher by exposing social groups to four intruder types representing different forms of threat. Intruders were introduced singly (experiment 1) to assess the costs and benefits associated with defence and in tandem (experiment 2) to assess how individuals prioritize perceived threats. Dominant breeders defended more than subordinate helpers, females were more aggressive than males, and female breeders defended more than any other individual in the group. Individual body size, or the difference in body size between intruders and defenders, had no influence on the frequency of defence. Dominant male breeders defended most vigorously against threats to their dominance position, while dominant female breeders showed the highest defence rates to both threats to their position and the security of young to a similar degree relative to all others. Predators evoked the strongest defence responses by subordinate helpers, and conspecific intruders evoked the weakest responses relative to all other intruder types. The results suggest that both costs and benefits have shaped aggressive defence patterns in this cooperatively breeding teleost fish. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Audience effects occur when an observing (by-standing) animal influences the behaviour of an observed individual. We examined whether audience effects influence mate choice decisions in a livebearing fish, the Atlantic molly, Poecilia mexicana. We gave males an opportunity to choose between a conspecific and a heterospecific, Poecilia formosa, female (experiment 1) or a large versus small conspecific female (experiment 2), and we determined the males' association times near the two types of females. During the second part of each test we visually presented an audience male to the focal male, and we compared male association times between the two parts. In both experiments the focal males spent less time near the initially preferred female, and spent more time near the initially nonpreferred female when we presented a conspecific audience male during the second part of the tests. When we presented a heterospecific, Xiphophorus hellerii, male instead, the change in male preferences was significantly weaker. Male preferences were highly consistent when we presented no audience male during the second part of the tests (control). Our study highlights that the social environment has an important effect on male mate choice decisions, and even the mere visual presence of a conspecific competitor can affect the expression of mating preferences.

AB Many sexually selected male signals elicit responses in males and females and, as a result, are affected by selection due to both mate choice and competition for mates. It has been proposed that because signals used in aggressive interactions may also be reliable indicators of mate quality, these dual functioning traits initially evolved in the context of male-male competition and were later co-opted by females to assess potential mates. Our phylogenetic reconstruction of the ancestral states of male and female responses to the sexually selected trait 'vertical bars' in the northern swordtail fish, Xiphophorus spp., suggests that female response to the bars was present before male response to the bars evolved. This is the first evidence that males may have co-opted a signal for use in male competition that was initially used by females in mate choice. We suggest that dual functioning, sexually selected traits are as likely to initially evolve in the context of female preference as in the context of male-male competition. In addition, we propose that eavesdropping may be an important mechanism by which signals are co-opted, with behavioural syndromes potentially playing a key role in the transition of the signal from a context of courtship to one of aggression.

AB Aggressive behaviour against conspecifics is considered a costly behaviour that forms part of reproductive investment. Previous studies have suggested that the intensity of agonistic behaviour may indicate individual quality since it exhibits a positive correlation with brood value. However, this relationship has been demonstrated after clutch completion, and by creating a nexus between efforts it has not been possible to disentangle other hypotheses that could explain such findings. Here, by presenting a trio of natural decoys (adult male, adult female and 1-year-old male) to Eurasian kestrels, Falco tinnunculus, we tested whether the aggressive behaviour to conspecifics prior to laying predicted posterior reproductive performance (clutch size). We also tested the effect of breeding stage and breeding density on this behaviour. In addition, we examined the effect of the presence of moulted versus unmoulted 1-year-old males on aggressive behaviour of breeders. Intrasexual agonistic behaviour, measured as attack intensity to the decoys, was positively correlated with clutch size in females, but negatively in males. In males, aggressive behaviour was lower during the female fertile stage than during previous stage, but in females, was similar over stages. Furthermore, agonistic behaviour increased with breeding density in females but not in males. We discuss these results in the context of sexual selection theory, and propose that the link between agonistic behaviour prior to laying and clutch size is via the connection to courtship feeding and that may be considered as an indicator of individual quality for both sexes.

AB Many bird songs are highly complex acoustic signals that broadcast a variety of information over long distances. General explanations for signal complexity assume that either different signal components are redundant, or that each component conveys a different message. Puget Sound white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys pugetensis, song consists of several temporally discrete phrases or components, two of which, the note complex and trill, vary independently across vocal dialects. Previous playback experiments with males suggest that the terminal trill encodes dialect identity. Here we test whether both the note complex and trill encode individual identity, as predicted by the redundancy hypothesis, or whether the note complex alone serves this role, as predicted by the multiple messages hypothesis. Analyses of acoustic variation in note complexes and trills, and results of a neighbour-estranger song discrimination playback experiment support the multiple messages hypothesis. Note complexes were more individually distinctive among males, and males responded stronger when a neighbour's song had a stranger's note complex substituted than when the neighbour's trill was replaced with that of a stranger. The segregation of cues to individual and dialect identity into the note complex and trill phrases, respectively, supports the hypothesis that coding conflicts may be resolved by using different song components for different functions.

AB The ability to distinguish nestmates from foreign individuals is central to the functioning of insect societies. In ants, workers from multiple-queen colonies are often less aggressive than workers from single-queen ones. In line with this observation, it has been hypothesized that workers from multiple-queen colonies have less precise recognition abilities than workers from single-queen ones because their colonies contain genetically more diverse individuals, which results in a broader template of recognition cues. Here, we assessed the impact of social structure ( queen number) variation on nestmate recognition and aggression in a large population of the socially polymorphic ant Formica selysi. We staged unilateral aggression tests on the nest surface. Workers from single-and multiple-queen colonies had good nestmate recognition ability and did not differ significantly in their level of aggression towards foreign, immobilized workers ( cue-bearers). In particular, workers from multiple-queen colonies efficiently recognized non-nestmates despite the higher genetic diversity in their colony. Cue-bearers from single- and multiple-queen colonies elicited similar reactions. However, the level of aggression was higher between than within social forms, suggesting that workers detect a signal that is specific to the colony social structure. Finally, the level of aggression was not correlated with the genetic distance between colonies. Overall, we found no evidence for the hypothesis that the presence of multiple breeders in the same colony decreases recognition abilities and found no simple relationship between genetic diversity and aggression level.

AB Pheromone trails are self- organized processes, where colony- level behaviour emerges from the activity of many individuals responding to local information. The Pharaoh's ant is an important model species for investigating pheromone trails. Here we show that Pharaoh's ant foragers mark with trail pheromones, using their stinger, on both the outward and return leg of foraging trips. Examination of trail markings showed that 10.5% of returning fed ants simply made marks by dragging their engorged gaster, because stinger marks were absent. After discounting gaster- dragging hair marks we found that fed ants ( 42.5%) did not mark significantly more frequently than unfed ants ( 36.0%). However, we found that trail- marking fed ants marked pheromone trails with a significantly greater intensity, as compared to trail- marking unfed ants, if the food source was high quality ( 1.0 M sucrose). When the food quality was low ( 0.01 M sucrose) we detected no significant difference in marking intensity between fed and unfed trail- marking ants. Our results show that in Pharaoh's ants individual trail marking occurs at a frequency of similar to 40% among fed and unfed foragers, but the frequency of individuals marking with high intensity ( continuous marking) is significantly greater when a food source is high quality. This contrasts with another model species, Lasius niger, where trail strength is modulated by an all- or- nothing individual response to food quality. The reason for this fundamental difference in mechanism is that Pharaoh's ant is highly reliant on pheromone trails for environmental orientation, so must produce trails, whereas L. niger is proficient at visual- based orientation.

AB For group- living animals, the ability to discriminate between familiar individuals and strangers may allow reduced agonistic behaviour between holders of neighbouring territories, termed the `dear enemy' effect. We tested the hypothesis that Eurasian badgers can discriminate between self-, neighbour- and alien( unknown) group faeces placed near their main sett. We carried out a series of controlled field experiments over a 12- month period at the main setts of three badger groups occupying contiguous territories. The experimental design used two different treatments: `alien treatment' involved the display of self- group scents with alien- group scents and `neighbour treatment' involved the display of self- group scents with neighbour-group scents. Badgers showed heightened behavioural responses towards alien- compared with self- group scents, but there was no significant difference in response to neighbour- relative to self- group scents. The relative responses towards alien- group scents were greatest during the breeding seasons, but there were no significant seasonal differences in the responses to neighbour- group versus self- group scents. In undisturbed badger populations, levels of aggression between neighbouring territory- holders are likely to be kept relatively low through neighbour recognition. However, increased levels of aggression will be shown towards dispersing or itinerant ( alien) badgers, especially during periods such as the breeding season when the potential threats to the long- term fitness of territory owners are greatest. This behaviour may reduce the effectiveness of management strategies involving the culling of group- living wildlife hosts to reduce levels of livestock or human disease.

AB Variation in appearance of parasitic and host eggs is an essential trait in the coevolutionary struggle between a brood parasite and its host. Here we examined the role of colour characteristics in the egg recognition in blackcaps, Sylvia atricapilla, assessed by ( 1) human vision and ( 2) spectrophotometry, including UV wavelengths. Since colour and spotting pattern within eggs are often highly variable, we also assessed three different parts of blackcap eggshell separately. We investigated the possibility that a lower intraclutch variation in the parasitized clutch would positively affect egg recognition. In addition, we predicted that egg rejection would depend on contrast between host and parasitic eggs. However, we found that neither intraclutch variation nor mimicry if assessed by humans had significant effect on host rejection. Multivariate analyses of spectrophotometric data revealed, however, that the likelihood of egg rejection significantly increased with decreasing intraclutch variation in blue chroma. Furthermore, probability of egg rejection significantly increased with decreasing contrast between parasitic and host eggs in UV wavelengths and with decreasing brightness of host eggs at the blunt egg pole. Accepted foreign eggs were significantly darker at the blunt pole than acceptors' own eggs. The paradox that rejected eggs had lower contrast could be explained by the fact that the contrast in UV spectra is associated with brightness of the blunt egg part. Our data suggest that colour characteristics of the blunt egg part may play a major role in the recognition of parasitic eggs in the blackcaps.

AB Using a framework based on the Hawk-Dove game, we constructed a model of the interaction between two males, which may or may not be related, competing for access to females. We parameterized the model with laboratory data from size-matched house mice and tested the model's predictions against independent laboratory data. The predictions that mate sharing is more frequent, fighting is less frequent and reproductive skew is lower when males are brothers than when they are unrelated were supported by the data. The qualitative and quantitative match between the model's predictions and the frequencies of fighting, sharing and dominance outcomes were generally good, except that the model predicts occasional fighting between brothers when none was observed. The empirically corroborated prediction on relatedness and reproductive skew is consistent with incomplete control of the subordinate male by the dominant, rather than with reproductive incentives, although the magnitude of skew in the model arises from frequencies of outcomes and not from these more specific mechanisms. The analysis demonstrates that these types of male-male interactions and their frequencies may be adequately characterized by a few main features such as relatedness of males, reproductive skew associated particularly with social dominance, and the costs of fighting. The model also makes testable predictions about results to be expected under more natural conditions. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Multiple regional differences in tool use have been identified among wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, but the hypothesis that these represent traditions, transmitted through social learning, is difficult to substantiate without experimentation. To test chimpanzees' capacity to sustain traditions, we seeded alternative tool use techniques in single individuals in different captive groups. One technique, 'Lift', spread in the group into which it was introduced and not in chimpanzees who saw no model or whose group was seeded with the alternative technique, 'Poke'. Poke was also not discovered by control animals tested individually. However, Poke emerged spontaneously in the Lift group and became dominant in both groups, regardless of the founder's Lift or Poke technique. Accordingly, this study demonstrated a statistically significant, differential spread of alternative techniques through social learning, yet no clear separation of traditions, unlike an earlier study with a different population of chimpanzees. This difference may be attributable to prior experience with relevant tools. In further experiments we investigated the basis of the social learning evident in acquisition of the Lift technique, using 'ghost' conditions in which the task was operated automatically rather than by a chimpanzee. Differential movement of the feeding device either by itself or with the tool coupled to it was not sufficient for learning to occur. It appears necessary for a chimpanzee to observe another chimpanzee performing the Lift technique for transmission to ensue. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Both sexes of the turquoise-browed motmot, Eumomota superciliosa, display their long-racketed tail in an exaggerated side-to-side wag display in two contexts. In the. rst, the wag display is performed in the presence of predators (predator-elicited wag display), and evidence supports the hypothesis that the signal functions as a pursuit-deterrent signal (Murphy 2006, Behavioral Ecology, 17, 547-553). In the second, the wag display is performed in the apparent absence of predators immediately before feeding nestlings ( prefeeding wag display). I tested four hypotheses on the adaptive significance of the prefeeding wag display: ( 1) a dishonest, preemptive, pursuit-deterrent signal given in case predators are present; ( 2) a nonfunctional mis. re of the predator-elicited wag display; ( 3) a signal that alerts nestlings to the delivery of food; ( 4) a sexually selected signal that advertises parental quality to potential mates. There was no support for the hypotheses that the prefeeding wag display was directed to nestlings or potential mates. The wag display was generally performed where nestlings could not detect the signal and the display did not vary with the sex of the displaying bird, the presence of the mate, or the size of the food carried in the signaller's bill. Evidence presented in this paper is most consistent with the hypothesis that the predator-elicited wag display and the prefeeding wag display are performed as a response to the presence or the potential presence of a predator. I discuss the possibility that the prefeeding wag display functions as a dishonest, pursuit-deterrent signal. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The costs of providing care to offspring and how these costs influence individual allocation of resources to current and future reproduction are likely to be important in the evolution of cooperative breeding. We reduced the costs of offspring care experimentally in 12 groups of cooperatively breeding carrion crows, Corvus corone corone, by providing supplementary food throughout the breeding season. Neither nonbreeders nor breeders from supplemented territories significantly increased their levels of provisioning effort. However, unfed crows lost more weight than fed crows and, in contrast to fed crows, lost weight in relation to provisioning effort. Furthermore, breeders decreased their provisioning rates in groups with more than three caregivers, supporting both the idea that provisioning chicks is costly and the conclusion that crows invest in self-maintenance rather than in the current brood when costs are reduced.

AB Individual recognition via vocalizations is key to reproductive success in many species. We explored individual recognition and call discrimination in Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus, through several playback experiments. By using two call types in multiple social contexts, we demonstrate, for the first time in a Spheniscus species, that adults and chicks can discriminate between conspecific calls. We played male ecstatic display calls, including calls of a neighbour, stranger and mate, to incubating females and, later, played this same set of calls to their mates. Females responded more strongly to ecstatic display calls of mates versus neighbours; and strangers but did not discriminate between calls of neighbours and strangers. Males showed no difference in response to their own ecstatic display calls and those of neighbours and strangers. We also played mutual display calls of mated pairs and stranger pairs to both pair members during incubation and, later, to their unattended chicks. Reaction to mutual display calls for both sexes was similar, showing a significantly stronger response to their own mutual display call than to that of a stranger pair. Chicks responded more strongly to the mutual display call of their parents than to that of a stranger pair. Few playback experiments consider experimental and ecological factors that might affect playback results. We found several ecological factors that correlated strongly with response to strength: longer-mated females responded less strongly to their mate's call, males responded more strongly later in the season, and chicks responded less strongly at higher temperatures.

AB Males of many species have alternative mating behaviours and must make decisions about which behaviours to use to maximize reproductive success. Guppies, Poecilia reticulata, have two alternative mating behaviours: display behaviour, which facilitates female choice, and sneak mating, a form of sexual coercion, which circumvents female choice. The choice of which behaviour to use and the circumstances in which behaviours are used can be potentially costly to both sexes. We examined the influence of variation in water velocity on male mating behaviour in nature and in controlled laboratory conditions in which we were able to control for male size. We first examined whether males use alternative behaviour when subjected to changes in water velocity and then whether females have the potential to ameliorate male harassment by moving to high water velocities where the smaller males may be excluded. Females preferentially used higher available water velocities than males and mating activity decreased with increasing water velocity. However, at high water velocities males switched from displays to sneak mating behaviour, the behaviour type that most opposes female interests. Females thus have the potential to reduce, but not entirely escape, the detrimental effects of this sexual conflict by moving to high water velocities.

AB Research has shown that the wax combs are important in the acquisition of colony odour in the honeybee, Apis mellifera. However, many of these studies were conducted in the laboratory or under artificial conditions. We investigated the role of the wax combs in nestmate recognition in the natural context of bees at colony entrances. Wax combs constructed by each experimental colony were swapped between hives and the acceptance of nestmate and non-nestmate forager workers was recorded before and after the swap, and in relation to a control hive not involved in the swap. We conducted the experiment twice, in consecutive years with three different colonies each time. Colonies that exchanged combs became more accepting of each other's workers than of workers from the third colony. The overall acceptance of comb swap non-nestmates increased significantly from 3% before the swap to 23% after the swap in the first year, and from 8 to 47% in the second year. This effect wore off within 3 weeks. Chemical analyses showed that the cuticular profile of non-nestmates involved in the experimental comb swap became more similar to each other after the swap, and that acceptance by guards of bees from different hives was negatively correlated with chemical distance between the hydrocarbon profiles of the workers from different hives.

AB A large number of coloured sexually selected ornamental traits in the animal kingdom are based on carotenoid and melanin pigments. The biochemical differences between these two classes of pigment, together with their different physiological roles, have led to the general belief that there will be a fundamental difference in the way in which they are used in animal signals. Specifically, it has been argued that carotenoid-based colours will have higher levels of condition dependence and that melanin-based traits will be under tighter genetic control. We present a meta-analysis of studies that have experimentally investigated the signalling quality of the two kinds of colour in birds and show that there is no evidence of a difference between them. Furthermore, we show that the available data are currently very limited, both in the number of studies and in the quality of many of the studies that have attempted to examine this question, and we suggest directions for future work.

AB We aimed to identify chemical properties of plant species that correlate with their palatability, quantify a common currency of forage for the western grey kangaroo, Macropus fuliginosus, and test the impact of frequency of occurrence on food selection. Of 24 plant species exposed to kangaroos, those high in salts and tannins were avoided, whereas those high in acid-digestible fibre were often favoured; protein content was not related to palatability. We then performed cafeteria tests with two captive and semiwild populations. Food pellets contained additional fructose, NaCl, citric acid or tannins. We also used energy-enhanced and balanced control pellets. Despite wide geographical separation, the kangaroo populations expressed the same eating patterns. High-energy pellets were preferred. When these were removed, fructose (an indicator of energy) assumed the most preferred rank. Our study affirms the tendency of herbivores to select flavours associated with high energy, suggesting that energy is important in determining a currency of forage for the western grey kangaroo. The 'deterrent substances', tannins and NaCl, were more likely to be eaten when rare. The high selection of the control diet, which was fed ad libitum throughout the study, may provide additional evidence that frequency of occurrence affects selectivity, favouring the common element when palatable, and the rare element when not palatable.

AB In aerial conflicts among territorial insects, injury costs are not obviously high and contestants cannot physically 'force the issue'. Resource-holding potential in these cases usually relates to morphological and/or biophysical determinants of flight performance and endurance rather than traditional parameters such as size and strength. However, success is sometimes related to body size. Males of the landmark-defending wasp Hemipepsis ustulata compete via elaborate noncontact aerial duels in which large individuals enjoy an advantage. We evaluated the hypothesis that size is important because of a correlation with high-performance flight. We used a residency manipulation to establish 92 escalated contests in which some individuals had the outer 16-18% of their forewings removed to reduce flight performance (independently of body size). Initial residents won most (78%) contests, but logistic analysis indicated that no other parameter, including size, wing treatment and age, could explain the pattern of contest outcome. Survival regression analysis implicated size, age and site location, but not wing treatment, as significant predictors of nonresident contest persistence. We also found evidence of assessment of relative body size. Since our wing treatment had no measurable effect, the importance of body size does not appear as an emergent property of a system in which contest ability is determined primarily by flight performance dynamics. We conclude that aerial contests in H. ustulata are mediated by complex multicomponent decision rules, in which contest role, relative body size, age and perception of resource value collectively determine a contestant's persistence time.

AB Recent behavioural studies on fish have emphasized the role of ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths in mate choice. We performed female mate choice experiments, focusing on the UV wavelength range, with the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a species in which the role of visually guided behaviour in the human-visible wavelength range (400-700 nm) has been well studied. Ripe female sticklebacks were given the opportunity to watch courting males behind UV-transmitting (UV+) and UV-blocking (UV-) optical filters. We tested the hypothesis that a difference in viewing conditions, manipulated by the two optical filters, would affect male attractiveness, as indicated by the time that the female stayed near the males. Females significantly preferred UV+ males. They also became less selective with time. Control experiments, in which neutral-density optical filters were used, showed that the ability to perceive UV wavelengths is likely to be used for colour discrimination instead of detecting brightness differences.

AB The arboreal eggs of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, are preyed on by social wasps, Polybia rejecta. Embryos hatch rapidly up to 30% before their typical undisturbed hatching age when attacked by wasps, so many embryos escape. We hypothesized that the escape ability of older embryos would reduce wasp foraging success or efficiency, and that wasps would therefore prefer to prey on younger eggs. To characterize wasp foraging abilities and preferences, we videotaped the behaviour of individual foragers at an outdoor feeding station. We presented wasps with pairs of clutches differing in age by 1 day, from newly laid versus 1 day through 4 versus 5 days. Eggs become competent to hatch at 4 days. Wasps foraged more efficiently and successfully on older eggs than on younger ones. Among not-yet-patchable clutches, wasps preferred older eggs, but there was no evidence for discrimination between late unhatchable eggs and hatchable eggs (3-5 days), and wasps readily attacked embryos likely to escape. The thick egg jelly of younger clutches makes it difficult for wasps to break into eggs. The poorly developed embryos also disintegrate easily, making them harder to carry. Thus, at least when wasps have experience with a range of egg stages, they kill few young eggs. Older eggs frequently escaped by hatching, so the heaviest mortality fell on intermediate developmental stages, both at the feeding station and at a natural breeding site. Structural variation in egg clutches and developmental changes in embryos may affect interactions between other small, mobile predators and amphibian eggs.

AB The Tamesi molly is an unusual molly species because it has features of both shortfin and sailfin mollies. Morphologically, it is classified as a shortfin species, yet phylogenetic evidence and observations of male courtship behaviour indicate that it should be classified as a sailfin molly. We characterized the mating behavioural profiles of dark and silver male P. latipunctata by varying the competitive environment (presence or absence of male competitors) and the degree of female receptivity (unreceptive versus receptive females), both factors known to increase rates of courtship displays in sailfin species. We measured rates of three mating behaviours: courtship displays, gonoporal nibbles and gonopodial thrusts (forced insemination attempts) under both types of competitive and female receptivity conditions. Rates of courtship displays were strongly influenced by female receptive state; both dark and silver males elevated their rates of courtship displays in the presence of receptive females in either competitive environment. In addition, the influence of competition for mates (presence of a competitor) had a stronger effect on the courtship display rates of dark males, but only in the presence of receptive females; courtship display rates were almost eight times higher for dark males when at least one female in the social group was receptive (<= 24 h postpartum). These results suggest that dark males actively compete for receptive females by increasing their reliance on courtship, a behavioural response clearly characteristic of other sailfin molly species.

   RECOGNITION; VIRILIS
AB Animals use sensory information when making decisions regarding social status. In particular, crayfish use chemical and possibly mechanical signals to communicate past social history and status. These signals originate in the urine that is actively released during agonistic encounters. We examined the transfer of social information via chemical and mechanical signals by using (1) neutrally buoyant particles, along with a projected light sheet to visualize flow generation, (2) a fluorescent dye to observe urine release and (3) a unique combination of the two techniques to quantify the roles of urine and current generation during agonistic bouts. Both dominant and subordinate crayfish generated currents and appeared to use them to send and sample signals, but dominant crayfish generated more frequent currents than subordinates. Alterations in currents and behaviours suggest that currents are used to transfer social information. Dominant animals released urine during an encounter more frequently than subordinates, and usually did so while engaged with an opponent. In addition, when urine was released, it was transported within these self-generated currents. However, urine was not released every time a current was generated, making urine release relatively rare compared to current generation. A correlation of urine releases with current generation and agonistic behaviours appears to be an indicator for eventual dominant-subordinate relationships. Dominant crayfish showed agonistic behaviours more often when releasing urine. Consequently, chemical signalling influenced a fight opponent's behaviour.

AB Begging by nestlings can prove costly, either through energy expenditure if food-bearing parents are not present, or through increased predation risk. Therefore, parents may provide cues to modulate begging. We investigated responses of 7-day old nestlings of eastern phoebes, Sayornis phoebe, and red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, to various adult calls. Phoebes begged strongly to playback of conspecific food calls but not to other vocal stimuli, and only weakly to manual stimulation. They had no specific response to phoebe alarm calls. We suggest that phoebe alarms, which were given mainly when a partner was nearby, at both egg and chick stages, function primarily to warn mates. Red-winged blackbirds begged most readily to manual stimulation and ceased begging, and crouched, specifically to conspecific alarm calls. Therefore, in phoebes begging is 'switched on', and in red-winged blackbirds it is 'switched off', by parental calls. We suggest that for species like red-winged blackbirds, which nest on flexible substrates, nestlings readily beg to vibrational cues such as nest movement, so parent alarms are important to switch off begging at inappropriate times. For species like phoebes, which nest on rigid substrates, food calls induce begging in the absence of vibrational stimuli, and may replace the need for alarm calls to nestlings. The marked differences seen in these hosts of the brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater, raises the question of whether nestlings of this generalist brood parasite can eavesdrop on such diversity in host cues, a problem we address in our companion paper.

AB The social cohesion hypothesis of play asserts that the adaptive function of social play is to strengthen affiliative ties between group members, thereby increasing cohesion within the social group. Although this hypothesis is frequently cited, it has never been quantitatively tested. I used data collected from a wild population of cooperative mongoose (the meerkat, Suricata suricatta) to test four predictions arising from the hypothesis: first, that an individual's frequency of play, and mean number of play partners, will be positively correlated with group size (because individuals in large groups must strengthen ties with a greater number of animals); second, an individual's frequency of play will be positively related to frequency of other affiliative interactions such as allogrooming; third, an individual's frequency of play will be positively correlated with level of contribution to cooperative group activities (based on the assumption that individuals that are closely bonded to their group will invest more heavily in the group than those with weak ties); and finally, an individual's frequency of play will be positively correlated with duration of tenancy in the natal group. The behaviour of young meerkats failed to fulfil any of these predictions, and I conclude that social play is unlikely to have the capacity to promote social cohesion in mammals.

AB I conducted a 3-year study investigating parentage in a Costa Rican population of white-throated magpie-jays, a cooperatively breeding corvid inhabiting the tropical dry forests of Central America. This species is unusual among avian cooperative breeders in that helpers are mostly females. Using 12 microsatellite loci, I estimated parentage for 110 offspring in 32 broods and eight social groups. Primary breeders were not the sole producers of offspring within a brood. At the 95% confidence level, female helpers within the group produced 16% of young, and floater males sired approximately 30% of young. Helpers that bred mated either with the primary male (three cases) or with floaters (five cases). When the analysis was limited to the most reliable data, the 20 nests and 63 offspring where all candidate mothers had been sampled, at the 95% confidence level only one helper produced young, while floater males sired 22% of offspring. The results of this study cast doubt on the simple classification of white-throated magpie-jays as cooperative breeders and suggest a more complex combination of cooperative and parasitic behaviours.

AB Wild turkeys, Meleagris gallopavo, are among the most ornamented birds in North America, displaying vividly coloured fleshy ornaments on their heads and bright, iridescent structural coloration in their plumage. We investigated the effect of experimental inoculation with coccidian parasites on the expression of iridescent structural coloration in yearling male turkeys. Prior to moult of ornamental feathers, we assigned turkeys to three experimental groups: we maintained six turkeys free of coccidial infection, inoculated four turkeys with a single species of coccidial oocvsts, and inoculated six turkeys with multiple species of coccidial oocysts. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify the plumage coloration of wing covert and breast feathers in the breeding plumage of males in each treatment protocol. We found significant treatment-based variation in the iridescent plumage coloration of yearling male turkeys such that infected males showed proportionately less UV reflectance in their wing covert and breast feathers and had duller breast feathers. This is the first experimental evidence that parasites can suppress the expression of structural plumage coloration, and our findings suggest that, in wild turkeys, iridescent coloration could serve as a condition-dependent signal of male health.

AB Ant larvae may increase their fitness by trying to increase their food intake, since adult morphology and quality depend on nutritional conditions during juvenile development. As larvae are legless and dependent upon workers, some sort of begging signal can be expected. We studied larval begging behaviour in the ant Gnamptogenys striatula. Workers preferentially fed larvae that were either near the food or performed a typical swaying behaviour. In this swaying behaviour, larvae raised their head and neck, and gently reached and waved towards workers or food items. Swaying duration was not, however, correlated with distance to food. In a separate experiment, hung larvae swayed more than well-fed larvae, suggesting that swaying is an important element of begging for food. Acquiring extra food through begging probably allows G. striatula larvae to manipulate their future reproductive options. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals often signal in communication network environments that include nonintended receivers that may constitute a risk to the signalling animals. Unpaired male songbirds, which sometimes intrude into neighbouring territories and interrupt courtship, may be an example of nonintended receivers of vocal courtship signals. We investigated this in the whitethroat, using dyads of unmated territorial males. Each dyad consisted of a resident male, who was part of the experimental treatment, and a neighbouring male, whose responses to the treatment stimuli were tested. Each dyad received two playback tyeatments: a courtship treatment in which the treatment male was induced to court a remotely controlled calling and jumping stuffed female, and a song duel treatment in which playbacks of male song were used to induce the focal male to countersing. The neighbours responded with more song flights to the courtship treatment than to the song duel treatment, perhaps to achieve an overview of the courtship activity or attract the female. Only the courtship treatment resulted in neighbouring intrusions and immediate chasing of the intruder by the treatment male. The males that suffered intrusions did not sing less than those that did not suffer intrusions. Reduced singing therefore may not be able to explain the intrusions. Every intrusion except one occurred after the first courtship vocalization, making it likely that the courtship per se caused the intrusions. This emphasizes the necessity of restricting the transmission range of courtship vocalizations in a network and therefore also explains why the courtship vocalizations of whitethroat males are relatively short ranging.

AB Male cricket frogs produce only one type of call, the advertisement call, which both attracts females and repels rival males. The temporal and spectral structure of this call varies in a graded fashion with social context: males increase the temporal complexity and decrease the dominant frequency of their advertisement calls when interacting with neighbouring males. Previous studies of male behaviour suggested that vocal escalation signals fighting ability or aggressive intent. In this study, we examined an alternative hypothesis for the function of vocal escalation, that it increases a male's relative attractiveness to females when other males are nearby. We tested female cricket frogs for phonotactic preferences with respect to spectral and temporal call characters. Females did not show preferences for call dominant frequency, although they tended to choose calls with dominant frequencies near the population mean over calls with high or low dominant frequencies. Females preferred temporal call characters representative of interacting males to the temporal characters of undisturbed males. Males may use changes in temporal call characters to facultatively increase their relative attractiveness to females in the presence of other males.

AB In male birds, the responsiveness of androgens to sexual and territorial behaviour is predicted to vary with mating system and the degree of paternal investment ('challenge hypothesis', CH; Wingfield et al. 1990, American Naturalist, 136, 829-846). The CH predicts a higher and longer lasting 'breeding baseline' androgen level in males of polygynous species with no or only short-term paternal investment than in males of monogamous species with a high degree of paternal investment. Since the applicability of the CH to nonavian vertebrates has been unclear, we experimentally tested its predictions in several cichlid fish (Neolamprologus pulcher, Lamprologus callipterus, Tropheus moorii, Pseudosimochromis curvifrons and Oreochromis mossambicus) using a simulated territorial intruder protocol. Androgens (11-ketotestosterone: 11-KT; testosterone: T) were measured from fish-holding water. In all species sampled, the 11-KT patterns confirmed the predictions of the CH originating from the avian literature, but T patterns did not. Males of all species sampled were highly responsive to territorial intrusions; however, the magnitude and duration of this response, that is, the rapid return to baseline 11-KT levels, could not clearly be explained by the degree of paternal care. 11-KT responses to interactions with ovulating females were observed in maternal mouthbrooders but not in biparental species (e.g. Lamprologini). At the interspecific level, androgen responsiveness was greater among males of monogamous species, as predicted, but also in species with more intense pair bonding (e.g. Tropheus moorii). Thus, this study confirms the predictions of the CH in cichlid fish at both the intraspecific and the interspecific levels. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We tested several alternative hypotheses about the function of scent marking by the North American river otter, Lontra canadensis. Otters may mark at latrine sites with spraints (faeces) to (1) signal species identity, (2) advertise their reproductive status, (3) establish and maintain territories, and (4) communicate social status and identity to group members. Olfactory preference tests were conducted at the Alaska Sealife Center in Seward, Alaska, on a group of 15 wild-caught male otters in February 1999. We found that male otters investigated otter scent more than sealion faeces. The male otters also showed a preference for male scent over the scent of anoestrous females. No preference for the scent of unfamiliar males, compared with the scent of familiar males, was observed, and no preference for the scent of close kin was detected. However, an investigation of dominant relationships of the captive otters showed that dominant males spent more time investigating male scent than did subordinate males. Thus, spraints deposited at latrine sites may function to communicate social status of males. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social dominance is intuitively assumed to be associated with higher fitness, because social dominance implies better access to resources. We found that, in a colony of jackdaws, the dominant males consistently produced fewer fledglings, which had lower chances of survival to 1 year of age. Laying date and clutch size were independent of dominance, but females that mated with dominant males were in poorer condition and laid smaller eggs. Parental survival was independent of social dominance, and the frequency of extrapair fertilizations in jackdaws is negligible. Dominance was a stable trait of individuals, and not a state that all individuals eventually attained. We conclude that, in this colony, dominant jackdaws had lower fitness. To our knowledge, this is the first example of such a pattern in a free-living species. We hypothesize that the high density of our colony resulted in high testosterone titres, which suppressed paternal care of mate and offspring to the extent that it outweighed the benefits of higher resource access.

AB Driven by competition and mate choice, size-assortative mating has been seen in many organisms. The breeding system of salmonid fish, Oncorhynchus spp., has been extensively investigated and many examples of size-assortative mating have been found. However, assortative mating is not always observed and many reported examples involved cases with a large dichotomy in size classes or were conducted in artificial arenas where other factors influencing mate choice and competition were controlled. This study investigated size-assortative mating in a population of naturally reproducing pink salmon, O. gorbuscha. We made direct observations of courtship behaviour over 3 years on fish of known sizes. To determine the extent to which these observations corresponded to reproductive success, we assessed the parentage of the offspring produced by the fish in the first 2 years of the study using DNA fingerprinting. Size-assortative mating was not seen in the behavioural observations. Parentage results showed that our measure of dominance (proximity of males to ripe females) corresponded with successful matings, suggesting that the fish that we observed as dominant were in fact involved in more matings or more successful matings. We also saw no size-assortative mating in male and female pairs that produced adult offspring. We are not suggesting that the processes that can lead to size-assortative mating are not occurring, but that many other factors, such as female ripeness, male availability, predation threat and changing environmental conditions, may minimize the importance or mask the occurrence of size-assortative mating under natural conditions.

AB Acquiring and storing information in memory is constrained by the limited capacity of attentional and short-term memory systems. Therefore, processes that prioritize information for storage in memory according to its survival value to the organism are likely to have evolved. Information incurring energy or time costs to acquire, or if forgotten, should be stored and retrieved more effectively than information that is less costly to acquire or forget. We manipulated the costs of acquiring and forgetting information in an eight-arm radial maze memory task for pigs, Sus scrofa, by placing ropes at the entrance to arms, which pigs had to walk over incurring an extra 2-3-s time cost for each arm entry. Each day each pig (N = 16) made a sampling visit to the maze to find food in four arms, followed by a 10-min retention interval, and a recall visit in which visits to the four previously empty arms were reinforced. Baited arms were varied daily. Pigs were divided into four groups and exposed to ropes (costs) either during sampling only, recall only, both or neither. Exposure to costs during sampling visits decreased errors during recall visits. This was probably the result of enhanced attention to and encoding of information during sampling. When all groups were performing equally well, retroactive interference treatments revealed hidden differences between them. Groups experiencing costs during recall tests were least susceptible to interference effects, probably because of more considered use of retrieved information. Both memory encoding and retrieval processes may thus be modulated by even small costs of obtaining or forgetting information. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Traits that enhance attractiveness in one sex may or may not influence attractiveness in the other. In the dark-eyed junco, Junco hyemalis, outer tail feathers of males and females are all or partly white and form a sharp contrast with the bird's mostly grey plumage. The amount of white in these feathers ('tail white') is greater in males than in females and, as we report here, is greater in birds that have completed a second prebasic moult than in yearlings. During courtship, male juncos spread their tails, revealing their tail white, and a previous experiment has shown that males with experimentally enhanced tail white are more attractive to females. To determine whether females with experimentally enhanced tail white would be preferred by males, we clipped and replaced tail feathers of females, creating a control group with low to natural levels of tail white and an enhanced group with high levels. We tested preference in a mate choice apparatus like that used previously and found that males courted both control and enhanced females and displayed individual preferences but showed no collective preference for members of either category of females. Because we found neither a preference for trait values that indicate greater age/experience (experimentally enhanced females) nor a preference for less male-like appearance (control females), our results are inconsistent with a role for male mate choice in the maintenance of tail white in females. Female tail white may be subject to selection in another context or persist owing to a genetic correlation between the sexes. Regardless, the sexes apparently prefer different trait values, which suggests that preferences are expressed independently in males and females.

AB I developed two versions of the twin threshold model (TTM) to assess risk-sensitive foraging decisions by rufous hummingbirds. The model incorporates energy thresholds for both starvation and reproduction and assesses how three reward distributions with a common mean but different levels of variance interact with these critical thresholds to determine fitness. Fitness, a combination of survival and reproduction, is influenced by both the amount of variance in the distributions and the relative position of the common mean between the thresholds. The model predicts that risk-intermediate foraging is often the optimal policy, and that risk aversion is favoured as the common mean of the distributions approaches the starvation threshold, whereas risk preference is favoured as the common mean approaches the reproduction threshold. Tests with free-living hummingbirds supported these predictions. Hummingbirds were presented with three distributions of nectar rewards that had a common mean but Nil, Moderate or High levels of variance. Birds preferred intermediate levels of variance (Moderate) when presented with all three rewards simultaneously, and became more risk-averse as the mean of the distributions was decreased but more risk-prone as the mean was increased. Birds preferred Nil when it was paired with Moderate or with High, but preferred Moderate in the presence of Nil and High together. This reversal of preference is a violation of regularity, conventionally interpreted as irrational choice behaviour. I provide an alternative version of the TTM demonstrating that violations of regularity can occur when relative instead of absolute evaluation mechanisms are used.

AB Differences in the relative contributions of individual helpers to cooperative activities in vertebrate societies are sometimes interpreted as evidence of functional specialization and have been compared with the incipient subcaste systems found in some social insects. However, it is not yet clear whether some helpers specialize in particular tasks throughout their life span or whether variation in cooperative behaviour represents a temporary, age-related polyethism. We describe the development of cooperative behaviour in female helpers in meerkats, Suricata suricatta, an obligately cooperative mammal where young produced by the dominant female are reared by up to 30 helpers. Using a combination of field experiments and long-term records of the development of individuals, we investigated whether particular helpers specialize in particular activities. In the first year of life, variation in body weight affected overall levels of involvement in cooperative behaviour as well as relative contributions to different activities, generating contrasting activity profiles between light and heavy helpers. However, the effects of body weight disappeared by the second year of life, and individual differences in foraging success became the principal factor affecting contributions to cooperative behaviour. Contributions to different cooperative activities were positively correlated across individuals, with some helpers consistently contributing more than others to all cooperative activities. Our study provides no evidence that meerkat helpers specialize in particular cooperative activities. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The evolution of migration in an animal population produces a suite of physiological, behavioural and cognitive adaptations. Migratory birds, in particular, require the ability to return annually to breeding and wintering sites after long journeys, and thus might be predicted to have evolved enhanced spatial memory. In a comparison of two sparrow subspecies that co-occur in winter, the migratory subspecies (dark-eyed junco, Junco hyemalis hyemalis) performed better than the nonmigratory subspecies (J. h. carolinensis) on a room-scale spatial memory test. The migratory juncos also had more densely packed hippocampal neurons than did nonmigrants. Among nonmigrants, we looked for hippocampal differences between birds that occupied two home ranges annually and those that remained on their breeding territory year-round, to determine whether migration, per se, is related to neuroanatomical differences. However, we were unable to reach any conclusions because of low statistical power. A denser hippocampus could be the basis for better spatial memory in migrant juncos. Further testing of spatial memory on a landscape scale is needed to strengthen this argument and to understand cognitive differences between migrants and nonmigrants.

TI Attractiveness of sand hoods built by courting male fiddler crabs,
   <i>Uca musica</i>:: test of a sensory trap hypothesis
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Courting male fiddler crabs, Uca musica, sometimes build sand hoods at the entrances of their burrows to which they attract females for mating. On average, females visit 17 males in as many minutes before they choose a mate, and they preferentially visit males with hoods. When moving between burrows, fiddler crabs of both sexes sometimes approach and temporarily hide against objects on the surface. Hence, mate-searching females may approach hoods because they resemble (mimic) other objects that crabs approach to reduce their predation risk. We conducted two experiments to test this sensory trap hypothesis. First, we determined whether sexually receptive and nonreceptive female U. musica and nonreceptive female U. stenodactylus, a species that does not build structures, spontaneously approach hoods (replicas), stones, pieces of wood and shells. As predicted by the sensory trap hypothesis, both species, irrespective of sexual receptivity, approached these objects and neither preferred hoods. Second, to determine whether female U. musica show a preference for hoods when they search for a mate, we recorded the frequency with which females approached males with natural hoods, hood replicas, wood, stones and shells. Again as expected, females approached males with these different structures at the same rates. We conclude that hoods are effective mimics of objects that females approach for safety whether they are searching for a mate or not. Males benefit by using this sensory trap because hoods make them more attractive, and receptive females may benefit when they approach hoods because they reduce their mate-search risk.

AB Acoustic communication is important for determining and maintaining intermale spacing in breeding aggregations of anurans and insects. Because the number and proximity of signalling males can show extensive temporal and spatial variation, we should expect to find mechanisms that permit males to modify their signalling behaviour in ways that balance the needs to attract females and defend their calling space. We conducted two field playback experiments to investigate the role of plasticity in male aggressive signalling in intermale spacing of spring peepers (Anura, Hylidae). In the first experiment, we found a positive correlation between the amplitude of the advertisement calls of a male's nearest neighbour and the stimulus amplitude at which the male first produced aggressive calls. In the second experiment, repeated presentations of advertisement calls above a male's aggressive threshold resulted in rapid decreases in aggressive signalling and significant, but temporary, elevations of aggressive thresholds. We suggest that short-term habituation to a neighbour's calls could function as a proximate mechanism for plasticity in aggression that would allow males to accommodate nearby callers while also tracking fluctuations in the local density of calling individuals. In a third experiment, we examined female choice as an ultimate-level explanation for plasticity in male aggression. Females preferred advertisement calls to aggressive calls, but this preference was weak and was abolished by a 6-dB reduction in the amplitude of the advertisement call. We suggest that female preferences probably function as only one possible source of selection on plasticity in male aggressive signalling and propose energetic limitations as an additional source of selection.

AB It has been suggested that prothonotary warblers, Protonotaria citrea, respond adaptively to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, even though they lack historical habitat and range overlap with cowbirds. I studied behaviours functioning as potential defences against brood parasitism in the prothonotary warbler, a cavity-nesting host species. Opening sizes preferred by prothonotary warblers were not small enough to exclude cowbirds, and warblers were parasitized heavily in nests with larger openings. Male and female prothonotary warblers were always away from their nests before sunrise when cowbirds laid eggs in their nests. Prothonotary warblers infrequently (similar to6% of 560 nests) deserted nests that were parasitized during the egg-laying period, but frequently (56% of 151 nests) deserted nests that were parasitized before a female warbler laid her first egg. Prothonotary warblers also deserted 60-70% of nests where a cowbird egg, warbler egg or die were experimentally added before egg laying. However, the experimental addition of one of these three objects during the egg-laying period did not elicit desertion. The desertion of parasitized nests was not affected by nest site availability as has been reported elsewhere in the literature. This lack of a response to brood parasitism by prothonotary warblers may be an example of evolutionary lag, because it is likely that they have only recently been exposed to widespread parasitism, and they accept parasitism at a high cost to their own reproductive success.

AB During competitive encounters protagonists are expected to use signals of individual quality particularly if there is a risk of injury or death. Lateral presentation of body profile, by which information regarding phenotypic characteristics associated with individual quality are displayed, may represent such a strategy. During aggressive interactions, male fallow deer frequently engage in parallel walking which is assumed to represent a mutual display of quality, as mediated by exposure of the maximal profile of the body or antlers. We examined the context and role of the parallel walk during competitive encounters to investigate whether there was evidence that dyads of competing males were assessing differences in phenotypic characteristics. There was no evidence to support the hypotheses that the parallel walk is a lateral display of body size or weaponry or that its use is associated with a reduced level of escalated or risky behaviours during fighting. Total time spent fighting was not shorter when a parallel walk was present than when there was no parallel walk. The parallel walk was highly associated with fighting and it was more likely to be initiated by the subsequent loser. Furthermore, parallel walking frequently followed bouts of fighting and as such may represent a strategy that permits an animal the opportunity to decide whether to continue fighting. Parallel walking was also associated with a failure to resolve contests in favour of one animal indicating that it may be a means of withdrawing from further fighting without incurring a loss in dominance status.

AB The ability to recognize and respond to predators often has a learned component, but few studies have examined the role of social learning in the development of antipredator behaviour. We investigated whether wild-caught juvenile guppies, Poecilia reticulata, from a low-predation river in Trinidad increase their response towards a novel predator through association with conspecifics from a high-predation river. We assigned fish to one of three treatment groups: (1) repeated exposure to a model accompanied by high-predation conspecifics; (2) repeated exposure to a model with low-predation conspecifics; (3) a control group in which focal fish interacted with high-predation fish in the absence of the model. Guppies trained with high-predation, but not low-predation, 'demonstrators' significantly improved their antipredator behaviour (spent more time schooling and inspected the model from further away). The guppies assigned to the control group showed no significant improvement in antipredator behaviour after the training period, suggesting that association with experienced conspecifics in the absence of the model is not sufficient to enhance the antipredator behaviour of naive fish. We conclude that guppies can improve their antipredator behaviour through association with more experienced conspecifics in the presence of visual cues simulating high predation risk.

Birds allowed a 5-min preview of the surrounding landscape prior to release home faster than those denied access to such cues, suggesting that recognition is visually mediated. We examined this phenomenon further by asking how memory generated through prior experience with a site is used in recognition. We provided a group of homing pigeons with training experience in which they viewed, through a single transparent vertical face of an otherwise opaque release box, an approximately 140degrees segment of the landscape for 5 min before release. Training previews were always given from consistent locations and orientations within a release site. Test releases that followed were used to ascertain whether subsequent site recognition necessitated previewing from this already familiar angle and distance, or whether the skill could be extended to novel, nonoverlapping lateral views of the landscape. The results suggested that homing performance was better after presentation of the view recapitulating that seen during training than after showing a novel alternative view. Pigeons may have been using a template of the arrangement of familiar landmarks around the release site as the cue for recognition. The effect, however, disappeared after repeated training, suggesting that repeated release from a site may allow for more extensive visual survey and the memorization of detailed features of the landscape or the extraction of site-specific general features that aid recognition even when a novel view is presented.

AB Male and female juvenile budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, were allowed to observe a conspecific demonstrator using its beak to remove one of two distinctively coloured objects (i.e. a blue and a black stopper) from a hole in the lid of a box and eating seed from within. Both objects could be removed by either pulling up or pushing down. When subsequently allowed access to both stoppers, and rewarded with food for all removal responses, regardless of the object to which they were made and their direction, observer birds removed both stoppers in the same direction as their demonstrator. This effect was present on the first occasion when observers removed a stopper, and persisted over at least 24 trials. Female observers made more removal responses than males, but conspecific observation had equivalent effects on direction of responding in males and females. All observers tended to approach the same object as their demonstrator when the objects were discriminable using both spatial and colour cues, but not when they differed in colour alone. Contrary to previous findings, these results suggest that robust behavioural matching effects can be obtained in budgerigars, and that these birds are capable of motor imitation or emulation.

ID SOCIAL SEGREGATION; DEER; SHEEP
AB Sexual segregation is common in ungulates and some social mammals but its causes are still poorly understood. We developed an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model to test whether sexual differences in activity could lead to sexual segregation. In our model, males and females differed only in their propensity to switch from an active to a passive state and vice versa, with males being more reluctant to get up and more ready to lie down than the more active females, or vice versa. The only factor in our model that affected sexual segregation was the sexual difference in the propensity to switch from an active to a passive state and vice versa. As differences in activity budgets increased, the degree of sexual segregation increased. Sexual segregation reached a peak when sexual differences in activity budgets were greatest. This high level of segregation remained, even when animals were programmed to adjust their activity to other animals in their vicinity. Our results verify the logic of the activity budget hypothesis that sexual differences in time spent active (grazing, walking) versus passive (lying, ruminating) can, in principle, result in sexual segregation. However, this does not exclude alternative mechanisms. Our model could also be applied to any social animal foraging in groups. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Parents should vary their level of investment in sons and daughters in response to the fitness costs and benefits accrued through male and female offspring. I investigated brood sex ratio biases and parental provisioning behaviour in the brown thornbill, Acanthiza pusilla, a sexually dimorphic Australian passserine. Parents delivered more food to male-biased than female-biased broods. However, factors determining parental provisioning rates differed between the sexes. Female provisioning rates were related to brood sex ratio in both natural and experimental broods with manipulated sex ratios. In contrast, male provisioning rates were not affected by brood sex ratio in either natural or experimental broods. However, males in established pairs provisioned at a higher rate than males in new pairs. Data on the sex ratio of 109 broods suggest that female brown thornbills adjust their primary sex ratio in response to pair bond duration. Females in new pairs produced broods with significantly fewer sons than females in established pairs. This pattern would be beneficial to females if the costs of rearing sons were higher for females in new than established pairs. This may be the case since females in new pairs provisioned experimental all-male broods at elevated rates. The condition of nestlings also tended to decline more in these all-male broods than in other experimental broods. This will have additional fitness consequences because nestling mass influences recruitment in thornbills. Female thornbills may therefore obtain significant fitness benefits from adjusting their brood sex ratio in response to the status of their pair bond.

   HIERARCHY; GEOMETRY; PRIMATES
AB When food finders are exploited by others, but cannot themselves switch to scrounging or leave their foraging group, other behavioural adaptations should be favoured. Tactical deception in primates and foraging at the periphery of the group in ground-feeding birds have been suggested as two such responses. We show that exploited individuals may also respond by adjusting their foraging behaviour to the concurrent behaviour of the scroungers. We investigated the foraging strategies of exploited subordinate domestic pigs, Sus scrofa. Pairs of pigs were tested in competitive foraging trials. We trained the subordinate pig in each pair to use a producing tactic in competitive pair trials by informing it about the location of hidden food during a preceding search trial in which it foraged alone. The dominant pig was naive about the food location in the competitive trials but able to displace the subordinate from the food source. We have shown previously that the dominants scrounged on their coforagers in these competitive trials by following them and displacing them from the food source. In the present study, logistic regression analyses show that the food-finding subordinates altered their foraging behaviour depending on the current behaviour of the dominants. Overall, the subordinates were more likely to show food-directed behaviour when the chances of arriving at the food source ahead of their exploiters were higher. The foraging behaviour of individual subordinates was related to their exploitation experience. Individuals subjected to higher exploitation pressure showed more varied strategies. These behavioural strategies are most simply interpreted as attempts by the exploited food finders to increase the time they can spend at the food source before the scroungers arrive.

   VOCALIZATIONS; PLASTICITY; BEHAVIOR
AB Male Pacific treefrogs, Hyla regilla, use advertisement and encounter calls in their reproductive communication. Encounter calls are produced when a male hears either advertisement or encounter calls at amplitudes that exceed his aggressive threshold for that call type, and they are believed to play a role in male spacing in a chorus. Aggressive thresholds of males for advertisement and encounter calls are plastic; males resume advertisement calling (i.e. accommodate) after repeated exposure to either advertisement or encounter calls that exceed their aggressive thresholds for that call type. Presentation of one call type does not elevate a male's aggressive threshold for the other call type, indicating that discrete neural 'channels' exist for processing advertisement versus encounter calls. Because these calls are spectrally highly similar, it is likely that they are differentiated in the central auditory system on the basis of their different temporal structure;: pulses are repeated in advertisement and encounter calls at rates of approximately 100 pulses/s and 30 pulses/s, respectively. The present study tested whether consecutive advertisement-type interpulse intervals (IPIs) are required to activate the filter for advertisement calls. Males were accommodated to synthetic stimuli that differed in the proportion of advertisement versus encounter IPIs. Aggressive thresholds of males for the encounter call and advertisement call (monophasic type) were elevated 450% and 58%, respectively, following accommodation to a stimulus that had nine of each IPI type, arranged in an alternating sequence. Aggressive thresholds for the monophasic advertisement call were elevated 151%, however, when males were accommodated with stimuli that had two sets of eight to nine consecutive advertisement IPIs; consistent with previous work, aggressive thresholds for the encounter call were not significantly elevated. Aggressive thresholds for the advertisement call are typically elevated approximately four-fold following accommodation with that call type. These findings are-consistent, therefore, with the hypothesis that several consecutive advertisement IPIs are required to activate the 'advertisement channel'; if consecutive advertisement IPIs were not required, the stimulus-that consisted of the same number of advertisement and encounter IPIs should have induced comparable elevations of the aggressive thresholds of males for advertisement and encounter calls. Selective filters for the advertisement call, therefore, appear to. integrate information across many consecutive 'correct' IPIs. This integration process may contribute to female's call preference.

AB Chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, tested monocularly on day 3 after hatching recognize familiar versus unfamiliar conspecifics and choose to approach one or other when they use the left eye, whereas they approach familiar and unfamiliar chicks at random when they use the right eye. In experiment I we investigated the effects of light exposure of embryos prior to hatching on this particular form of lateralization. Irrespective of whether they hatched from eggs incubated in the dark or from eggs exposed to light during the final days of incubation, chicks using the left eye had higher choice scores (meaning they chose to approach either a familiar or an unfamiliar chick) than chicks using the right eye or both eyes. Therefore, light experience prior to hatching did not influence the lateralization of individual recognition or choice behaviour, although it did affect latency to move out of, and time spent in, the centre of the runway. Experiment 2 showed that visual/social experience posthatching influences choice behaviour: chicks housed in a group in the light for 12 h on day 1 posthatching made a clear choice between familiar and unfamiliar chicks when tested on day 3, but chicks kept in a group in the dark on day 1 did not make a choice, instead alternating between the two stimuli. In experiment 3 we found that posthatching visual/social experience increased the choice scores of chicks using the right eye and thereby removed any lateralization of choice behaviour. The results suggest that visual experience of a social group is required before chicks using their right eye (and left hemisphere) will pay attention to the cues that distinguish one chick from another. Chicks using their left eye (and right hemisphere) recognize the difference between individuals without requiring visual experience with other chicks.

AB Friendly postconflict (PC) interactions between former opponents have been described for a large number of primate species held in captivity. We investigated conflict management behaviour for wild Hanuman langurs, Semnopithecus (Presbytis) entellus entellus, in India, using a large sample of over 6000 agonistic and affinitive interactions recorded in one one-male/multifemale troop and three all-male bands. We compared dyadic PC affinity with the dyadic baseline affinity during the overall observation time to minimize biases of traditional matched-control samples. PC affinity was recorded during only 15% of all dyads (immature male-immature male 0%, adult male-adult male 0%, adult male-immature male 5%, adult male-adult female 0%, adult female-adult female 42%). PC affinity is probably absent amongst males because their dominance relationships are strongly asymmetrical, leaving little room for emotional insecurity. Dyads among females, on the other hand, reflect frequent rank changes and close kinship which probably corresponds to higher levels of emotional uncertainty and greater need for PC affinity. Overall, PC affinity reached only 26% of the randomly expected value. Thus, the vast majority of langur monkey opponents avoided each other after conflicts. Avoidance as a low-cost option for group-living animals to cope with conflicts is often not possible in captivity. This suggests that reports of high rates of reconciliation may be at least partly-artefacts of captivity. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Objects in nature often have spatial and functional relationships with other objects. For example, fruit may be connected to tree branches, bushes sometimes function as landmarks for home, and stones are functionally associated with nuts when they are used to crack the nuts open. Although animals may use the spatial and functional relationships between specific objects, it is important for ethologists interested in cognitive mechanisms to ask whether animals understand the spatial relationship between objects in a more general and abstract way. In this experiment, we ask whether a small New World monkey, the cottontop tamarin, is capable of perceiving the abstract relational concept of 'connectedness'. Using a traditional operant paradigm, subjects were required to press one button to images with connected objects, and another button to images with separated objects. In Phase I of the experiment, subjects received training with only one connected and one separated image. Following training, probe images were presented in which features such as colour, texture and shape were systematically manipulated to determine which features were more important in stimulus classification. Accuracies and reaction times of responses were recorded. On the basis of their performance, the tamarins appeared to recognize that changes in the colour or texture of two objects plays no functional role in determining whether such objects are connected or separated. In contrast, changes in the shape and distance between two objects does play an important functional role, and the tamarins appeared to be sensitive to such changes. In Phase 2, subjects received training with a larger set of images. After this training, classification accuracy remained significantly above chance with most probes, suggesting that the tamarins had acquired a more general connectedness concept. In Phase 3, novel images were presented. Classification accuracy was significantly above chance for many of the novel images. Overall, results suggest that tamarins perceive spatial relationships between stimuli to some extent and can classify images based in part on their spatial relationship. Other recent experiments have shown that cottontop tamarins respond to spatial relationships even better than in the current experiment when they have to act directly on the objects. The difference between these results suggests that tamarins perceive the spatial relationships between objects more readily in the context of an ecologically valid problem. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Patas monkeys and many forest guenon species live in one-male groups throughout the year. During some conceptive seasons, extragroup males enter the troop singly or in small groups to copulate with females, although this multimale state persists only as long as the conceptive season lasts. Our goals in this study were to (1) examine how the number of males in the group affected levels of intrasexual mate competition in males and females, (2) identify the proximate factors accounting for changes from single- to multimale mating, and (3) develop a model comparing the proximate factors leading to single- and multimale mating in patas monkeys with those for forest guenons. We studied the copulatory patterns of 23 female and 11 male patas monkeys during three breeding seasons in Laikipia, Kenya, and used rates and patterning of mate guarding, copulation harassment and wounding as indices of intrasexual competition. We observed multimale mating during the 1995 conceptive season, and single-male mating during 1997 and 1998. We found that moderately strong intrasexual competition in males led to infrequent high-intensity encounters across all mating seasons, and that males competed to control access to groups of females year round. Female intrasexual competition for mates was low,, but slightly more vigorous during single-male mating seasons. Our model suggests that specific demographic and ecological conditions, combined with a single life history variable, interbirth interval, explain observed variation in mating systems of groups of patas monkeys and forest guenons.

AB Scent over-marking occurs when an animal places its scent mark directly on top of another individual's scent mark. However, situations may arise in which the top- and bottom-scent donors of an over-mark differ in an individual characteristic(s), for example, gonadal hormone titres. We tested the hypothesis that adult meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, preferentially respond to a gonadectomized donor treated with gonadal steroid hormones over a gonadectomized donor not treated with gonadal steroid hormones, independently of the position of the scent marks in an over-mark. Male meadow voles spent more time investigating the scent marks of gonadectomized females treated with oestradiol than that of gonadectomized females treated with no oestradiol, independently of the position of the two scent marks in the over-mark. Female voles spent more time investigating the scent marks of gonadectomized males treated with testosterone than that of gonadectomized males treated with no testosterone, only when the former males were the top-scent donors. These results suggest that male meadow voles appear to base their preference on the oestradiol titre of females, rather than the position of the female's mark in an over-mark. In contrast, female meadow voles appear to use both the position of the male's scent mark in an over-mark and the male's testosterone titre for the basis of their preference.

AB The question of whether animals navigate using 'map' information derived from one or more spatial gradients in the Earth's magnetic field has been debated for half a century. Although there is evidence that certain animals possess the sensory abilities necessary to perceive at least two magnetic components that vary spatially, there previously has been no direct test of the use of magnetic map information by experienced adult migrants. Magnetic information could provide information about an animal's geographic position along a single axis ('unicoordinate map') or could be part of a position-fixing system that provides positional information along two nonparallel axes ('bicoordinate map') with the second axis being derived from either magnetic or nonmagnetic cues. Here we report that adult eastern red-spotted newts, Notophthalmus viridescens, displaced approximately 45 km NNE of their home ponds oriented in the home direction when exposed either to the ambient magnetic field of the testing site, or to a 2 degrees increase in magnetic inclination (normally found further from the home ponds in the same general direction as the testing site). When exposed to a 2 degrees decrease in inclination resulting in a value that would normally be found on the other side of the home ponds from the testing site, however, newts reversed their direction of orientation. The same changes in magnetic inclination had no effect on shoreward magnetic compass orientation, which does not rely on map information. These findings provide support for two critical predictions of the magnetic map hypothesis, and suggest that information about geographic position along at least one axis relative to home may be derived from the magnetic field.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID PAPIO-URSINUS; MATE CHOICE; VOCALIZATIONS; COMPETITION; BEHAVIOR; CUES
AB In a wide variety of animal species, females produce vocalizations just before, during or immediately after copulation. These calls are thought to be sexually selected traits that function to incite males to compete for access to the calling females in such a way that, by calling, females maximize the quality and/or the number of their mating partners. The signalling of individual identity within these vocalizations; in conjunction with male discrimination between females on this basis, would have important implications for their function. I analysed the copulation calls of free-ranging yellow baboons, Papio cynocephalus cynocephalus, to examine whether sufficient acoustic cues existed to broadcast information on the individual identity of the caller. Discriminant function analysis indicated that calls could be assigned to the correct female with a high degree of accuracy, both when considering calls given throughout the menstrual cycle and also those given only during the period of likely conception (when the sexual swelling is at its largest). A playback experiment showed that consorting male baboons were able to discriminate the copulation call of their consort female from that of another cycling female. I: discuss the implications of individuality of female copulation calls and males' perception of this variability. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The study of how parents divide investment between sons and daughters has become one of the most popular areas of discussion in evolutionary biology. Trivers & Willard (1973, Science, 179, 90-92) suggested that the physical condition of the mother may influence whether she maximizes her lifetime reproductive success by biasing her investment towards sons or towards daughters. in this review I discuss the evidence for sex-biased maternal investment in primates. No consistent pattern emerges from data sets on sex differences in infant birth weights and growth rates, measures of nipple contact, and lengths of interbirth intervals with respect to maternal condition. Studies on birth sex ratios have also proven highly inconsistent. To test the Trivers & Willard hypothesis, information on birth sex ratios, sex-biased mortality before and after birth, and patterns of maternal care during prenatal and postnatal life are required in a single population. Currently, no such information is available for any one population of primates, and will be difficult to obtain, owing to the long life span and complexity of social interactions of primates. An additional difficulty of testing the Trivers & Willard hypothesis in primates is that it is hard to conceive of any empirical evidence that would disprove it as long as alternative adaptive explanations continue to be suggested for particular species and populations. A lack of correlation between maternal condition, birth sex ratio and maternal care could be interpreted as suggesting: that additional factors have been overlooked. Direct predictions from the theory are required. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID SEAWEED FLY; MATE CHOICE; SELECTION; BEHAVIOR; SIZE; EVOLUTIONARY;
   PREFERENCES; FEMALES
AB Measuring individual variation in mating behaviour is an integral part of studies of sexual selection and of considerable theoretical importance. Few studies, however, have examined individual variation in mating behaviour in a sexual conflict system and considered how individual variation influences the strength and consistency of the resulting sexual selection. We examined variation in mating behaviour of male and female pairs in the seaweed fly, Coelopa frigida. Sexual selection in seaweed flies occurs as a result of a sexual conflict over mating, with larger males generally able to overcome female rejection responses. We explored male and female mating conflicts and examined the variation in conflict outcomes within and between pairs. First, female willingness to mate was unaffected by short-term mating experience, allowing us to examine repeated interactions between a male and a female. Second, the outcomes of the sexual conflict over mating (copulation or rejection), and components of the mating interaction (number of copulations and time the male is mounted), were strongly repeatable. Third, the patterns of sexual selection on male size were consistent across mounts. Individual pairs consistently gave the same outcome to the mating conflict and yielded consistent sexual selection. Sexual conflict systems can thus be studied in the same way as those with more traditional forms of sexual selection and yield important insights into the links between variation in mating behaviour and sexual success.

AB We investigated kin discrimination of larvae by adult cannibalistic females in two specialist predaceous mite species. In dual choice tests, adult Phytoseiulus persimilis and P. macropilis females discriminated between related and unrelated larvae and preferentially preyed upon the latter. We found little variation among P. persimilis strains. Laboratory-reared, commercially mass-reared and field-collected females showed similar propensities to preferentially consume unrelated larvae. Due to the consistent trend in kin recognition and cannibalism among strains we dismiss that kin recognition was an artefact of rearing conditions. With respect to the production component of kin recognition, our study indicates genetic rather than environmental origin of the recognition label. Potential functional explanations for kin recognition and avoidance of kin cannibalism in the specialist predaceous mites P. persimilis and P, macropilis include epiphenomenon of species recognition, disease transmission and kin-selected behaviour. Because previous studies indicated that P. persimilis and P. macropilis do not discriminate between con- and heterospecific predaceous mites, we suggest that kin-selected behaviour is the most likely explanation. Eating related larvae may decrease the inclusive fitness of the cannibalistic female if there is an alternative way of obtaining nutrients (i.e. eating unrelated larvae). Furthermore, adult females may gain in inclusive fitness by releasing offspring from intraspecific competition for food and space and the potential threat of conspecific predators. Finally, we discuss the potential linkage between the evolution of kin recognition in specialist predaceous mites and the occurrence of aggregations of conspecific individuals.

AB Although diving birds and mammals can withstand extended periods under water, field studies show that most perform mainly short, aerobic dives. Theoretical studies of diving have implicitly assumed that prey acquisition increases linearly with time spent searching and have examined strategies that maximize time spent foraging. We present a simple model of diving in seals, where dive durations are influenced by the seal's assessment of patch quality, but are ultimately constrained by oxygen balance. Prey encounters within a dive are assumed to be Poisson distributed and the scale of the patches is such that a predator will encounter a constant prey density during a dive. We investigated the effects of a simple giving-up rule, using recent prey encounter rate to assess patch quality. The model predicts that, for shallow dives, there should always be a net benefit from terminating dives early if no prey are encountered early in the dive. The magnitude of the benefit was highest at low patch densities. The relative gain depended on the magnitude of the travel time and the time taken to assess patch quality and the effect was reduced in deeper dives. As the time taken to decide decreased, the relative benefit increased, up to a maximum, but fell as decision time was reduced further. Frequency distributions of different aspects of dive durations from three deep-diving and two shallow-diving seal species are presented and compared with the model's predictions.

AB We used radiotelemetry to investigate the time of migratory flight initiation relative to available celestial orientation cues and departure direction of a nocturnal passerine migrant, the reed warbler, Acrocephalus scirpaceus, during autumn migration. The study was carried out at Falsterbo, a coastal site in southwest Sweden. The warblers initiated migration from times well after local sunset and well into the night, corresponding to sun elevations between - 4 degrees and - 35 degrees, coinciding with the occurrence of stars at night. They departed in the expected migratory direction towards south of southwest with a few initiating migration in reverse directions towards northeast to east. Flight directions under overcast conditions (7-8/8) were more scattered than under dear sky conditions (0-4/8). There were fewer clouds on departure nights than on nights when the birds did not initiate migration. For birds staying longer than one night at stopover the horizontal visibility was higher and precipitation was less likely on departure nights than on the previous night. The results show that the visibility of celestial cues, and stars in particular, are important for the decision to initiate migration in reed warblers. However, cloud cover, horizontal visibility and precipitation might be correlated with other weather variables (i.e. wind or air pressure) that are also likely to be important for the decision to migrate.

AB We review geophagy, or soil ingestion, in primates. This behaviour is widespread and is presumed to be important to health and nutrition. Primates may engage in geophagy for one-or a combination of reasons. Here we present, and make a preliminary assessment of, six nonexclusive hypotheses that may contribute to the prevalence of geophagy. Four hypotheses relate to geophagy in alleviating gastrointestinal disorders or upsets: (1) soils adsorb toxins such as phenolics and secondary metabolites; (2) soil ingestion has an antacid action and adjusts the gut pH; (3) soils act as an antidiarrhoeal agent; and (4) soils counteract the effects of endoparasites. Two hypotheses pertain to geophagy in supplementing minerals and/or elements: (5) soils supplement nutrient-poor diets and (6) soils provide extra iron at high altitudes. In addition to these hypotheses, geophagy may satiate olfactory senses, serve as a famine food and finally may have no function at all. We draw together a large body of information from various sources to assess these hypotheses and suggest some tests to understand the function of geophagy. Our review suggests that primates engage in geophagy for a number of reasons that are nonexclusive. We conclude that mineral supplementation, adsorption of toxins, treatment of diarrhoea and pH adjustment of the gut seem the most plausible reasons why primates engage in geophagy.

AB Food allocation in many asynchronously hatching bird species favours large, competitively superior chicks. In contrast, food is usually distributed equally within broods of crimson rosellas, Platycercus elegans, implying that parents do not simply feed the most competitive chick. We used two temporary removal experiments to manipulate hunger of: (1) individual first- or last-hatched chicks, or (2) the whole brood. When only a single chick was hungry, parents compensated fully and chicks gained the same mass over the day as during controls. Mothers and fathers, however, responded in different ways to chick hunger. Mothers did not strongly alter their food allocation when a single chick was hungry, and controlled the distribution of food by refusing to feed first-hatched chicks when they were hungry and by moving more during feeds. In contrast, fathers allocated more food to hungry last-hatched chicks. When the whole brood was hungry, parents were unable to compensate chicks and all chicks lost mass over the day. In these conditions, mothers preferentially fed first-hatched chicks, while fathers fed all chicks equally. Our results show that both mothers and fathers were able to discriminate and selectively feed chicks, but that parents responded differently to changes in chick hunger within the brood. Fathers responded more strongly to variation in chick hunger within the brood, suggesting they reallocate food based on short-term changes in hunger. Mothers distributed food preferentially to last-hatched chicks except when the whole brood was hungry, when they switched to favouring first-hatched chicks. This pattern is consistent with a strategy of adaptive brood reduction when food is scarce. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   MORTALITY; MARES; HERD
AB On the assumption that infanticide exists in plains zebra, as reported for horses, Equus caballus, we tested the following hypothesis. Introducing a new zebra male into a herd of breeding females should increase foal mortality in comparison with herds in which the sire of the foals is still present. The younger the foal, the more likely infanticide should be. We collected data from five herds in two zoological gardens in the Czech Republic. We found nine records of infanticide in plains zebra and three cases of abortions that were probably induced by forced copulation. We analysed additional indirect data to investigate the possibility of introduced males causing other abortions. Abortions were three times more likely in herds with introduced males than with only fathers present. Postnatal mortality of the foals was four times greater with introduced males than with fathers. No indication of a sex preference was observed for infanticide by a new male for either abortions or postpartum deaths. When we combined all records involving introduced males, the probability of foal death was greatest when the new male joined the herd just after conception and decreased with increasing time between conception and date of the new male introduction (the chance of a foal surviving was less than 5% just after conception and more than 50% at the time of delivery). Mortality of foals did not depend on whether the new male was introduced before or after the foal was born. Survival increased to more than 60% after the foal reached 1 month of age. Our results suggest that captive plains zebra show the highest occurrence of infanticide reported among ungulates. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   PEACOCKS; LENGTH
AB A previous experimental study of great snipe, Gallinago media, has reported an effect on male mating success of the amount of white in their tails. That result is one of a very limited set of existing experimental results supporting a female mate preference for a morphological trait in animals. However, a later observational study did not find any correlation between amount of white and male mating success. If females sample a limited number of males, their preferences need not result in strong relationships between mating success and trait values in males, possibly explaining the failure to find the predicted correlation. Yet, females of lekking species are thought to have ample opportunities for mate sampling. To resolve these contrasting results, we present in this paper (1) a larger correlational study (several leks during 10 years) showing no relationship between male mating success and whiteness of tails (measured in several ways), and most importantly (2) evidence that individual females do not mate predominantly with males with very white tails among those; males that each female samples. These results show that females do not prefer males with whiter tails as mates, within the contemporary natural variation in the trait. They also show that there is no sexual selection of the trait at present. This does not necessarily imply that white tails are not a sexually selected adaptation in males, but the mechanisms are likely to have been different from direct mate choice of whiter tails per se.

AB In the beetle Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.) females are larger on average than males, as indicated by elytra length. Size-assortative matings were observed in wild populations in Florida and in laboratory mating experiments. We tested three mechanisms for this size-assortative mating: (1) mate availability; (2) mating constraints; and (3) mate choice. We found that mate choice influenced size-assortative mating by: (1) large and small males preferring to mate with large females; (2) large males successfully competing for large females, leaving small males to mate with small females; and (3) females accepting large males as mates more readily than small males. Males increased their reproductive success by mating with larger, more fecund females. They transferred protein to females during mating. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB This study tested the general prediction that population density affects male-male competition, female mate choice and the opportunity for sexual selection. By manipulating the density of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, while keeping the sex ratio constant, I found that male mating tactics were phenotypically plastic with respect to density. As density increased, males decreased their courtship displays. Male-male competition and mate searching were highest at intermediate densities. Population density had no significant effect on the total number of copulations, copulatory tactics or the percentage of postcopulatory guarding. Female preference for males with a higher percentage of orange coloration was similar at all density levels. The 'opportunity for sexual selection', which estimates the upper limit to which a selected trait can shift if directional selection is operating and was calculated as the variance in number of copulations per male divided by the square of the mean number of copulations, was negatively associated with population density. This may be due to the decrease in male-male competition at high density rather than female preference which was similar across density treatments.

AB In the aquatically mating harbour seal, Phoca vitulina, oestrous females show marked differences in spatial and temporal distribution between geographical areas. This suggests that the males' display behaviour may also vary between areas. We recorded male vocalizations in two areas, the Moray Firth and Orkney, U.K. In the Moray Firth, females haul out on a few intertidal sandbars and travel along predictable routes to forage at sea. In Orkney, female haul out sites are much less influenced by tidal availability and females are much more dispersed. In the Moray Firth, males vocalized only during a short mating season, from 1 July to 12 August. Vocalizations varied significantly with the tide, the peak at high tide clearly coinciding with the period when most females were in the water. In contrast, vocalizations in Orkney were significantly related to both tidal and diel patterns. We suggest that the timing of male vocalizations reflects differences in female availability between sites. In the inner Moray Firth, vocalizations were heard throughout the females' range, whereas vocalizations in Orkney were heard only in two discrete areas. However, at both sites the density of vocalizing males was highest in narrow channels and/or along predictable female travel routes. Therefore, males clearly adapt their temporal and spatial behaviour patterns to variations in female distribution and density. These results suggest that male mating strategies in aquatically mating pinnipeds are more variable than was previously envisaged. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

LA English
DT Article
ID LONG-TAILED MACAQUES; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CHILDREN; MONKEYS; STRESS
AB In nonhuman primates, affiliative behaviours, such as social grooming and various forms of body contact, become more frequent after an aggressive interaction, Since such behaviours lead to a decrease in postconflict aggressive behaviour and displacement activities;and to increased social tolerance, they have been labelled reconciliatory. We video filmed sessions of free play in daycare centres in Stockholm and investigated whether affiliative behaviours used by 5-year-old boys in the postconflict period had a similar reconciliatory function. For 219 conflicts in 21 h 40 min of observation we recorded postconflict affiliative/prosocial, aggressive and displacement behaviours. When affiliative behaviours were shown and accepted by the opponent, aggressive and displacement behaviours decreased and play was promoted. These behaviours thus serve a function similar to reconciliatory behaviour in nonhuman primates and we think it is applicable to call accepted affiliative behaviours in postconflict periods of preschool children reconciliatory, However, conflicts were often polyadic and nonconflict periods consisted of intense play with a rich exchange of affiliative behaviours. These factors were limitations to the postconflict/matched-control method traditionally used in primatological research to document reconciliatory behaviour. We suggest that for preschool children, video recordings and an analysis and description of postconflict affiliative, aggressive and displacement behaviours can be used instead.

TI Use of electroreception during foraging by the Australian lungfish
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID NEOCERATODUS-FORSTERI; PLATYPUS
AB A diverse range of animals, including elasmobranchs and nonteleost fish, use passive electroreception to locate hidden prey. The Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri (Krefft 1870), has ampullary organs analogous in form to the. electroreceptors of other nonteleost fish. Afferents from these ampullae project to regions in the brain that are known to process electrosensory information in other species, suggesting that N. forsteri possesses an electric sense that may be used during prey location. To explore this hypothesis directly, we first characterized food-locating behaviour in N. forsteri and then conducted an experiment designed to quantify the effects of manipulating electrical and olfactory stimuli from live prey. A small crayfish, Cherax destructor, was housed in a specially constructed chamber hidden beneath the substrate, which prevented emission of chemical, mechanical and visual cues, but allowed transmission of bioelectric fields. Control treatments included presentation of electrically shielded prey, a dead crayfish and an empty chamber. In some treatments, a competing olfactory signal was presented simultaneously at the other end of the test tank to assess the relative salience of this sensory modality. The lungfish responded to the crayfish in the unshielded chamber with accurate and sustained feeding movements, even with a competing olfactory signal. By contrast, the abolition of electrical cues in the three control treatments reduced the accuracy and frequency of feeding movements in the vicinity of the target chamber. These results show that, N. forsteri is capable of perceiving the weak electric fields surrounding living animals, and Suggest that it uses this information when foraging to locate prey hidden from view.

AB The preference of female blue tits, Parus caeruleus, is correlated with the brightness of the ultraviolet (UV) crest; there is also assortative mating with respect to the crest's UV/violet chroma. However, manipulation of plumage reflectance is necessary to infer a direct causal link between UV plumage and mate choice. We gave both male and female blue tits a choice between a W-reflecting ('UV+') partner and a partner whose UV plumage reflectance had been removed ('UV-'). Male blue tits significantly preferred UV+ females. Similarly, female blue tits tended to prefer UV-reflecting males, but their UV+ preferences were nonsignificant. Neither sex showed a preference when conspecifics were replaced by a heterospecific. This study suggests mutual mate choice but male choice may be more strongly influenced by the visual appearance of potential mates. This is one of a few studies to show male mate preferences and the first demonstration of a direct relationship between UV reflectance and;male mate choice.

AB Explanations for the evolution of polyandry emphasize either direct benefits or indirect genetic benefits. The former class of explanation predicts that females may seek multiple copulations but not necessarily multiple partners, while the latter predicts that females will seek multiple copulations with different partners. We investigated these predictions experimentally in the hide beetle, in which females mate more than once during their reproductive cycle. Female hide beetles remated more readily with novel males than with their previous partners, suggesting they mate multiply in order to obtain indirect, genetic benefits. In double-mating experiments with sterile males, the proportion of eggs fertilized by the second male was highly variable; this could not be explained by variation in male body size, duration of copulation or mating order. Male hide beetles form postinsemination associations by riding on the backs of females. This behaviour was more prevalent in the presence of rival males and less prevalent in the presence of additional females, suggesting that the behaviour serves to increase paternity, perhaps by obtaining additional copulations.

AB Social challenges may have driven the evolution of intelligence in primates and other taxa. In primates, the social intelligence hypothesis is supported by evidence that primates know a lot about their own relationships to others and also know something about the nature of relationships among other individuals (third-party relationships). Knowledge of third-party relationships is likely to play an especially important role in coalitions, which occur when one individual intervenes in an ongoing dispute involving other group members, by helping individuals to predict who will supporter intervene against them when they are fighting with particular opponents, and to assess which potential allies are likely to be effective in coalitions against their opponents. To date, however, there is no evidence that primates make use of knowledge of third-party relationships when they form coalitions. Here, I show that male bonnet macaques, Macaca radiata, use information about third-party rank relationships when they recruit support from other males. Males consistently chose allies that outranked themselves and their opponents, and made such choices considerably more often than would be expected by chance alone. The analysis shows that the data do not fit simpler explanations based upon males' knowledge of their own relationships to other males or males' ability to recognize powerful allies.

AB Chemical signals from conspecifics can influence the behaviour and neuroendocrine axis of mice. Several different molecules are excreted with urine, depending on hormonal level, and can indicate the sex of the emitter. In male mice, these chemicals are the major urinary proteins (MUPs) and some small volatile odorant molecues that are found bound to them. We tested adult males for light avoidance behaviour in a two-chamber apparatus, with one light and one dark side, in the presence or absence of male urinary substances. The presence of chemical cues on either side of the cage was expected to modify light avoidance behaviour. The volatiles released from purified MUPS had the same effect as whole adult male urine, in that they induced a faster onset of exploration of the light compartment. The results show that mice can use the information carried by the odorant molecules released by MUPs to recognize the urine of male mice, and respond appropriately.

ID UNDERWATER PREY; GARZETTA; GULARIS; STRIKE
AB The majority of heron species (Aves, Ardeidae) forage on aquatic prey in shallow water. Prey detection, aiming and the beginning of the capture strikes are performed while the heron's eyes are above water. For most angles, as a result of air/water light refraction, the apparent image available to a heron is vertically displaced from the prey's real position. Herons must therefore correct for refraction. We tested the hypothesis that species that forage in aquatic habitats should be more able to correct for image disparity than those of terrestrial habitats. The ability of hand-reared herons of four species to capture stationary prey (fish) underwater (submerged) or in air (aerial) was tested. Three species (little egret, Egretta garzetta,, squacco heron, Ardeola ralloides, and night heron, Nycticorax nycticorax) normally forage in aquatic habitats while the fourth (cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis) forages in terrestrial habitats. No individuals missed aerial prey. Success rates of little egrets and of squacco herons with submerged prey were high, while night herons became less successful with increased prey depth and/or distance. In cattle egrets, success rate was low and negatively correlated with prey depth. The observed interspecific differences may thus be related to (1) differential. ability to correct for air/water light refraction and (2) the species' foraging behaviour. We suggest that cattle egrets are in the process of losing their ability to cope with submerged prey. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Multiple paternity has rarely been reported in anuran amphibians, with only three previous documented. examples. For the Australian frog Crinia georgiana, we observed synchronous polyandry in an average of 44% of matings observed at four field sites. This suggests matings involving more than one male are common in this species. One to eight males were observed in amplectant groups with second males amplexed ventrally. Genetic analyses, using allozyme electrophoresis, of offspring from two matings indicated that at least two of three possible males fathered offspring. Third males were unlikely to have shared paternity, explained by their inappropriate position during amplexus. Multiple paternity may be more common in frogs than has been reported.

   FRANCE; LABORATORY MICE; WILD MICE; MOUSE; ECOLOGY; DISPERSION; DYNAMICS
AB Because of the cryptic nature of small mammals inhabiting vegetation with widely scattered food resources, little is known about the behavioural mechanisms underlying their spatial dispersion. While house mice exploiting human-built environments attempt to exclude intruders aggressively from small territories that contain concentrated food resources, comparative tests show that the grassland mouse, M. spretus, establishes dominance relationships and then avoids sites used by dominant competitors, probably to avoid displacement from sites that provide safety from predators. We carried out further comparative tests to examine competitive behaviour and response to odours from same-sex conspecifics among house mice living ferally on the Isle of May, U.K., using recently captured adult males (N = 62) and females (N = 23). In contrast both to house mice caught from buildings and to the grassland M. spretus, feral house mice from the Isle of May showed no aggressive, defensive or cautious behaviour on meeting a same-sex conspecific, with the exception of one aggressive male. Scent marks had no effect on their response to a competitor, although intruders in a scent-marked arena showed a significant sex difference in choice between a clean nest site versus one soiled by a same-sex resident: males spent more time in the soiled nest while females spent more time in the clean one. We propose that the lack of aggression among feral May mice may be due to the infeasibility of defending large territories, containing scattered resources, on an island where there is no real predation risk. We suggest that this hypothesis may explain the lower aggression and higher densities that are characteristic of populations of small mammals, reptiles and birds living on small islands.

AB Arginine vasotocin (AVT), a neuropeptide, appears to influence mating and aggressive behaviours of males classically thought to be controlled by testosterone. We examined the effects of AVT on the calling behaviour and competitive ability of the grey treefrog Hyla versicolor under natural field conditions. AVT increased the probability that males produced advertisement calls from a resident's calling site. Most intriguing, AVT increased an. intruder male's ability to acquire calling sites from resident males without physical aggression in staged encounters. This is particularly significant because resident males typically win encounters over intruders. This is the first study demonstrating that AVT manipulations in a natural population can directly influence the outcome of male-male competition for a resource and reverse the resident-male advantage.

AB Female amphipods (Crustacea) carry their fertilized eggs in an external brood pouch until the fully formed juveniles emerge (passive brood care). They may also direct specific maternal activities towards the brood (active brood care). We show that Crangonyx pseudogracilis, which typically populates freshwaters subject to wide fluctuations in temperature and dissolved oxygen, engages in a highly responsive form of active brood care. This involves a flexing motion by the female that expands the brood pouch and increases the suspension of the eggs in the surrounding medium, accompanied by ventilation of the brood pouch and the 'cycling' of eggs therein. Females also selectively eject nonviable eggs from their broods. We investigated the expression of this brood care behaviour in relation to intrinsic and extrinsic factors relevant to the development of broods. The time spent by females in this behaviour initially increased as embryos developed, but decreased once advanced embryos began to self-ventilate and to have a heart pulse. In addition, both increased temperature and decreased oxygen concentration resulted in increased levels of brooding behaviour. We thus propose that this behaviour functions to ameliorate the microclimate of the brood pouch and serves the changing metabolic demand of the brood, as influenced by the interaction of embryonic development with temperature/dissolved oxygen regime. In addition, this behaviour may be a key adaptation facilitating the success of this North American species as an invader of disturbed and polluted freshwaters in Europe and elsewhere; Evidence is emerging that other amphipods associated with harsh environmental conditions also shaw such active maternal brood care.

AB Large size is often decisive to victory in territorial disputes. Here we report for the first time a natural territorial advantage associated with small size, possibly exemplifying a 'paradoxical strategy' (Maynard Smith Sr Parker 1976, Animal Behaviour, 24, 159-175) in which small individuals with inferior resource holding power win war-of-attrition contests against superior adversaries because resource value/rate of cost accrual (V/K) is greater for small contestants. Males of the aposematic nymphalid butterfly Heliconius sara that defend scattered mating arenas in subtropical Brazilian forest have wings that are on average 3% shorter than males caught away from territories during any part of the year. Smaller residents tend to return to territories over longer periods, and field experiments show that intruders retreat faster when confronting smaller than average territory owners. Heliconius sara has a second, seemingly much more important mating system in which female pupae attract males pheromonally, and in which large males may be more successful in winning mates. Because it is unlikely that small H. sara have intrinsically superior resource holding power, and because territories should be about equally valuable to all males, we propose that large males, supposedly favoured in pupal mating, may risk losing more in terms of future reproductive success through chance injury in territorial fights (large K) and thus avoid combats with small opponents which risk little from injury because of their diminished mating prospects (small K).

AB Extra-pair paternity is common in many socially monogamous passerine birds with biparental care. Thus, males often invest in offspring to which they are not related. Models of optimal parental investment predict that, under certain assumptions, males should lower their investment in response to reduced certainty of paternity. We attempted to reduce certainty of paternity experimentally in two species, the eastern bluebird, Sialia sialis, and the tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor, by temporarily removing fertile females on two mornings during egg laying. In both species, experimental males usually attempted to copulate with the female immediately after her reappearance, suggesting that they experienced the absence of their mate as a threat to their paternity. Experimental males copulated at a significantly higher rate than control males. However, contrary to the prediction of the model, experimental males did not invest less than control males in their offspring. There was no difference between experimental and control nests in the proportion of male feeds, male and female feeding rates, nestling growth and nestling condition and size at age 14 days. We argue that females might have restored the males' confidence in paternity after the experiment by soliciting or accepting copulations. Alternatively, males may not reduce their effort, because the fitness costs to their own offspring may outweigh the benefits for the males, at least in populations where females cannot fully compensate for reduced male investment.

AB Few researchers have been able to quantify the time or effort expended by male birds in seeking extra-pair copulations with neighbouring females, In this study, we radio-tracked male hooded warblers, to determine the frequency and duration of intrusions onto neighbouring territories. Extra-pair fertilizations are common in hooded warblers, with 35% of females producing extra-pair young. Males intruded onto territories where females were nest building more often than expected by chance and approached females during most intrusions (78%), suggesting that these intrusions were extra-pair copulation attempts. Almost all intrusions (96%) were to adjacent territories, and males made an average +/- se of 0.4 +/- 0.2 forays/h and spent 4.7 +/- 2.6% of their time off-territory. Males were involved in fights or chases with the resident male in 21% of intrusions, but were apparently undetected during most intrusions. Males with high intrusion effort onto neighbouring territories had the lowest rate of intrusions onto their own territory by other radio-tracked males, Males varied extensively in their intrusion effort, but this was not significantly correlated with male body mass, age or song rare. The percentage of time spent intruding onto other territories was small (0-8%), so males probably do not face strong trade-offs between making extra-pair copulation forays and other activities like mate guarding and feeding offspring.

AB We investigated the factors involved in the orientation of raiders of the European Amazon ant, Polyergus rufescens, and how these factors are used by raiders during the different phases of slave-making expeditions. Ants at the head of the raiding column did not follow previously deposited chemical trails but oriented by celestial cues. Raiders in the middle of the column used celestial factors but were also strongly affected by the recruiting activity of the ants that preceded them. During the return trip, raiders used both chemical and celestial cues. The latter allowed the ants to assume the correct home direction while following the chemical trail. Perception of the ultraviolet band of the light spectrum was of crucial importance for the orientation of the raiders, during both the outbound and inbound journeys. This supports the hypothesis that P. rufescens workers, like other ants, perceive the pattern of polarized skylight in the ultraviolet range.

These factors were examined in single females and mated pairs of Peromyscus californicus who were required to 'forage' for food by running in a wheel. Offspring survival and growth, parental behaviour, amount of food obtained by running in the wheel and inter-birth intervals between litters were recorded. Females alone were able to raise litters of two pups, but not four pups. Mated pairs were able to raise a litter of four pups. Litters of one or two pups reared with the mother alone grew as fast as pups reared with both parents. Single females that kept their pups alive had a mean inter-birth interval of 53 days; paired females had a mean inter-birth interval of 37 days. These results show the effect of male parental investment on reproductive success when parents must forage for food: the presence of the male resulted in four times as many pups reared over a 74-day period as a female could rear on her own.

AB Precocial or semi-precocial chicks of underground-nesting seabirds are able to explore the immediate confines of the nest site. Therefore, the development of a cognitive ability that allows chicks of colonial seabirds to return to their own nest during the nestling period may be necessary if contact between young and parents is maintained simply by strong nest-site attachment. In Procellariiformes olfaction may play an important role in navigation of adults to colony sites and nesting burrows. A series of experiments with British storm-petrel, Hydrobates pelagicus, nestlings suggested that they also possess an olfactory homing ability and that they are capable of nest recognition a few days after brooding ceases. As there is apparently no parent-offspring recognition in this species, and adults direct care towards any young that stays in its nest, the ability of chicks to recognize their own nests by smell is likely to be selected for.

AB The influence of sex and age on success in contests over access to food was studied in a wintering population of snow buntings, Plectrophenax nivalis, in northeast Scotland over a 5-year period. Males won 87% of dyadic interactions with females, but, in contrast to many other studies, first-winter birds won a majority (60-70%) of intra-sexual interactions with same-sex adults. First-winter males continued to have greater success than adult males even after controlling for an individual's role within a contest, the degree to which the contest escalated, and the severity of the weather. Contests won by adult males were more likely to have escalated, perhaps indicating a greater cost, than those won by first-winter males. Dominance status dropped from an individual's first to its second winter of life, but not thereafter. It is argued that winning winter food fights is of more immediate benefit to first-winter birds, and that reversal of the usual age-related dominance pattern may be due to the species' itinerant nature in winter combined with a lack of long-term pair-bonds or individual recognition. Assertion of dominance therefore carries only short-term benefits which may not override the costs of aggressive behaviour. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Alarm calling in sciurid rodents is often explained by inclusive fitness benefits that callers accrue. Inclusive fitness arguments imply that indirect fitness plays an important role in the evolution and maintenance of alarm calling. A more parsimonious hypothesis is that animals alarm call to increase their direct fitness by warning their offspring. Group-living animals are related to each other social group member by a coefficient of relatedness, r, that theoretically ranges from 0-1.0. The sum of these pair-wise coefficients,'total r', reflects the magnitude of possible inclusive fitness benefits. The amount of variation in the rate of yellow-bellied marmot, Marmota flaviventris, alarm calling that was explained by direct parental care was compared with that variation explained by total r. After pups emerged, adult females with pups called more than other age/sex classes. Additionally, 42% of the variation in the rate of calling over the entire study was a function of whether the caller was a female who had pups emerge above ground that year. Total r explained no significant variation in;the rate of alarm calling. Alarm calling in group-living yellow-bellied marmots is a form of direct parental care and inclusive fitness, broadly defined, is of little importance for the maintenance of alarm calling.

AB The behaviour of male speckled wood butterflies, Pararge aegeria L. (Satyrinae), was studied in relation to the following phenotypic traits: dorsal wing colour, submarginal wing spots, wing length and generation. Wing colour was of overriding importance. Pale males spent most of their time resting within a sunlit patch and engaged in short flights and intra- and interspecific interactions. Darker males flew more frequently between sunlit patches through the shaded forest. Thus males differing in phenotype did not have the same probability of showing perching, patrolling or an intermediate type of mate-locating behaviour. Darker and larger males were also more likely to leave the forest. There was very little effect of spot type, but a clear influence of generation on the behavioural variation. It is hypothesized that the observed variation is related to differences in thermoregulation between differently coloured individuals. Darker individuals are expected to have an increased warming rate which means that they can spend more rime flying through the shady wood from one sunlit patch to another, while pale males will not suffer from overheating as soon as dark ones when settled on a sunlit patch. This in turn causes variation in their adaptedness to different behavioural strategies.

AB Animal signals are often used in more than one context or by more than one class of signaller. In the big-clawed snapping shrimp, Alpheus heterochaelis, the open chela display is a visual signal produced by both males and females. Thus, to respond appropriately to the open chela display in interactions, shrimp need information about the sex of the other individual. These experiments were performed to determine the effect of sex information from chemical signals on the response of shrimp to the visual signal of the open chela. First, chemical signals from males and females were presented alone. Shrimp did not respond differentially to chemical signals from males and females. Next, chemical signals were presented concurrently with the open chela display. Male shrimp showed a greater response to an open chela with male chemical signals than to an open chela with female chemical signals. Male response to an open chela with female chemical signals was also a function of the chela's relative size, and this size-relative response was less than the response to the open chela alone. Male response to an open chela with male chemical signals was independent of relative size. In contrast, females responded aggressively to open and closed chelae regardless of relative size, and regardless of concurrent chemical signals. The relative costs and benefits associated with aggressive and pair-forming interactions differ for males and females, and these differences are likely to contribute to the differences in assessment observed here.

AB The influence of moonlight on the foraging behaviour of the scorpion Buthus occitanus israelis was observed. In contrast to their visual predators, most scorpions use air and surface vibrations to locate their prey. Therefore, moonlight is not likely to have a direct effect on the scorpions' foraging behaviour, but rather an indirect effect through changes in risk from predation or changes in prey availability. Adult scorpions were less active on moonlit nights than on dark nights, and adults that were active on full moon nights tended to ambush under bushes. Juveniles, however, did not seem to alter their activity as a response to moonlight. Mass-to-size ratios of adult scorpions foraging on moonlit nights were significantly lower than those of scorpions foraging on dark nights, suggesting that scorpions that forage in bright moonlight are individuals with relatively low energy reserves. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that risk of predation is higher during periods of bright moonlight. It is suggested that the scorpions use environmental factors such as illumination and humidity as proximal cues, to evaluate levels of predation risk and food availability.

AB Intra-uterine position is related to anogenital distance in female house mice, and possibly male house mice. Consequences of intra-uterine position as tested in the laboratory include effects on aggression, reproductive behaviour and hormone biology. The behavioural and reproductive consequences of variation in intra-uterine position, using anogenital distance in young mice as a bioassay, were tested using wild house mice, Mus domesticus, in eight 0.1-ha field enclosures. Male mice with larger anogenital distances were more aggressive as adults, had larger mean home range size and were more likely to disperse than males with smaller anogenital distances. Female mice with smaller anogenital distance were more likely to attain reproductive status, had a higher rate of pregnancy and had more pregnancies on average than females with smaller anogenital distance. Survival was not related to anogenital distance for either sex. These findings indicate that intra-uterine position has consequences for behaviour and reproduction in mice. In utero exposure to higher levels of testosterone apparently enhances behaviour patterns related to reproductive success for males and decreases reproductive success for females. Differences in exposure to oestrogen in utero may also be a possible mechanism for some of these effects in males. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Offspring may remain associated with parents to gain the skills required for independent survival and reproduction. The ontogeny of foraging and breeding behaviour was followed in a cohort of cooperatively breeding white-throated magpie-jays from hedging through to dispersal. Young jays approached adult levels of foraging proficiency within 1 year of hedging. During their first year of age, young jays provisioned nests as helpers at a lower rate than did older individuals. No improvement occurred during that hrst year, however, suggesting that lower provisioning was the result of other factors than the lack of foraging or nesting skills. Natal dispersal was. extremely sex-biased: males dispersed between 4 and 23 months of age, but females remained in their natal group. Male dispersal coincided with both the maturation of foraging skills and the start of a breeding season. Males from larger groups dispersed at an earlier age than those from smaller groups. Therefore, although offspring must associate with parents during some minimum period to acquire skills, the decision of whether and when to disperse from the natal territory is determined by other factors in the white-throated magpie-jay.

AB Behavioural interactions and habitat use by larvae of the giant damselfly, Megaloprepus coerulatus, were studied in Panama. These larvae live in water-filled holes in fallen and living trees. Despite potential advantages for larval territoriality in this species, M. coerulatus did not exhibit exclusive use of resources, probably because their prey were not spatially clumped. Both well-fed and starved larvae initiated agonistic displays typical of other damselfly species, and even small differences in relative size affected their behaviour towards conspecifics. Habitat use in M. coerulatus varied with levels of food and cover. When cover was abundant, as it is in natural holes, larvae were hyper-dispersed. A larva rarely showed exclusive use of a given area from one day to the next, however, even when both cover and motile prey were experimentally limited. The ability of larger individuals to displace smaller ones as they move around the habitat is best described as size-dependent (and site-independent) dominance rather than territoriality. The results suggest that it is premature to characterize an animal as 'territorial' on the basis of its behaviour in the laboratory, unless the abundance and distribution of resources that are provided are realistic, and the experimental design is sufficient to differentiate between size-dependent dominance and site-specific exclusion of conspecifics from a critical resource.

AB New Zealand birds first encountered mammalian predators in the 18th century and thus do not carry an evolved set of response options for mammals. The responses of experienced and naive New Zealand robins, Petroica australis, to an introduced mammal (the stoat, Mustela erminea) were compared. Experienced (mainland) robins responded strongly to the stoat, whereas their response to the control (a box) was weak, and similar to the response of naive (island) robins to both the stoat and the control. Naive robins learned to recognize the stoat after one-event learning. The training was robust, being achieved using three training protocols. Robins on the mainland have apparently learned to recognize predators, and it is suggested that learned recognition abilities have enabled their survival. Predator training may be a valuable addition to many reintroduction programmes for endangered species. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The deception hypothesis suggests that pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, males are more successful at distant secondary territories, since they are able to hide their mating status. Alternatively, the female-female aggression hypothesis suggests that males take up distant secondary territories to reduce aggression between their two females. Mated females have been suggested to behave aggressively towards other females to ensure male parental care. Radio-tagged females of polyterritorial males appeared close to a male's second nestbox only if this was close to their own nestbox. They often foraged further from their own nestbox, however, than the distance between the two nestboxes. Females did not patrol their mates' second territory and thus they were not particularly active in preventing their mates from mating with other females. Aggression of a mated female may play some role in male polyterritoriality, since a prospecting female may use her aggression as a cue in assessing male mating status.

AB Theoretical arguments concerning the evolution of parental care depend on the relative costs of caring the two sexes. In this study experimental manipulations of parental care were used to compare the costs of care between the sexes in the biparental St Peter's fish. For both males and females parental care had costs to growth and increased the number of days until the next reproductive cycle. In females, care also decreased subsequent fecundity, as expected from an observed positive correlation between female fecundity and body weight. The results provide strong evidence for high costs of care for females and distinguish between two components of the costs of reproduction: the costs of gamete production and the costs of care.

AB Water immersion-induced grooming sequences and open field behaviour were studied in two sublines of Sprague-Dawley rats, Rattus norvegicus, selectively bred for high- (HY) and low-yawning (LY) frequency. HY rats were more active than LY rats in the open field: ambulation, rearings and wall-leanings were significantly higher in the former than in the latter group, indicating that LY rats are more emotionally reactive. Sequential analysis showed that HY rats exhibit more occurrences of a well-organized caudal grooming, while LY rats engage more frequently in well-organized facial grooming. Correspondence analysis revealed that both groups groom according to a hierarchical organization, with transitions between grooming elements depending on anatomical proximity. Clustering of grooming elements is related to a temporal recruitment and a reciprocal transition between them. Both groups, however, show distinct 'syntaxes' of grooming elements. Altogether these results indicate that along with a high or low frequency of yawning, there are other associated types of behaviour that separate both groups of rats. The structure of grooming between HY and LY rats indicates a strain-specific functional and neurophysiological difference. Yawning, grooming and emotional reactivity appear to be associated with arousal variations. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The predictions that a decrease in the synchrony of food arrival leads to an increase in aggression, resource monopolization and, ultimately, variation in fitness within groups were tested. Groups of four female medaka, Oryzias latipes, were allowed to compete over a 2-week period for prey (Artemia sp.) that arrived either synchronously (every 5 s) or asynchronously (every 60 s). As predicted, both the monopolization of food and the frequency of aggression were higher when food arrived asynchronously than when it arrived synchronously. Fitness of individual fish was measured as the number of eggs spawned, growth, and surplus power, the sum of the energy allocated to eggs and growth. Variation of within-group fitness was greater in the asynchronous treatment than in the synchronous treatment when measured by growth and surplus power, but not by number of eggs. The frequency of aggression by an individual was positively correlated with feeding success and ultimately to fitness in the asynchronous treatment but was not correlated with either in the synchronous treatment. These results suggest that food was economically defendable only in the asynchronous treatment.

TI WHY DO MALE CRAB SPIDERS DRINK NECTAR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID MISUMENOIDES-FORMOSIPES; JUVENILE; FEMALES
AB Misumenoides formosipes is a protandrous, semelparous crab spider common on flowers in North America. Females are 20-50 times heavier than males, which seldom feed on prey as adults, but search for and guard potential mates. Nectivory, previously unproven for spiders, was observed in male M. formosipes. Males were studied on Queen Anne's lace, Daucus cai ota, to determine the importance of nectar as an energy and water source and its effect on male longevity. Because of their low mass and large surface-to-volume ratio males were more prone to dehydration than females. Drinking nectar replaced fluid that males lost through evaporation, although dew and rainwater were more efficient sources of fluid because the volume per nectary was very small. Males preferred drinking a simulated nectar source (30% sucrose solution) to water, and even when satiated with water would still drink the sucrose solution, suggesting nectar was used as an energy source. Males offered nectar for an hour a day lived longer than males given only water. Nectar feeding may have evolved because of the selective advantage of increased longevity for male reproductive success.

AB Prevailing theories concerning maternal investment strategies to maximize fitness under adverse environmental conditions predict sex-biased investment in offspring under certain circumstances. These predictions have received empirical support in some species but not in others. The present study was designed to assess patterns of maternal investment in postnatally food-restricted eastern woodrats, Neotoma floridana, in an attempt to replicate previous work and to examine patterns of resource allocation in greater detail. Experimental dams received a food ration that supplied approximately 80% of non-lactating nutritional requirements, whereas control dams had unrestricted access to food. To limit the level of stress experienced by lactating mothers, individual females were allowed unlimited access to food for the duration of the lactation period if their mass fell below 75% of their pre-experimental mass. Food restricted dams attempted to rear all offspring despite experiencing considerable weight loss themselves. Growth rates of young from experimental litters were significantly lower than those of young from control litters. In contrast to previously reported data, no evidence of sex-biased maternal investment was found in this species.

AB The marginal value theorem states that foragers should leave patches when the instantaneous capture rate has fallen to the average capture rate for the habitat. This predicts that patch residence time should increase with increasing patch quality and decrease with increasing habitat quality. These and other predictions from prescient, Bayesian and fixed-time models were tested using observations on 14 radio-tagged free-living common cranes, Grus grus, foraging in cereal farmland. Cranes behaved as Bayesian foragers. Their intake rates on leaving patches changed with patch and habitat quality. The behaviour of cranes was consistent with marginal value theorem predictions only in patches where energy return was lower than required to meet daily food requirements. In contrast, birds left richer patches earlier than expected and at higher intake rates than poor patches; In addition, cranes stayed longer in larger flocks. These results suggest that cranes changed their foraging rules according to their expected energy balance.

AB It is hypothesized that age- and sex-biased philopatry in the migratory collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, may be partly caused by age and sex differences in the balance between benefits of using prior local experience and costs of time devoted to finding the way home. To test this idea, newly arrived birds of different sexes, ages, prior local experience and arrival time were experimentally translocated between woodlands with nestboxes, about 1.5-6 km apart, and the return rates of different categories of birds were then compared. About 54% (N=230) of the displaced birds returned to the plot of capture compared with 86% of the controls (i.e. birds caught and released in the same plot; N=79), suggesting that home area infidelity might be at least partly caused by high costs of finding the way home. Among displaced birds, older birds returned more often, and more quickly, than did yearlings, also when date of arrival was controlled for. Older birds, but not yearlings, with experience of the plot of capture from the previous year were more likely to return than those with no such experience. Old males were more likely to return than old females, and males, but not females, of both age classes that arrived early were more likely to return than those that arrived late. It is concluded that the higher degree of philopatry of old birds is best interpreted in terms of increasing benefits of prior local experience with age. The significance of prior local experience may differ between sexes because of a difference between males and females in the costs of finding and comparing alternative nest sites, with the highest benefits accruing to the sex with the highest average search costs, that is, males in the collared flycatcher.

AB Parentage was determined by DNA fingerprinting for 110 young from 38 broods. There was no intraspecific brood parasitism and no young were fathered by males from outside the polygynandrous group. Nineteen (50%) broods were fathered by one male (15 by alpha, four by beta), 17 by two males (14 alpha and beta, two alpha and gamma, one beta and gamma) and two by three males (alpha, beta and gamma). A male's paternity share of a brood increased with his share of the matings, measured as the proportion of time he gained exclusive access to the female. This relationship was the same for alpha and beta males, which suggests that their copulations were of equal potency. Alpha males gained a larger share of the paternity by guarding fertile females and their overall paternity within the group tended to increase with female nesting asynchrony, although not significantly so, and to decrease with more competing subordinate males. Males were more likely to help feed nestlings if they gained a greater share of the matings with the mother. There was no difference between alpha and beta males in the relationship between the probability of helping and mating share. Given a choice between two synchronous broods, males preferred to help where their mating share was greatest. When alpha and beta males helped at the same nest their share of the feeds reflected their share of matings, not their dominance rank. When only one male helped at a nest, alpha males decreased their amount of help with decreased mating share, whereas beta males did not. This difference may arise because alpha males have greater chances of mating with other females in the group, so opportunity costs of helping are greater for them. How these different helping responses influence female preference for alpha versus beta males is discussed.

AB Although at variance with Darwinian theory, adoption of unrelated offspring has been reported in a variety of ground-nesting colonial seabirds. Pierotti and Murphy (1987, Anim. Behav., 35, 435-444) suggest that an inter-generational conflict exists between disadvantaged chicks and unrelated adults, a conflict that often results in wandering chicks successfully soliciting investment from foster parents. Of 47 ring-billed gull, Larus delawarensis, chicks that departed their natal broods over four summers of field work, 34 remained in recipient broods for 3 or more days and received parental care (i.e. were successfully adopted), and 13 remained in recipient broods for less than 3 days ('runners'). Chicks in broods that were subsequently subject to abandonment were fed at a significantly lower rate (on a per chick basis) than chicks in control broods (which neither adopted nor had a chick depart) or broods that subsequently adopted a chick. In most cases, adoptees were older than the oldest resident chick in the accepting brood, but runners were younger than resident chicks. Pairs whose oldest chick was less than 7 days were more likely to adopt foreign offspring than pairs with older chicks. Twenty-six (76%) of the 34 adopted chicks survived to at least 24 days (fledged). Pairs that adopted a chick realized a lower annual breeding success (chicks fledged/pair) than control pairs or pairs that had a chick depart their brood. Disadvantaged chicks that gain permanent acceptance into foreign broods 'win' the inter-generational conflict at the expense of the foster parents.

   LEKS; UGANDA KOB; EVOLUTION; LEKKING; SUCCESS; MALES
AB Females of lek-breeding ungulates are commonly thought to mate on leks because leks provide opportunities for females to choose particular males, and enable them to produce offspring that receive genetic benefits. An additional benefit may be that selection has resulted in oestrous females avoiding harassment by non-territorial males in herds. In Kafue lechwe, Kobus leche kafuensis Haltenorth, a lek-breeding ungulate, female mating rates in large unstable herds were lower than on leks because a large proportion of mating attempts were terminated prematurely by competing nonterritorial males. In addition, sexually receptive females in herds were chased more frequently and for greater distances by males than sexually receptive females on leks. Once females left herds they were more likely to accumulate on leks than on single territories because the former retained more females than the latter. Such retention of oestrous females in clustered territories may also generate benefits to males that establish territories near to one another.

TI CAN HONEY-BEES COUNT LANDMARKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID FREELY FLYING HONEYBEES; BEHAVIOR; INSECTS; MOTION
AB Honey bees, Apis mellifera, were trained along a row of four identical landmarks (tetrahedral tents 3.46 m high) which were equally spaced in a set-up 300 m long, the feeder being placed between the third and fourth landmarks. In the tests, the number of tents between hive and feeder was altered. Even though many bees continued to search for food at the correct distance, the distance estimation of the bees as a group depended notably on the number of landmarks. If they encountered more landmarks on their way from the hive to the feeder than they had during training, significantly more bees landed at a shorter distance than during control tests with the training landmark set-up. If they encountered fewer landmarks, they flew significantly further. This behaviour meets the basic criteria in most definitions of true counting. Since, however, a transfer of the counting performance on different objects is unlikely to occur, the observed behaviour should be referred to as protocounting (Davis and Perusse 1988, Behav. Brain Sci, 114, 561-615). Landmark (proto-) counting is considered here a special application of a sequential memory for landmarks.

TI MATE SAMPLING AND COPULATION BEHAVIOR OF GREAT SNIPE FEMALES

AB Mate sampling by great snipe, Gallinago media, was studied by following individually marked females on their visits to two leks in five consecutive mating seasons. The main objectives were to determine whether the females used a sequential search or a best-of-N-males comparison when selecting a mating partner, and to evaluate the consequences of females engaging in copulations with more than one male and in repeated copulations with the same male. The minimum length of the period between the first observation of a female and her first observed copulation varied from 0 to 18 days (median 4). One to 10 males (median=2) were visited in the pre-mating period. Nineteen females (58%) mated on their first observed visit to the territory of a male, whereas 14 (42%) returned to a previously visited male to mate. Seven (21%) of the females were seen copulating on more than one night, and four of them changed copulation partner between nights. The fact that so many females were seen returning to a previously visited male to mate is best explained by a best-of-N-males comparison, but the results could also be explained by a sequential search strategy with a variable threshold. Females copulated more with successful males and they copulated more when other females were present on the territory of the male than when alone. Competition between females is most likely to account for these differences, but the mechanism is not known. The testes of great snipe males were large compared with those of other waders, indicating that sperm competition is important in this lekking species.

AB The nest defence behaviour of vole-eating Tengmalm's owls, Aegolius funereus, in the presence of a live American mink, Mustela vison, was studied. The study covered a 3-year vole cycle, where low, increasing and peak vole years followed each other in a predictable manner. First-year survival prospects of owlets in the increasing vole years were twice as high as in the low and peak years. Males may have adapted to local fluctuations in food abundance because of restricted natal and breeding dispersal, but nomadic females with wide natal dispersal may not possess such a response. As expected, male, but not female, nest defence was related to the survival prospects of offspring. Age-related differences in the intensity of nest defence were also studied. Surprisingly, a negative relationship was found between male age and the intensity of nest defence in the peak vole year. This suggests that before a vole crash, old males may have higher residual reproductive value than young ones or that old males may reduce their investment at a time when large investment in offspring is not beneficial.

TI HOW DO FEMALE PARASITOID WASPS ASSESS HOST SIZE DURING SEX-RATIO
   MANIPULATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SPALANGIA-CAMERONI; TRICHOGRAMMA-MINUTUM; HYMENOPTERA; CURVATURE
AB As in many parasitoid wasps, Spalangia cameroni females oviposit a greater proportion of daughters in large hosts than in small hosts. How females assess host size for this sex-ratio manipulation was examined: do females require visual cues and do they use exposed surface area or volume or duration required to drill into a heat prior to oviposition? Visual cues are not necessary; in the dark, females still produced a greater proportion of daughters in large hosts than in small hosts. To examine whether females use exposed surface area or volume to estimate host size, proportion of daughters was compared between unburied hosts and hosts that had been half-buried either horizontally or vertically. Burying hosts did not interfere with host-size assessment for sex-ratio response; sex ratios did not differ between partially buried hosts and unburied hosts of the same size. Females do not appear to use duration required to drill into a host prior to oviposition to assess a host's resources. Drill duration was not consistently longer or shorter for the types of hosts in which daughters versus sons tended to be oviposited. Specifically, a greater proportion of daughters were oviposited in large hosts than in small hosts and in young hosts than in old hosts. Drill duration was longer in large hosts than small hosts but was shorter in young hosts than old hosts. The greater average drill duration observed for daughters suggests that daughters may be mon costly to produce than sons.

TI PATTERNS IN THE DIVING BEHAVIOR OF THE POCHARD, AYTHYA-FERINA - A TEST
   OF AN OPTIMALITY MODEL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID FULIGULA; DUCKS
AB Foraging divers face a trade-off between obtaining oxygen at the surface and food underwater. Houston and Carbone (1992, Behav. Ecol, 3, 255-265) developed models to predict the allocation of time over the dive cycle for aerobic divers that maximize gross and net rates of energy intake under a range of conditions. To test some of these predictions diving experiments on the pochard were conducted. The costs and benefits of foraging were manipulated by varying water depth, food concentration and depth of the substrate covering the food. Each stage of the dive cycle was positively correlated with water depth, and the trends were qualitatively similar to the predictions of the models. Food concentration did not significantly affect foraging time: only small effects were predicted. Foraging time (predicted to decrease independently of recovery time, as energy costs during foraging increase) decreased in (sic) to increasing substrate depth (used to increase foraging costs), while recovery time was not significantly affected. An additional experiment was conducted to determine whether the birds could assess foraging areas that differ in water depth and food concentration. When offered two options, the birds changed their mean preference from a higher to a lower food concentration as the depth of the higher concentration option increased. However, they switched their preference earlier than expected based on estimates of the net rates of gain obtained from these options. This suggests that factors other than energetics influence the choice of foraging areas.

AB The ability of female red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, to discriminate between normal songs of local, conspecific males and altered or foreign songs was tested. Females were tested using the solicitation display assay, in which captive females are first treted with oestradiol and then exposed to playback. The number of copulation solicitation displays was the sole response measures. Females responded more strongly to full songs with all introductory notes removed in tests using nine pairs of stimuli. Females did not discriminate between normal songs and the same songs divided into three parts and reassembled in shuffled orders. Subjects drawn from a Pennsylvania (USA) population displayed more in reponse to local songs than songs recorded in Califorina (USA). Pennslyvania females also responded more strongly to trill portions of Pennsylvania songs than to trill portions of California songs. Overall, the results are compatible with the hypothesis that female red-winged blackbirds are more discriminating than males in species recognition, attending to more acoustic cues than do males.

TI DOMINANCE, AGGRESSION FREQUENCIES AND MODES OF AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION IN
   FERAL PONY MARES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Feral pony mares, Equus caballus, at Assateague Island, Maryland, formed linear dominance hierarchies within bands. Generally, older mares dominated younger mares, and larger mares dominated smaller mares. Large mares initiated aggression more often than small mares when age was controlled for but, surprisingly, older mares initiated aggression less often than younger mares when size was controlled for. Thus, mares peak in aggressiveness fairly soon after achieving full size and then, while  maintaining or improving their rank in the dominance hierarchy, progressively reduce their involvement in aggression as they grow older. Involvement in aggression per mare increased as number of mares in the group increased; this effect was independent of nearest-mare distances. Frequency of involvement in aggression did not differ between mares that had changed bands within the year and mares whose band association had continued for a year or more. Aggression was directed more frequently than expected at subordinate mares who were nursing, and also occurred more frequently than expected at water holes. The proportion of aggressive encounters during grazing closely matched the total proportion of time spent grazing. Subordinate mares with foals received aggression more often than subordinate mares without foals. The high frequency of aggression associated with foals and nursing suggests that interference with reproduction of subordinates is an important mode of competition between mares. Such interference may be common in animals that feed on dispersed resources and live in small, cohesive groups.

TI MODELS OF, AND TESTS FOR, RECIPROCITY, UNIDIRECTIONALITY AND OTHER
   SOCIAL-INTERACTION PATTERNS AT A GROUP LEVEL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Research on reciprocity is impaired by confusing definitions and often wrongly used statistical tests. Here two models of the mechanism on which reciprocity may be based are discussed and an initial step towards a new framework for its analysis is presented. A distinction is made between reciprocity and interchange. In the case of reciprocity, for one kind of act the same kind is received in return. In interchange, however, two different kinds of acts are bartered. Three types of  reciprocity/interchange in social actions among all pairs of group-members are distinguished (''qualitative'', ''relative'' and ''absolute'') on the basis of the precision of the reciprocity/interchange. Permutation procedures for association between matrices (such as the Mantel Z and two other newly derived tests) are used as a statistical test for detecting reciprocity/interchange. A rough comparison of the power of the two new tests is included. The tests can be applied to all kinds of group-living animals and to all sorts of social behaviour. The distinction between the three types of reciprocity/interchange and the matching statistical methods are also useful for defining and detecting other patterns in social interactions, like unidirectionality and associations between different kinds of social behaviour. The influence on social interactions of variables like dominance rank, age and sex can be analysed in the three forms by testing correlations between invented matrices  which represent the influence of these variables (the so-called hypothesis matrices) and social interaction matrices. These methods are extended for two categories of individuals, thus allowing the investigation of, for example, reciprocity between males and females. The methods are illustrated with examples of coalition formation and grooming behaviour among captive chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes.

TI MANIPULATING FORAGING GROUP-SIZE - SPIDER MONKEY FOOD CALLS AT FRUITING
   TREES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The food calling behaviour of the Costa Rican spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi, was studied to determine if food calls function as conditional signals designed to attract conspecifics and thereby manipulate the size of the feeding subgroups. First, individuals were shown to manipulate the number of conspecifics joining them by altering the frequency of calling. Then, based on the expected levels of feeding competition and male-female strategies, four predictions were made concerning the frequency with which individuals should call. As predicted, cells were given more often by subgroups containing dominant individuals than by subgroups with only subordinate individuals, in large trees more often than in small ones, and more frequent when food resources were abundant than when they were scarce. However, contrary to what was predicted, subgroups containing males did not call more than subgroups with only females. In general, the observations suggest that spider monkeys can conditionally broadcast information to manipulate their subgroup size and do so in ways that may decrease feeding competition.

TI CONTRAST BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE SONGS AFFECTS THE RESPONSE OF EASTERN
   MEADOWLARKS TO PLAYBACK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two playback experiments was conducted to examine the effects of acoustic contrast in sequences of songs on responses of eastern meadowlarks, Sturnella magna. In the first experiment, subjects were played pairs of their own songs that differed in the degree of acoustic contrast. No differences were found between the bird''s responses to similar and contrasting song sequences. Moreover, they matched playback equally often following switches between similar or contrasting song types. Thus, individuals recognized even subtle differences in the acoustic properties of their own songs. In the second experiment, some of the same song types were played back to strangers. When composed of unfamiliar songs, sequences of contrasting song types elicited faster and stronger responses than did similar sequences. Following contrasting switches, subjects had a shorter latency to answer the playback, sang more often, switched among their own song types more frequently and had a shorter latency to switch to a new song type. Thus, when unfamiliar song types are involved, switches between contrasting song types appear to be more readily detected by listeners than are switches between similar songs. Because sequences of contrasting songs will be perceived as having greater variety, they may also be stronger stimuli for unfamiliar listeners. These results suggest that eastern meadowlarks agree with our classification of some song types as contrasting and others as similar.

TI MOTHER DAUGHTER AND PEER RELATIONSHIPS OF SCOTTISH HILL SHEEP
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations were made on the behaviour of juvenile ewes in a home-range group of Scottish hill sheep, Ovis aries. The group, including the juvenile ewes, remained on the hill throughout the year. In contrast to previous studies of hill sheep, whilst the juveniles remained in their natal group, their associations with their mothers declined from about 6 months of age onwards. There was no indication of any recovery in the mother-daughter bond by the end of the study. In this respect the present study concurs with other work on populations of feral and wild sheep. Whilst associations with mothers declined, the preference for peers increased in autumn and strengthened considerably in winter, as the juveniles formed peer groups that moved independently of older ewes. Peer association declined the following summer as the juvenile ewes again became integrated into the larger group. Although juveniles did not associate with their mothers, cluster analysis of movement patterns showed that at 1 year old they tended to develop summer ranging behavior similar to their mothers. It is suggested that separation from the mother and the development of relationships with peers have arisen in sheep as these social processes facilitate the formation and cohesion of large home range groups with the benefits that larger group sizes confer.

TI CATEGORIZATION OF SONG NOTES IN GREAT TITS - WHICH ACOUSTIC FEATURES ARE
   USED AND WHY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An operant procedure was employed to determine which acoustic parameters great tits, Parus major, used to categorize song notes. Birds were trained first to discriminate between two synthetic song notes. These sounds were models of naturally occurring song notes and differed from one another in five acoustic parameters. Once subjects learnt to discriminate between the two training notes, they were tested with notes that presented all combinations of the five parameters. Responses to these  sounds showed that great tits relied almost exclusively on note frequency to form categorie; amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and the interaction between frequency and amplitude were all used to a much lesser extent. Note duration, inter-note interval and all other interaction effects did not influence categorization. A second experiment indicated that the importance of frequency can be explained by the fact that birds are particularly sensitive to differences in this feature.

TI INTER-MALE SPACING IN CHORUSES OF THE SPRING PEEPER,
   PSEUDACRIS-(HYLA)-CRUCIFER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Field measurements and playback experiments designed to assess mechanisms of spacing between calling males of the spring peeper were conducted in central Missouri [USA]. In 10 choruses of typical density, mean inter-male distances ranged from 21 to 24 cm and usually varied more than the sound pressure level (SPL in decibels (dB) re 2 .times. 10-5 Pa) of nearest neighbours'' calls (overall range: 88-106 dB SPL; range at mean inter-male distance: 92-98 dB SPL). In playback experiments, conducted  choruses of unusually low density, the lowest sound pressure levels at which males vocally responded to a synthetic advertisement call of 2875 Hz ranged from 48 to 71 dB SPL; the median of 63 dB SPL is a conservative estimate of the effective threshold for antiphonal calling. The sound pressure levels of the calls of each frog''s nearest ranged from 0 to 36 dB SPL (median 11 dB SPL) above its estimated threshold. These values are conservative because background noise precluded testing one-fourth  of the frogs at sound pressure levels below 64 dB SPL. Thus, over a wide range of chorus densities, males of the spring peeper usually spaced themselves at places where the call amplitude of their nearest neighbour was well above their auditory threshold.

AB In natural populations of Padogobius martensi, a small freshwater goby, the number of eggs per nest increases with the size of the guarding male. The present study is a laboratory investigation of factors determining this size-related reproductive success of males. Females mated randomly with respect to male size but showed a marked preference for spawning in large nest sites, which were always occupied by the larger males. Courtship interference, nest take-over and egg cannibalism reduced  the reproductive success of smaller males, although the progency of some small males were guarded by the larger males that took over their nest.

TI EGG PRESENCE AND DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE INFLUENCE SPAWNING-SITE CHOICE BY
   FEMALE GARIBALDI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB During the spawing season, male garibaldi, Hypsypops rubicundus (Pomacentridae), defend algal nests within permanent territories on which females deposit eggs. Eggs in the early stages of development are bright yellow and turn grey as development proceeds. Field observations indicated that females preferentially approached nests with eggs in the early stages of development prior to or in the absence of male courtship and were more likely to spawn in such nests than in empty nests or nests  with only eggs in the advanced stages of development. Field experiments involving pairwise manipulations of nests with eggs revealed that, between nests, those that retained eggs in the early stages of development were significantly more likely to receive new eggs before nests that were completely stripped of such eggs or retained only eggs in the advanced stages of development. Within nests containing eggs in both the early and advanced stages of development, females deposited eggs only among other eggs in the early stage. The presence of eggs in the early stage is at least one factor influencing the observed choice pattern. Female preference to deposit eggs among other eggs in the early stages of development is predicted by theoretical and empirical studies on male care strategies and the sources of egg mortality among fishes with paternal egg-care.

TI THE COMPLEX NETWORK OF OLFACTORY COMMUNICATION IN POPULATIONS OF WILD
   HOUSE MICE MUS-DOMESTICUS RUTTY - URINE MARKING AND INVESTIGATION WITHIN
   FAMILY GROUPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavioural responses of wild house mice to urine odours encountered within their home area were investigated for eight family groups living in separate enclosures. Six classes (male and female adults, subadults and juveniles) were tested with 12 types of odour stimuli, including the natural marks of whole families and the urine of individual mice collected from resident and unfamiliar families. Differences in response to odours between classes, and between odours within classes, were due  to the amount of time spent closely investigating the test odour and to the frequency of marks deposited on the test odour, but not to the amount of time spent in other behaviours, the frequency of visits to the test odour, the delay to the first visit, or the length of marks deposited. Unfamiliar odour stimuli were not generally investigated or marked more than familiar odours, except for the natural marks of entire families, and unfamiliar family marks did not deter invasion of a new area.  Mice within each class responded to specific odour cues and there was little correspondence between investigatory and marking responses. The most interesting findings were the lack of investigation and comparatively low marking response of adult males towards unfamiliar male urine; investigation and marking of clean areas by females; prolonged investigation of female urine by male and female mice of all ages except breeding adult females; prolonged investigation of male urine by subadult males;  comparatively heavy marking of female stimuli by adult males, adult females and subadult females; and the low frequency but significant mark responses of subadult and juvenile mice. The results are compared with those of previous studies in test arenas and a new model is proposed to account for marking behaviour. Consequences of this complex network of olfactory communication are briefly discussed with respect to individual behaviour and status within socially organized mouse populations.

TI DETERMINANTS OF FEEDING TERRITORY SIZE IN THE CORALLIVOROUS
   BUTTERFLYFISH, CHAETODON-MULTICINCTUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Both sexes of the monogamous coral-feeding butterflyfish, Chaetodon multicinctus, forage as energy maximizers, are constrained by the time available for feeding, and vigorously defend their feeding territories from intrusions by conspecific competitors. Territory area was positively correlated with coral abundance when data were pooled from coral-poor and coral-rich habitats. In contrast, male length and total food were correlated with territory area within the coral-rich habitat. When food supply was increased, fish attempted to defend all food within original borders but were limited by aggressive interactions with conspecifics attracted to supplemental food. When coral abundance was reduced, residents expanded their territories. In comparison, territories were adjusted as an inverse function of competitor abundance and related costs of defense. Although these experiments support competitor-mediated models of territory size, food resources are also important in that they set a lower limit for minimum territory area and, when possible, are defended in surplus by this species.

TI FEMALE PAIRING OPTIONS IN POLYTERRITORIAL WOOD WARBLERS
   PHYLLOSCOPUS-SIBILATRIX - ARE FEMALES DECEIVED
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Polyterritoriality has been explained as a way in which paired males hide the fact that they are already paired, in order to attract additional females. The deception hypothesis suggests that females choosing already-paired males in secondary territories are less sucessfully than if they had chosen unpaired males available at that time. Lack of time for females to assess a male''s pairing status has been suggested as the constraint making ''deception'' possible. In this study of polyterritorial  wood warblers, the actual options availabe for a female who chose on already-paired males were investigated. There were differences in the behaviour of males trying to attract females: paired males left their secondary territories more often than unpaired males left their territories. This could make it possible for females to assess a male''s pairing status. Since pairing status seems possible to detect at an early stage, lack of time is not likely to constrain the female''s opportunity to detect deception. When females were attracted to already-paired males, the unpaired males availabe often occupied territories where wood warblers rarely bred. This, and the fact that these females had a similar, or even greater, short-term fledging success than those who later paired with the unpaired males they had rejected, suggests that females may be adopting the best mating option available at a given time.

TI NEST SITE SELECTION AND NEST-BUILDING BEHAVIOR IN DOMESTIC-FOWL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Domestic hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, prefer to lay in nests containing loose material which can be both moulded by their body and feet movements and manipulated with their beaks during nest building. This study attempted to define which of these two functions the hen regards as more important. When given a choice, hens opted for nests that could be moulded by body and feet movements but could not be manipulated with the beak rather than nests that could not be moulded but could be manipulated. When the importance of loose material was assessed independently of whether the nest could be moulded or not, hens did not seem to regard its presence as essential. These findings suggest that it is more important for hens to have a nesting site with a substrate that can be moulded with the body and feet than one that can be manipulated with the beak. The study then attempted to elucidate whether it is the performance of nest-building motor patterns or the attainment of the final moulded nest that hens find rewarding. When given a choice between pre-moulded nests and mouldable nests, hens opted for the premoulded ones. The frequencies of nest-building activities performed in both nest types, however, were not different. These findings suggest that the hen has some ''need'' to perform nest-building behaviour but does not have to build a nest herself; a pre-moulded nest is perfectly acceptable as long as it allows the performance of the behaviour. When pre-moulded nests were compared with traditional litter nests, the majority of hens opted for litter nests suggesting that these nests have features (as yet undefined) that are particularly attractive to nesting hens.

TI TERRITORY ACQUISITION AND LOSS IN MALE SONG SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, contested for territories year-round in a non-migratory population. Over 5 years, most settlers were yearlings, but many were older floaters that had previously owned a territory. Most turnovers occurred when floaters evicted territory owners from all or part of their territories. This finding contrasts with the assumptions of most models of dispersal and habitat settlement, i.e. that owners are always dominant to floaters, and that floaters gain territories only after an owner''s death. Territory owners often evicted neighbours in the breeding period, when they were also likely to gain access to additional females. Floaters usually gained territories just prior to breeding and as breeding began. These patterns are consistent with the idea the male territory defence primarily serves to provide access to females. Middle-aged males more often expanded their territories and regained them after being evicted than 1- or 4-year-old males.  Birds that floated as yearlings were more likely to float after owning a territory as an adult than were birds that gained a territory before April to their first breeding season. Individual differences in competitive ability persist throughout life, but vary with age. Factors that affect patterns of aggressive versus passive territory acquisition between populations include: migratory tendency, habitat saturation, length of the breeding period, the potential to breed outside the native population, the relative survival rates of territory owners versus floaters, and the mortality rate of territory owners in the absence of challenge by floaters. An understanding of the territorial system is crucial to predicting patterns of dispersal and habitat distribution.

LA English
DT Article
AB Three experiments were conducted to examine the functional properties of vocal precursors to stereotyped song in socially housed captive cowbirds. Previous studies had shown that eastern male cowbirds developed different song repertoires when housed in different social contexts. This paper reports on the acoustic origins of the different vocal outcomes. In addition, a winter roost of cowbirds was studied to investigate the setting in which males naturally develop song. Analyses of the vocalizations of laboratory-housed subjects revealed acoustic differences from the earliest stages of song ontogeny. The field data indicated that free-living and laboratory-housed males shared the same structural categories of song and that the winter roost provided males with opportunities to interact with females. Taken as a whole, the studies suggest that song ontogeny is a dynamic process involving social and vocal interactions between singers and listeners.

AB The nursing behavior of marked bighorn ewes, Ovis canadensis, and their lambs was observed in Alberta, Canada, for 2 years. Suckle duration decreased as lambs grew older. Nursing behavior in midlactation was correlated with maternal condition; young ewes, ewes with high faecal counts of lungworm (Protostrongylus spp.) larvae, and ewes whose lambs were born late allowed shorter suckles and were less likely to nuzzle their lamb''s rump during a suckle. Sons did not appear to receive more milk  than daughters. Suckle duration in mid-lactation was correlated with survival for female lambs but not for males. Lambs born late were disadvantaged, probably because nutritious forage was accessible to their mothers only in early lactation.

AB Owings and Hennessy (1984) proposed that repetitive calling by ground squirrels, i.e. long bouts of calling wherein the same vocalization is uttered repeatedly, might act as a tonic signal to promote vigilance in perceivers. This idea was tested by comparing the effect of naturally occurring repetitive and nonrepetitive calls on the behaviour of California ground squirrels, Spermophilus beecheyi. Both types of calls increased the amount of time spent vigilant by perceivers, especially in bipedal postures. More time was spent vigilant after repetitive than non-repetitive calls, thus supporting the tonic communication hypothesis. However, longer bouts of repetitive calling did not promote proportionately increased vigilance over that evoked by shorter calls. In fact, the reverse was true and the increase in vigilance to repetitive call began to wane during the later stages of a calling bout. Repetitive calling may represent a case of ''persuasion'', in which the signaller continues signalling in an attempt to maintain some state in resistant perceivers.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF FOOD LIMITATION ON SWARMING BEHAVIOR IN THE WATERFLEA
   BOSMINA-LONGISPINA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Bosmina longispina showed a high degree of overdispersal in nature, which drastically reduced the local amount of food within the swarms. In experiments, swarming behavior occurred only in the light and when food was abundant. In darkness and when food was limiting, B. longispina were more evenly distributed. If swarming prey individuals benefit from a reduced predation risk, the swarming behavior of B. longispina can be interpreted as an adaptive diurnal rhythm in the trade-off between reducing risk of predation and maximizing feeding rate. Maximal feeding seems to have priority over passive avoidance mechanisms such as swarming when the risk of starvation is high.

TI INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN STRUCTURES THAT DISPLAY COMPETITIVE ABILITY -
   LARGE ANIMALS INVEST RELATIVELY MORE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The benefits of possessing (or enlarging) a display structure used in competitor assessment will vary between individuals of a species. For some individuals the cost of developing such a feature could outweigh any benefits accrued. Animals whose competitive ability is high can benefit from display, but there is little advantage in advertising low competitive ability. Thus, since large animals generally win fights it can be predicted that large animals should have relatively large display features. This prediction was tested using data on the moorhen, Gallinula chloropus. Evidence is presented that in this species frontal shields are used in competitor assessment. The size of an individual''s frontal shield varied seasonally. Maximum shield size corresponded with peak aggressive behavior. Shield size was positively correlated with body weight, which is the best predictor of the outcome of agonistic encounters in this species, and the slope of the regression was significantly greater than one. Thus shield size proved to be positively allometric as predicted. It remains to be tested whether or not positive allometry is a feature of all structures used to display competitive ability.

TI THE ANTI-EXHAUSTION HYPOTHESIS - A NEW HYPOTHESIS TO EXPLAIN SONG
   PERFORMANCE AND SONG SWITCHING IN THE GREAT TIT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the results of a detailed analysis of 52 song bouts, recorded from 22 great tits, Parus major, during the dawn chorus. A song bout consists of a number of song bursts (called strophes) separated by periods of silence. High quality males, as measured by average strophe length, sang their bouts with a higher percentage performance time (i.e. the percentage of time spent singing in a bout), but the average number of strophes per bout was not related to male quality. In 31 of 52 bouts there was a systematic decrease in the percentage performance time throughout the bout. This was mainly caused by a prolongation of the pauses between the strophes, and sometimes by a shortening of the strophes. Both high and low quality males sang bouts with and without this decrease in the percentage performance time. Bouts that started with longer strophes and/or shorter inter-strophe pauses showed on average a more rapid decrease in the percentage performance time, and contained fewer strophes, than bouts that started with shorter strophes and/or longer inter-strophe pauses. After switching to another song type the males again used longer strophes and/or shorter inter-strophe pauses. An ''anti-exhaustion'' hypothesis is proposed and discussed. This hypothesis gives a mainly causal explanation for the existence of song switching and song repertoires in passerine birds.

TI ON THE COST OF SEARCHING FOR A MATE IN FEMALE PIED FLYCATCHERS
   FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, were trapped in one area and released in another a few kilometres away, where the positions of all available nest sites and males were known beforehand. Many of the females moved only a short distance before mating, settling after about 2 (0-6) days in early spring and about 1 day later on. The length of the premating period was negatively correlated with female body weight and prevailing air temperature, indicating that the females were subject to an energy constraint when searching. The premating period was longer for females that settled with an already-mated male than for those mating with an unmated male. The significance of the results is discussed in relation to the evolution of avian mating systems, and of male behaviour and plumage colour. Competition for a mate, rather than for food, may explain the spacing of males (territoriality).

TI PREY CHOICE AND NESTLING HUNGER - AN EXPERIMENT WITH PIED FLYCATCHERS,
   FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Prey choice variation was studied in a multiple-prey loader, the pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, by anipulating the body condition of the adults and the hunger level of the nestlings. Parents with high and low body weight brought back similar prey when they were feeding an experimental brood of five hungry nestlings, but parents with high body weight fed the brood at a higher frequency than those with low body weight. Parents with high body weight took more small prey when they were  feeding five hungry nestlings than when they were feeding two well-fed nestlings. The latter result is consistent with a recent model of central place foraging, which takes into account the costs of staying away from the nest. Alternatively, the parents may have changed the currency for energy maximization, and hence the criteria for prey choice; e.g., a shift from net to gross energy maximization would imply a less selective prey choice.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF DAILY VARIATION IN FORAGING COST ON THE ACTIVITY OF
   SMALL CARNIVORES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The daily activity of some predators is correlated with the activity pattern of their prey. If capture efficiency varies as a function of prey activity, a predator that synchronizes its foraging activity with the time of day that prey are most vulnerable should capture more prey, and at lower cost, than a predator that initiates foraging at random. Mink, Mustela vison, and weasels, M. erminea and M. nivalis, were presented with an opportunity to maximize their intake in similar  circumstances in the laboratory. An animal''s ability to synchronize its foraging activity with the time of day when food was most available was tested. Energy costs (wheel revolutions) were varied to encourage an animal to redistribute its activity from a preferred 12-h phase of the light-dark cycle to the other phase, and then back again. The degree to which activity changed to coincide with the most economical phase was analysed for each individual, and weasels were compared to mink. The activity of six (of seven) animals shifted in response to modified foraging costs, but only two animals (both mink) approached the 180.degree. redistribution of activity expected of an energy-maximizing forager. In general, all animals were active during a favoured phase (usually dark) of the light-dark cycle and relatively large variations in foraging cost during this cycle had only modest effects on activity.

TI EVOLUTIONARY AND NEUROBIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SELECTIVE PHONOTAXIS IN
   THE GREEN TREEFROG, HYLA-CINEREA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An extensive series of two-speaker and four-speaker playback experiments using synthetic advertisement calls identified acoustic criteria that may be used by females of the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea, in choosing a mate. At a sound pressure level (SPL) of 75 dB (decibels re 20 .mu.Pa) females preferred signals which had a low-frequency spectral peak in the range 0.8-1.0 kHz and a high-frequency spectral peak in the range 2.4-3.6 kHz. Some frequency preferences were reduced or abolished by changing the absolute or relative SPLs of the experimental stimuli. Frequency selectivity in the low-frequency range decreased with playback level; selectivity in the high-frequency range increased with playback level. Females were less selective with respect to variation of the low-frequency peak in four-speaker experiments than in two-speaker experiments. Frequency preferences were independent of female body size. Females responded selectively to signals that differed in call duration and  relative SPL; some preferences depended on absolute SPL. Females preferred signals with higher (15-100%) than average repetition rates to those with average rates, but did not respond at all to calls repeated at about four times the normal rate. These results are discussed in terms of current knowledge on auditory physiology and recent data on patterns of call variation and mating success among male green treefrogs.

TI COURTSHIP AND MATING-BEHAVIOR OF THE CHINESE PRAYING-MANTIS,
   TENODERA-ARIDIFOLIA-SINENSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The courtship and mating behaviour of the Chinese praying mantis was studied by analysing videotapes of adults in an enclosed, illuminated arena. Three courtship patterns were observed: (1) the male approached while in view of the female; (2) the male approached the female from behind; and (3) the female approached the male. For pattern 1 (the one most frequently observed), the courtship behaviour of the male consisted of 11 discrete components which emerged together 10 days after the final moult. Maturational changes in the male''s sexual behaviour included a decline in the time to intromission with increasing age. This decline in time to intromission was faster in sexually mature males, indicating an experimental component. Cannibalism in the mantis was not causally associated with sexual behaviour, but occurred in association with sexual behavior when females were hungry. Decapitation of the male by the female preceded intromission in only one 69 experiments. The courtship  displays of the male and female may play the role of reducing intraspecific aggression during courtship and thus reducing the likelihood of cannibalism.

TI INTRASPECIFIC NEST PARASITISM AND ANTIPARASITE BEHAVIOR IN SWALLOWS,
   HIRUNDO-RUSTICA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Intraspecific nest parasitism was relatively frequent (overall 16.5% of 261 nests) among swallows, Hirundo rustica, during four consecutive years. Parasite eggs were laid by neighbouring females. Those females, but not their mates, visited strange nests during the egg-laying period of the female owner. Parasite eggs were laid during and immediately after the egg-laying period of the parasitized female. Parasitism tended to be frequent in years with large populations and was more frequent in large colonies (of 17-32 pairs) than in groups of 1-4 pairs. The same females were parasites more frequently than expected during both first and second broods. Parasite females had more fledglings per breeding attempt than either non-parasite hosts or females not being parasitized. Females guarded their nest sites less during egg laying than during pre-laying and incubation because of their large feeding demands when producing eggs. Nest guarding rates of colonial females were significantly higher during and following egg laying than those of solitarily nesting swallows. Parasitized females had lower nest guarding rates than other females. Parasite eggs were usually evicted by female nest owners during pre-laying, but never during egg laying and incubation.

TI PARENT OFFSPRING RECOGNITION IN THE BARN SWALLOW (HIRUNDO-RUSTICA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Past research has shown that in the colonial bank swallow and cliff swallow, parents and offspring recognize one another by calls, enabling parents to locate and feed only their own chicks. To test the hypothesis that recognition traits are adaptations to coloniality, we examined parent-offspring recognition in the related but non-colonial species, the barn swallow. To allow cross-species comparisons, we used the same methods that had been used in the previous swallow studies. We carried out four studies. (1) Cross-fostering expriments done immediately before fleding gave no evidence of recognition. (2) In a playback experiment, parents gave no indication that they recognized the calls of their offspring. (3) In another playback experiment, chicks responded more strongly to the calls of their parents than to the calls of unrelated adults. The degree of recognition, however, was somewhat weaker than that seen in the two colonial swallow species. (4) Newly fledged young did not creche after fledging. Rather, family groups generally stayed apart from one another for almost 2 weeks, while parental care was still being given. The comparative data suggest that parent-offspring recognition via individually distinctive cues evolved in response to the intermingling of young associated with colonic living, and is thus weakly expressed in barn swallows compared to cliff swallows and bank swallows.

TI WHY DO GREAT TIT (PARUS-MAJOR) MALES DEFEND THEIR BROOD MORE THAN
   FEMALES DO
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In pairs or groups of birds it is more often the male than the female who invests more effort and/or risk in predator defence. In the great tit (Parus major) too, the male risks more in defending a brood of nestlings from a live pigmy owl (Glaucidium perlatum) than does the female; this opportunistic raptor takes, apart from mammals, both adult and nestling birds including those of hole nesters like the great tit. A quantitative analysis of this behavioural sex differences showed it to be consistent with two models but not with a third model based on the parents'' different roles in parental care. The Sex-specific Mortality hypothesis is based on the female suffering a higher breeding season mortality. This hypothesis is compatible with the sex difference in defence as it occurs for first broods in deciduous forest. The Sex-differential Interest hypothesis predicts higher male investment because of the male''s stronger interest in the territory and/or in the pair mate. The female investment version of this model is directly supported by the male approaching the predator most closely in the immediate presence of the female.

TI SUBGROUP INDEPENDENCE AND GROUP DEVELOPMENT IN A SEX-CHANGING FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Social groups of a female-to-male sex-changing fish, Anthias squamipinnis, are frequently divided into two or three spatially separated subgroups. Group characteristics and evolutionary considerations lead to the prediction that subgroups result from group fission and develop gradually into independent groups. If so, then sibling subgroups should differ in degree of independence among groups. The subgroups of one bipartite and one tripartite group differed in four attributes of independence:  symmetry of movement between subgroups, integrity of location during day-night changeover and after male removal, integrity of composition after male removal, and origin of the female changing sex following removal of a male from one subgroup. The subgroups of the tripartite group were more independent than those of the bipartite group. These results suggest that groups of this fish may divide in ways descriptively similar to fission of primate groups and social insect colonies.

TI HOUSE SPARROWS ESTABLISH FORAGING FLOCKS BY GIVING CHIRRUP CALLS IF THE
   RESOURCES ARE DIVISIBLE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Numerous studies have demonstrated that individuals benefit by joining existing foraging flocks. However, few have discussed mechanisms by which individuals might actively establish such flocks. This study presents experimental evidence that free-living, solitary house sparrows (Passer domesticus L.) that discover a divisible food source usually make ''chirrup'' calls to recruit other sparrows before foraging. However, a sparrow that locates a non-divisible resource tends not to chirrup, nor  does it wait to be joined before foraging. The time for a ''pioneer'' sparrow to be joined by another sparrow is inversely proportional to the rate of chirrup calls made by the ''pioneer'' sparrow, and the chirrup call rate per individual sparrow is inversely proportional to the flock size. Playback experiments with recorded chirrup calls confirmed that these calls alone are sufficient to attract other sparrows.

TI KIN RECOGNITION BY PHENOTYPE MATCHING IN FEMALE BELDING GROUND-SQUIRRELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female Belding''s ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi), that had been reared apart from each other, were observed in paired-encounter tests to determine whether exposure to nestmates'' phenotypes during development had influenced their subsequent social discriminations. As a result of cross-fostering, test partners were (1) either unfamiliar sisters (reared apart) or unfamiliar, unrelated females, and were (2) either reared with each other''s sibling (indirectly exposed to each other) or were not reared with each other''s siblings (not indirectly exposed to each other). Regardless of relatedness, females that were indirectly exposed to each other were significantly less agonistic during tests than females not indireclty exposed to each other. This suggests that females learned something from their nestsmates'' phenotypes and later recalled what they had learned in order to distinguish between their nestmates'' unfamiliar kin and non-kin. Furthermore, sisters that were indirectly exposed to each other were less agonist the non-sisters that were indirectly exposed to each other. This was true even when the only kin phenotypes females had experienced during rearing were their own, which suggests that females may have compared unfamiliar phenotypes with their own, as well as those of their nestmates. Thus, the phenotypes that females encountered during rearing, both their nestmates'' and their own, influenced their later social discriminations, probably by phenotype  matching. Under this recognition mechanism, an individual forms a hypothetical kin template based on its own or its familiar relatives'' phenotypes, and later compares the phenotypes of other conspecifics with the learned template.

TI MANAGEMENT OF STERILE AND MOLDY SEEDS BY A DESERT RODENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) are known to store large quantities of seeds in underground caches. Over 20 species of moulds have been found in the caches, and experiments have shown that the kangaroo rats prefer to ingest slightly mouldy seeds over non-mouldy and very mouldy seeds. Laboratory experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that these rodents manage seeds to promote an intermediate level of seed mouldiness. The experiments revealed that rodents tended to move sterile seeds to the highest humidities available. The same individuals moved seeds with the preferred level of mouldiness to humidities below the threshold for further mould growth. We interpret these activities as adaptive attempts to increase mould growth on sterile seeds and inhibit further growth on sufficiently mouldy seeds.

TI BENEFITS, COSTS, AND DETERMINANTS OF DOMINANCE IN A POLYGYNOUS ORIOLE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In southeastern Peru, males of the yellow-rumped cacique (Icterinae: Cacicus cela L.) gather at colony sites where they display and compete for dominance. However, because mating takes place away from the colony, males can only be assured of paternity if they consort with and guard each sequential mate during the egg-laying period. There are 2 major benefits of dominance. First, high-ranking males consort with females during the period when eggs are most likely to be fertilized. Second, high-ranking males preferentially consort with females which nest in the sites that are safest from predators, a possible form of mate choice by males. Dominance, however, is short-lived both within a season and over a male''s lifetime. High-ranking males lose weight as they grow older, which lessens their combative ability and leads to a decline in dominance with age. Therefore, young adult males enjoy access to females both at and away from colony sites, while older males are forced to  peripheral positions. This is the reverse of the situation reported for some species with lek-based mating systems. Consorting apparently entails considerable cost to dominant males and acts to limit the extent to which males can monopolize females. The mating system of the cacique is rare among birds, but widespread among large herbivorous mammals and primates. These results demonstrate that sexual dimorphism in size can evolve even when intrasexual competition favours large size in both sexes, as is the case in the cacique.

TI INBREEDING AVOIDANCE AND MALE-BIASED NATAL DISPERSAL IN ANTECHINUS SPP
   (MARSUPIALIA, DASYURIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Members of the dasyurid marsupial genus Antechinus and their close relatives are unique among terrestrial vertebrates because male generations are discrete, being punctuated by an abrupt post-mating mortality. Almost all juvenile males disperse shortly after they are weaned, while females are strongly philopatric. Circumstantial and experimental evidence suggests that mothers cause the dispersal of their sons and recruit unrelated males to live with themselves and their daughters during this  dispersal phase. Dispersal generally involves all the males in a litter and occurs in litters with a single male, those consisting entirely of males, and even where the mother will not breed again. This suggest that the benefits of inbreeding avoidance are a sufficient cause for the evolution of sex-biased dispersal. Alternative causes that have been suggested in the literature are inadequate because of the absence of a class of experienced males that would promote dispersal among subordinates, and the failure of the dispersal to reduce group-size in nests.

TI SIBLING COMPETITION AND SIBLICIDE IN ASYNCHRONOUSLY-HATCHING BROODS OF
   THE CATTLE EGRET BUBULCUS-IBIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Feeding behavior and sibling competition were observed in nine families of the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) from blinds during 1359 nest-h throughout the nestling period. During days 0-19, size differences among siblings were clear; begging behavior of chicks changed with time. At least one parent always attended the nest. Food boluses regurgitated early within a feeding period were received by senior chicks more often than by juniors. When any two siblings begged for food at the same time,  the elder and younger received the first bolus on 65% and 35% of occasions respectively. Between days 20 and 39, the frequency of begging reached a peak. Begging behavior became intense and stereotyped. The number of boluses received per begging declined rapidly, especially for junior chicks. In large broods, the success rate of begging was lower and fights occurred among siblings, espeically among juniors. Out of 256 dyadic fights, the elder sibling won 85, lost one, and tied 171. The youngest  chick died in two broods, apparently as the result of these fights (siblicide). No parents interfered in fights among their offspring. After day 40, the frequency of begging decreased gradually and ceased by day 80. No chicks died in the last period, although the frequency of fights in all large broods remained high.

TI COURT AND SPARK - ELECTRIC SIGNALS IN THE COURTSHIP AND MATING OF
   GYMNOTOID FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB By mimicking tropical rainy season conditions in aquaria 2 spp. of gymnotoid electric fish, Eigenmannia virescens and Apteronotus leptorhynchus, were stimulated to spawn in captivity. Their courtship activity, breeding behavior and electric social communication were monitored in several groups over 2 yr. Groups of both species established dominance hierarchies correlated with electric organ discharge frequency, aggressiveness and size. Spawning was preceded by several nights of courtship during which the male modulated its electric organ discharge to produce ''chirps''. Continual bouts of chirping lasted for hours on evenings prior to spawning. These electrical signals play a significant role in courtship and spawning, as gravid E. virescens females could be stimulated to spawn by playing back into the tank a tape recording of male courtship chirps. In both species the chirp involves a slight increase in frequency followed by a cessation of the dominant frequency. This suggests  a common mode of signal production in these 2 different genera of fish. Chirps are short and abrupt during aggressive encounters, but assume a softer and more raspy quality during courtship.

TI ACTIVITY IN THE FERRET - ESTRADIOL EFFECTS AND CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The present study was conducted to determine whether estradiol increases activity in the European ferret (Mustela furo), whether this effect is sexually dimorphic, and whether a 24-h rhythm is present in the ferret''s daily activity. The activity of male and female adult, postpubertally gonadectomized ferrets was monitored while they were maintained singly on a 13:11 light-dark cycle, before and after implantation with estradiol-17.beta.. Gonadectomized male and female ferrets exhibited equal  levels of activity, and neither sex exhibited a significant change in activity following estradiol implantation. None of the ferrets exhibited a strong circadian rhythm, although weak 24-h rhythms and shorter harmonic rhythms were present. Golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), monitored in an identical manner, exhibited strong circadian rhythms. Estradiol administration may not cause an increase in activity in the ferret. This species lacks a strong circadian activity rhythm.

TI AGGRESSION, NESTING SYNCHRONY, AND REPRODUCTIVE FITNESS IN RING-BILLED
   GULLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relationship between synchronous nesting and aggressive behavior between adults was studied in a colony of ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) from 1976 to 1978. By exchanging eggs and creating more or less synchronous hatching in 2 of 3 study plots, the hypothesis that synchronous hatching among neighboring nests reduces aggression between neighbors was tested. The 3rd plot served as a control. Aggression was lowest in the synchronous plot and highest in the asynchronous plot. More  synchronous hatching also reduced aggression when each pair''s average synchrony with its neighbors and each neighbor-neighbor interaction were considered. The relationships between neighbor-neighbor hatching synchrony, aggression and fledging success suggested that gulls that engaged in more aggression had lower reproductive fitness. The importance of this phenomenon in colonial birds was discussed.

The response developed with age and/or body size. The even development of the response in a sample of laboratory-reared fry suggests that experience of predators is not necessary for the normal development of this behavior.

AB The dominance rank of male bonnet macaques influenced their associations and sexual interactions with cycling and conceiving females. Only high-ranking males formed exclusive associations with high-ranking females, and high-ranking males copulated with these females more often than did other males. Changes in male dominance rank were directly related to changes in male mating behavior, as males who rose in rank spent increasing amounts of time in exclusive proximity to conceiving high-ranking  females, and males whose ranks declined spent decreasing amounts of time in proximity to such females. In the year studied dominance relationships were most stable, and the top-ranking male most successfully monopolized access to conceiving high-ranking females.

TI PREY SELECTION BY PLOVERS - OPTIMAL FORAGING IN MIXED-SPECIES GROUPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Prey (earthworm) size selection was investigated in lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) and golden plovers (P. apricaria) feeding in mixed species flocks and compared with that predicted by an optimal foraging model based on energy intake. As well as the usual constraints of searching and handling time, the difficulty of capturing concealed prey, the orientation time needed to locate prey and the risk of theft by gulls (Larus ridibundus) were incorporated into a model. When costs were taken into  account, small worms were the most profitable. The relative profitability of size classes changed when gulls were present and birds shifted their intake accordingly so that they always took mainly the most profitable worms. Birds were expected to do best by taking the 3 most profitable size classes and the size range taken was consistent with this. There was an inverse relationship between the probabilities of taking profitable and unprofitable worm sizes. Observations of birds were supported  by field enclosure experiments which prevented birds feeding in certain areas. Departures from predictions of the model are interpreted as sampling errors due to birds using depth as an approximate indicator of worm size.

TI AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN FORAGING SUCCESS IN THE HERRING GULL
   (LARUS-ARGENTATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Aspects of the feeding success and behavior of herring gulls, L. argentatus, at refuse tips were investigated during the winter of 1981-1982. Feeding occurs in mixed flocks of adult and immature gulls and is highly competitive. Comparisons were made between 5 age-classes of gulls (adults and immature birds in their 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th years). Immature herring gulls were less successful than adults both in finding and extracting edible items from the refuse. The feeding strategy of immature birds involved more energy expenditure/unit of food gained than that of adults and was therefore less efficient. Foraging ability improved over the first 4 yr of life, 4 yr olds being almost as successful as adults. Over this period foraging skills are learned and perfected, and competitive ability improves. This relates to the delay in the time of 1st breeding.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB At a colony containing 200 individuals of known ages and genetic relationships, alarm calling by black-tailed prairie dogs (Rodentia: Sciuridae: Cynomys ludovicianus) was investigated during experiments with a stuffed specimen of a natural predator, the badger (Taxidea taxus). As in other species of burrowing squirrels, female alarm calls are evidently nepotistic (i.e. function to warn genetic relatives). Male alarm calls are also nepotistic; individual males vary their rate of alarm calling in response to the presence or absence of close genetic relatives in the home territory. Beneficiaries of alarm calls in other species of squirrels usually include adult or juvenile offspring, but beneficiaries of black-tailed prairie dog alarm calls frequently include only non-descendant kin.

TI AN EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY OF ACOUSTIC INTERFERENCE BETWEEN 2 SPECIES OF
   NEOTROPICAL TREEFROGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hyla ebraccata and H. microcephala commonly occur together in Panama. There is considerable overlap in calling sites and spectral properties of calls in these species. H. ebraccata frequently call amid dense choruses of H. microcephala. Choruses of the latter species are cyclical, producing fluctuating background noise levels. Natural vocal interactions between these species were recorded and playback experiments performed using both recordings of H. microcephala choruses and artificially synthesized noise. Background noise generated by H. microcephala choruses causes a shift in the timing and type of calls given by nearby H. ebraccata. Males reduce their calling rates and the proportion of multi-note and aggressive calls at high chorus levels. Playbacks of filtered noise produced a similar change in calling behavior. These changes may enhance the ability of male H. ebraccata to broadcast signals to conspecifics. Vocal interactions in mixed species anuran choruses may have important effects on the calling behavior of individual males.

TI MAGNETIC COMPASS SENSE IN THE LARGE YELLOW UNDERWING MOTH,
   NOCTUA-PRONUBA L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many animals are now known to have a magnetic sense which they use when moving from 1 place to another. Among insects, this sense has only been studied in any detail in the honey bee. A role for a magnetic compass sense in cross-country migration has not so far been demonstrated for any insect. On clear nights the large yellow underwing moth, N. pronuba, orientates by both the moon and the stars. Radar studies showed moths to be well-oriented on overcast nights as well as clear nights. When large yellow underwings are placed in an orientation cage on overcast nights and the Earth''s normal magnetic field is reversed, the orientation of the moth reverses also. This species makes use of the Earth''s magnetic field in maintaining compass orientation on overcast nights. The preferred compass orientation to the Earth''s magnetic field is the same as the compass direction that results from orientation to the moon and stars.

TI COMPETITIVE FORAGING IN MALLARDS - IDEAL FREE DUCKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mallards (A. platyrhynchos L.) distribute themselves between 2 patches of food in a close approximation to the distribution predicted by the ideal free model. An important assumption of this model is violated since the despotic behavior of some individuals results in different birds receiving unequal payoffs. The distribution of the birds between the food patches is influenced by the distribution of these despots. The ducks probably initially use the frequency of supply of food items at a patch to assess its profitability, but over a longer time use other cues.

TI ORGANIZATION RULES AND TIMING IN KESTREL GROOMING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Grooming bouts were observed for 200 h in 2 captive American kestrels (F. s. sparverius). Two types of bouts were found, long and short; the bout length distribution for long bouts approximated a geometric distribution, which can be interpreted as a discrete variant of the survival function. Transition rules in long bouts were based on anatomical proximity. Grooming movements clustered together on the basis of anatomical regions and function. Timing processes could either be accounted for by a 3-level hierachy involving 2 different types of distributions, or a 4-level hierarchy of identical distributions. In the former model, grooming acts per cluster, clusters per preening session and preening sessions per bout all yielded frequency distributions of the geometric type, suggesting that grooming could be controlled by a hierarchy of random processes.

TI PROXIMITY BETWEEN THE SEXES IN RING DOVES - SOCIAL BONDS OR SURVEILLANCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Most bird species are monogamous, and in many instances the male provides a substantial contribution to the care of the young. Traditionally, the initial phase of the relationship between the sexes has been characterized in terms of pair formation and an increasing bond between the sexes. But recent formulations emphasize the role of guarding, surveillance and other behavioral devices that protect the genetic relationship of the male to the offspring for which he cares. Ring doves were studied to determine whether the details of the relationship during the initial period are consistent with this latter view. Experiment 1 reveals that males remain in close proximity to their mates until the 1st egg is laid and the fertile period of the female ends; social contact then falls to a low level. Experiment 2 shows that when the female is removed during her fertile period, the male searches and calls more vigorously than does a female when her partner is absent. Experiment 3 demonstrates that it is visual contact rather than simply proximity that the male maintains during the fertile period of the female. These observations are consonant with the view that males maintain surveillance over their mates, but they do not exclude the possibility that the behavior patterns might provide other benefits as well.

TI MINING AND EXPLOITATION OF NATURAL MINERAL-DEPOSITS BY THE DESERT
   TORTOISE, GOPHERUS-AGASSIZII
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six female desert tortoises, G. agassizii, were observed to consume the soil of a limelayer on an exposed site, or to excavate through the overburden where the layer was not exposed. The Ca content of soil from the layer mined was significantly higher than that of adjacent surface soil. All geophagous episodes involved reproductively mature females during the nesting season, a period in which the females were in potential Ca stress. This is the 1st report of mining and long-term exploitation of natural mineral deposits by a lower vertebrate and may represent behavior at least as complicated as that seen in many ungulates.

TI OPTIMAL FORAGING BY THE SWALLOW (HIRUNDO-RUSTICA, L) - PREY SIZE
   SELECTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The foraging ecology of the swallow (H. rustica) was investigated in the field and compared with predictions of optimal foraging theory. Prey items were selected primarily by size. The inclusion of an item in the diet depended on the absolute abundance of the high-ranking prey and not of the low-ranking ones. Small items of low profitability were included when food was abundant and more small items were taken when they were relatively abundant. Energetics data are used to show that it is profitable in terms of net energy gain for the swallow to take a mixture of large and small items; optimal foraging theory would predict exclusive specialization on large, high-ranking items. Other possible explanations for the inclusion of small items in the diet are discussed.

   (AMPHIBIA, URODELA, SALAMANDRIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sexual behavior of the red-spotted newt, N. viridescens, is described. The male can adopt one of 2 types of behavior depending on the initial responsiveness of the female. If she is responsive, the male performs a brief lateral (or hula) display, at the end of which one or more spermatophores may be depositied. If she is unresponsive, the male captures the female and a lengthy period of amplexus ensues, followed by spermatophore transfer behavior. Spermatophore transfer is most successful after amplexus, and a preliminary cost-benefit analysis of the 2 types of courtship is given. The behavior is discussed in the context of other urodele amphibians, and in the wider context of male reproductive strategies.

TI PRIMATE POLYSPECIFIC ASSOCIATIONS - DO THEY OCCUR BY CHANCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Contrary to subjective impressions, the frequency of mixed-species associations of African forest primates is often no greater than would be expected by chance. Two null hypotheses predicting association frequency are developed and compared with data on mangabeys (Cerocebus albigena) in the Kibale forest, Uganda; association frequencies imply behavioral attraction in the case of only 1 of 6 spp. present. For other species, the simpler possibilities that associations reflect high population density or use of mutual feeding sites cannot be rejected. Comparative data from West African associations suggest more significant association tendencies there. Even where the evidence indicates that tendencies to associate between species are favored by selection, association may not need to benefit both species.

AB L. pseudoflavus Evans form closely packed huddles within their daytime resting sites. Huddles will form if 2 populations of this species are mixed. Huddles will also form if L. pseudoflavus and L. flavus are mixed, but individuals tend to select conspecific neighbors within the huddles. Huddles form only after considerable milling around of the component slugs and form more frequently and involve more contact in dry compared with humid conditions. Moving slugs increase their evaporation rate by 65% compared with still animals of the same weight. Two slugs making close contact reduce their evaporation rate by 34% compared with unhuddled slugs. Huddles are non-social aggregations whose prime function is the conservation of water.

TI OPTIMAL FORAGING IN BUMBLEBEES - HUNTING BY EXPECTATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Foraging behavior literature contains 3 hypotheses concerned with hunting by expectation. These suggest possible rules animals use to decide when to leave particular feeding sites and search in other places for food. Predictions of the 3 hypotheses were tested experimentally by varying the quality of plants (amount and distribution of nectar) encountered by bumblebees (B. appositus). Results support only a rare expectation hypothesis. Bees left multiflowered plants when the amount of nectar found in the 1st flower was below a threshold volume. Bees stayed on plants if they received greater than the threshold volume. This threshold nectar volume is close to the amount predicted if a bee forages to maximize its rate of net energy intake.

As measured by related t-tests of maternal anogenital licking, male and female pups were discriminated in the untreated condition, but not when masking stimuli were present. Female pups treated with male urine elicited more licking than female pups treated with female urine. Maternal licking was decreased by olfactory masking agents and increased by pup urine. Olfactory stimuli from pups evidently both stimulate maternal licking and serve as a basis for discriminating male and female offspring.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Interactions between male and female hamsters were recorded on each day of the estrous cycle in terms of proximity (approaching, leaving and following by each member of the pair). Time spent sniffing the partner was also recorded. Measures were extracted which related to the females'' stimulus value to the male (attractivity) and to the females'' initiation and maintenance of proximity to the male (proceptivity). Both were found to change not only at estrus but throughout the 3 diestrous days of the cycle. Although the concepts of attractivity and proceptivity were originally introduced in relation to the estrous female, their extension to the diestrous period may lead to a better understanding of the social and sexual factors underlying the interaction.

TI SIBLING RECOGNITION IN SPINY MICE (ACOMYS-CAHIRINUS) - INFLUENCE OF AGE
   AND ISOLATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sibling recognition was tested in spiny mouse (A. cahirinus) pups by recording the frequencies of sibling vs. non-sibling pairing in groups of 2 pairs of littermates. Following 3-5 days of isolation, weanlings showed reliable preferences for siblings as compared to non-sibling agemates. Although such sibling recognition was not evident following an 8 day isolation period, 4 h of sibling reunion on the 5th day of this period was sufficient to reinstate subsequent sibling discrimination. While 9-11 day old pups tended to huddle indiscriminately in groups containing siblings plus non-siblings, selective dyadic pairing by siblings occurred by 14-15 days. Littermate recognition is most likely the result of exposure learning during early development.

TI SOCIAL ECOLOGY OF ADULT MALES IN A CONFINED TROOP OF JAPANESE MACAQUES
   (MACACA-FUSCATA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Younger subjects among the 20 adult males in the Oregon troop of Japanese macaques (M. fuscata) had more diverse patterns of use of resting areas. Rank was correlated with consistency of use of paths, as males of lower rank made detours to avoid other animals. Males of higher rank used the most preferred and least abundant resting and movement areas and ate from the densest food patches. Old males and males of high rank were more site-attached to shelter areas. Site-attachment may decrease agonistic encounters, since low-ranking males routinely avoided areas most often used by the site-attached and high-ranking males.

TI OBSERVATIONS ON BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT OF SUCKLING AND EARLY-WEANED
   PIGLETS DURING FIRST 6 WEEKS AFTER BIRTH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Piglet behavior was studied during the 1st 6 wk after birth using litters weaned at 3 and 6 wk. The main changes with age in suckling animals involved increases in overall activity and in behavior associated with solid food ingestion. Newly-weaned animals were particularly active and aggressive, the appeared to have difficulty lying together comfortably. Most animals accepted the new diet in the first day; frequency of defecation increased over the 4 days after weaning. Unlike suckling piglets, the early-weaned animals often nosed the bellies of pen-mates, and frequently pawed the bedding in conjunction with defecation and before lying down. Consistent individual differences in the incidence of biting litter-mates, feeding, and belly-nosing correlated with either body weight or weight gain. Unusual behavior associated with early weaning is discussed in terms of digestive upset leading to discomfort, restlessness and fatigue.

TI EFFECTS OF STIMULUS CONFIGURATION ON ELICITED PREY CATCHING BY MARINE
   TOAD (BUFO-MARINUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Marine toads (B. marinus) were tested for their preferences between pairs of small stimuli presented simultaneously on opposite sides of the body. In agreement with an earlier study of B. bufo, elongation of prey along the axis of movement facilitated prey catching by B. marinus. This effect was significantly stronger for black stimuli than for white objects of the same size. Contrary to results reported for B. bufo, where double stimuli produced only inhibitory interactions, facilitation effects were found with nearby small objects. Inhibitory effects were observed when larger stimuli were used. As a possible correlate of mutual inhibitory interactions among rival stimuli via film analysis showed that toads struck mainly at the leading object when stimuli traveled orthogonally to the toad''s optic axis. These various data are considered in the light of neurophysiological interpretations.

TI STATUS SIGNALING IN HARRIS SPARROWS - EXPERIMENTAL DECEPTIONS ACHIEVED
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR
AB Harris sparrows (Zonotrichia querula) signal their social dominance by variations in the extent of black feathering on their throats and crowns. Earlier deception experiments showed subordinates dyed blacker to be socially persecuted. Two explanations of this behavior are distinguished: cheating on the signaling system is socially controlled and the persecution resulted from an incongruence between signal and behavior. The incongruence hypothesis is supported. Subordinates that were both dyed and administered testosterone show dramatic increases in social status. The evolutionaly stability of the signaling system seems not to depend upon social control of cheating. A new hypothesis to explain the evolutionary stability of subordinance in this system is proposed where dominants and subordinates are adapted, respectively, to defensible and indefensible resource bases, and equal fitness for them is achieved through frequency-dependent selection.

TI SYSTEMATIC PATROLING AND ORDERLY BEHAVIOR OF RATS DURING RECOVERY FROM
   DEPRIVATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior of rats during recovery from food or water deprivation was studied. Both in their home cages and in a residential environment (plus-maze), rats systematically reexplored their familiar surroundings, particularly after they had partly satisfied their deficits and before they settled again to rest. Partial recovery from deprivation apparently disinhibited exploration. The pattern of such patrolling in the plus-maze was, at least, a 2nd-order process; the identity of an arm visited was influenced by the identity of the previous 2 arms visited within the same activity bout. Adaptation to the schedule of restricted access to food and water was accompanied by changes in the parameters of activity bouts and in the sequences of movements about the mazes, but not by an increase in total time spent active. Although rats directed their initial behavior more to remedying their immediate deficits, the level of patrolling was maintained.

TI INFLUENCE OF FEMALES UPON AGGRESSION IN DOMESTICATED MALE RATS
   (RATTUS-NORVEGICUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The aggression of adult male Long-Evans rats (R. norvegicus) toward males of the same strain was tested before and after a 1 wk period of cohabitation with a pair of intact females, ovariectomized females, or intact males, comparable to the females in size. Only cohabitation with intact females increased the aggression of resident males against unfamiliar male intruders. Female enhancement of aggression does not appear to be caused by sexual frustration of males, or a function of dominance-subordinance relations, per se. Increased aggression may be mediated by elevated testosterone production associated with mating.

AB An experimental procedure was devised to test the functional significance of the multiple chirp call (MC call) of H. frenatus. The call was played to individual females and males in a choice situation. Females made no directed response to the male MC call, and seemed weakly stimulated to move. Males gave a significant negative response to the call and demonstrated more movement. The results are compared to a similar work with anuran amphibians and diurnal lizards.

TI PREDICTING AND ASSESSING DOMINANCE FROM SIZE AND COLORATION IN
   POLYCHROMATIC MIDAS CICHLID
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To test whether gold morphs dominate normal ones, 12 groups of Cichlasoma citrinellum were observed, each consisting of 3 golds and 3 normals paired by weight. Golds dominated comparable normals. Smaller golds also profited from sharing the color of the dominant fish. Contest and approach declined across days, but attack and yield remained high. Standard deviation of rank was progressively greater with higher rank, but uncertainty of rank plotted as an inverted U. Behaviors important in dominance showed high dependence on type of fish but low dependence on day; these behaviors also had more variation attributable to the coloration factor. From a set of stated criteria, dominance is deemed best assessed here by an index: (attacks) .div. (yields + attacks); contesting (threat) is actually misleading.

TI INFLUENCE OF SOME SYMBIONTS ON SHELL-SELECTION BEHAVIOR OF HERMIT CRABS,

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The influence of some symbionts on the shell-selection by the hermit crabs P. pollicarus and P. longicarpus was examined by placing individual hermit crabs with 2 similar shells in a choice situation and recording the shell occupied after 12 h. One shell contained a symbiont species and the other did not. The results indicated that organisms normally found on or in empty shells influence the shell-section by these species of hermit crab. P. pollicarus preferred shells occupied by the sea anemone Calliactis tricolor or by the hydroid Hydractina echinata as opposed to bare shells. P. longicarpus also preferred shells with H. echinata. Both crab species rejected shells with the barnacle Balanus amphitrite. Shells containing the mollusks Crepidula fornicata or C. plana were rejected by the smaller hermit crab P. longicarpus. Theses mollusks appeared to exert no influence on P. pollicarpus unless they were large or abundant, at which point their weight or occlusion of available space possibly has negative effects on the crab.

LA English
DT Article
AB In an experiment designed to investigate variations in the behavior of male newts in response to female behavior, 5 males were tested for each of 40 consecutive days in a standard 5 min trial in which the female''s behavior was controlled by the experimenter. In all males there was a steady decline over the 40 days in the number of spermatophores produced, i.e. the number of sexual sequences completed during the 5 min trial period. A number of scores relating to the frequency of performance of male acts and to their temporal patterning are shown to be correlated with one another and with spermatophore score. The temporal patterning of the male''s behavior in a given sequence is related both to the total number of sequences completed in a trial and to the position of the sequence in question within the trial. Principal components analysis enables a number of correlated scores for a sequence to be expressed as the libido score for that sequence. A number of factors which may influence the temporal patterning of the male''s behavior are discussed, and it is suggested that the amount of sperm available and the need to ascend to the surface to breathe may be the most important.

TI DISRUPTION OF MALE RATS SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR INDUCED BY SOCIAL ISOLATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Disturbed sexual performance and hyperexcitability have been observed in the isolated male rhesus monkey and guinea pig but negative findings have been reported for the rat. In this study, 26 of 30 Sprague-Dawley rats reared in various types of social isolation displayed inadequacies in mounting, failure to achieve intromission, and aberrant motor responses typically reported with various species. Of the several attempts to introduce a therapeutic environmental alteration, thus eliciting copulatory responses, only a 3 week period of cohabitation with normal females was effective. Males reared with males, while mating as frequently as those living in heterosexual groups, required a higher ratio of incomplete to complete copulations to achieve ejaculation. Results are related to competing response and ethological hypotheses.

AB Pseudemys scripta, Chrysemys picta and Terrapene Carolina all exhibited head withdrawal when presented with an enlarging, circular shadow enlargement, with head withdrawal occurring more often to a rapidly enlarging shadow. Repeated presentation of the enlarging shadow brought about habituation of the head withdrawal. Recovery from the habituation was still incomplete after 10 days of rest. The head withdrawal and habituation are both seen to be related to survival.

TI EFFECTS OF TAPPING SOUNDS ON FEEDING BEHAVIOUR OF DOMESTIC CHICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The 1st of 3 experiments using 3 and 4-day old, non-food-deprived, White Leghorn cockerels tested pairs and singles, with and without tapping. Both pairing and tapping increased feeding. The 2nd tested chicks over a 20 min. period with 1 min. of tapping alternating with 1 min. of silence. Chicks were also tested with 20 mln. of continuous tapping. Adaptation occurred only under the latter condition. The 3rd tested chicks under 4 rates of tapping 30, 60, 120, and 240/min. The lower 2 rates resulted in small amounts of feeding; the higher 2 resulted in larger amounts. These effects are discussed in terms of a general arousal mechanism.

TI CRITICAL PERIOD IN ATTACHMENT OF LAMBS AND EWES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Ten Clun Forest, 2 half-breeds and 8 mule ewes were separated from their lambs (37 in all) immediately after birth and moved to new pens. Lambs were returned after periods ranging from 5 min.-8 hrs. Only one definite rejection was recorded, after 5 hrs. separation. In another experiment, 7 ewes (5 Clun Forest and 2 mules) and 13 of their lambs were involved in interchanges of lambs between ewes. Results suggest the tentative hypothesis that the ewe will lick the 1st recently born lamb or lambs presented to her within a period of several hours after parturition. Licking for 20-30 min. appears to establish an attachment and a basis for distinction from other lambs.

AB As a preliminary to an investigation into mutual stimulation between quail embryos, electronic recordings were made of sounds and movements produced by embryos of 6 precocial and 2 passerine species of birds. This was done during the final developmental stage before hatching when lung ventilation has begun. Sounds and movements were produced by all live embryos almost without a break. Characteristic rhythms occurring in all species were those of clicking and hatching.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB The sounds and communicative behaviors of the marmot (Rodentia) were studied primarily under natural environments in Colorado. Their behavior patterns were filmed, and their sounds were tape-recorded. The sounds were analyzed on a sound spectro-graph and compared to the sounds of Marmota caligata. Auditory, visual, tactile, and olfactory stimulations are used for communicating. Marmots older than 1 mo. and of either sex can produce "whistles," "screams," and "tooth chatters." The whistle sounds are modified by marmots to form 6 different calls. Interspecies communication appears to exist.

TI AGONISTIC BEHAVIOUR IN WOODCHUCKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Agonistic behavior of woodchucks was studied in natural populations and in pens. Aggressive interaction rate in natural populations was correlated with density and season. Interaction rate, interaction distance, and wounding all indicated decreasing levels of aggressiveness during the summer and early fall even in situations where vegetation night was constant. Pen encounters were characterized by considerably more fighting than were field interactions. Passive avoidance by subordinates was the commonest type of agonistic interaction observed in the field.

TI DIURNAL RHYTHM OF ACTIVITY IN NILE CROCODILE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB By means of a simple aktograph consisting of a float attached to a needle writing on a kymograph drum, it has been shown that the Nile crocodile exhibits a weak diurnal rhythm of activity. When the results of several days are averaged the periodicity becomes more apparent, with a peak in the early hours of the evening. The rhythm is less marked in hot than in cooler weather. Crocodiles show a greater tendency to haul out of the water and bask in the sunshine on days when the air temperature lies above about 24[degree]C than in cooler or hotter weather.

TI ELECTRIC DISCHARGE + ASSOCIATED BEHAVIOUR IN STARGAZER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The stargazer, Astroscopus y-graecum, discharges its electric organs during feeding. The usual pattern of discharge consists of a high-frequency "burst" of pulses followed, after about 100 milliseconds, by a "train" of discrete pulses lasting several seconds. Prey are captured within 150 or 300 milliseconds. The "burst" of pulses appears just before or during the opening of the mouth and positive correlation exists between the "burst" duration and the size of prey. The "train" of pulses is observed only if prey are captured and swallowed. The number of pulses in the "train" is directly correlated with the length of the prey and possibly with its movement within the mouth of the stargazer. "Bursts" and "trains" of pulses similar in appearance to those observed during feeding can be evoked by pressure and by a combination of visual and mechanical stimuli. If the "bursts" result from stimulation of the same receptors which produce discharges during feeding, the results suggest that the visual properties of the prey combined with the water-borne waves set up by swimming movements trigger the "burst". "Trains" appear to result from activation of proprioceptors sensitive to stretch and probably are located in the pharyngeal region. The discharge is too weak to stun predators or prey and does not appear to be used in electro-echolocation or as a signalling device, but the latter cannot be totally excluded. Although it is normally observed only during feeding, the function of the electric discharge is still unknown.

AB Here we examine whether vocal learning in Costa's hummingbird, Calypte costae, is open-ended. Openended learning is the ability of a vocal learning animal to memorize and learn to incorporate new song material into its vocal repertoire after reaching sexual maturity. Open-ended vocal learners are able to learn as adults because they have either a sensitive phase that never closes or a seasonal reopening of the sensitive phase. In prior experiments, we raised 18 individually housed male Costa's hummingbirds in isolation chambers from fledging (day 21 posthatch) until they were approximately 1 year old. During that time, they were tutored and learned song that was individually specific and stable. Here we report what happened when we moved cohorts of eight (in 2017) and six (in 2018) of these similar to 1-year-old birds to communal housing in two outdoor aviaries, placing them in physical, visual and acoustic contact with other adult Costa's hummingbirds that sang songs to which each individual had never previously been exposed. The remaining four 1-year-old birds (in 2018) were instead kept in isolation for their second year as a control, then first exposed to each other at 2 years of age. Within 2 months, all of the 1-year-old birds rapidly changed their songs to produce novel songs that were unique to each aviary. The control birds that remained in isolation for a second year did not change their songs. These second-year birds then changed their songs when they were moved to the aviaries and exposed to novel song for the first time at 2 years of age. Although additional experiments are important (e.g. tutoring adults raised in the wild), our results show that Costa's hummingbirds have open-ended vocal learning through at least their third year.

AB By changing the spatiotemporal availability of resources, tourism-related feeding can have potentially detrimental impacts on the movement ecology of animals, thus possibly undermining its own conservation benefits. A lack of baseline data on natural behaviour and the noninclusion of observation data that adequately incorporates the previous experience of animals with tourism-related feeding have generated contradictory results, causing the true impacts of feeding to remain obscure. Further, the relationship between the energy consumption of fed animals and their space use remains unexplored. Here, we coupled passive acoustic telemetry with previously published observation data at a tourism- related feeding site to investigate how direct feeding affects space use and residency patterns of great hammerhead sharks, Sphyrna mokarran, in Bimini, The Bahamas, at various timescales (ranging from days to 8 years). We first constructed movement models for 28 known fed and na & iuml;ve sharks (i.e. those that were present at the study site but never attended feeding events) to quantify differences in space use and spatial overlap between those groups. We then compared bait uptake of fed sharks with their space use. Fed sharks showed a marked reduction in space use in response to feeding events and an amplification of these impacts over 5 consecutive years. In contrast, na & iuml;ve shark space use remained unchanged over the same period. The seasonal residency of fed and na & iuml;ve great hammerheads remained stable across 8 years, with the sharks leaving the study site during the summer of each year. Our study underscores how the intensification of tourism-related direct feeding progressively alters the space use of apex predators across short and long timescales, with enduring effects on fed animals. Our study further highlights the utility of a na & iuml;ve animal group for assessing feeding impacts in the absence of baseline data. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Honey bees, Apis mellifera, are important pollinators, and they face many natural and anthropogenic challenges that affect their ability to collect the resources needed to maintain the colony. Foragers can make use of a remarkable repertoire of communication behaviours that help colonies to exploit their environment successfully. Food source availability is a key factor for colony success and, therefore, survival and reproduction. Few studies have investigated how food stores impact forager communication strategies and bee physiology. We experimentally manipulated honey stores and (1) quantified the production and following of waggle dances, (2) quantified the expression of immune-related genes using qPCR and (3) analysed fatty acids from bee abdomens using GC-MS 6 days after the experimental manipulation. We found that the number of waggle dances increased by about 60% when honey bees were starved of honey. The number of followers per dance, however, decreased, which may be due to a switch to proactive, solitary foraging or to the occurrence of more waggle dances. Waggle dance duration, the number of waggle phase followers that were followed and foraging distances were not affected by the treatments. Bees in starved colonies showed a higher expression of the gene defensin 1, which is an important predictor of overwinter survival, but there was no treatment effect on fatty acid content. Our results show that the amount of honey stored in hives affects communication behaviours and the investment in immunocompetence of bees, possibly to counter the negative health effects of nutritional stress. However, fat content does not seem to be affected in the time span of the study. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Adaptive adjustment of the FM component of calls in CF-FM bats is not
   involved in avoidance of conspecific jamming
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
DE adaptive vocal adjustment; echolocation; jamming avoidance
ID ECHOLOCATION BEHAVIOR; SOUNDS; FLIGHT; SONAR
AB Echolocating bats observe their surroundings through continuous vocalization and echoreception. Sounds from nearby conspecifics may have a similar spectrum and high intensity. Bats emitting frequency-modulated (FM) echolocation calls avoid conspecific jamming sounds by altering their call frequency jamming avoidance response (JAR). Bats emitting constant frequency (CF)-FM can use other strategies to avoid jamming due to the different functions of the two acoustic components. In this study, seven Rhinolophus sinicus bats were used to conduct sound detection in both single individuals and pairs. We studied how these bats adjust the terminal FM (tFM) component of their calls when flying with conspecifics, and we tested whether acoustic adjustments are made to avoid jamming. Echolocation calls had shorter durations, reduced pulse intervals and higher tFM peak frequency and terminal frequency in the presence of conspecifics. The frequency differences of the tFM component between two bats did not increase in paired flights compared to their baseline difference, and the magnitude of spectral adjustments was independent of the baseline separations between bats. These results suggest that these bats do not use a JAR strategy to mitigate interference in the tFM component of calls. The call adjustments of CF-FM bats are more likely to be attention behaviours rather than being used for avoiding acoustic interference. Bats differentiate their own echoes and pulses from those of conspecifics through their respective acoustic signatures.

AB Kin selection is important for understanding the evolution of social behaviour in group-living species. Yet, the role of kinship in solitary species has received little attention. We studied how kinship influences intraspecific variation in social organization and spatial structure in a predominantly solitary species, the bush Karoo rat, Otomys unisulcatus, from the Succulent Karoo semidesert of South Africa. We predicted that if social groups occur, they should consist of close kin. We further predicted that the spatial structure is not random, but that close kin live closer to each other. Over 5 years we performed trapping and focal animal observations and fitted mini-GPS dataloggers simultaneously on 125 neighbouring female bush Karoo rats to investigate how their spatial structure was influenced by kinship. Females were mainly solitary, although small social groups also occurred, all consisting of close kin, typically females, such as a mother and her adult daughter or sisters. Although females did have more nonkin than kin neighbours, kin lived closer to each other than nonkin. Daily ranges were larger in the breeding than in the nonbreeding season and overlapped more between kin than nonkin females. We conclude that kinship should be considered when studying solitary species as it might influence variation in social organization and spatial structure. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Foraging honey bees, Apis mellifera, need to interact with a range of moving objects, including flowers during windy conditions. Their ability to land on moving flowers, which they demonstrate regularly in nature, would require them to be able to detect, identify and compensate for the flowers' movements. We sought to investigate whether honey bees can distinguish between a stationary and an oscillating flower and whether they display a preference for one or the other. Different sets of individual free-flying honey bees were trained by presenting them with either a stationary or an oscillating flower-like stimulus, which were identical in shape and colour. Subsequently, when prompted to spontaneously choose between two identical flowers, one moving and the other stationary, honey bees exhibited a preference for the moving flower, regardless of whether they were previously trained on the stationary or the moving flower. In a further experiment, a separate set of bees were presented, after being trained, with a choice between stationary or oscillating flowers whose shape differed from the training flower. Here too, bees displayed a significant preference to land on the moving novel-shaped flower. These findings highlight the significance of flower movement to honey bee foraging behaviour. Moving objects like flowers could contribute additional visual salience which would enable easier detection, highlighting motion as an important descriptor used by insects to identify and interact with relevant environmental stimuli.

AB While resource selection varies according to the scale and context of study, gathering data representative of multiple scales and contexts can be challenging especially when a species is small, elusive and threatened. We explored resource selection in a small, nocturnal, threatened species, the greater bilby, Macrotis lagotis, to test (1) which resources best predict bilby occupancy, and (2) whether responses are sex specific and/or vary over time. We tracked 20 bilbies and examined within home range resource selection over multiple seasons in a large (110 ha) fenced sanctuary in temperate Australia. We tested a set of plausible models for bilby resource selection, and found that food biomass (terrestrial and subterranean invertebrates and subterranean plants) and soil textures (% sand, clay and silt) best predicted bilby resource selection for all sampling periods. Selection was also sex specific: female resource use, relative to males, was more closely linked to the location of high-quality resources (invertebrate biomass). Bilby selection for roads was independent of season but varied over time with males selecting for areas closer to roads when plants increased in density off roads. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering resource selection over multiple contexts and highlight a method to collect such data on a difficult to study, threatened species. Collecting such data is critical to understanding the habitat required by species. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many animal species, including humans, producer arousal state is considered a key modifier of vocal production and structure. Encoding of affective arousal state in vocalizations provides a rapid means of information transfer about an individual's internal state, potentially reflecting its response to external stimuli. Meerkats, Suricata suricatta, are a highly vocal species. They use close calls to maintain group cohesion while foraging. Due to their patchily distributed prey, motivation for neighbour proximity varies; being too close results in competition (increased arousal-aggression), while too far results in risks of losing the group and predation threats (increased arousal-fear). We investigated how neighbour proximity and behavioural, social and environmental context influence the acoustic structure of wild meerkats' close calls. We found little effect of neighbour distance on the majority of the acoustic parameters measured, although close calls were longer and had a higher fundamental frequency when in very close proximity. However, there was a consistent effect of the behavioural context in which the call was given across several acoustic parameters. Overall, meerkat close calls potentially convey information on current behaviour, highlighting a potential mechanism in the diversification of acoustic signals.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily transformed urban ecosystems by restricting public human activity to only the most essential societal functions, even as other landscape level factors such as the built environment remained unchanged. In so doing, it provided a unique opportunity to experimentally answer questions about the role of human disturbance in driving behavioural adaptation in urban wildlife. We compared nesting data collected on an urban dark-eyed junco, Junco hyemalis, population nesting on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), U.S.A. campus during the 2021 nesting season, when the campus restrictions were in effect, to a similar data set collected in 2019, before the pandemic, in order to examine (1) whether urban dark-eyed juncos on the UCLA campus altered their use of novel off-ground and artificial nesting sites in response to reduced human activity and (2) whether reduced human activity impacted nesting success. We found that after a >80% reduction in human ac-tivity, junco nesting success during the COVID-19 pandemic modestly increased compared to prepan-demic levels. However, nest site selection remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that the landscape of the built environment or urban predators, rather than disturbance by human activity, drives novel nest site selection in urban birds.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB While native species' interactions underlie coevolution, non-native species might benefit from their novel cues and a lack of recognition, resulting in potential competition advantages in interactions. In predator-predator interactions for example, non-native predators bearing novel cues might experience reduced interference. However, non-native predators might experience similar interference if their cues are similar to those of native predators, such as in congeneric species. Here, we studied aggressive re-sponses by ants towards several native and non-native lady beetles, and in turn compared the responses of these lady beetle species to ants. We expected strongest ant aggression towards coevolved native North American lady beetles, intermediate aggression towards non-native, congeneric lady beetles (due to potential cue similarities) and least aggression towards the non-native Harmonia axyridis. A similar ranking was expected for the lady beetle responses to ants. Furthermore, we analysed cuticular hydro-carbons (CHCs) of all lady beetle species and tested for similarities of CHCs between congeneric native and non-native species in the genera Coccinella and Hippodamia. Overall, similar ant aggression towards different lady beetle species could not be attributed only to cue similarities between them, suggesting that ants might additionally respond to different defensive traits of lady beetles. Surprisingly, we found CHC similarities not only between congeneric native and non-native lady beetles, but also between non-native H. axyridis and both Hippodamia species. Despite similar ant aggression, reaction behaviour of the native Coleomegilla maculata was relatively strong compared to that of non-native lady beetles, sug-gesting a low tolerance towards ant attacks. In particular, during times of food scarcity, non-native lady beetle species that are tolerated by ants might have an advantage over less-tolerated native lady beetles. Future field studies on ant-lady beetle-aphid interactions are required to shed light on ant tolerance and competitive advantages of non-native lady beetle species.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Most phytophagous insects harbour symbiotic microorganisms that may facilitate, at multiple levels, the exploitation of plants. Little is known, however, about the role of these symbionts in insects' host plant choice. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a good model to explore these topics. It harbours a nutritional 'primary' endosymbiont allowing it to thrive on plant sap, and up to seven 'secondary' endosymbionts (S-symbionts) whose roles in plant utilization are currently under study. Here, we first investigated the influence of cytotype on females' oviposition rate on hibiscus and lantana, a favourable and an unfav-ourable host plant, respectively, for B. tabaci. We then addressed whether cytotype affects whiteflies' plant choice for oviposition. Using genetically homogeneous whiteflies harbouring different cytotypes, we showed that oviposition rate was significantly lower on lantana than on hibiscus, but that this reduction varied between cytotypes. Moreover, according to their cytotype, whiteflies preferred hibiscus over lantana, or showed no preference. Thus, cytotype influenced plant choice for oviposition. Together, our results indicate that, without a cytotype that facilitates the utilization of lantana, whiteflies may avoid this host plant. Since cytotypes harbour different combinations of S-symbionts, we argue that these symbionts are very likely to influence whitefly oviposition behaviour.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In mate choice, social learning may take the form of mate choice copying or anticopying, whereby observed mating decisions are either mimicked or avoided. Alternatively, independent mating decisions may be based on innate preferences or early life social learning. While mate choice copying is widespread among some animal taxa, research in arthropods is limited and results are mixed. We tested these hy-potheses using Enchenopa treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae). Enchenopa males produce plant -borne vibrational advertisement signals and females express their mate preferences by selectively duetting with males. Individuals on the plant can monitor these public signals during pair formation. We randomly assigned females to treatment duets consisting of either unattractive or attractive male signals, followed by a long female treatment response (enthusiastic), a short female treatment response (reserved) or no female treatment response. We described the test females' mating preferences before and after the treatment duet. We found that female mate preferences were not affected by the treatment duets. Instead, females had consistent individual differences, which supports the independent mate choice hypothesis and rejects both social learning hypotheses. Our findings suggest that independent mate choice does not necessarily represent a lack of opportunity for social influences from the immediate social context of mate choice.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Dominance hierarchies help to reduce unnecessary fights and associated costs during the mating season. Fallow deer, Dama dama, typically have high levels of male-male competition and strong reproductive skew. Nevertheless, how male dominance and daily fight rates affect mating success is still uncertain. We used a 2-year data set from a large population of tagged fallow deer (620-689 individuals), to calculate male dominance ranks based on their agonistic interactions prior to the mating season ('prerut'), to then examine how rank is related to fight rates and mating success during the mating season ('rut'). Overall, higher-ranked males fought at least twice a day on a higher proportion of days during the start and peak of the rut and secured more matings than lower-ranked males. Males engaging in more than 10 fights per day were less likely to secure a mating that same day, and those males exceeding 15 fights per day secured no matings at all. Nevertheless, males with the highest numbers of fights (i.e. 15 - 21 fights per day) and higher proportion of won fights on a given day had higher mating success on the next day compared to those males fighting fewer than 15 fights per day. Although higher-ranked males secured most matings during the rut, their fight rates decreased towards the end. We propose that engaging in more fights negatively affects daily individual mating success but may benefit mating success on the following day and potentially increase long-term fitness benefits. Additionally, engaging in more fights as the rut progresses probably allows lower-ranked males to secure some matings before the availability of oestrous females ends for almost a year.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Understanding the evolution of animal personality requires knowledge of how selection acts on this form of behavioural variation. While there is good evidence that among-individual variation in behaviour is subject to natural selection from predation, less is known of how personality might affect reproductive success. Here, we observed the sex-specific patterns of selection acting on among-individual behavioural variation in the Australian field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, through the effects of behaviour on reproductive success. In this species males and females show among-individual variation in boldness and exploratory behaviour, both of which are expected to influence encounter rates with potential mates. We measured the behaviour of males and females and obtained two estimates of individual fitness, the number of mates and number of offspring produced, for individuals interacting freely over a period of 1 week within a simulated natural environment. Male but not female crickets changed their exploratory behaviour after they had interacted with conspecifics in the simulated natural environment. We found evidence of significant sexual selection acting on males in the form of a positive Bateman gradient. While also positive, the Bateman gradient for females was not statistically significant. Selection analyses pro-vided little evidence of linear, quadratic or correlational selection acting on male or female boldness or exploratory behaviour. We conclude that among-individual variation in these behaviours is unlikely to be subject to selection via their effects on reproductive success.Crown Copyright (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Individuals of the same species represent the greatest competitors to one another as they have the same demands in terms of food and habitat.Therefore, these overlapping niches might favour interindividual trait variation by promoting niche differentiation. An ecologically important aspect of trait variation is behaviour. Behavioural differences between conspecific individuals that are consistent across time are defined as 'animal personality'. Whereas animal personality traits have been described under laboratory conditions in many insects, including ants, knowledge about consistent behavioural variation in the field is scarce. Here, we investigated intercolonial behavioural variation in the ant species Lasius niger in the field. We used standardized behavioural assays for exploration, aggression, responses to chemical cues of con-and allospecific ants, the tendency to forage at honey and the foraging activity at the nest.Each assay was repeated five times over the course of the season. We found temporally consistent differences between colonies for exploration and aggression as well as for foraging activity, but not for responses to chemical cues. This consistency is the more remarkable as nearly all traits showed strong seasonal and temperature effects. This suggests that traits can be plastic and consistent at the same time. Our study shows that despite variable abiotic and biotic conditions, temporally consistent animal personality traits can be detected in the field underlining their importance in understanding ecological interactions and intraspecific coexistence.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Egg burial behaviour, that is, when parents bury the eggs with a layer of nest material during the egglaying stage, has been described in various egg-laying animals. Several functions of egg burial have been described in animals with different life histories and breeding traits, but rarely reveal distinctive functions between sister species. In the polygamous Eurasian penduline tit, Remiz pendulinus, sexual conflict over care has been proposed to drive egg burial since, during egg laying, females hide eggs from males to prevent them abandoning the nest. Females then have the option to desert the clutch themselves and leave parenting to the male. However, in a congeneric species, the Chinese penduline tit, Remiz consobrinus, males have been seen with females in the nest at night, which indicates males know of the eggs' existence. In this study, we investigated egg burial function in Chinese penduline tits and experimentally tested four hypothesized functions of egg-burying behaviour. (1) We found that egg burial is unlikely to play a role in sexual conflict resolution, as both males and females appeared to bury eggs during egg laying and both freely entered and roosted in the nests with eggs exposed at night. (2) Egg burial does not prevent nest parasitism, as no egg rejection or clutch abandonment was observed in clutches with model parasitic eggs. (3) Our results do not support the temperature regulation hypothesis since the temperature difference between buried and experimentally unburied eggs did not affect hatching success. (4) Notably, our results support the novel egg protection against wind hypothesis since the burying layer efficiently prevented the eggs from rolling out of wind-swayed nests. The difference our study found between the two Remiz species highlights that one behaviour, egg burial, can serve different evolutionary functions between closely related species.

AB Cognition is likely to have fundamental effects on the behaviour and fitness of animals, but measuring cognitive abilities can be a challenge because performance on cognitive tests can be influenced by 'noncognitive' factors. Parasitic infections, for example, could lead to temporary changes in the ability or motivation of an individual to participate in cognitive tasks, thereby altering cognitive performance. Here, we examine the relationship between problem-solving performance of American crows, Corvus brachyrhynchos, in a string-pulling task and their infection status with Campylobacter jejuni, a common bacterial pathogen that is taxonomically and geographically widespread in birds. Sixty-five per cent of the 34 test subjects solved the string-pulling task and temporal repeatability of individual cognitive performance across trials was high. Birds infected with Campylobacter (constituting 62% of the 21 birds tested for the pathogen) were significantly less likely to solve the string-pulling task. This difference appeared to be due to both a willingness to attempt the task and an ability to solve it: all uninfected birds attempted and succeeded in the task, whereas only seven of the 13 infected birds attempted the task, three of which failed. Overall, less active birds were less likely to solve cognitive tests, but infected birds were not generally less active than uninfected birds, suggesting that lethargy did not mediate the relationship between infection and cognitive performance. These data indicate that transient changes in health, mediated by parasites like Campylobacter, could contribute to the failure of some individuals to participate in or solve cognitive tests, although it is unclear whether impaired problem-solving performance is due to an overall lack of interest in food or an unwillingness or inability to engage in cognitively challenging tasks when infected. If the latter, impaired cognitive performance could constitute a subtle, indirect cost of infection that exacerbates the direct physiological consequences of parasites like Campylobacter.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Breeding dispersal can influence fitness as well as the dynamics and genetic architecture of populations, but the patterns and causes of dispersal in most species are still poorly understood. Here, we used 55 years of re-sighting and breeding data from 530 individually marked adult Canada jays at the southern edge of their range in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada to evaluate factors that influence the probability of breeding dispersal occurrences and distances. Breeding dispersal within the study area was rare, occurring in 3% (N = 81) of the 2477 cases in which individuals were observed defending a territory in consecutive years, and only 13% (N = 68) of individuals dispersed at least once in their lifetime (mean age of dispersers = 4.75 +/- 2.8). Of the 81 breeding dispersal cases, 68% (N = 55) involved a single bird, while the remaining 32% (N = 26) involved 13 cases of a mated pair dispersing together. The probability of breeding dispersal was similar between sexes, but females tended to disperse farther. Surprisingly, almost half of breeding dispersal events occurred during the autumn and winter when all or most food had already been cached. However, 70% (N = 57) of breeding dispersal events involved settlement on a neighbouring territory, which may have allowed adults to retrieve previously cached food on their original territory. Overall, adults were most likely to disperse locally when they lost a mate, had originally occupied a lower-quality territory, and a vacant position was available nearby. While the distance and rates of breeding dispersal did not change over time (N = 55), breeding dispersal events caused by mate loss, were highest in years with the steepest population decline, suggesting that a diminishing pool of mate replacements influenced breeding dispersal decisions.

AB The impact of ionizing radiation on overall ecosystem health has become a topic of great interest in recent years due to both several nuclear disasters as well as the growing concern over the normal operating waste associated with nuclear power sites. Here, we aimed to analyse how radiation impacts essential characteristics of invertebrate sexual communication including acoustic signalling and the subsequent impacts to mating success. Specifically, we looked at adult male crickets (Acheta domesticus) courtship songs, which are vital for this species' successful reproduction. We analysed the spectral and temporal patterns of nonirradiated and irradiated male songs (0-12 Gy at the fourth instar) as well as several mating parameters to determine possible impacts of song variation on male mating success. Results indicate alterations of several song parameters in irradiated males, with most variation occurring in low-frequency trills: peak and mean frequency, length of pulse and average entropy were significantly altered in doses 7 Gy and above. Mating success at these doses (7 Gy, 10 Gy, 12 Gy) was consequently significantly impacted, with other mating parameters being only significantly altered at the highest radiation doses. Declines in mating parameters were evident at lower doses but were not significant. Here we show that radiation exposure in early stages of development can result in detrimental impacts to vital components of male acoustic signalling, which may be a key or contributing factor to the evident reduction in the ability of males to mate successfully. These impacts are also vital in understanding the potential impact of radiation contamination sites where populations are being chronically exposed over many generations.

AB Animals can reduce predation risk by increasing antipredator behaviours in areas of high long-term risk (risky places hypothesis), escalating antipredator behaviours when exposed to immediate risks (risky times hypothesis), varying responses to short-term risk based on long-term risk (risky times and risky places hypothesis, or predation risk allocation hypothesis) or altering antipredator behaviours based on habitat characteristics (habitat complexity risk mediation hypothesis). Most research on responses to predation risk has come from studies on herbivore prey, whereas little research has focused on mesopredator behavioural responses to risk. We studied antipredator behaviours of mesopredator cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus, exposed to top predator risk from lions, Panthera leo, and leopards, Panthera pardus, by using a playback experiment to manipulate short-term predation risk in areas of differing long-term risk. We did not find support for the risky places hypothesis; cheetah vigilance was not influenced by longterm risk. On the contrary, we found support for the risky times hypothesis; cheetahs were more vigilant and more likely to flee following lion and leopard playbacks. Additionally, we did not find support for the risky times and risky places hypothesis or the predation risk allocation hypothesis; cheetah antipredator behaviours following a predator playback were not associated with long-term predation risk. Finally, cheetahs had higher baseline vigilance in areas of open vegetation but were more likely to flee from lion sounds in areas of dense vegetation and from leopards in areas of open vegetation. We highlight the importance of understanding spatial and temporal factors that influence mesopredator risk perception and show that antipredator behaviours can differ among trophic levels.

AB Long-distance vocalization is a characteristic of African lion, Panthera leo, behaviour and is important for maintaining territorial boundaries as well as locating distant group members. Vocal signalling is, how-ever, a flexible behaviour that involves varying costs and benefits depending on environmental, social and spatial factors. Motivated by previous data collection limitations, we developed a novel approach to investigate the influence of atmospheric conditions and animal home range geography on lion vocal behaviour using acoustic and accelerometer biologgers. To compensate for the short lifetime of the acoustic biologger, we trained a machine-learning model to detect lion roars from long-term acceleration signals which yielded over 500 nights of data from seven individual lions. Analysis of detected roar events revealed that vocalizations occurred mainly at night with a peak just before dawn. The relative likelihood of vocalization was negatively related to wind speed and temperature and positively related to absolute humidity suggesting that lions preferred to roar under conditions that reduce sound attenuation and thereby maximize calling area. Roar occurrence was found to be dependent on an animal's location relative to its home range with lions demonstrating an apparent avoidance for vocalizing beyond the home range boundary. Lions were also more likely to roar repeatedly while closer to rivers and water points within their home range. This study is the first of its kind and not only improves the under -standing of lion vocal behaviour but can also inform new approaches for recording animal vocalizations remotely.

AB According to Weber's law, discrimination between stimuli is based upon the proportional difference (Delta I/ I), not the absolute difference (Delta I), between their magnitudes (I). How such nonlinear processing of signal information by receivers impacts the effectiveness of communication and drives patterns of signal evolution remains poorly understood. To investigate whether female preferences for exaggerated sexual signals follow Weber's law, we tested females of Cope's grey treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, in two-alternative choice tests, in which we varied both the absolute (Delta I) and proportional (Delta I/I) differences in duration between two advertisement calls. Consistent with Weber's law, female preferences for longer signals increased as Delta I/I increased; however, preferences were negatively related to both Delta I and absolute signal duration (I). This so-called 'opposite miss' to Weber's law (i.e. poorer discrimination performance than predicted at high stimulus magnitudes) has potential to shape signal evolution in distinct ways that differ in the extent to which further signal exaggeration is favoured. Our results highlight that animals use a diversity of approaches to information coding in perception, including coding that is neither linear nor strictly proportional according to Weber's law, and that perceptual processes have the potential to impact an important selective pressure - female preferences - and shape animal communication.

ID MATING-BEHAVIOR; COURTSHIP BEHAVIOR; SEXUAL SELECTION; BODY-SIZE;
   RECEPTIVITY; DIMORPHISM
AB It is widely accepted that hunger state and food availability affect mating behaviour. Hunger state decreases mating activity because of a trade-off between foraging and mating behaviour, except for the cases where females obtain material benefit from mating and, therefore, increase copulation rate when they are starved. Similarly, food availability is believed to increase the copulation rate. However, the interaction between hunger state and food availability has rarely been demonstrated. It is empirically known that Drosophila prolongata increases copulation rate after starvation treatment, for which no theoretical explanation is applicable because no material benefit for females, such as nuptial feeding, has been observed in this species. We conducted a series of experiments controlling hunger state and food availability independently, showing that: (1) hunger state affected the copulation rate differently between the sexes; and (2) starved females copulated more than fed females in the presence of food, whereas they copulated less in the absence of food. Our results illustrate an otherwise overlooked role of food availability that reverses the effect of hunger state on copulation rate, raising the idea that starved females may be more receptive in a wide range of species if food is available, which might have served as a preadaptation for the evolution of nuptial feeding behaviour.

AB Migration theory has largely overlooked the role of overwintering grounds and yet many migratory animals spend most of the annual cycle there. High winter site familiarity could confer considerable advantages on animals preparing for subsequent migration phases, enabling them to maximize migration speed and minimise the use of unknown stopover sites. Despite this, quantitative studies of the magnitude of fuel stores attained at such sites are lacking. To evaluate the energetic contribution of an overwintering site to spring migration, we used manual and automated telemetry to estimate departure date, departure fuel load, flight range and breeding destination of blackpoll warblers (Setophaga striata) wintering in Colombia. Relative to overwinter mass, warblers increased body mass (a surrogate for fuel stores) by an average of 59% prior to departure from the overwintering site. Flight range (mean 2710 km, range 2110-3380 km, N = 16) and detections at automated telemetry stations in North America suggest movements to Cuba/southeastern US, before refuelling and then continuing towards breeding grounds in eastern Canada (total duration similar to 30 days). Total migration length was similar to 5350 km and energy acquired at the overwintering site was sufficient to cover 39-63% (mean = 50%), demonstrating the major contribution tropical wintering grounds can make to migration. It follows that varying the extent of fuelling prior to departing overwintering sites may provide animals with a mechanism for balancing their exposure to risk during migration, while simultaneously allowing for flexibility in migratory schedules in a changing world.

AB The defensive repertoires of prey are shaped by diverse ecological and evolutionary demands. This can generate trade-offs between the components of defences, as in the classic 'fight or flight' dichotomy, or dedicated investment in a singular end, allowing individuals in better condition to mount a more effective defence all round. Further, sexual dimorphism may drive sex differences in such responses, although our understanding of the interaction between sexual selection and defensive behaviour is in its infancy. Deimatic, or 'startle', defences typically combine multiple protective strategies, such as camouflage and aposematism, with a rapid transition between them, and thus offer unique opportunities for studying the dynamics of suites of defensive behaviours. Here we examined the display of the sexually dimorphic mountain katydid, with the goal of identifying the factors influencing individuals' escape response and display intensity. In experimental assays designed to simulate encounters with predators, we found that sex and repeated exposure to predation attempts affected components of the defensive behaviour of individuals in diverse ways. Both short-distance (sprint) and longer-distance (endurance) speeds differed between the sexes, primarily via an interaction between the intensity of displays and exposure to repeated predation attempts. Display intensity was best explained by an interaction between experience and sex: males maintained their intensity across 3 days of repeated attacks, while females decreased it. These results reveal complex influences on the expression of antipredator behaviour, and identify potential trade-offs mediating individual responses which differ between the sexes. Our findings also highlight the need to consider sexual dimorphism and the effect of individual condition when studying complex behavioural defences.

AB In most mammalian species, mothers must protect offspring from multiple sources of risk. In Australia, feral horses, Equus ferus caballus, have naturalized in many ecosystems, and foals are at risk from both predation by dingoes and sexually selected infanticide by nonpaternal stallions. This study tested maternal responses to these two forms of risk: risk of predation through dingo call playbacks and infanticide risk through a comparison of maternal protectiveness of foals in single- and multistallion bands. Mares were more vigilant and spent more time close to foals in bands with multiple resident stallions, where there is a higher risk of infanticide, relative to bands with a single stallion. Dominant stallions spent more time close to foals following the dingo call playbacks, indicating that stallions may play an important role in detecting and protecting foals from interspecific sources of risk. There was no significant increase in maternal protectiveness in response to dingo call playbacks, indicating that mares did not perceive dingo calls to be an immediate threat to foals. While predators were present, infanticide risk appeared to be the most significant modifier of maternal behaviour in this study. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While the mate choice literature has focused primarily on the choices that females make, under certain circumstances males are expected to make mating decisions as well. Such circumstances include when males provide a significant energetic investment in a female or her offspring. Male orthopterans can invest considerable resources in females and have been studied for their mating investment decisions. However, while males provide acoustic information to females, females do not provide reciprocal acoustic information to males. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Laupala males use chemical signals to make mating decisions. We found that males and females have discernable differences in cuticular lipid expression when considering both whole-body and antennae-only extracts. Furthermore, access to the antennae alone resulted in males showing more courtship towards females and more aggressive behaviours towards males. Finally, males showed higher levels of association and courtship behaviour near female-exposed filter paper than they did near male-exposed and control filter paper. These results suggest that Laupala males use chemical signals when deciding whether to initiate courtship and open the possibility that chemical communication has played a role in the diversification of this genus.

AB A major focus of research in behavioural ecology involves testing whether behaviour, on average, is adaptive. Here, we note that although studies often find that individuals differ in how well they perform adaptive behaviour (e.g. some individuals fit the predictions of optimal diet theory better than others, and some exhibit higher social skill than others), few studies have emphasized these consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behavioural skill. We define behavioural skill as performance in decision making on a particular task, while competence involves a collection of skills on a suite of related tasks. After discussing the definition of these and related terms, we present some examples and briefly describe how to quantify CIDs in skill and competence. We then present a three-level conceptual framework for organizing thinking on skill and competence. For the central level, behavioural skill per se, we note that for many ecologically important tasks (e.g. foraging, mating), success depends on decision making in three sequential steps: situation choice (e.g. patch choice that determines encounter rates with food items or potential mates), engagement choice (e.g. diet or mate choice) and execution choice (e.g. prey capture or courtship tactics). At a foundational level, we discuss three types of mechanisms that underlie behavioural skills: (1) genetic and neuroendocrine mechanisms; (2) development and learning (expertise); and (3) cognition. At a higher level, we outline understudied issues regarding suites of correlated skills both within a context (e.g. is skill in foraging patch choice correlated with skill in diet choice?) and across contexts (e.g. is skill in diet choice correlated with skill in mate choice?), and we discuss reasons why different skills might be either positively or negatively correlated. We conclude with some remarks regarding evolutionary issues and ecological implications. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ontogeny of quality-based signals has been studied in numerous animal systems but the degradation of vocal signals with age has received much less attention. Investigating age-related changes in quality-based acoustic signals and the associated social processes (e.g. rank changes, competition intensity) can expand our understanding of the information content of signals and their perception by receivers. To address this issue, we monitored the changes in syntactic complexity of songs in male rock hyraxes, Procavia capensis, over their lifetime. These songs are known to reflect the signallers' identity and quality. We found that age, residency and tenure had a combined effect on the syntactic structure of signals. Progression trends differed according to the signallers' social status. For mature bachelor males song complexity increased with age, whereas it decreased for resident males, which had performed complex songs at the beginning of their residency tenure. This decline in complexity, potentially indicating fatigue, has also been associated with increased competition pressure, reflected in males' increased tendency to become involved in fights. In previous studies on animal vocal signalling and human speech, no effects of senescence on syntactic complexity were detected. Our current findings, however, suggest that vocal complexity is informative and could be reflective of the condition and competitive abilities of the signallers. However, an alternative explanation of lower signal complexity due to decreasing competitive motivation is also discussed.

AB Offspring growth rates impact fitness and can be influenced by maternal effects. Despite efforts to understand the influence of maternal traits (e.g. age, size, body condition) on reproductive effort, much less is known about how maternal traits and environment influence the behaviour of offspring and ultimately, how offspring behaviour may influence the efficiency of the translation of maternal investment into offspring growth. Offspring of capital breeders, such as the northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostris, are nursed exclusively from maternal body reserves and investment is limited by the resources acquired prior to parturition. Combined new and previously published milk energy intake and offspring storage data (N= 38) suggest impacts of maternal age on growth efficiency that are independent of rates of energy delivery. To determine the mechanisms underlying this effect of maternal age, behavioural data were collected from pups of 46 known-age females, from parturition to weaning, across 6 years and three different sites along the central California coast, representing 3954 seal-hours of observation. Pup behaviours were divided into five mutually exclusive categories that potentially impacted pup energetics. The offspring of older females spent more time resting, while offspring of younger females spent more time locomoting and distant from their mother. As pups developed, they spent more time suckling and locomoting and less time resting. Pup behaviour showed strong diel patterns, with activity decreasing over the day. The magnitude of these relationships varied between rookeries, suggesting influences of harem size, topography or environmental features on pup behaviour. Together these findings suggest direct impacts of maternal age and breeding experience on pup behaviour and growth efficiency. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Syntax is habitually named as what sets human language apart from other communication systems, but how did it evolve? Comparative research on animal behaviour has contributed in important ways, with mainly three sets of data. First, animals have been subjected to artificial grammar tasks, based on the hypothesis that human syntax has evolved through advanced computational capacity. In these experiments humans generally outperform animals, but there are questions about validity, as experimental stimuli are (deliberately) kept devoid of semantic content. Second, animal communication has been compared in terms of the surface structures with the aim of developing a typology of animal syntax, based on the hypothesis that syntax is an evolutionary solution to the constraints of small signal repertoires. A wide range of combinatorial phenomena has been described, mainly in nonhuman primates, but there is little support for the hypothesis that syntax has emerged due to repertoire size constraints. A third way of studying the evolution of syntax is to compare how animals perceive and communicate about external events, the mental deep structure of syntax. Human syntax is closely aligned with how we perceive events in terms of agency, action and patience, each with subsidiary functions. The event perception hypothesis has been least explored in animals and requires a serious research programme.

AB Optimal foraging theory suggests that the environment (e.g. distribution of resource patches) will shape an individual's decision to exploit the resource available or explore other locations. Together with the environment and the social context, individual characteristics such as personality have been recently discovered to affect behaviour, offering new insights in the field of behavioural ecology. In many species, personality types differ in breeding success, and foraging behaviour could potentially mediate the influence of personality on reproductive output. A recent study conducted on African penguins, Spheniscus demersus, revealed that bold and shy individuals raised chicks with different growth rates. Here we investigated whether strategies of resource acquisition vary with personality, that is, boldness degree, which may explain the differences in breeding success previously observed in this endangered species. Over 3 years, we deployed GPS loggers, sometimes in conjunction with time-depth recorders, on chickrearing penguins on Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa, and recorded their boldness degree using a standard human approach protocol. Bolder females, but not males, foraged following a more sinuous path than shyer ones. Similarly, wiggle frequency and the total vertical distance travelled underwater increased with female boldness degree. These results suggest different resource acquisition strategies between personality types in female African penguins. However, none of the foraging or diving behaviour characteristics influenced breeding success. These findings suggest that personality may influence breeding success through other mechanisms (e.g. chick provisioning). Our study indicates that, in this species, some nest behaviours (i.e. proxy of personality) may link with foraging and diving behaviours more than others. Nevertheless, the sex-specific adaptation observed in foraging and diving behaviour may result from a differential investment in the breeding season and reduce intraspecific competition for food in this species.

AB Understanding how heatwaves affect organisms is becoming an important issue in animal behaviour, given the changing climate. Exposure to high air temperatures can lead to lethal hyperthermia, when individuals are no longer able to maintain body temperature within their optimal physiological range. Animals will rapidly adjust their behaviour, prioritizing heat dissipation through activities such as drinking and sitting in shade to maintain their body temperature over other activities, such as foraging. Here, we used an automated logging system to consider both the spatial and temporal foraging patterns under a range of different air temperatures at an individual level, in a strictly granivorous species in the wild. We continuously monitored individual foraging activity of wild zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, a species well adapted to arid conditions, in an Australian arid area across two heatwave events. High air temperatures significantly reduced foraging activity, with the extent of this effect depending on the time of day. They also led to a significant decrease in the number of birds foraging together and to birds spending a higher proportion of their foraging activity close to a water supply. As temperatures exceeded 35 degrees C we saw a significant escalation of heat dissipation behaviour. Our results indicate that extreme air temperatures significantly affected temporal, social and spatial characteristics of zebra finch foraging behaviour and these are likely to adversely reduce an individual's capacity to forage efficiently, and consequently its food intake in the short term, while also potentially having implications for both reproduction and survival in the long term.

AB The increased popularity and accessibility of social network analysis has improved our ability to test hypotheses about complex animal social structures. To gain a deeper understanding of the use and application of animal social network analysis, we systematically surveyed the literature and extracted information on publication trends from articles using social network analysis. We synthesize trends in social network research over time and highlight variation in the use of different aspects of social network analysis. The use of social network analysis in empirical articles has increased over time. In the context of social network methods, we found that many studies did not use an association index to account for missing individuals or observations of individuals; that the number and type of social network metrics calculated in a given study varied substantially (median = 2); and that focal observation was by far the most common method used to generate social networks, although the use of biologging devices increased over time. We also observed that most species studied using social networks are mammals (55%) or birds (23%), and that the majority are species of least concern (59%; International Union for the Conservation of Nature, IUCN, www.iucn.org). Based on our findings, we highlight four key recommendations for future studies: (1) the use of association indices is almost always necessary; (2) the a priori selection of specific network metrics and associated hypotheses increases transparency; (3) combination of focal observation with biologging devices could improve our understanding of remotely sensed behaviours; and (4) because most studies rarely study species of conservation concern, it may be practical to generate networks for similar species or populations, which could help inform management decisions. We highlight emerging trends in social network research that may be valuable for distinct groups of social network researchers: students new to social network analysis, experienced behavioural ecologists interested in using social network analysis and advanced social network users interested in trends of social network research. Our findings also shed light on past research and provide guidance for future studies using social network analysis. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Heat waves are rapidly increasing in frequency and length around the globe. These periods of elevated temperatures are inducing extreme thermal stress in many organisms. One dramatic result of heat waves is mass mortality events, notably in birds. Although much attention is given to lethal events, little is known about how more common sublethal temperatures affect behaviour, especially in endotherms. For example, male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia atlantica, sing at lower rates at higher temperatures. We hypothesized that simulated heat waves may also reduce the ability of females to discriminate between sexual signals. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying whether female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, responded more to conspecific song or heterospecific song while at their typical housing temperature compared to temperatures above their upper critical temperature. We collected data on how often the birds selected conspecific over heterospecific songs and how much effort the birds invested in sampling those songs using a matched-pairs design. During housing temperature trials, females preferred conspecific song compared to heterospecific song. In contrast, females no longer showed a preference for conspecific song at temperatures above their upper critical limit, although the birds invested similar effort in sampling songs in both treatments. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that high temperatures affect female preference for a mating signal in an endotherm. Our results highlight the need for future work to investigate this overlooked effect of climate change on endotherms. Because thermoregulatory processes are phylogenetically conserved, our results generate useful predictions for future studies of heat wave effects on mating behaviours in endotherms.

AB There is increasing evidence that the composition of a social group influences the fitness of its members. For example, group member identities can determine the exposure risk to contact-transmitted parasites and consequently impact the health of all group members. Here, we propose that group composition may also affect host exposure to parasite propagules prevailing in the environment via collective parasite avoidance behaviours. We explored the spatial avoidance of a trematode parasite, Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, using the simplest form of host groups, pairs of sea trout, Salmo trutta trutta. These pairs showed either (1) between-group heterogeneity in their experience with the parasite (both, one or neither previously exposed) and matched dominance ranks (assessed through growth rates) or (2) within-group heterogeneity in previous exposure and in dominance ranks. We show that pairs that had recently been exposed to the parasite spent significantly less time in areas of infection risk than pairs in which one or both individuals were unexposed. This result suggests that previous exposure improves parasite avoidance. Among pairs with mixed exposure history, parasite avoidance was most pronounced when the exposed individual was dominant over its partner. We conclude that higher ranked individuals direct collective movements and their exposure history predicts a pair's parasite avoidance. As avoidance efficiency was directly related to infection rate, our results suggest that group composition can shape individual exposure to nonsocially transmitted parasites, and ultimately fitness.

AB Temperate-zone bats likely feed in an environment with few dangerous nocturnal predators, suggesting a life largely free of the antipredator trade-offs faced by most other animals. Such bats may, however, encounter dangerous diurnal raptors with an early start to their nightly feeding, and thus may face predation-related trade-offs in deciding when to emerge from a daytime roost. Non-predator-related factors could also come into play in this nightly decision. We used an information-theoretic approach to examine which combination of a wide range of variables exerts the greatest influence over emergence times from maternity roosts in a population of Indiana bats, Myotis sodalis, covering a 12-year period. Our competing statistical models were based on two broad environmental influences on emergence times: predators and physical (meteorological and astronomical) variables. The best-performing model included most of the variables associated with antipredator trade-offs, assuming that bats emerging before or near sunset experience a foraging benefit and a substantial risk of predation by diurnal raptors. Accordingly, state-dependent behaviour was apparent, with emergence beginning earlier during the more energetically demanding portion of the reproductive cycle. During lactation (the most demanding period), about 20% of emergence events began before sunset, compared to only 5% during colony formation. Earlier emergence was also associated with high cloud cover (darker conditions), larger roost populations and roosts located deep into the forest. Moonlight at sunset, however, was absent from the best-supported model and had no apparent influence on emergence times. Overall, the emergence behaviour of our species is consistent with a trade-off between energetic needs and predation risk, most likely due to the temporal overlap of early emergences with the activity period of diurnal raptors. This behaviour may be more common than expected in temperate-zone bats. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social behaviour potentially plays an important role in invasion success. New colonists, for example, may glean useful information about predators and food by interacting with native heterospecifics. The extent to which invaders benefit from such social interactions could hinge on their prior exposure to other species. Here we asked how the shoaling decisions of the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a successful invasive species, are mediated by their shared history with a heterospecific, the phenotypically similar Micropoecilia picta. To do this, we monitored shoal cohesion in single-species treatments and in treatments where M. picta was present. We predicted that shoal cohesion would be greater in single-than in mixed-species shoals. We also hypothesized that mixed-species shoals consisting of fish with a shared history would be more cohesive than those where the two species had hitherto occurred allo-patrically. We found that shoal cohesion did not differ between single-and two-species treatments, or in relation to shared history with M. picta. However, while guppies were more often found in mixed-species than single-species shoals, they were more likely to have a conspecific individual as their nearest neighbour within mixed-species shoals. These results show that guppies willingly shoal with heterospecifics, even in the absence of a shared history, but also that the resulting shoals are not randomly assembled. This flexibility in shoaling may confer a crucial advantage in the initial stages of invasion. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Plasticity's role in shaping phenotypic diversification continues to receive considerable attention. One especially debated issue concerns the significance of genetic accommodation in diversification, and the proposed role of ancestrally plastic responses in facilitating or biasing subsequent genetically canalized differentiation among taxa. Here, we investigated whether pre-existing plasticity in response to variation in population density present in the ancestral Mediterranean range of the bull-headed dung beetle Onthophagus taurus may have mediated previously documented rapid canalized divergences among descendent exotic populations that have been subject to dramatically different levels of competition for mates and resources in the field. We focused on two maternal behavioural traits, two life history traits and two morphological traits. We find that (1) Mediterranean O. taurus exhibited plasticity in response to adult densities for four of our six focal traits; (2) in two of those, plastic responses matched the direction of canalized divergences among natural populations; and (3) the presence and direction of plasticity appeared unrelated to trait type. More generally, our results provide partial support for the hypothesis that evolution by genetic accommodation could have contributed to the very early stages of population differentiation in a subset of traits in O. taurus.

AB Mirror image stimulation has a long history of being used to quantify aggressive behaviour but its suitability has recently been questioned because behavioural responses towards a mirror image and towards a real opponent are not always correlated, and are associated with different physiological responses. These discrepancies might result from lateral-display behaviour, which provides a way for animals, particularly fish, to assess fighting ability during early stages of a contest. With a regular mirror, species that prefer head-tail orientation during lateral display are unable to do so, which might lead to aberrant responses that would not accurately reflect behaviour in a real contest. We designed a non-reversing mirror test by connecting two regular mirrors at a 90-degree angle, allowing animals to see and interact with their image in headetail postures. We compared behavioural indices in three standardized aggression tests (using a regular mirror, a nonreversing mirror or a size-matched, three-dimensional inanimate model) and in real fights to examine which test best predicted aggression in real fights between mangrove rivulus fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus. Individuals tested with both regular and nonreversing mirrors preferred using right-lateral displays, while those tested with a nonreversing mirror delivered more attacks than those tested with the regular mirror and the model. Individuals with higher frequencies of attack towards the nonreversing mirror had higher winning probabilities in real fights. Contests involving individuals that differed considerably in aggression exhibited towards the nonreversing mirror were less intense and shorter in duration. However, individual differences in performance in tests using the regular mirror and model did not predict contest dynamics. These results support the hypothesis that nonreversing mirrors, but not regular mirrors or models, elicit behaviour that corresponds with the fishes' performance during real fights. Our study validated the nonreversing mirror as a new method for quantifying aggression with the potential to broadly impact research ranging from neurobiology and behaviour to population ecology and evolutionary biology.

AB The trajectory of development and refinement of communication signals closely map physical and social development in many vertebrate species. Although marine mammals exhibit highly complex and diverse communication signals, asking similar questions about signal development can be challenging when dealing with long-lived species that roam widely at sea. North Atlantic right whales, a large baleen whale species, are intensely studied due to their endangered status. We examine whether right whale acoustic signals vary with the physical and social development of individuals from birth to adulthood using a latitudinal analysis. Data included 986 high-quality calls recorded from 49 individuals of known age spanning from 1 month to 37 years, with two individuals measured at different ages. Calls produced by calves younger than 1 year were easily distinguished by their short duration, a high degree of frequency modulation and a high percentage of nonlinear phenomena. Nonlinear phenomena within calls shifted from disorder (deterministic chaos) to increased control (biphonation and subharmonics) with increasing age. The overall percentage of calls containing nonlinear phenomena decreased with increasing age. Duration of the calls and calling bouts increased in direct correlation with age. Notably there was no clear indication of fixation in any of the measured parameters with age, with directional changes continuing over the entire age range studied. This study presents the first evidence that acoustic maturation does not stop at sexual maturity (similar to 9 years) in right whales and that refinement of calls continues through adulthood. Clear age-related voice cues have been documented in a range of terrestrial species with increases in call duration often reflecting increased stamina or condition in older adults. This study shows a similar trend in right whale sound production, with changes detectable across three-decade age range of available data. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A basic tendency to look where others are looking provides animals with the opportunity to learn about important objects in the environment, such as the location of conspecifics, food and predators. Although research has shown that many social species are able to follow others' gaze, the extent to which different species rely on sophisticated cognitive capacities when gaze following is debated. Whereas some species follow gaze via a relatively inflexible orienting response, gaze following in other species may reflect a deeper understanding of the visual perspective and attentional states of agents. Identifying the mechanisms underlying gaze following in different species is the critical first step to addressing the challenging ultimate question of why different species vary in their gaze-following skills. Therefore, we explored whether rhesus macaques have a mentalistic understanding of gaze. Specifically, we tested whether rhesus macaques are able to incorporate representations of a partner's knowledge state into their gaze-following response. In our study, macaques saw a human actor look to a distant location in a surprised manner. We manipulated whether or not the actor had previously seen the very first object in his line of sight. We found that monkeys looked for an alternative target of the actor's gaze more quickly when the actor had previously seen the object compared to when he had not. This suggests that rhesus macaques may have a mentalistic understanding of gaze cues. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multimodal communication has received increasing attention in recent years. While much is understood about how intended receivers (such as potential mates) respond to multimodal displays, less is known about how eavesdropping predators perceive and interpret these cues. The male tungara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus, is a neotropical anuran that attracts females with an acoustic call and a dynamically inflating/deflating vocal sac. However, the tungara frog's multimodal courtship display also attracts eavesdropping predators, such as fringe-lipped bats, Trachops cirrhosus. We utilized robotic frog models to expose fringe-lipped bats to multimodal tungara frog courtship displays. The models varied in call amplitude and/or the presence of vocal sac cues. In a two-choice test, we show that fringe-lipped bats more often attack higher-amplitude calls. Additionally, coupling the inflating vocal sac cues to the lower-amplitude frog call increased the probability that a bat would attack this less attractive call. Previous studies have demonstrated that vocal sac cues do not increase the attractiveness of low-amplitude calls to female P. pustulosus. Thus, although natural selection, through the bats, and sexual selection, through the female frogs, exert counter-selection forces on the male's sexual display, the strength of these forces are not symmetrical. We discuss possible explanations for why this might be the case. This study underlines the importance of understanding the contribution of both intended and unintended receivers on signal evolution, and it helps explain how selection pressures might vary across sensory modalities.

AB There has been great interest in how complex social behaviours such as cooperative breeding evolve and are maintained; however, it is still unclear what exact phenomena trigger the transition to cooperative breeding. Recent work in birds has suggested a number of factors associated with cooperative breeding, including environmental uncertainty and brood parasitism. One recent study found a correlation between brood parasitism and cooperative breeding, but it examined this relationship from a geographically restricted perspective. We investigated evolutionary correlations between brood parasitism and cooperative breeding at a global scale, including nearly half of all bird species and brood parasites. At a global level, we found a strong positive correlation between cooperative breeding and brood parasitism. However, when partitioned regionally, we found that the global pattern was driven exclusively by relationships within Africa and Australia, suggesting that any causal relationship in the transition to cooperative breeding is idiosyncratic. In addition, we found that even where a correlation was supported, transition rates between states were more consistent with cooperative breeding attracting brood parasitism, rather than brood parasites driving the evolution of cooperative breeding, weakening any hypothesized causal connection.

AB The social environment is a pervasive influence on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of animal populations. Recently, social network analysis has provided an increasingly powerful and diverse toolset to enable animal behaviour researchers to quantify the social environment of animals and the impact that it has on ecological and evolutionary processes. However, there is considerable scope for improving these methods further. We outline an approach specifically designed to model the formation of network links, exponential random graph models ( ERGMs), which have great potential for modelling animal social structure. ERGMs are generative models that treat network topology as a response variable. This makes them ideal for answering questions related directly to how and why social associations or interactions occur, from the modelling of population level transmission, through within-group behavioural dynamics to social evolutionary processes. We discuss how ERGMs have been used to study animal behaviour previously, and how recent developments in the ERGM framework can increase the scope of their use further. We also highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this approach relative to more conventional methods, and provide some guidance on the situations and research areas in which they can be used appropriately. ERGMs have the potential to be an important part of an animal behaviour researcher's toolkit and fully integrating them into the field should enhance our ability to understand what shapes animal social interactions, and identify the underlying processes that lead to the social structure of animal populations.

AB Animals may divert time and energy in similar ways in the presence of predators, humans or landscape infrastructures. Roads have facilitated the economic and social development of human populations. Nevertheless their presence and human use cause environmental changes, such as clearing, which increase perception of predation risk. Among the responses to this are changes in animal behaviours. In the present study, we sought to assess whether roads in an Argentine reserve affect perception of predation risk by guanacos, Lama guanicoe, through behaviour changes. We analysed the effects of two types of roads (unpaved track and paved route) and their surrounding environment (e.g. vegetation structure) on group size variation and on three behaviours: vigilance, foraging and movement. We also used the group structure of guanacos, such as the number of calves, to explain these behaviours. Roads in the protected area had no impact on the size of guanaco groups. However, individuals in larger groups were less vigilant and foraged more closely to roads, indicating that closeness to roads is less risky for these animals. Although guanacos' time spent moving was not affected by roads, nearness to the unpaved track and high plant cover showed the highest proportions of animals moving in the area, and individuals moved more when in small groups and in areas with medium-height vegetation. The number of individuals displaying vigilance or foraging behaviours was not affected by any of the explanatory variables. Based on these findings, we conclude that guanacos perceive the roadside environment as safer, possibly because open areas adjacent to roads facilitate detection of predators. Knowing the effects of roads on wildlife in protected areas is necessary to find ways to reach a balance between the economic development of a region and conservation of its biodiversity.

AB It is becoming increasingly clear that copulation does not necessarily always lead to offspring production in many organisms, despite fertilization success presumably being under both strong natural and sexual selection. In the seed bug Lygaeus simulans, between 40% and 60% of copulations fail to produce offspring, with this 'mating failure' representing a significantly repeatable male-associated trait. Mating has been demonstrated to be costly in this species and, as such, we might expect females to minimize the chance of mating failure by displaying a preference for males with higher insemination success where possible. After assaying males for mating failure, we asked whether females preferred males with a history of successful inseminations versus unsuccessful inseminations in pairwise mate choice trials. Contrary to our expectations, females showed no preference for more successful over less successful males. Moreover, females showed no preference for larger males in the choice trials, even though larger males were significantly more likely to successfully inseminate females in the initial assay. This apparent lack of female precopulatory choice suggests that postcopulatory choice mechanisms may be key to mating failure in this species. However, this does not necessarily explain why females pay the cost of mating with males they will then reject via postcopulatory processes. More generally, our results suggest that mating failure may play a largely underappreciated role in mating systems evolution, influencing both the cost of choosiness, and the costs and benefits of polyandry.

AB Understanding the evolution of cooperation remains a central concern in studies of animal behaviour, with fundamental issues being how individuals avoid being cheated, or 'short-changed', and how partners are chosen. Economic decisions made during social interactions should depend upon the availability of potential partners nearby, as these bystanders generate temptations to defect from the current partner. The influence of bystanders is highlighted in two theoretical approaches, biological markets theory and parcelling, both economic models of behaviour. Here, we tested predictions of these models using the grooming behaviour of wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, living under strong structural despotism, where grooming is exchanged both for agonistic support and for itself, and so we provide the first investigation of both presence and value of bystanders on chimpanzees' grooming decisions. We found that male chimpanzees took into account the relative value (rank) of bystanders compared to that of their current partner, with this more important than bystander numbers. High-ranking bystanders appeared to generate incentives to defect from a potentially cooperative interaction and we found that grooming effort was parcelled into discrete episodes, with smaller parcels used when a bystander outranked the current partner. The number of bystanders also generated a temptation to defect, as bidirectional (reciprocated) bouts were more likely to occur with fewer bystanders. Such bouts were more likely with smaller rank distances between groomer and recipient. We found no influence of grooming relationship on initial investment: groomers did not appear to trust that they would receive grooming in return, even from those with whom they had a history of strongly reciprocal grooming. Our findings are consistent with an economic-benefits, markets-based approach, but not a relationship model paradigm. Our work highlights the importance of considering the immediate social context (number and quality of bystanders) in studies of cooperation. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB In the context of breeding phenology, social behaviour (especially song) has long been considered an important 'supplemental cue' that females integrate with other environmental information to determine timing of egg laying. However, to our knowledge, no studies have experimentally manipulated song in the wild in the context of female breeding phenology and performance. We studied natural variation in, and response to experimental manipulation of, prebreeding song and social behaviour in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, to determine whether male behaviour acts as a phenological cue determining female timing of egg laying and subsequent, postlaying breeding performance. In our highly synchronous system, natural variation in prebreeding male song quality and singing effort was surprisingly high, and singing increased slightly closer to egg-laying date. There was a strong prebreeding response of both males and females to the playback treatment, but no effect on female breeding phenology (egg-laying date) or performance (nestbox occupancy, egg size, clutch size, total chicks hatched, total chicks fledged or double-brooding behaviour). Our 3-year study finds no evidence that male prebreeding song is a cue determining female breeding phenology or performance in starlings. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Several biological functions, such as reproductive success, peak during middle age in long-lived vertebrates. One possible mechanism for that peak is improved foraging performance during middle age, after a period of youthful inexperience and before senescence. Age may be particularly important in relating foraging behaviour to fitness for diving animals as altered skeletal muscle contraction efficiency or cardiovascular function could play a strong role at the scale of a single dive. Miniaturized accelerometers provide the opportunity to measure fine-scale foraging behaviour at the scale of a single wing beat. To examine the relationship between age and foraging behaviour in a diving seabird, whose reproductive success peaks during middle age, we equipped 115 thick-billed murres, Uria lomvia, with accelerometers and depth loggers. Murre activity (i.e. dynamic body acceleration) decreased with increasing dive depth during descent but increased with increasing maximum depth achieved. These patterns were inversed during ascent. After accounting for depth and maximum depth, middle-aged birds had low activity levels during the dive, compared with old and young birds, suggesting that old and young birds were less efficient at diving and foraging than middle-aged birds. Young individuals appeared to struggle at depths above 20 m during descent and throughout ascent when compared to middle-aged birds, while old individuals struggled at the end of deep dives during descent and during the initial parts of ascent when compared to the same middle-age class. We conclude that there is a link between foraging behaviour and age, contrary to previous findings. By examining foraging behaviour at a fine-scale, such as a dive, different energy expenditures across age groups were revealed, giving us insight on how seabirds are affected by senescence in the wild.

AB In monogamous species that provide biparental care, partners with similar behavioural types generally have a better reproductive success than dissimilar ones. The pattern of assortative mating for behavioural type is thus often interpreted as resulting from a mate choice process. However, an alternative process is also possible when the partners become similar through postpairing adjustments (behavioural convergence). The disentanglement of these two nonexclusive mechanisms is an important evolutionary question. Only sexual selection based on behavioural similarity before pairing can explain the maintenance of the behavioural type variability. In a previous study, we reported the existence of behavioural convergence for aggressiveness between partners in convict cichlids Amatitlania siquia, a monogamous tropical fish. We tested herein the assumption of mate choice based on behavioural similarity for aggressiveness using either short-term binary choice or long-term group level pairing. Pairing was not based on behavioural similarity between potential partners. Choosing a behaviourally compatible partner is a complex task because it requires profiling the potential mates. Individuals would thus achieve higher fitness benefits from choosing a partner on more conspicuous criteria (such as size for instance) and then attempt to increase partner similarity by convergence after pairing. Sexual selection does not appear to drive the maintenance of aggressiveness type variability in convict cichlids. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Chestnut-sided warblers use rare song types in extreme aggressive
   contexts
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article

ID REPERTOIRE SIZE; SIGNAL; BIRD; ORGANIZATION; VARIABILITY; POPULATION
AB Songbirds of a number of species use song repertoires that contain some song types that are uttered only rarely, and are therefore unlikely to be heard by the typical listener. Singing patterns that hide song types are difficult to reconcile with putative repertoire functions that require listeners to evaluate the size or diversity of singers' repertoires. Perhaps in species with repertoires that include rarely used song types, the rare types serve a function that is required only rarely. Based on observations of chestnut-sided warblers, Setophaga pensylvanica, I hypothesized that in this species, rarely used song types are reserved for use in extreme aggressive contexts. I experimentally simulated such a context (a prolonged territorial intrusion by a male competitor) by presenting song playback and a taxidermic mount on chestnut-sided warbler territories. The targeted males were much more likely to use their rare song types during the simulated intrusions than during natural baseline singing. A similar but smaller effect was evident in an analysis of natural singing that compared songs associated with fighting and chasing with songs that were not. Use of rare song types by experimental subjects did not predict their likelihood of attacking the simulated intruder. If this lack of predictive value is not an experimental artefact and extends to natural interactions, it suggests that despite their association with highly aggressive contexts, rarely used song types might not represent the strongest possible signal of aggressive motivation in chestnut-sided warblers. Perhaps use of rare types instead represents the penultimate level in a graded series of aggressive signals that culminates with a signal variant that went undetected in this experiment.

AB Many species produce specific signals in response to environmental events. The specificity of these signals allows receivers to react appropriately to an event in the absence of other contextual cues. These functionally referential signals can be auditory, visual or multimodal and occur in antipredator, food and social cohesion contexts. In birds, acoustic signals used in antipredator defence are the most often studied. However, several species of birds produce functionally referential signals in other modalities, including gestures, and in other contexts, including food and social contact. The prevalence of functionally referential visual or multimodal signals may be underestimated. More research using innovative techniques is needed to test these signals. Food calls, particularly those produced during food provisioning, also require further study and may shed light on the ontogeny of food signals. Comparative studies across closely related species of birds may also reveal differences in the development of functionally referential versus motivational signals. Taken together, the type of research into functionally referential signals suggested herein will likely further our understanding of the ecological, social and physiological pressures that have shaped communication in birds.

AB In eusocial insects, daughters rear the offspring of the queen to adulthood. In the honeybee, Apis mellifera, nurses rear young and old larvae, which emit divergent pheromones. These larval pheromones in turn affect nurse bee behaviour and physiology. To determine whether larvae and their associated pheromones have long-term physiological and behavioural effects (a priming influence) on nurse behaviour, we examined the effects on young workers of exposure to young larvae, old larvae or the young larval pheromone e-beta ocimene (e beta) relative to a broodless control population. We also tested whether exposing nurses to the volatile eb pheromone of young larvae was sufficient by itself to produce physiological changes similar to those caused by exposure to live larvae. To disentangle the releaser and primer effects of brood pheromones on age of first foraging and collection bias, bees were primed for only the first 10 days of adult life. The early environment of maturing caregivers was found to alter the circulating titres of vitellogenin and juvenile hormone in nurses. Live brood treatments suppressed ovary activation. The brood environments also significantly reduced the age of first foraging, while priming with eb increased the proportion of pollen foragers. Collectively, these results support the view that the reproductive regulatory network is sensitive to colony conditions, and this network is used to mediate the foraging division of labour.

AB Laboratory measures of personality traits are often used to answer both evolutionary and ecological questions involving behavioural variations in the wild within and between populations. However, little is known about the actual behavioural mechanisms behind any correlation with behaviours in the wild, and traits often lack validation in a different context. We examined whether the commonly used exploration behaviour trait constitutes an active exploration strategy, by testing whether the activity in the exploration test could also be captured in a different exploration context. We subjected great tits, Parus major, to two different tests, one being the standardized exploration behaviour test and one a newly constructed test. The new test arena contained eight large rooms connected by corridors, where we scored the activity of individuals and the number of rooms visited as a proxy for exploration. We found that our new exploration test captured repeatable behaviour in activity and exploration of rooms both within and across years. We found no correlations between the two tests, suggesting that they may not capture the same behaviour, in terms of exploration of rooms or activity. We conclude that in our study population, the classic exploration behaviour test seems context specific, rather than constituting a general exploration strategy. (C) 2016 The Authors.

   RECEPTIVITY
AB Courtship signalling, necessary for the recognition of potential mates, is often complex, using many modalities with multiple components. Drosophila courtship comprises chemical, tactile, visual and acoustic stimuli. Ablation of single sensory channels, either signal production or reception, can determine the roles of individual modalities in overall reproductive success. Adding measures of courtship timing, particularly courtship latency, the time for the male to initiate courtship, and courtship duration, the time from courtship initiation until the female accepts the male for copulation, allows us to identify the stage of courtship at which a signal acts. This study focuses on Drosophila saltans, a member of the saltans species group. Little is known about sexual behaviour of species in this group, part of the Sophophora subgenus. In the present study, we found that ablation of any one signal in D. saltans did not eliminate mating, thus courtship is multimodal. In addition to examining the signals and signal reception common to most Drosophila species, we also examined the role that the midtarsi play in courtship. The removal of the female's midtarsi significantly reduced mating occurrence. Using timing data, we discerned that the absence of midtarsi in the female did not affect the male's ability to identify the female as a potential mate, but the male may be unable to sufficiently stimulate the female to copulation. Measuring courtship latency and courtship duration, as well as the occurrence of courtship and copulation, allowed us to determine whether a particular signal plays a role in activating the male to initiate courtship or stimulating the female to mate.

AB It can be difficult to assess the degree to which a female attends to an individual element of a multicomponent male courtship display. Quantifying behaviours where females actively sample a male display element (such as smelling or tasting a chemical signal) can provide detailed information about differences between females in their sampling behaviour and reliance on that element in making mate choice decisions. Bower 'paint' is a unique male sexual display trait found in satin bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus violaceus. Male bowerbirds masticate dried hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) needles and apply this paste to the inside walls of their bowers. Female bowerbirds move among bowers of different males until they choose a mate. Recent mate searching experience and other factors appear to affect this process. Females visiting bowers taste the paint when they nip at the painted wall. Why females sample paint is unknown, but there is now strong evidence that female sampling of paint is important in mate selection. We tested the hypothesis that tasting is related to female uncertainty in mate choice. We found that a greater tendency of females to taste paint on bowers was associated with three measures of female mate choice uncertainty: (1) more frequent female visits to bowers, (2) mating with multiple males and (3) switching frequently among visited males. We suggest that high rates of tasting are predictive of female uncertainty in mate choice, perhaps due to some females initially having limited information about the quality of potential mates.

AB Behaviours such as territoriality, navigation and acquisition of food resources depend on spatially based cognition, which has been positively associated with the hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for spatial processing. We previously demonstrated that differential demands on spatial processing within the context of territoriality affect brain volume in the side-blotched lizard, Uta stansburiana: territorial males have larger cortices (reptilian hippocampal homologues) than nonterritorial males. However, it is still unclear whether these cortical differences are based on potential differences in experiences, genetic architecture, or a combination of both. In this study, we specifically focused on the role of experiences in the cortical phenotype. We hatched and raised territorial and nonterritorial males to adulthood, controlling for differential environmental experiences, and found that cortical volume did not differ between laboratory-reared territorial and nonterritorial males. Furthermore, when compared with wild-caught individuals, laboratory-reared individuals had significantly smaller cortical volumes, regardless of territorial predisposition. These results indicate that a large component of the differential cortical volume found between territorial and nonterritorial lizards in the wild must be experiential. Additionally, cortical volume is smaller in a captive environment, regardless of territorial predisposition. Our work indicates that experience, particularly experience with a simplified environment such as that found in captivity, dramatically limits the size of the cortices in this species.

AB Monogamous pair bonds can be transient or long-lasting, which varies across species. The neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating pair maintenance behaviours are largely unknown, yet fundamental to our understanding of monogamy. Furthermore, the expression and regulation of pair maintenance behaviour is likely to be greatly influenced by social and environmental contexts. Our previous research suggested that androgens might regulate long-term pair maintenance behaviour in the monogamous zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. Here, we tested the hypothesis that testosterone treatment to males affects long-term pair maintenance behaviour in zebra finches. Established pairs were randomly assigned to one of two groups: control (N = 8) or testosterone (N = 7). Males were given either an empty or a testosterone-filled Silastic implant. Physical and acoustic affiliative behaviours and plasma testosterone levels were examined at three time points: pre-implantation, 30 days post-implant and 60 days post-implant. Importantly, we examined affiliative behaviours under two contexts: in the home cage (baseline) and following a brief chase (post stressor). Male testosterone treatment had no effects on behaviour during the baseline period, but significantly affected behaviours during the post stressor period. Specifically, testosterone-treated males spent less time in close proximity to their partner and sang more. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a context-dependent effect in the neuroendocrine regulation of pair maintenance behaviour, as well as the first report of an inhibitory effect of testosterone on zebra finch pairing behaviours. These results raise interesting questions about the function of affiliative behaviours in established pair bonds. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are usually depicted as sexually submissive and bound by male coercion, because males are able to monopolize oestrous females, limiting a female's options for mate choice. We present behavioural data from a group of wild chimpanzees during a rare period in which up to 10 females cycled simultaneously, which prevented males from monopolizing oestrous females, thus changing the dynamic of male-female sexual interactions. Overall, we found that nulliparous and parous females employed different copulation calling strategies, reflecting their relative reproductive attractiveness and social standing within the community. Male partner rank, copulation duration and dominant male audience further influenced calling behaviour, and there was a nonsignificant trend for females to increase calling as the number of cycling females increased. We conclude that female chimpanzees are capable of adjusting their copulation calling flexibly, by taking into account their own sexual attractiveness, to incite male competition.

AB Social structure is a fundamental component of a population that drives ecological and evolutionary processes ranging from parasite transmission to sexual selection. Nevertheless, we have much to learn about factors that explain variation in social structure. We used advances in biologging and social network analysis to experimentally test how the local habitat, and specifically habitat complexity, modulates social structure at different levels in wild populations. Sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, establish nonrandom social networks that are characterized by avoidance of some neighbours and frequent interactions with one opposite-sex individual. Using synchronous GPS locations of all adult lizards, we constructed social networks based on spatial proximity of individuals. We increased habitat structural complexity in two study populations by adding 100 short fences across the landscape. We then compared the resulting movement behaviour and social structure between these populations and two unmanipulated populations. Social connectivity (network density) and social stability, measured at weekly intervals, were greater in populations with increased habitat structural complexity. The level of agonistic interaction (quantified as scale damage) was also higher, indicating a fitness cost of greater social connectivity. However, some network parameters were unaffected by increased complexity, including disassortative mixing by sex, and at the individual level, social differentiation among associates (coefficient of variation of edge weights) and maximal interaction frequencies (maximal edge weight). This suggests divergent effects of changed ecological conditions on individual association behaviour compared to the resulting social structure of the population. Our results contrast with those from studies of more gregarious species, in which higher structural complexity in the environment relaxed the social connectivity. This shows that the response to altered ecological conditions can differ fundamentally between species or between populations, and we suggest that it depends on their tendency for gregarious behaviour.

AB Exaggerated horns are a characteristic feature of many male rhinoceros beetles. We surveyed and compared the scaling relationships of these sexually selected weapons for 31 Dynastinae species with different degrees of horn exaggeration. We found that nearly all rhinoceros beetle species were male dimorphic, that the allometric slope of major males was consistently shallower than the slope of minor males, and that the decrease in slope was greatest among species with the most exaggerated horns. These patterns are consistent with the curved allometries of stag beetle mandibles and giraffe weevil rostra, and suggest that the depletion of developmental resources is a general phenomenon limiting the continued exaggeration of insect weapons. The dimorphisms in horn morphology are expected to correspond to behavioural differences between major and minor males, but little is still known about the mating tactics of most rhinoceros beetle species. Future studies on the relative benefits and performance of horns during male-male combat are needed to fully understand the diversity of horn allometries and the evolution of exaggerated structures.

AB Humans readily attribute intentionality and mental states to living and nonliving entities, a phenomenon known as anthropomorphism. Recent efforts to understand the driving forces behind anthropomorphism have focused on its motivational underpinnings. By contrast, the underlying cognitive and neuropsychological processes have not been considered in detail so far. The marked increase in interest in anthropomorphism and its consequences for animal welfare, conservation and even as a potential constraint in animal behaviour research call for an integrative review. We identify a set of potential cognitive mechanisms underlying the attribution of mental states to nonhuman animals using a dual process framework. We propose that mental state attributions are supported by processes evolved in the social domain, such as motor matching mechanisms and empathy, as well as by domain-general mechanisms such as inductive and causal reasoning. We conclude that the activation of these domain-specific and domain-general mechanisms depend on the type of information available to the observer, and suggest a series of hypotheses for testing the proposed model.

AB Species with complex life cycles are good models to understand trade-offs between life in hostile and favourable habitats. Newts remain in breeding wetlands for a long period and are strongly affected by fish introduction; however, mechanisms of the exclusion observed in the field are still not well known. In particular, whether newts skip breeding and leave water for land in response to fish introduction and how aquatic shelter may influence their choice remain open questions. To investigate these questions, we experimentally studied the use of aquatic and terrestrial habitats during the breeding season of palmate newts, Lissotriton helveticus, in the presence and absence of goldfish, Carassius auratus. We determined the consequences of habitat choice on newt fitness by assessing sexual activity and number of eggs. There was a strong, significant avoidance of the aquatic environment in the presence of fish, particularly when no aquatic shelter was available. This escape from the water had an impact on reproduction: newts decreased their sexual activity and laid fewer eggs. The availability of shelters favoured coexistence but did not prevent a large proportion of the newts from leaving water and skipping reproduction. This study shows how the presence of fish and the absence of aquatic shelters can lead to newts forgoing aquatic life, thus improving our understanding of the mechanisms behind the coexistence and exclusion patterns found in the wild. More broadly, these data contribute to explaining aquatic versus terrestrial life in favourable and unfavourable environments. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Cooperative breeding systems showcase the diversity of social trajectories within and among species, ranging from the extremes of eusocial insects where individuals become irreversibly specialized as fecund queens or sterile workers, to vertebrate systems where individuals maintain the flexibility to breed throughout life. Between these extremes lies a continuum with individuals exhibiting varying degrees of specialization in their behaviour. Most research on cooperative breeders, particularly on vertebrate systems, has focused on why helping has evolved, rather than addressing this diversity. Here, we present a framework to explain variation in the timing, extent and flexibility of phenotypic divergence across vertebrate and invertebrate cooperative systems. We base our framework on recent theory about how individuals integrate information about the environment from different sources (genes, parents and direct experiences) when establishing their developmental trajectory. We discuss how the timing and degree of divergence and specialization are influenced by the availability and reliability of information about later fitness options and by the extent to which individuals have control over their development. Throughout, we use this developmental perspective to draw broad comparisons across vertebrate and invertebrate systems, which are often considered separately.

AB Changing environments, whether through natural or anthropogenic causes, can lead to the loss of some selective pressures ('relaxed selection') and possibly even the reinstatement of selective agents not encountered for many generations ('reversed selection'). We examined the outcome of relaxed and reversed selection in the adaptive radiation of the threespine stickleback fish, Gasterostues aculeatus L., in which isolated populations encounter a variety of predation regimes. Oceanic sticklebacks, which represent the ancestral founders of the freshwater radiation, encounter many piscivorous fish. Derived, freshwater populations, on the other hand, vary with respect to the presence of predators. Some populations encounter native salmonids, whereas others have not experienced predation by large fish in thousands of generations (relax-selected populations). Some relax-selected populations have had sport fish, including rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, introduced within the past several decades (reverse-selected). We examined the behavioural responses of sticklebacks from three populations of each type to simulated attacks by trout and birds to determine whether relaxed and reversed selection has led to divergence in behaviour, and whether this divergence was predator specific. Fish from trout-free populations showed weak responses to trout, as predicted, but these responses were similar to those of oceanic (ancestral) populations. Fish from populations that co-occur with trout, whether native or introduced, showed elevated antipredator responses, indicating that in freshwater, trout predation selects for enhanced antipredator responses, which can evolve extremely rapidly. Comparison of laboratory-reared and wild-caught individuals suggests a combination of learned and genetic components to this variation. Responses to a model bird flyover were weakly linked to predation environment, indicating that the loss of predation by trout may partially influence the evolution of responses to birds. Our results reject the hypothesis that the consistent presence of predatory birds has been sufficient to maintain responses to piscivorous fish under periods of relaxed selection.

AB Knowledge continues to emerge on how maternally derived egg hormones influence progeny behaviour in oviparous taxa. Of particular interest is how glucocorticoids (GCs) in eggs, as a signal of maternal stress, affect offspring behavioural traits. To date, research has focused on effects of egg GCs on offspring behaviours within a single experimental context. Little is known regarding how egg GCs affect relationships among behaviours and across ecological contexts (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We explored how exogenously increased egg cortisol shapes behavioural syndromes of juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch. Social dominance during a territory intrusion and boldness following a simulated predator attack were recorded for juvenile coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated and untreated eggs. When exposed to a conspecific intruder, coho salmon treated with cortisol in ovo increased dominance behaviours, whereas coho salmon reared from untreated eggs reduced these behaviours. Following exposure to a simulated predator attack, coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated eggs increased boldness (i.e. increased activity and feeding; reduced shelter use), whereas coho salmon reared from untreated eggs reduced boldness. A dominance-boldness relationship was observed for coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated, but not untreated, eggs; dominance during the territory intrusion positively correlated with boldness under threat of predation. Our results highlight the complex influence of egg GCs on offspring behaviour and behavioural syndromes. Continued investigation into the outcomes of egg GCs on offspring will broaden our understanding of intergenerational components of the hormone-behaviour nexus.

AB In mammals it has been proposed that complex social environments have selected for sophisticated social strategies. Third-party and more specifically third-party rank relationship knowledge is an important requirement for such strategies, especially in species with a strict hierarchy such as primates. Previous research has demonstrated that female vervet monkeys know the entire female hierarchy within their group, suggesting a detailed knowledge of their surrounding social world. What remains unclear, however, is the extent and detail of such social knowledge in other age/sex classes. We used the same experimental design to test whether females and males also keep track of each other's hierarchy and whether juveniles know about the female hierarchy. Our results suggest that females know about the male hierarchy but that males and juveniles seem to lack such knowledge regarding the female hierarchy. This indicates sex and developmental differences in the extent of social knowledge and especially third-party rank relationship knowledge in vervet monkeys. As a consequence, sophisticated social strategies may most likely be found in adult females in this species. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Foraging decisions can be influenced by innate biases, previous individual experience and social information acquired from conspecifics. We examined how these factors interact to affect flower colour preference in the large earth bumblebee, Bombus terrestris dalmatinus. Individual bees with no experience foraging on coloured flowers were first tested for innate colour biases on an unrewarded array of blue and yellow artificial flowers. Depending on treatment, bees then acquired individual experience foraging on a colour (either blue or yellow) associated with high-quality sucrose rewards, or a colour with low-quality sucrose rewards, or they did not acquire any individual experience. Bees were then exposed to the alternative colour associated with conspecific demonstrator bees (social information) or the alternative colour with no social information. Bees that had no individual experience visited flower colours that were associated with conspecific demonstrators (social information) but only significantly if the socially demonstrated colour was one for which bees had an innate bias. When bees had individual experience foraging on a colour with high-quality rewards they continued foraging on that colour, and generally did not visit the socially demonstrated alternative colour, regardless of innate colour bias. Alternatively, when bees had individual experience foraging on colours with low-quality rewards, they made more visits to the socially demonstrated alternative flower colour, but only when the alternative colour was the colour for which they had an innate bias. Bees that had no access to social information continued to forage on low-reward coloured flowers. Thus we show that reward quality of resources with which bees have individual experience affects the use of social information but with an important role of innate biases.

AB Heterogeneous environments are often associated with differential selection pressures favouring the evolution of local adaptations, and assortative mating is one of the mechanisms that might enhance such local adaptations. Montane environments present an example in which environment changes rapidly and predictably along an elevation gradient, and such variation may be expected to lead to the evolution of local adaptations. In food-caching mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, reliance on food stores is likely to increase with elevation, and previous research has shown that individuals living at high elevations cache more food and have superior spatial memory, needed to recover food caches, while also being socially subordinate to low-elevation birds. Here, we asked whether such differences might be associated with assortative mating. Considering that superior spatial memory ability for recovering food caches may be more critical for survival at high elevations because of more severe winter conditions, it should benefit females from high elevations to mate assortatively with males from the same elevation. If spatial memory is costly but not critical at low elevations, females from low elevation should mate assortatively with males from low elevation, especially given their socially dominant status to high-elevation birds. We assessed female preference using a pairwise choice of high-and low-elevation males. We used the amount of time spent in proximity to males from the same versus different elevation to determine female preference. High-elevation females showed significant preference for high-elevation males, however, low-elevation females showed no elevation-related preference. These results suggest that high-elevation females are choosier than low-elevation females, and prefer males from their same elevation. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The use of toxic chemical defences to repel and deter predators is widespread across living organisms, yet there are surprisingly few formal models of toxin evolution. Published models tend to focus on a trade-off between individual benefits and costs of toxicity, and treat predators as simple agents of selection, reducing future attacks when they encounter toxic prey. In this paper we argue, however, that the physiological characteristics of predators may be crucial in determining the nature and outcomes of toxin evolution. To examine this idea we devised and explored a model in which prey defence evolves in the context of predator physiology. We represented this as dose-effect relationships in predators for nutrition and toxins along with variable rates of predator metabolism. Incorporating variables of predator physiology can change views of toxin evolution. A key point is that inclusion of predator physiological variables requires that the nutritional value of prey is explicitly represented in the model, and this directly affects predictions for toxin evolution. In our model costly toxins generally evolve to the point that they are 'minimally unprofitable': just toxic enough to make prey typically unprofitable given their nutritional value to predators. As the nutritional value of prey increases, so the minimally unprofitable toxin level of prey tends to increase in step; hence another general prediction from this model is that toxin levels within prey should often correlate with the nutritional value of the prey. Predator physiology and cognition also contribute to variation in the social nature of defence. We argue that incorporating representations of predator physiology is important in the comprehension of toxin evolution and make suggestions for directions of future work.

AB In cooperatively breeding or eusocial societies, opportunities may arise for helper individuals to gain direct fitness by reproducing. However, the extent to which helpers respond differentially, in terms of their reproductive behaviour, to the probability that reproductive opportunities will arise is not fully known. In many eusocial Hymenoptera, workers lay eggs only in queenless conditions following the death of the queen or queens. Relative to polygyny (multiple queens per colony), monogyny (single queen per colony) increases the probability that queenless conditions arise. We therefore tested the hypothesis that ant workers respond differentially to queenless conditions as a function of the probability of queenlessness. We compared worker behaviour and reproduction before and after removal of queens from monogynous and polygynous colonies of the ant Leptothorax acervorum. We found that, in queenless conditions, workers from monogynous colonies were significantly more likely to lay eggs, showed a significantly reduced latency to egg laying and laid eggs at a significantly higher rate per capita than workers from polygynous colonies. In addition, before queen removal, workers that laid eggs in queenless conditions across both monogynous and polygynous colonies performed a range of behaviours associated with reproduction at significantly higher rates than nonreproductive, control workers. These 'future reproductive' workers also significantly reduced their rates of brood care following queen removal. These findings show that workers under monogyny reproduce more readily in queenless conditions than workers under polygyny, and that would-be reproductive workers alter their behaviour before they experience the opportunity for future reproduction. They therefore suggest that workers adaptively modulate their reproductive behaviour as a function of the likelihood of opportunities for direct reproduction arising, and that workers' behaviour is affected by the ability to gain direct fitness even when reproduction is currently not occurring.

AB Proteins and peptides are used as pheromones by many invertebrates and vertebrates, on land as well as underwater. These molecules are used as pheromones by aquatic animals such as squid, sea hares, and newts. Males in some terrestrial salamander species use high molecular weight glycopeptide pheromones transferred directly to the nostrils of the female. In Drosophila fruit flies, sex peptides in the male's seminal fluid change the female's behaviour so that after mating she rejects other males and starts to lay eggs. The rapid evolution of Drosophila sex peptides and salamander peptide pheromones suggests that sexual conflict may be involved. In mice, exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1 (ESP1) secreted from the male's tear glands is transferred to the female's nose through physical contact during investigation of the facial areas during courtship. ESP1 activates a narrowly specific vomeronasal receptor, leading to receptive behaviour in the female. The urine marks of male territorial house mice contain high concentrations of highly variable major urinary proteins (MUPs). The MUPs bind small molecule pheromones and other odorants, slowly releasing them and thus greatly prolonging the attractive volatile lifetime of the signal. One of the MUPs, darcin, is the same in all male house mice: it is a pheromone in itself. When the female comes into contact with darcin in a scent mark it prompts a learned attraction to both the male's individual chemical signature mixture and the location of the scent mark. Proteins and peptides may also contribute to the highly variable chemical profiles that differ between individual mammals, for example, and that are used as cues to allow individuals to be distinguished.

   BEHAVIOR; MOCKINGBIRD; CUCKOOS
AB Obligate avian brood parasites do not provide direct care to their young but can indirectly increase their offspring's success in host nests. One way in which parasitic cowbirds (Molothrus sp.) could achieve this is through egg puncturing, whereby, prior to laying in a nest, females puncture the eggs that are already present in the nest to reduce the competition that their offspring will later face for food. In this study we investigated whether cowbirds strategically increase their puncturing effort with increasing competitiveness of the future brood. We filmed egg-puncturing behaviour by shiny cowbirds, Molothrus bonariensis, at nests of chalk-browed mockingbirds, Mimus saturninus, a large host whose nests often receive multiple cowbird eggs. We presented cowbirds with large (4 eggs) or small (1 egg) clutches of either mockingbird or cowbird eggs, where large clutch sizes predict greater intrabrood competition than small clutch sizes, and mockingbird eggs (which are larger) predict greater competition than other cowbird eggs. Cowbirds delivered more pecks and punctured more eggs per visit to larger clutches, and mockingbird eggs were broken more often than cowbird eggs, but pecked less per visit. The higher number of pecks aimed at cowbird eggs, despite these producing less competitive nestmates, could reflect responses to eggshell strength rather than egg size, as cowbird eggs are harder to break because of their thicker shells and so require more effort to puncture. Our results show that cowbird puncturing behaviour is not rigid and varies with nest contents. We suggest this variation is consistent with females increasing their offspring's chance of survival.

AB Several hypotheses could explain the evolution of multimodal signals. One possibility is that such signals allow for communication even when one signalling modality is temporarily unavailable. However, little is known about the consequences of the permanent evolutionary loss of a signal modality. We used the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus to test the hypothesis that the loss of one mode of signalling can be accommodated by flexibly switching to another pre-existing modality. Field crickets use cues that carry social information in the form of both long-range acoustic signals and short-range cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), but males in some T. oceanicus populations have permanently lost the ability to sing because of a morphological mutation erasing sound-producing structures on their wings. In assays testing responsiveness to substrate-borne CHCs, T. oceanicus females responded to the presence of male, but not female, CHCs, which is consistent with known sexual dimorphism in field cricket chemical cues. However, we found no evidence for signal compensation in male crickets that have experienced an evolutionary loss of acoustic signals: females did not differentially respond to the CHCs of constitutively silent males compared to those of normal males. The ability of organisms to shift adaptively from one signalling modality to another following the evolutionary loss of a signal is likely to be constrained by both the degree to which signal production and receiving is flexible and the existence of suitably preadapted alternative modalities.

AB Tactical deception has long attracted interest because it is often assumed to entail complex cognitive mechanisms. However, systematic evidence of tactical deception is rare and no study has attempted to determine whether such behaviours may be underpinned by relatively simple mechanisms. This study examined whether deceptive alarm calling among wild tufted capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella nigritus, feeding on contestable food resources can be potentially explained by a physiological mechanism, namely increased activation in the adrenocortex and the resulting production of glucocorticoids (GCs; 'stress hormones'). This was tested experimentally in Iguazu National Park, Argentina, by manipulating the potential for contest competition over food and noninvasively monitoring GC production through analysis of faecal hormone metabolites. If deceptive false alarms are indeed associated with adrenocortical activity, it was predicted that the patterns of production of these calls would match the patterns of GC output, generally being higher in callers than noncallers in cases in which food is most contestable, and specifically being higher in callers on those occasions when a deceptive false alarm was produced. This hypothesis was not supported, as (1) GC output was significantly lower in association with the experimental introduction of contestable resources than in natural contexts wherein the potential for contest is lower, (2) within experimental contexts, there was a nonsignificant tendency for noncallers to show higher GC output than callers when food was most contestable, and (3) individuals did not show higher GC levels in cases in which they produced deceptive alarms relative to cases in which they did not. A learned association between the production of alarms and increased access to food may be the most likely cognitive explanation for this case of tactical deception, although unexplored physiological mechanisms also remain possible.

AB The 'cognitive capacity hypothesis' states that song complexity could potentially be used by prospective mates to assess an individual's overall cognitive ability. Several recent studies have provided support for the cognitive capacity hypothesis, demonstrating that individuals with more complex songs or larger song repertoires performed better on various learning tasks. These studies all measured individuals' learning performance in social isolation. However, for gregarious species such as the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, testing individuals in a group context is socially and ecologically more relevant if song complexity is to be a meaningful indicator of cognitive ability. We tested whether song complexity correlated with performance on a suite of novel foraging problems in flocks of male zebra finches, starting by replicating the lid-flipping task used by Boogert et al. (Animal Behaviour, 2008, 76, 1735-1741), who provided the first support for the cognitive capacity hypothesis in zebra finches isolated during testing. We also presented flocks with a barrier task and two types of novel food. We found that males' song complexity scores did not correlate with their latency to solve any of these novel foraging problems in a social context. Individuals that solved the tasks likewise did not have more complex songs than nonsolvers. However, performance was positively correlated across the different foraging tasks. These results raise doubts as to whether the song complexity measures used by Boogert et al. are predictors of problem- solving performance, and perhaps cognitive ability, in a more ecologically relevant, social setting. Stress responsiveness might instead explain the association between song complexity and foraging task performance among isolated zebra finches reported by Boogert et al.

AB Studies in the laboratory have shown that animals can combine multiple kinds of information to form integrated memories for rules and events. Less is known about how animals make use of these integrated memories in the wild. Here we tested whether wild, free-living, rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, could learn to identify rewarded flowers in a naturalistic foraging situation, by remembering, over multiple exposures, what flower was rewarded, where and in which context. Birds were presented with boards on which four artificial flowers were mounted, one containing a food reward, the others containing water. Which flower (its colour and location) contained a reward was indicated in one condition by the presence of visually distinctive background boards and in a second condition by the sequential order in which the boards were presented. In both conditions, birds combined these pieces of information and learned to use the context to determine which of the four flowers was rewarded. Although they were not required to do so here, it is possible that these birds might be able to combine pieces of information to form integrated memories for single events.

AB Sex differences in the behaviour of human children are a hotly debated and often controversial topic. However, several recent studies have documented a biological basis to key aspects of child social behaviour. To further explore the evolutionary basis of such differences, we investigated sex differences in sociability in wild chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, infants at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We used a long-term data set on mother-infant behaviour to analyse the diversity of infant chimpanzee social partners from age 30 to 36 months. Male infants (N = 12) interacted with significantly more individuals than female infants did (N = 8), even when maternal sociability was controlled for. Furthermore, male infants interacted with significantly more adult males than female infants did. Our data indicate that the well-documented sex differences in adult chimpanzee social tendencies begin to appear quite early in development. Furthermore, these data suggest that the behavioural sex differences of human children are fundamentally rooted in our biological and evolutionary heritage.

AB For many hosts of brood-parasitic birds, their frontline of defence is to mob adult parasites that approach the nest. Mobbing is commonly interpreted as an adaptation to prevent the parasite from laying, although to date evidence of this is indirect or anecdotal. We investigated the effectiveness of mobbing by chalk-browed mockingbirds, Mimus saturninus, as a defence against their parasite, the shiny cowbird, Molothrus bonariensis, using videos of 480 naturally occurring cowbird nest visits and other direct observations. Mockingbirds only occasionally prevented cowbirds from reaching the nest or from laying once in it. More often, cowbirds were able to deposit an egg, aided by their agile flight, rapid laying, endurance of mobbing and, in some cases, opportunistic timing, whereby they approached nests when mockingbirds were distracted in battle with other cowbirds. Adult parasites present a second threat to hosts, however, in that they try to damage or remove host eggs prior to laying their own. We found that mobbing at the nest significantly reduced the likelihood that cowbirds broke a mockingbird egg during their visit, despite almost all mobbed visits concluding with a cowbird laying an egg. In this host therefore, the benefit of mobbing must be assessed by two independent measures: prevention of egg laying by the parasite and loss of their own eggs. As mockingbird eggs that survive a cowbird's visit intact can go on to fledge from parasitized broods, we expect strong selection for mobbing as an antiparasite defence in this host, even though it largely fails to prevent parasitism itself.

AB In aquatic organisms, diel vertical migration (DVM) is typically characterized as ascent at dusk and decent at dawn. Often several hypotheses are required to explain the sensory-mechanisms and ultimate causes of DVM. Currently, most of the research focused at the individual level has identified DVM functions as a response to light, feeding opportunities, predator avoidance and bioenergetics in small planktivores. However, there are no studies examining whether DVM hypotheses can explain and predict individual behavioural characteristics in top-level predators. In this study, we test whether bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, a cold-water pelagic-cruising piscivore, show size-dependent daily and seasonal patterns in DVM consistent with light levels (proximate trigger) and feeding opportunities, predator avoidance and bioenergetics hypotheses. To test these hypotheses, free-swimming bull trout (N = 187, 358-881 mm total length) in a large, temperate reservoir were implanted with depth-sensing acoustic transmitters for 1 year. We found that swimming depths of bull trout were shallowest at night, deepest during the day and showed clear patterns of DVM across all seasons. In line with the predator avoidance hypothesis, large and small bull trout occupied different depths in all seasons except the spring, while the likelihood of depth change for large and small fish varied depending on season and diel period. The greatest depth difference among large and small bull trout occurred in the summer and less so in autumn. In the summer, small bull trout remained at greater depths (similar to 15 m) than larger fish (similar to 7 m) regardless of diel period. Our results indicate that light is a proximate trigger, and since there is no clear temperature-related bioenergetic advantage to changing depths during winter, feeding opportunities and predator avoidance are the most parsimonious DVM hypotheses to explain body-size-dependent behaviour in this top-level predator.

AB Individual recognition, using acoustic, visual or olfactory individual signatures, is crucial for the coordination of social interactions and its occurrence has been demonstrated experimentally in many taxa. In this context, mistaking one individual for another is expected to be costly, for example through misdirected parental care or social punishment. To minimize the occurrence of such false responses, individual signatures should be distinct and selection should act on receivers to perceive these differences. However, it is largely unknown how precise signal perception is and whether similarity between individual signatures influences the occurrence of false responses. We used acoustic parent-offspring recognition in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, to test how acoustic similarity between individuals affects a chick's response behaviour. In a playback experiment, fledglings were presented with calls of parents as well as calls of nonparents that varied systematically in their similarity to the parents' calls. The acoustic similarity between calls of parents and unrelated adults partly explained the response pattern of fledglings. Offspring preferentially responded to adult calls that were similar to their parents' call. The response pattern further seemed to incorporate a baseline responsiveness to conspecifics since most fledglings responded to very dissimilar adults. These findings demonstrate that the strength of response is related to signal similarity, which is potentially an important underlying mechanism shaping distinctiveness in signal design.

AB Sperm competition theory predicts that males should strategically adjust sperm ejaculate expenditure according to the number of competing ejaculates, because sperm production is costly. That is, males should provide females with larger or higher-quality ejaculates when one rival male is present, but decrease ejaculate size or quality as the number of rivals exceeds one. We tested this hypothesis in the laboratory by subjecting male domestic crickets (Acheta domesticus) to increased sperm competition risk (one rival male) or intensity (two rival males) and then measuring total sperm number and viability (proportion of living sperm) of the ejaculate. In addition, we tested whether male ejaculate expenditure covaried with their own or their mate's phenotypic quality. Contrary to theoretical predictions, males did not prudently adjust the number of sperm they transferred to mates based on either sperm competition risk or intensity. We also found that smaller males had higher proportions of living sperm in their ejaculate relative to larger males, suggesting that male A. domesticus can adjust their ejaculate quality based on their perceived reproductive prospects.

AB Large mammals select conspicuous objects on which to deposit their scent marks, which may function to supplement the olfactory signal, visually and/or chemically. Analysing marking sites is paramount to understanding whether signallers could mitigate potential fitness costs by placing scents strategically to reduce time and energy investment. The defining characteristics of marking sites are unclear across species, and variation in the literature concerning selectivity maybe explained by behavioural plasticity. We took an evolutionary perspective on the selection and spatial distribution of marking trees by brown bears, Ursus arctos, to account for such variation. Our hypothesis, that brown bears would be selective in the trees used for scent marking, was supported; the trees chosen were located in regularly visited areas, where the defence of a resource is needed. The criteria of a marking tree appear to be primarily location and then about properties that facilitate their use as a conspicuous object; bears selected rarer species and trees of larger size than the average available. Other features, such as aromatic properties of the species, bark texture and the ability of the bark to hold scent, may act additionally to determine a tree's marking potential. The energetic investment in manufacturing pungent volatile odours could be reduced if signallers utilize tree properties to attract receivers. Across mammalian taxa, whether a tree is selected for marking appears to vary based on environmental context; the principal function is to limit the energetic costs of producing scent marks by placing marks strategically to increase the likelihood of attracting potential receivers.

AB Social network analysis has become a valuable tool for the measurement of social bonds and can give insight into the level of social complexity in a species. However, most studies have focused on a single social group or community, and we have a rather limited understanding of the extent to which a species' network structure varies across groups and across habitats. We investigated the strength and structure of social bonds in feral goat groups in two geographical locations that differ in ecological and climatic conditions. We found that a range of strengths of social bonds existed between female goats, with behavioural and spatial measures being highly correlated. Levels of aggression between spatially proximate individuals reflected the intrinsic costs of social living, but lower rates between more strongly bonded individuals indicated a degree of social tolerance. We found a consistent social structure despite differences in demography and ecology and we propose that associations are driven by social benefits as well as by ecological requirements. We suggest that a clique size of 12-13 individuals may be optimal for goats; beyond this threshold, the system may be less stable and susceptible to fission.

AB The scientific study of frogs and toads as important systems in behavioural ecology traces its roots to an influential review published in this journal 36 years ago (Wells 1977a, 'The social behaviour of anuran amphibians', Animal Behaviour, 25, 666-693). In just 28 pages, Wells summarized the state of knowledge on important behaviours associated with anuran breeding and introduced an evolutionary framework 'for understanding the relationship between social behaviour and ecology' (page 666) that was largely lacking in earlier treatments of this group. Not only is Wells's review one of the most cited papers ever published in Animal Behaviour, it is also responsible for setting broad research agendas and shaping much of our current thinking on social behaviour in an entire order of vertebrates. As such, it is entirely appropriate that we honour Wells's review and its contributions to the study of animal behaviour in this inaugural essay celebrating 12 papers selected by the community as the most influential papers published in the 60-year history of Animal Behaviour. In our essay, we place Wells's review in historical context at the dawn of behavioural ecology, highlight the field's progress in answering some major research questions outlined in the review, and provide our own prospectus for future research on the social behaviour of anuran amphibians.

AB Social experiences, especially during early development, have profound effects on the brain and behaviour in later life. We examined whether the provision of alloparental care by older siblings affects anxiety, sociability and parental behaviour at adulthood in both them and the younger siblings for which they care. Using mandarin voles, Microtus mandarinus, we kept the older litter in the parents' cage at weaning where they provided alloparental care to younger siblings of the next litter. We found that mandarin voles that had cared for younger siblings displayed significantly more locomotor activity in a novel environment and engaged in more social investigation of unfamiliar same-sex individuals. Females of this group also provided more parental care compared to control voles. Individuals cared for by older siblings demonstrated lower levels of anxiety and aggression, and higher levels of parental investment at adulthood, compared to control animals. These results suggest that providing alloparental care increases locomotor activity, social investigation and maternal care in adulthood, and that receiving alloparental care reduces levels of anxiety and aggression and increases biparental care in adulthood. Giving and receiving alloparental care has clear benefits in this species and suggests that alloparental care may increase the inclusive fitness of both givers and receivers.

AB A male advantage in spatial abilities is predicted to evolve in species where males rely on expansion of home territory to locate dispersed mates during the breeding season. We sought to examine mechanistic underpinnings of this evolved trait by comparing spatial navigational abilities in two species of Peromyscus that use widely different reproductive strategies: deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii, in which males engage in territorial expansion and mate search, and California mice, Peromyscus californicus insignis, in which males do not engage in territorial expansion and mate search. Males and females from outbred stocks of each species were administered tasks that assessed spatial learning and memory, and activity and exploratory behaviours. The maze used for these studies included four spatial cues that could be used to aid in locating one of 12 potential escape holes. As predicted, male deer mice outperformed conspecific females and male California mice in maze performance and memory, and this difference appeared to be due to extent to which animals used spatial cues to guide maze navigation. Consistent with territorial expansion as a component of competition for mates, male deer mice were more active and engaged in more exploratory and less anxiety-related behaviours than conspecific females and male California mice. The results have implications for understanding and studying the cognitive and behavioural mechanisms that have evolved through male-male competition that involves territorial expansion and mate search.

AB Predation may drive differential selection among personality types, but the mechanism linking personality with predation risk is poorly understood. One such mechanism may be provided by stress hormones (corticosterone in birds), which are linked to boldness towards predators. However, because of feedbacks between boldness and future fitness expectations, the relationship between boldness and stress physiology may be modulated by individual quality. We investigated flight initiation distances (FIDs) of incubating eider, Somateria mollissima, females in relation to handling-induced corticosterone concentrations and individual quality (female breeding experience, body condition). We investigated whether FIDs were repeatable, and whether stress responsiveness and individual quality attributes, either independently or interactively, affected FIDs. We also analysed whether incubation duration, a period of peak predation pressure on females, would depend on female boldness towards predators (FID), controlling for individual quality. FIDs were repeatable within and between seasons, and females with higher handling-induced corticosterone concentrations generally had longer FIDs. However, this relationship was modulated by interactions between stress responsiveness and individual quality. High stress responsiveness was associated with longer FIDs in younger females, while the opposite was found for the oldest females. Furthermore, the FIDs of females in good body condition increased less strongly with increasing stress-induced circulating corticosterone. Shy females (long FIDs) and those in poor body condition had shorter incubation periods. Boldness is thus linked to stress responsiveness, helping to explain why stress responses may be correlated with survival. However, physiological stress effects on boldness cannot be understood in isolation from effects of individual quality. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Searching for a suitable breeding site is an important decision in the life of most animals. The decisions where to settle and how far to travel before doing so depend on many factors. Individual differences in dispersal distance could result from different strategies (e.g. specialists versus generalists), which might result in similar reproductive success in different habitats, or different competitive abilities to acquire a territory close to the natal site. The barn owl is polymorphic in melanic coloration, which is associated with many physiological and behavioural traits such as habitat choice, stress response and docility, raising the possibility that the coloration is also related to dispersal. We studied natal dispersal (from rearing site to site of first breeding attempt) and breeding dispersal (from one breeding site to the next) in barn owls using a long-term data set. Darker reddish individuals moved further than paler individuals during natal dispersal, but not during breeding dispersal. A cross-fostering experiment showed that the colour of the biological and foster parents had no influence on dispersal distance. The distance dispersed by parents and same-sex offspring was correlated, whereas natal and breeding dispersal were not repeatable within individuals, indicating that they are two different processes. Given that the distance travelled in natal dispersal appears to be heritable, the underlying genes might be coupled to those related to coloration. We discuss hypotheses to explain the potential adaptive function of the link between coloration and natal dispersal. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Adopting the paradigm of a study conducted with chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes (Melis et al. 2006, Journal of Comparative Psychology, 120, 154-162), we investigated orang-utans', Pongo pygmaeus, understanding of others' visual perspectives. More specifically, we examined whether orang-utans would adjust their behaviour in a way that prevents a human competitor from seeing them steal a piece of food. In the task, subjects had to reach through one of two opposing Plexiglas tunnels in order to retrieve a food reward. Both rewards were also physically accessible to a human competitor sitting opposite the subject. Subjects always had the possibility of reaching one piece of food that was outside the human's line of sight. This was because either the human was oriented to one, but not the other, reward or because one tunnel was covered by an opaque barrier and the other remained transparent. In the situation in which the human was oriented towards one reward, the orang-utans successfully avoided the tunnel that the competitor was facing. If one tunnel was covered, they marginally preferred to reach through the opaque versus the transparent tunnel. However, they did so frequently after initially inspecting the transparent tunnel (then switching to the opaque one). Considering only the subjects' initial inspections, they chose randomly between the opaque and transparent tunnel, indicating that their final decision to reach was probably driven by a more egocentric behavioural rule. Overall the results suggest that orang-utans have a limited understanding of others' perspectives, relying mainly on cues from facial and bodily orientation and egocentric rules when making such judgements.

AB Harsh environments may lead to increased demands on memory in animals that rely on memory for survival. We previously showed that winter severity is associated with non-experience-based differences in memory and the hippocampus over a large continental scale in food-caching black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus. However, large climatic differences also occur along steep elevational gradients in montane environments over a small geographical scale. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that large differences in memory and the hippocampus exist over extremely short distances (10 km) along the elevation gradient. We found that food-caching mountain chickadees (P. gambeli) from the highest elevations in the Sierra Nevada Mountains had significantly better spatial memory associated with larger hippocampi, with almost twice the number of hippocampal neurons, than individuals only 600 m lower in elevation. We found similarly large differences in hippocampal neurogenesis rates as indicated by the total number of immature neurons. Our study therefore suggests that climate-related environmental differences can produce dramatic differences in memory and the hippocampus in animals within close proximity on small spatial scales and that currently observed trends in global climate may have significant effects on cognition and the brain.

AB Differences between continental and island species in their ability to recognize mammalian predators are well documented, but how quickly acquired predator recognition behaviour declines or is lost when animals are translocated to sites without mammals has not been fully investigated. We compared predator recognition in a 'mainland' population of Stewart Island robins, Petroica australis rakiura, where rats have been present since the 1600s, and in a reintroduced island population where rats were recently eradicated and the resident robins have experienced a rat-free environment for about one generation. We found that the rat-free island population showed little fear or recognition of a model rat and were less agitated and more likely to approach and consume food in front of the model rat relative to robins on the mainland. The results of our study suggest that endemic species that acquire the ability to recognize mammalian predators lose this ability relatively quickly when translocated to islands where mammals are absent. These results raise questions about the costs of maintaining mammalian recognition behaviour in mammal-free environments, even when avian predators are present. They also raise concerns about whether island sanctuaries are appropriate sources for harvesting for reintroductions back to the rat-infested mainland.

AB Exploitation of the environment by building a tunnel network is one of the stages involved in the foraging behaviour of subterranean termites, and it may be influenced by several factors, such as temperature, soil, drought, floods, predators, competitors, obstacles or even a lack of food. Because soils in natural environments are generally very heterogeneous, our aim in the present study was to analyse the tunnelling behaviour of the Asian species Coptotermes gestroi in the presence of physical, chemical and biological cues in the substrate (twisted wire, a pre-existing tunnel and a tunnel containing three dead soldiers of Heterotermes tenuis or C. gestroi) in bidimensional glass arenas. All experiments were run in Biochemical Oxygen Demand incubator (25 +/- 0.2 degrees C), and the arenas were digitally photographed after 24 h. Fewer primary tunnels were constructed in the absence of guidelines (control treatments) than in the presence of guidelines (experimental treatments), demonstrating more vigorous initial tunnelling behaviour in the presence of guidelines in the soil. In addition, termites in experimental treatments either clearly followed the solid guideline in several regions of the tunnelling arena, or spread their network of tunnels from the preformed excavation, and their tunnelling patterns differed from those of the controls. Finally, foragers usually avoided contact with dead soldiers by constructing primary tunnels at different sites from those where dead soldiers had been placed. These results indicate that behavioural patterns of C. gestroi foragers are altered when tunnelling substrates are not homogeneous. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Prey make several behavioural adjustments to minimize the risk of predation by their natural predators. When hunted, however, they may have to adjust their behaviour further or differently to cope with this additional mortality risk. Here, we investigated whether African large ungulates would adjust their behaviour in response to hunting risk (i.e. risk of being shot by human hunters). We predicted that they would shift their use of surface water, a key and scarce resource in African savannas, from day hours to night hours to reduce the risk of encountering human hunters. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes to record the temporal drinking niche of three nonhunted ungulates (i.e. impala, Aepyceros melampus, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, sable antelope, Hippotragus niger). We also monitored waterholes in hunting areas in the vicinity of Hwange National Park. In Hwange National Park, the three species avoided waterholes at night, when the risk of natural predation was higher. Conversely, in the hunting areas, all three species visited waterholes more often at night. Impala and greater kudu, however, were less prone to switch towards night-time use of waterholes in hunting areas compared to sable antelope, although all three species were exposed to similar hunting risk. Our results suggest that hunting may force African ungulates to shift their visits at waterholes from day hours towards night hours, but that the magnitude of this shift may be constrained by the predation risk imposed by large nocturnal carnivores. We conclude that species preyed upon by natural predators adjust their antipredator behaviour in response to the additional risk of predation imposed by hunting.

AB Interspecific mutualisms, that is, reciprocally beneficial relationships between different species, are ubiquitous in nature and ecologically very important. The long-term stability of mutualisms, however, may be threatened by the emergence of 'cheaters' or by the abandoning or extinction of one of the mutualistic partners. Recently, we found large genetic variation in a key trait that helps to maintain the trophic mutualism between ants and aphids, whereby the aphids offer sugary-rich honeydew to the ants, which, in exchange, protect the aphids against natural enemies. In particular, we found that about half of all Aphis fabae black bean aphid clones screened do not invest in producing a key honeydew sugar, the trisaccharide melezitose, which also happens to be very attractive to and nutritionally valuable for ants. The aim of the present study was to find out whether ants have any mechanisms available to 'punish' such low-quality melezitose-deficient clones, for example by reducing their visit rate and level of protection against natural enemies. Surprisingly, we found that the visit rates of low-melezitose-secreting clone colonies were no different from those composed of normal, high-melezitose-secreting clones. Nevertheless, our results suggest that ants were more likely to collect honeydew from the high-melezitose-secreting clones. Overall, we conclude that the stability of this particular ant-aphid mutualism is not maintained by active punishment and argue that this may be the reason why the low-melezitose-secreting clones manage to attain such high frequencies in natural populations.

AB Parasites can negatively affect their host's physiology and morphology and render host individuals less attractive as mating partners. The energetic requirements of defending against parasites have to be traded off against other needs such as feeding activity, territoriality, thermoregulation or reproduction. Parasites can affect mating patterns, with females preferentially mating with parasite-resistant or parasite-free partners. We tested experimentally whether removal of both ectoparasites and endoparasites on free-living, male Columbian ground squirrels, Urocitellus columbianus, affected male mating behaviour, reproductive success and seasonal and posthibernation weight gain compared to control males. We predicted that experimental males would lose less body mass and mate more often than control males. In addition, we predicted experimental males would copulate earlier than control males in the mating sequences of receptive females and sire more offspring, because this species exhibits a strong first-male paternity advantage. Parasite treatment significantly reduced the parasite loads of experimental males. None of these males had ectoparasites at the end of the season, compared to 70% infestation of the control males. However, contrary to our expectations, the experimental treatment did not affect male reproductive behaviour (mating frequency, mating position, consort duration and mate-guarding duration), did not increase male reproductive success, and did not influence male body mass. We conclude that parasite infestation plays a minor role in affecting male reproductive behaviour, maybe because of the overall low infestation rates. Alternatively, males may be able to compensate for any costs associated with moderate loads of parasites. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Birdsong structure is known to vary across different scales of geographical separation, from differences between neighbours in a habitat to populations across continents. The high-elevation regions of the Western Ghats mountains in southern India form 'sky islands' containing the unique Shola habitat. Bird species on such sky islands are often specifically adapted to habitats typical of these islands while populations on different islands may have been geographically isolated over varying periods of time. Forest fragmentation can intensify the effects of such isolation by affecting species dispersal processes. We examined the effects of genetic differentiation across populations on the song of a threatened, endemic bird, the white-bellied shortwing, Brachypteryx major, on different islands of this sky island system. We compared songs from three populations, one of which on one island was genetically distinct from the other two populations on another island. These two populations were genetically similar but separated by recent deforestation. We recorded songs from 23 individuals and characterized 572 songs by 13 parameters. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in song between the three populations, with the genetically distinct populations across the two islands being the most differentiated. This was supported by a visual and aural examination of spectrograms that revealed characteristic qualitative differences in songs across these populations. Finally, this study corroborates accepted patterns of congruence between song and genetic divergence across islands and also highlights the difference in song between anthropogenically fragmented, but genetically similar populations, possibly owing to cultural drift.

AB Food-hoarding animals employ a variety of tactics to minimize the loss of caches to pilferers. It remains unclear, however, how these responses are affected by complete pilferage events and if differences occur between species and between the sexes within a species that adopt different hoarding strategies. We studied the behavioural responses to complete pilferage in five species that scatter-hoard or larder-hoard. Under natural conditions and within outdoor enclosures we simulated complete pilferage events by removing wild apricot, Prunus armeniaca, seeds hoarded by Pere David's rock squirrels, Sciurotamias davidianus, Korean field mice, Apodemus peninsulae, striped field mice, Apodemus agrarius, Chinese white-bellied rats, Niviventer confucianus, and rat-like hamsters, Tscherskia triton. Following pilferage, all five species increased seed removal from the source and total hoarding intensity under both natural and captive conditions, but no effect of sex was found. Pere David's rock squirrels, Korean field mice and striped field mice, which show both scatter and larder hoarding, increased scatter hoarding, but not larder hoarding. Our pilferage manipulations in the field also increased the distance that seeds were buried from the source. These findings suggest that complete pilferage may increase seed-hoarding behaviour in rodents and that scatter hoarding might be better than larder hoarding in avoiding complete pilferage in rodents that already perform both of these.

AB Although body coloration is often used in social interactions, few studies have tested whether it is linked to a suite of behavioural traits. We examined whether among captive adult male eastern Hermann's tortoises, Eurotestudo boettgeri, behavioural patterns covary with eumelanic coloration of the shell. Dark eumelanic males were more aggressive in male-male confrontations and bolder towards humans. These relationships were independent of body size and ambient temperature. Activity level and exploration were not significantly associated with coloration. We conclude that, at least in captivity, melanic shell coloration predicts agonistic behaviour towards conspecifics and fearfulness towards humans (i.e. boldness).

AB Underlying the study of animal welfare is the assumption that animals experience emotional states. Although there has been a bias towards studying negative emotions, research into positive emotions is necessary for an overall welfare assessment. The aim of the current study was to find behavioural expressions specific for anticipation of different events in domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus. To this aim, we used a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm by which we induced anticipation of a positive, neutral and negative event. We investigated whether birds were able to discriminate between sound cues signalling these events with different valences and, if so, whether anticipation of different events is reflected in different behavioural responses. The birds showed a response of increased attention to all sound cues. In anticipation of the negative event, the birds showed more head movements and locomotion than in anticipation of both the neutral and positive event, possibly reflecting the aversive nature of the negative event. In anticipation of the positive event, the birds showed more comfort behaviours, such as preening and wing flapping, which have been associated with a state of relaxation. Our study shows that laying hens are able to anticipate differentially a positive, neutral and negative event announced by different sound cues. It is also the first study to identify comfort behaviours as specifically associated with anticipation of a positive event in domestic fowl. Comfort behaviours may therefore be associated with a positive emotional state in domestic fowl. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cognitive processes, such as stimulus appraisal, are important in generating emotional states and successful coping with cognitive challenges is thought to induce positive emotions. We investigated learning behaviour and autonomic reactions, including heart rate (HR) and its variability (standard deviation (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of a time series of interbeat intervals). Twenty-four domestic pigs, Sus scrofa, housed in six groups of four, were confronted with a cognitive challenge integrated into their familiar housing environment. Pigs were rewarded with food after they mastered the discrimination of an individual acoustic signal followed by an operant task. All pigs quickly learned the tasks, while baseline SDNN and RMSSD increased significantly throughout the experiment. In reaction to the signals, pigs showed a sudden increase in HR, SDNN and RMSSD, and a decrease in the RMSSD/SDNN ratio. Immediately after this reaction, the HR and SDNN decreased, and the RMSSD/SDNN ratio increased. During feeding, the HR and the RMSSD/SDNN ratio stayed elevated. The pigs showed no cardiac reaction to the sound signals for other pigs or their feeding pen mates. We concluded that the level of cognitive challenge was adequate and that the observed changes in the autonomic tone, which are related to different dimensions of the affective response (e.g. arousal and valence), indicated arousal and positive affective appraisal by the pigs. These findings provide valuable insight into the assessment of positive emotions in animals and support the use of an adequate cognitive enrichment to improve animal welfare.

AB Natural selection has caused prey species to evolve distinct defensive mechanisms. One of such mechanisms was the evolution of noxious or distasteful chemicals, which have appeared independently in a number of vertebrates and invertebrates. In detailed analyses of arthropod behaviour, scent gland secretions have consistently been shown to be responsible for repelling specific predators. Because using such chemicals is costly, animals with alternative cheaper defences are expected not to release such secretions when alternative options exist. In this study, we sought to determine the defensive mechanisms of the harvestman Discocyrtus invalidus, a heavy bodied species that bears a pair of repugnatorial glands. The spider Enoploctenus cyclothorax was used as the predator, and the cricket Gryllus sp. was used as a control. In a first set of experiments, the harvestmen were preyed upon significantly less than the crickets. In two other experiments, we found that harvestmen did not use their scent gland secretions to deter the predator. Moreover, results of a fourth experiment revealed that these spiders are not repelled by defensive secretions. Discocyrtus invalidus has a thick cuticle on the entire body: scanning electron micrographs revealed that only the mouth, the articulations of appendages and the tips of the legs are not covered by a hard integument. In a fifth experiment, we found that these spiders had difficulty piercing the harvestmen body. This is the first experimental evidence that a chemically defended arachnid does not use its scent gland secretions to repel a much larger predator but instead relies on its heavily built body.

AB Obligate social parasite insects are specialized in exploiting the parental service of the workers of another social species by invading their colonies. As social insects are usually aggressive towards intruders, social parasites have to circumvent the host's nestmate recognition system to enter the host colony successfully. Many studies on paper wasps have shown that, after host nest invasion, Polistes social parasites change their chemical profile to match the host's odour, thus allowing their acceptance into its colony. However, a social parasite's usurpation strategy may benefit from signals that reduce or eliminate the aggression of the host. We used lure presentation experiments to investigate whether Polistes sulcifer, a social parasite of the paper wasp P. dominulus, is able to reduce the aggressive reaction of its host. We found that the parasite lure elicited lower host aggressiveness than the conspecific lure, suggesting that parasite species have evolved cues able to inhibit host aggressiveness. We investigated separately the effects of chemical and visual patterns on host aggressiveness. The lower host reaction to the parasite lure was not due to chemical cues, but was elicited by the visual facial pattern of the parasite. Experimental manipulation of this visual pattern demonstrated that the black lower part of the clypeus of the parasite is the trait able to reduce host aggression. This pattern can be considered an honest signal since it visually amplifies the mandibular width, giving information about the parasite's dangerousness.

AB The ecological relevance of behavioural syndromes is little studied in cooperative breeding systems where it is assumed that the behavioural type might influence individual decisions on helping and dispersal (e.g. shy, nonaggressive and nonexplorative individuals remain philopatric and helpful, whereas bold, aggressive, explorative individuals compete for vacancies outside their group and disperse). We measured the behavioural type of 19 subordinates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher in their natural environment by quantifying six behavioural traits up to four times ('trials') in three different contexts, by presenting them with a conspecific intruder, a predator or nothing inside a tube. We found only moderate within-context repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients) of the focal individual's behaviour, except for attacking either the conspecific or the predator inside the tube. The focal individual's attack rate of the tube was also positively affected by its group size. Averaging traits per context removed the between-trial variation, and consequently the across-context repeatability was very high for all six traits, except for territory maintenance. Trait values depended significantly on the context, except for territory defence. Consequently, individuals could be classified into different behavioural types based on their reaction towards the tube, but surprisingly, and opposite to laboratory studies in this species, ranging propensity and territory maintenance were not included in this behavioural syndrome. We suggest that more studies are needed to compare standardized focal personality tests (e.g. exploration propensity) with actual behaviour observed in nature (e.g. ranging and dispersal).

AB The occurrence of nuptial gifts is rare in spiders, being well known only for a single species, Pisaura mirabilis (Pisauridae), whose males offer females a prey wrapped in silk during courtship. Although some males can mate without offering a prey, the gift in this species is thought to represent male mating effort. Male gift offering has been recently described in Paratrechalea ornata, a Neotropical spider belonging to another family, Trechaleidae. We investigated the function of the gift in this species by testing the mating effort hypothesis and two other nonexclusive hypotheses, sexual cannibalism avoidance and paternal investment. Two groups of males were exposed to virgin females: 23 males with no prey (NP group) and 21 males carrying a prey (CP group). Mating success, courtship, copulation and first oviposition were recorded. Males from group CP had better mating success, longer copulations and longer palpal insertions than those from NP. Longer copulations were associated with earlier eggsac construction and oviposition. Some unmated males from NP wrapped prey carrion when they returned to their breeding jars after the trial. Our findings suggest that nuptial gift giving represents male mating effort for P. ornata. Nuptial gifts would allow males to control copulation duration and to accelerate female oviposition, improving sperm supply and paternity, and minimizing possible costs of remating with polyandrous females.

AB Social learning is predicted to be adaptive when independent learning is time-consuming, dangerous or difficult. For a naive individual confronted with an array of novel foods, determining the nutritional value of unfamiliar foods can be challenging, and an increased reliance on social learning would be favoured by selection. I investigated whether the multimodal display of food calling and tid-bitting by white-tailed ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus, hens adaptively biases chicks' intake of foods of different nutrient content via social learning. Ptarmigan were observed in California's Sierra Nevada alpine for two summer seasons. In 116 foraging bouts, I observed 100 instances of hen food calling (to six plant species) and 100 responses by chicks. The relative proportion of each plant species in the chicks' diet was significantly and positively related to the proportion of food calls associated with that plant species, but not with its relative availability. Plant species that elicited food calls by hens had significantly more protein than did random mixtures of plants or than did foods eaten by the hens that did not elicit food calls. Chicks of hens that often uttered calls consumed diets significantly higher in protein than did chicks of hens that rarely called. Preferences were maintained as chicks became older and foraged further from their mothers, and food calling ceased, indicating social learning. Hens' food calling biased chicks' diet choices, supporting the prediction that socially acquired information plays a prominent role when an animal is seeking a nutrient that is difficult to identify (protein). These findings are consistent with the interpretation that ptarmigan hens engage in teaching, but further studies are required before it can be stated conclusively that they teach their chicks nutritional wisdom.

AB Several species of seabirds show cyclic patterns of attendance at their nesting colonies. We examined the patterns of variation in the numbers of Cory's shearwater at three colonies (two oceanic and one located on the continental shelf), including the world's largest, at Selvagem Grande, Madeira, Portugal and considered several hypotheses concerning their causal mechanisms. At Selvagem Grande, cycles were exceptionally marked and regular, with a periodicity ranging from 7.8 to 11 days, and involved both breeders and nonbreeders. In contrast, variation in numbers was aperiodic at a nearby and much smaller colony (Selvagem Pequena), and also at the colony located off the Portuguese coast (Berlenga Island). We found no relationships between number of birds ashore and environmental variables such as wind direction and speed or lunar cycle. Cycles did not seem to be driven by oscillations in food availability or accessibility, given that they did not correlate with daily chick growth rates (which were acyclic) or diet. Despite their regularity, cycles were slightly out of phase in different sectors of Selvagem Grande, which suggests that social interactions at the colony could act as an entrainment agent for an endogenous rhythm, and so cycles are probably more likely to occur in large and dense colonies. Observations are consistent with the hypothesis that cycles facilitate social interactions by maximizing the probability of encounters at the colony. However, the exact mechanisms through which these remarkable cycles are controlled are still completely unknown, and clearly further research is needed.

AB Individuals of many group-living species of birds respond to potential predators by giving alarm calls, and some species give different, spatially referential alarm calls in response to aerial predators (raptors in flight) and terrestrial predators (including perched raptors). In black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, characteristics of alarm calls also vary with predator size and level of perceived threat (Templeton et al. 2005, Science, 308, 1934-1937). We examined whether the terrestrial alarm calls of Carolina chickadees, P. carolinensis, show similar variation. In 2007 and 2008, we monitored responses of eight flocks of Carolina chickadees in Madison County, Kentucky, U. S. A. to mounts of different species of raptors that varied in size. Chickadees responded to the raptors by uttering 'chick-a-dee' calls with different numbers and types of notes. Larger, lower-threat predators (e. g. red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis) elicited calls with significantly more introductory 'chick' notes and fewer 'dee' notes, whereas smaller, higher-threat predators (e. g. eastern screech-owl, Megascops asio) elicited calls with few or no 'chick' notes and significantly more 'dee' notes. In addition, playback experiments revealed that a greater percentage of Carolina chickadees responded to playback of 'chick-a-dee' calls previously given in response to a small predator than during playback of calls given in response to a large predator. These results suggest that the 'chick-a-dee' alarm call is a graded signal that informs conspecifics about the presence and behaviour (i.e. perched) of a predator and the degree of threat posed by that predator.

AB Predation risk and competition can impose foraging costs, whereas social information acquired from conspecifics may lead to foraging gains. By altering cost-benefit trade-offs of foraging, variations in group size and predation risk can influence plant selection by herbivores. This influence may vary seasonally, depending on how foraging constraints vary throughout the year. Empirical evidence of these combined effects remains limited, especially in natural settings. We evaluated the spatial association between wheat sedge, Carex atherodes, and bison, Bison bison, foraging under predation risk during summer and winter. To maximize their energy intake rate, bison should feed on Carex atherodes. We found that the strength of selection for foraging sites with C. atherodes decreased with increasing risk of wolf, Canis lupus, encounter in winter, but not in summer. Bison faced greater risk in winter than in summer. Selection for C. atherodes was further influenced by group size. Larger bison groups displayed stronger selection for C. atherodes in winter but weaker selection in summer. Seasonal variations in group-size effects can be explained by changes in the relative costs and benefits of social foraging. Bison groups are much larger in summer than winter, implying potentially stronger competition among bison foraging on C. atherodes in summer. Carex atherodes is more inconspicuous in winter than in summer, thereby increasing the value of social information during winter months. We suggest that predation risk and spatial heterogeneity of highly profitable food influence the foraging decisions of bison differently in summer and winter because of seasonal differences in cost-benefit trade-offs.

AB Many aquatic invertebrates alter their behaviour in response to chemical stimuli from predators. Less is known about how finely prey can discriminate between stimuli from predatory and related non-predatory species, even in well-studied hermit crabs. We tested the time to emerge from the shell after disturbance ( hiding time) of a common intertidal hermit crab. Pagurus granosimanus was exposed to effluent from two large-bodied brachyuran crabs: the durophagous, predatory red rock crab, Cancer productus, and the herbivorous kelp crab, Pugettia producta, in a controlled laboratory setting. Hiding times were a dramatic 41% shorter in the presence of Cancer effluent than when exposed to Pugettia effluent, which did not differ from a sea water control. Therefore hermit crabs can distinguish between chemical effluent from predatory and nonpredatory brachyuran crabs, which could include crab-specific compounds or metabolites from recently consumed prey, and adjust their behaviour accordingly. Shorter hiding times probably decrease the risk of being eaten by a shell-breaking predator because hermit crabs may be better able to elude them, either by running rapidly away or by abandoning their shell before it is crushed. Individual tests with three video stimuli ( control, predatory crab, herbivorous crab), and combined tests with video and chemical stimuli, revealed a consistent generalized response to the presence of video but no differences among video treatments.

AB The occurrence of prolonged courtship behaviour in many animal species is a well-known phenomenon. The duration of courtship may be influenced by both females and males, often with different interests. In the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata, males offer a salivary secretion as a nuptial gift before copulation. However, males do not immediately initiate copulation by the production of the salivary mass. Instead pairs usually engage in prolonged courtship interactions. Yet the duration of courtship is highly variable, ranging between a few minutes and several hours. Furthermore, courtship does not always result in copulation; instead females often terminate courtship and abandon the male. The duration and outcome of courtship are likely to be influenced by factors such as body condition and female mating history, because they might influence individual attractiveness and motivation to mate. I examined to what extent these factors influence both male and female courtship decisions. Mated females were less keen to remain in courtship for long and abandoned males sooner than virgin females. Yet, male mating behaviour was unaffected by female mating status. Counterintuitively, females in poor condition interrupted courtship sooner with increasing body weight of their male partner. In addition, heavier males initiated copulations sooner than males in poorer condition. However, this effect was evident only in interactions with females in poor condition. A possible interpretation of these results is that males attempt to prevent females in poor condition from leaving prior to copulation by initiating copulation faster.

AB Social learning is an important process in the development of behaviour in many species. It is involved in information transfer concerning food that leads, in some species, to food preferences. In our experiment an adult dog (the observer) was allowed to observe another adult dog (the demonstrator) while the latter was disappearing behind one of four projecting blinds. In one trial the demonstrator dog found food behind the projecting blind, but not in the other. After the demonstrator had inspected the potential food location, it returned to the observer dog and they were allowed to interact and to have snout contact. Afterwards, the observer dog was allowed to inspect the potential food locations, while no olfactory cues from the food were given. The observer dogs were able to adjust their search behaviour depending on the knowledge gained by observing and interacting with a conspecific. Food availability to the demonstrator dog during the demonstration phase increased the willingness of observer dogs to have snout contact with their demonstrators and increased their motivation to search for food. In contrast to snout contact, however, food availability to the demonstrator dog had no influence on the decision to go to a particular food location. Furthermore, our results suggest that dogs use snout contact as a source of information to decide whether to go to a potential food location or not.

But not all coevolutionary interactions between cuckoos and hosts have followed the same pathway. Several host species do not show egg rejection even when the cuckoo's egg looks entirely unlike their own. For example, hosts of some Australian bronze-cuckoos, Chalcites spp., routinely accept olive-brown cuckoo eggs that look very different from the speckled white eggs of their own clutch. Here we investigate the hypothesis that these cuckoo eggs are cryptic, which might explain why hosts do not remove them from their clutch. First, we use a phylogenetic analysis to show that dark bronze-cuckoo eggs are not ancestral, but instead have evolved in a group that parasitizes hosts with dark nests exclusively. Second, we show that dark bronze-cuckoo eggs are laid by two species that parasitize hosts with relatively dark nests, whereas a congeneric bronze-cuckoo species parasitizing host nests with greater ambient light levels lays a mimetic egg. Finally, we use a model of avian visual processing to show that the dark eggs of Gould's bronze-cuckoo C. russatus are cryptic in dark host nests. Our results support the hypothesis that some bronze-cuckoo species and their hosts have pursued an alternative coevolutionary trajectory, which has resulted in the evolution of cryptic, rather than mimetic, cuckoo eggs.

AB Because production of gametes is costly in many species, selection is expected to favour mate recognition behaviours that reduce the probability of wasted mating attempts. Male Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulata, can learn to distinguish between conspecific females and between conspecific and congeneric females (P. picta) and make adaptive mating decisions on the basis of this information. In Mexico, however, introduced guppy males direct seemingly nonadaptive sexual behaviour to females of the distantly related Skiffia bilineata (Goodeidae). We asked whether prolonged exposure would lead to recognition and thus to a reduction of the level of male sexual behaviour experienced by S. bilineata females. Pairs of male guppies interacted freely with two female P. reticulata, two female S. bilineata, or one female of each species for 14 days. During trials, males encountered both familiar and unfamiliar females of the species they were trained with, and courtship towards these was quantified. We found that although male guppies habituated to familiar S. bilineata females, they persisted in their mating attempts towards unfamiliar ones. As with female guppies in previous studies, male guppies courted novel S. bilineata females and shunned those previously encountered. Our finding that guppy males recognize familiar S. bilineata females, but do not generalize this response, means that these endangered goodeids are vulnerable to persistent harassment. 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Spatial abilities have been associated with many ecologically relevant behaviours such as territoriality, mate choice, navigation and acquisition of food resources. Differential demands on spatial abilities in birds and mammals affect the hippocampus, the region of the brain responsible for spatial processing. In some bird and mammal species, higher demands on spatial abilities are associated with larger hippocampal volumes. The medial and dorsal cortices are the putative reptilian homologues of the mammalian hippocampus, yet few studies have examined the relationship between these brain areas and differential spatial use strategies in reptiles. Furthermore, many studies in birds and mammals compare hippocampal attributes between species that use space differently, potentially confounding species-specific effects with effects due to differential behaviours in spatial use. Here, we investigated the relationship between spatial use strategies and medial and dorsal cortical volumes in males of the side-blotched lizard. In this species, males occur in three different morphs, each morph using different spatial niches: large territory holders, small territory holders and nonterritory holders with home ranges smaller than the territories of small territory holders. We found that large territory holders had larger dorsal cortical volumes relative to the remainder of the telencephalon compared with nonterritorial males, and that small territory holders were intermediate. These results suggest that some aspect of holding a large territory may place demands on spatial abilities, which is reflected in a brain region thought partially responsible for spatial processing.

AB There is growing evidence that correlated behavioural traits, or behavioural syndromes, influence behavioural evolution in some taxa. Few studies, however, investigate whether the effects of a syndrome are the same for both sexes. We test whether variation in social tendency, inferred from interindividual distance, is correlated with other aspects of behaviour in male comb-footed spiders, Anelosimus studiosus. We compared these results to those from previous studies on female social tendency to determine (1) whether both sexes share the same behavioural syndrome and (2) whether its effects on mating success are the same for both sexes. Trait types in the syndrome analysis include foraging behaviour, anti-predator behaviour, exploratory behaviour and activity level. Our results suggest male A. studiosus, like females, can be categorized into two social classes: an aggregative (social) class and an intolerant (asocial) class. Social males (i.e. those with lower interindividual distance scores) were generally less aggressive towards prey and predators, and were less active. Furthermore, we provide evidence from a parent/offspring breeding study for an additive genetic component to male social tendency (heritability 0.32). To determine the influence of the male syndrome on mating success, we performed staged male-male contests between social and asocial males for access to females. We found that male social tendency was the single best predictor of success in these trials, with asocial males outperforming social. This finding is opposite to the trend observed in female A. studiosus, where social females experience higher mating success. We propose that the diametrically opposed mating outcomes between the sexes could generate evolutionary conflict. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Studies on the costs of sexual reproduction have focused primarily on the costs of heterosexual courtship and mating, whereas the costs of homosexual interactions, such as male-male or female-female displays and mounting, have been relatively neglected. This may reflect an implicit assumption that heterosexual interactions are more costly in most species, but this assumption has never been verified. We tested this assumption experimentally by comparing the effects of hetero- and homosexual interactions on life span in two distantly related insects with contrasting mating systems: the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, and the sexually dimorphic carrion fly Prochyliza xanthostoma. Despite pronounced behavioural and morphological differences between these species, results were remarkably congruent. Relative to individually housed virgin controls, male life span was reduced to a similar degree in males maintained with other males and males maintained with females. In contrast, female life span was strongly reduced relative to controls when females were kept with males, but was affected very little when females were maintained with other females. Thus, the costs of homosexual and heterosexual interactions are similar for males, but highly dissimilar for females. Our results suggest that the costs of homosexual interactions can be considerable, and may have important consequences for the evolution of mating systems.

AB Adult male grasshopper sparrows sing two structurally and functionally distinct songs: buzz song and warble song. To investigate how these songs develop, we tutored three groups of young males in the laboratory: one with recordings, one with live adult tutors and one with no song (isolate birds). We used visual scoring of spectrograms, principal components analysis of acoustic measures and spectrogram cross-correlation to analyse the results. Tape-tutored and live-tutored birds developed structurally normal buzz songs and largely normal warble songs. Isolate birds developed moderately normal buzz songs along with one or two more atypical songs. Neither buzz songs nor warble songs were accurately imitated by any of the tape-tutored birds. Live-tutored birds imitated buzz songs, but not warble songs, more closely than did tape-tutored birds. We also examined buzz songs in a population of grasshopper sparrows in the field. Comparisons of buzz songs of yearling males with those of their social fathers and with those of their first-breeding-year territorial neighbours indicate that sons do not imitate songs of their social fathers, and imitate songs of their immediate territorial neighbours only to a limited degree. Overall our results suggest that grasshopper sparrow song does not develop by imitation but that exposure to conspecific song is important for normal song development. Differences in development of the two song types may relate to both acoustic structure and function of these songs. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Life history theory predicts that females should modify their investment in a particular breeding attempt according to the likelihood of its success, as the investment of females in reproduction is typically higher than that of males. The ostrich mating system is promiscuous, and is thus a particularly interesting one in which to investigate differential investment by the sexes. To date, there has been no evidence that female ostriches discriminate between males as potential mates, but the degree of dimorphism in this promiscuous species and the variation in chick size within clutches suggest that differential maternal investment is likely. We investigated the relationship between egg mass and coloration of the feathers, bill, neck and legs of 15 male ostriches, maintained in a breeding flock at an ostrich farm in South Africa. Paternity was determined using microsatellite markers. We found that the colour of the neck, white and black body feathers, and the brightness of black feathers, predicted egg mass. These traits are exposed during the male courtship display, so we suggest that these visual cues influence the degree of maternal investment in eggs through their influence on female perception of mate quality.

AB On video, budgerigars observed a conspecific demonstrator depressing a stopper by pecking or by stepping and then feeding from the box below. The observers were given access to the stopper, immediately after observation or following a 24 h delay, and we recorded the proportion of their stopper removal responses that were made by pecking and by stepping. In experiments 1a and 1b, observers of pecking made a greater proportion of pecking responses than observers of stepping, and this effect did not vary between the immediate and delayed test groups. The results of experiment 2 replicated this effect with a delayed test, and suggested that it was due to imitation of pecking. Control birds that observed a demonstrator feeding, but did not see stopper removal, made a smaller proportion of pecking responses than pecking observers, but their behaviour did not differ from that of stepping observers. These findings are consistent with the associative sequence learning model of imitation, which suggests that the capacity to imitate a particular action depends on correlated experience of observing and executing that action.

AB The determination of an individual's behaviour often relies upon complex signals that convey messages about the environment it inhabits. In aquatic environments such signals take varied and conflicting forms including chemical cues indicating food or potential mates being opposed by the presence of competitor or predator odour. Despite ever increasing knowledge of the chemical nature of signalling compounds, little is known of how the environment affects an animal's response towards such infochemicals. We examined how the European shore crab, Carcinus maenas, changes its behaviour in relation to recent social interactions. We hypothesized that agonistic encounters would affect males' behaviour towards two chemical signals: the female sex pheromone cue and a feeding odour (mussel-infused water). In a laboratory experiment, agonistic encounters significantly increased males' response times to food stimuli regardless of their dominance status. Additionally, after an aggressive interaction, 40% of subordinate males failed to respond, and both winners and losers showed a delayed response, to the female sex pheromone. Status-dependent responses by males are potential signs of social structures, enabling them to use social hierarchy-driven mating tactics. This could reduce the number and intensity of costly fights during the short reproductive window. This is a rare example of social interactions directly affecting an animal's response to chemical cues for feeding and reproduction, opening the field for further studies on the complexity of chemical communication.

AB When males compete with rivals in the presence of females, there may be a trade-off between courtship and competition. We examined responses of female redback spiders, Latrodectus hasselti, to courtship from rival males under different competitive contexts. We paired size-matched males with females, and assessed correlates of male mating success. We compared these results to published data between females and single males or size-mismatched rivals. Size-matched males attempted copulation after a brief courtship, a strategy similar to smaller, 'sneaker' males in size-mismatched competitions. We also found context-dependent differences in female remating frequency and premature cannibalism. In size-mismatched and single-male trials, females prematurely cannibalized smaller males and males that mated quickly, but this was not the case when rivals were size-matched. However, in both types of competitive trials, males that mated rapidly paid a fitness cost. The courtship duration of the first male to mate was inversely related to the number of copulations that females accepted from that male's rival. Thus, females use premature cannibalism to reduce the paternity of males that minimize investment in courtship if they are clearly distinguishable from their rivals ( mismatched context), but they allow males to continue to compete if they are similar in quality ( matched context). In both cases, biases in female remating behaviour favoured males that invested in courtship. We conclude that female reproductive behaviour partly depends on the relative size of competing males, but that male fitness depends heavily on investment in courtship.

AB Animals that travel in groups must synchronize the timing of impending departures to ensure group cohesion. The mechanisms used by a honeybee, Apis mellifera, colony to organize the departure of a swarm from its nest remain a mystery. We examined the signals that trigger a swarm's explosive exodus from the parental nest, and we documented the concurrent changes in bee density and mobility. Using video recordings of swarms exiting observation hives, we analysed how bees in three swarming colonies prepared for and then performed their sudden departures. Over the 60 min before swarm exodus, the production of piping signals gradually increased and ultimately peaked at the start of the swarm departure. Also, during swarm exodus, bee density (number of bees in 100 cm(2)) dropped markedly, whereas the average bee velocity (mm/s), and the production of buzz-run signals, spiked dramatically. Neither waggle runs nor shaking signals showed increases before or during swarm exodus. The explosive departure of a honeybee swarm from its parental nest shows how animals can use the same communication signals in different contexts; we now know that honeybees use piping and buzz-run signals to initiate both a swarm's departure from its nest and a swarm's take-off from its bivouac site. This study also shows how a small minority of individuals in a social insect colony can operate as an oligarchy to make an important decision, i.e. when a swarm should leave its nest to found a new colony.

AB Many animals engage in dyadic vocal exchanges. Studying the patterns of vocal output and spatial arrangement of individuals in these interactions can often reveal information concerning their function. Sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, frequently exchange short sequences of clicks, termed codas, in social contexts. We analysed the coda vocalizations of sperm whale social units encountered in two different oceans to test hypotheses about how coda exchanges are organized. We also used a dynamic recording array to estimate the spatial scale of these vocal interactions. Coda production was influenced by the timing and types of codas produced by other unit members, resulting in the production of duet-like sequences of coda exchanges between pairs of whales. Codas were more likely to be made within 2 s of another coda than expected by chance, and whales were more likely to match previously produced codas than expected by chance, although matching appeared to be largely a result of the matching of one particular coda type within each social unit. Patterns of overlapping and matching exchanges did not seem to be correlated with relatedness or social affiliation. These exchanges occurred over a range of spatial scales, and are thus likely to be functional both between whales that are near and between those that are comparatively far from one another. The context of these exchanges, reciprocity in coda overlapping, and the sequencing of exchanges into duet-like chains all suggest that coda overlapping and matching function to reinforce social bonds between whales.

ID PARASITES
AB Metalmark moth larvae in the genus Brenthia ( Lepidoptera: Choreutidae) live beneath gauzy web shelters spun over a leaf surface and chew an escape hole into the floor of their nests through which they dart when alarmed. We provide a video and data showing that these larvae, when their webs are disturbed, shoot through their wormhole to the opposite side of the leaf at extremely high speeds: the fastest caterpillar passed through to the opposite leaf surface in only 100 ms. Experimental data show that Brenthia larvae use their silken web shelters as an extension of their sensory system. Although such usage of webbing is not surprising given what is known about spider webs, this is the first time such a behaviour has been shown to occur in Lepidoptera. Two grossly hypertrophied abdominal setae, directed behind the body, are not pulled through the wormhole, but instead remain intercalated into the silken lattice of the web shelter. By leaving the two setae engaged, the caterpillar is able to monitor both sides of its host leaf simultaneously. We report analogous escape hole behaviours in four other microlepidopteran families: Elachistidae, Gelechiidae, Oecophoridae and Pyralidae. In at least one genus of the latter family (Monoloxis), two caudally directed abdominal setae are hypertrophied in the same fashion as in Brenthia. We suspect that both escape holes and hypertrophied abdominal setae are more common and taxonomically widespread than presently recognized and that both 'strategies' will be shown to occur among other microlepidopterans.

ID ALARM CALLS; INFORMATION
AB The function and structure of alarm signals may vary with the caller's age, and some of this variation may be because young may have to attract the attention of their caregivers. The structure of calls may reveal this function. Yellow-bellied marmot, Marmota flaviventris, pups utter a novel vocalization, an elongated scream, which often contains nonlinear acoustic characteristics, 6% of the time when handled within about a week of emergence from their natal burrow. With a single exception in over 4000 captures, only pups uttered these unique vocalizations. Acoustically, pup screams are more than an order of magnitude longer than pup alarm calls and a majority of the screams have at least one type of nonlinearity. Playback experiments showed that average-length screams elicited higher-level responses than adult alarm calls and that elongated and average-length screams elicited higher-level responses than shortened screams. The acoustic structure of screams makes them especially evocative, and they may function to allow pups to recruit their mothers to help them fend off predators. More generally, an examination of nonlinearities in vocalizations of other species suggests that nonlinearities may be an honest indicator of arousal, and this honesty elicits heightened responses in receivers.

AB Aposematic coloration commonly involves patterns with contrasting colours. The early larva of Parnassius apollo is uniformly black, but the later instars develop two rows of dorsal orange spots. We tested the effect of these orange markings on the conspicuousness of the last-instar larva, by manipulating larval coloration in photographs from a natural habitat and measuring how fast human subjects could discover the larva on a touch screen. In the first experiment we compared the detectability of the natural phenotype with that of manipulated uniformly black and uniformly orange variants at different distances. In the second experiment with another set of photographs we added manipulations involving enlarged and reduced spot sizes. Generally, detection time increased with distance, and decreased with the proportion of orange in the coloration. The uniformly black larvae were surprisingly hard to detect even at the closest distances, suggesting that the young black instar has an efficient camou. age. Furthermore, even a small amount of orange colour increased the conspicuousness of the larva considerably, indicating that the orange markings are costly in terms of detectability. Importantly, as the increase in detection time over distances was larger for the natural coloration than for the orange coloration, we suggest that the natural coloration may involve a distance-dependent switch from conspicuousness to camou. age with increasing distance. Thus, even though the orange markings most probably have a signalling function, the coloration is not maximized for either crypsis or conspicuousness.

AB Granivorous rodents prefer large seeds because they offer a higher nutrient content, but such preferences may be counterbalanced by the higher costs of handling and transporting larger seeds. We hypothesized that this compromise underlying foraging decisions depends simultaneously on the size of both seeds and rodents. A given seed offers a fixed amount of resources, but the costs of handling and transporting that seed could increase as the rodent size decreases. We designed a laboratory experiment to assess explicitly whether seed choices depend on the size of both seeds and rodents. As a model, we used two different- sized species, the Algerian mouse Mus spretus (8-15 g) and the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus (18-40 g), that face the decision of choosing Holm oak (Quercus ilex) acorns from 0.5 to 15 g under natural conditions. The probability of seed removal decreased as the ratio of seed size to rodent size increased in both rodent species. Seeds heavier than 60% of the rodent's mass led to substantial decreases in acorn removal and seeds heavier than 70% of the rodent's mass were in no case removed. This critical value limited the choice of the largest seeds by the smaller species, but not by the larger one. Therefore, the larger species selected larger acorns and with a wider variance in size than the smaller species. Our results show the importance of considering jointly the sizes of seeds and rodents in the study of foraging decisions and seed dispersal behaviour by granivorous rodents.

AB The fission-fusion society of bottlenose dolphins seems particularly well suited to balancing the costs and benefits of grouping. Here, we examined four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses regarding the causes and/or functions of calf grouping patterns when with and away from the mother: maternal influence, same-sex bond formation, protection and social skill development. We evaluated the role of calf ( calf sex, age and separation from their mothers) and maternal characteristics ( foraging time and sociality) in shaping the size and composition of motherecalf groups using focal observations of 49 mothers and 89 calves. Mother-calf groups were biased towards association with females of all ages and with male calves, but contained relatively few juvenile and adult males. Although there was some support for all of the hypotheses, the social skills hypothesis best explained male calf social patterns, and maternal influence better explained female calf social patterns. While maternal sociality influenced calves of both sexes, daughters mirrored the mother during separations, whereas sons did the opposite, seeking more social contact if their mothers were solitary and seeking less social contact if their mothers were sociable. During motherecalf separations, calves of both sexes preferentially associated with immatures over adults, but male calves preferred juvenile and adult male associates, which female calves, like their mothers, avoided. Calf social patterns illustrate the specific social and ecological challenges that they face in relation to and independent of their mothers.

AB Most research on sexual cannibalism has focused on factors influencing female motivation to engage in cannibalism. However, a critical factor that may mediate the actual occurrence of sexual cannibalism is male vulnerability to female attacks. We tested whether sexual size dimorphism ( SSD) affected whether hungry females were successful in sexual cannibalism in a moderately size dimorphic wolf spider, Hogna helluo. Experimentally food-limited females cannibalized males more frequently than did well-fed females. However, in a correlational study, female body condition was only a significant predictor of the occurrence of sexual cannibalism if SSD was included in the model. Our results suggest that SSD is an important factor mediating the occurrence of sexual cannibalism in H. helluo by affecting male vulnerability to female attacks. Consideration of factors affecting male vulnerability to cannibalistic attacks by females may be critical to understanding the occurrence and evolution of sexual cannibalism. 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To deter predator attack, aposematic prey species advertise their unprofitability with one or more conspicuous warning signals that, in turn, enhance the avoidance learning of predators. We studied the costs and benefits of multicomponent signalling in Parasemia plantaginis moths. The hairy moth larvae have an orange patch on their otherwise black bodies. The patch varies phenotypically and genetically in size. We studied whether the detection risk associated with patch size varied against two backgrounds (green or brown) with two different predators: naive chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, and experienced great tits, Parus major. We also evaluated the signal value of different defence traits within a multicomponent signal by testing which combination of two traits, hairiness and the presence or size of the orange patch, most affected the avoidance learning rate of predators. Larvae with a large orange patch were at greater risk of detection by birds against both backgrounds. This higher detection risk was traded-off with enhanced avoidance learning rate. The orange patch had a higher signal value for the predators than did hairiness, which only slightly increased the survival of totally black or small-patched larvae but did not affect the defence of larvae with a large orange patch. Multicomponent defences are therefore not necessarily additive and variation in the warning coloration of aposematic animals may be partly explained by variation in the relative benefits of different components of a warning signal to different predators.

AB Central-place foragers must decide how to trade off travel time with foraging time when energy costs and gains differ between available prey types. Oxygen consumption places a fundamental constraint on the available options for deep-diving birds. Dives exceeding the aerobic dive limit (ADL) are considered costly because they extend the interdive surface time. Nevertheless, dives exceeding ADL, combined with short surface pauses, may be an efficient strategy if ( 1) prey density or ( 2) the probability of losing contact with ephemeral prey is high. We examined surface pause duration, dive duration and dive depth during dive bouts of Brunnich's guillemots, Uria lomvia, immediately before prey delivery. Surface pauses were more strongly related to dive depth than to duration and were both 'anticipatory' ( of short dives) and 'reactive' ( to long dives). Surface pauses decreased weakly, but significantly, with prey mass and were not shorter for ephemeral than for benthic prey once prey mass was accounted for. Dive duration was a decelerating function of dive depth and was unaffected by prey type ( benthic versus pelagic). Dive duration ( as a function of depth), bottom time ( as a function of depth and duration) and an index for prey acquisition rate based on these parameters all increased with prey mass. Thus, surface pause duration was not reduced during dive bouts for ephemeral prey and only slightly reduced during dive bouts for larger prey, suggesting that guillemots alter other components of the dive cycle ( bottom time, transit time) to accommodate differences in prey type and energy gain.

AB history research has mostly neglected learning even though it is probably a major contributor to lifetime performance in a variety of animals. As part of an ongoing project evaluating the relative contribution of learning, physiology and effort to performance throughout the life span, I quantified lifetime performance of honeybees, Apis mellifera, foraging at a feeder. Unlike natural foraging, where bees may learn a variety of features that contribute to increased performance, food collection from a feeder requires little learning. Foragers showed no long- term change in the rate of food delivery, a pattern that was different from published data indicating a long- term gradual increase in foraging performance in honeybees under natural settings. The discrepancy between bees' lifetime performance in the artificial versus natural settings suggests that learning is the key component contributing to the increase in performance throughout a forager's life as observed in the field.

AB We observed 42 humpback whale mother-offspring pairs on a foraging ground in southeast Alaska during 2001 and 2002 to examine their spatial association. We found that whenever these pairs were at the surface they maintained close proximity similar to that observed in terrestrial followers. By examining their dive behaviour, however, we determined that calves dive significantly less frequently and for shorter durations than their mothers, leading to periods of separation during foraging dives. Because this is likely to increase the risk of calf predation, females responded by significantly shortening the duration of their dives when unaccompanied by their offspring, thereby reducing this risk. As the season progressed, we observed that this behaviour waned and females became significantly less responsive to their offspring. At the same time, calves appeared to increase their role in maintaining proximity by synchronizing their dives with the mothers increasingly often. We discuss this shift in proximity maintenance in terms of the energetics associated with lactation, increased foraging effort by the offspring and parent-offspring conflict.

AB Dominance is a relative measure that allows asymmetrical relationships between individuals to be quantified. These kinds of relationships often depend on aggressive behaviour and the steroid hormone most frequently associated with aggressiveness is testosterone. Testosterone is present in both sexes and implanting it can provoke a rise of individual aggressiveness leading consequently to an increase of social status. Many researchers have studied the relationship between plasma testosterone and dominance but few have focused on yolk testosterone and social hierarchy. Thus we aimed to study the possible influence of the mother's social status on egg yolk testosterone deposition. Our hypothesis is that dominant females lay eggs containing more testosterone than subordinate females. We recorded the social hierarchy of 24 female domesticated canaries, Serinus canaria, and studied the influence of their social status on the concentration of testosterone in their egg yolks and on other egg characteristics. Our results show a significant relationship between a mother's social status and the amount of testosterone deposited in its yolks: the more dominant the females are, the more concentrated in testosterone their eggs are. Our results also show that yolk testosterone increases with laying order, whereas no relationship between mothers' rank number and their clutch size or egg mass was found. We conclude that there is a clear effect of maternal social status on yolk testosterone and discuss dominance inheritance. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Parental males of several blenniid species have a pair of glands on the anal fin. These are thought to be a source of pheromones for female attraction and/or of antimicrobials for egg protection. In Salaria pavo, we tested the female attraction hypothesis and whether the anal glands are essential for egg parental care. In S. pavo and Salaria fluviatilis, we tested whether anal glands affect female mate choice. In a Y-maze, reproductive females were attracted to water conditioned by males with anal glands and macerated anal glands but not to substances released by conspecific females, water conditioned by males that had the anal glands removed or to macerated anal fin rays. Females preferred to spawn in nests of males with anal glands than in those of males without anal glands. In the laboratory, neither hatching success nor development time was affected by the removal of the anal glands from parental males. In contrast, most of the eggs without parental care did not complete their development. We suggest that the anal glands are specialized in the secretion of a pheromone that attracts reproductive females, and blenniids have evolved true chemical communication, possibly through the selective pressure of female mate choice.

AB The effect of group size and the number of helpers on reproductive success is crucial to understand the evolution and maintenance of cooperative breeding. In northern Spain, carrion crows form kin-groups (three to nine individuals) where up to five individuals contribute to rearing the young. Using data from 99 different territories, followed over 10 years, we showed that group size was positively correlated with the annual number of fledglings produced, after controlling for the potential confounding effect of territory quality. This occurred through: (1) an increased probability for larger groups of renesting after early nest failure; (2) a higher probability of nest success; and (3) a higher number of fledglings produced in successful attempts. Video-recorded observations at the nests showed that chicks received more food in larger groups during the first 10 days of life, when the risk of starvation is highest, suggesting a role of allofeeding by additional carers in augmenting the reproductive success of a group. In crows, indirect and direct benefits through increased production of young are therefore available to nonbreeding group members. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Parental food deliveries are generally assumed to promote offspring fitness in altricial birds, mainly because mass at. edging often predicts recruitment as breeding adults. We studied how such provisioning influences recruitment in house sparrows, Passer domesticus, through both a traditional two-step indirect analysis ( via. edging mass) and a single direct analysis. In our study, total parental deliveries predicted neither. edging mass nor recruitment. Instead, delivery of the largest food items ('e-prey') predicted both. Offspring recruitment was determined only by personal mass, but from a parental perspective, the number of recruits per brood hinged principally on two factors, brood size and mean nestling mass at. edging. As in other species, recruitment probability declined across the breeding season, even though deliveries of the largest food items increased. Within the natural range of provisioning that parents achieved, the function relating e-prey and recruitment appeared to be accelerating, indicating that parents could rapidly enhance offspring success if bringing more of those items were possible. The failure of adults to do so suggests that the associated foraging costs are likely to be prohibitive, illustrating what has been called a 'food ESS' for parental care.

AB Theoreticians propose that trained winning and losing are important processes in creating linear animal dominance hierarchies, and experiments have shown that both processes can occur in animals, but their actual roles in creating natural hierarchies are unknown. We described agonism in 18 broods of three blue-footed boobies, Sula nebouxii, a species for which trained winning and losing have been demonstrated, to infer how these processes generate and maintain a natural hierarchy. Ranks in the linear hierarchy that emerged in every brood were initially assigned by asymmetries in age, size and maturity, which led to differences between broodmates in levels of expressed and received aggression and, consequently, to differences in the training of their aggressiveness and submissiveness. Later, ranks appeared to be maintained by the chicks' acquired aggressive and submissive tendencies combined with ongoing effects of persisting differences in size and maturity. Our results suggest that trained winning and trained losing are important in the construction of booby hierarchies but that these two axes of learning are largely independent. Increase in submissiveness occurs over a period of about 10 - 20 days, and the level of submissiveness reached varies with the amount of aggression received. After training, submissiveness is apparently maintained by a lower level of aggression and increasing use of threats. Threats become increasingly effective as chicks age, but are never as effective as attacks. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The routes of nine adult pigeons repeatedly released from a familiar site 9.1 km west of their Frankfurt home loft were recorded with the help of GPS-based flight recorders. Analysis of the tracks shows considerable variability not only between individual birds, but also between the tracks of each individual concerning duration of flight, flying speed and the routes chosen. The efficiencies (direct route divided by length of the route taken) are fairly high, ranging from 0.77 to 0.91. They did not increase significantly, nor did the tracks become more similar, as the pigeons became more familiar with the area between the release site and the loft. Homing flights begin with a starting phase of lower efficiency. Five hundred metres from the release point, all birds were significantly oriented; at 2500 m, they showed a small southerly deviation from the home direction. The overland flights were mostly very straight, with efficiencies above 0.9, and so was the approach to the loft. The flying corridor crossed the western suburbs of metropolitan Frankfurt, rich with conspicuous landmarks and highways, but an obvious influence of these features was not observed. In contrast to what was reported from other areas, our pigeons did not show a pronounced tendency to follow highways. Loops and detours in the course of the return flights are in part attributed to social interactions with other pigeons. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Colourful ornaments are typically thought to be selected through female choice ( intersexual selection), but often they also function as signals of dominance in intrasexual competition. The zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, is a well-studied model species for the evolution of colourful ornaments through female choice, and most research interest has focused on the red beak of males. However, results have been mixed, and in our population, we have found no female preference for males with redder beaks. To investigate whether beak colour is instead used as a signal in intrasexual competition, we studied aggressive behaviour of 160 male and 133 female zebra finches in experimentally staged encounters. Beak coloration was sexually dimorphic in the red and orange, as well as the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum, where females showed a more pronounced UV peak. There was a trend for females with less male-like UV reflectance to be more aggressive, but otherwise, beak colour explained little, if any, of the variation in aggressiveness within sexes during competition for a potential partner. Hence beak colour is unlikely to be a signal of dominance, at least under our experimental conditions. Body size often influences the outcome of competition, and we found a weak but significant correlation between body size and aggressiveness that differed between the sexes. Large males were more aggressive than small males whereas small females were more aggressive than large females. Generally, the level of aggressiveness was highly repeatable within individuals, but beak colour and body size explained only little of the between-individual variation.

AB Male mating signals are often multidimensional, potentially providing multiple messages to females. However, the relative importance of different signal dimensions and their context dependency are poorly understood. Even in a well-studied species such as the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, an important avian model for the study of mate choice, there is little consensus on the relative weighting of visual versus acoustic signals in mate choice. We therefore tested the consistency and repeatability of female mating preferences across different test contexts, presenting male song only or full courtship displays. We concurrently conducted a detailed analysis of male song characteristics and morphological traits. Females' individual preferences were consistent across three commonly used binary test paradigms (operant and phonotaxis tests with songs and association tests with live males). Preference direction was thus independent of test contexts. Preference strength was repeatable only between the operant and live male tests, possibly because these two tests allowed active interaction with songs or males whereas exposure to songs in the phonotaxis test was passive. The song structure parameters that predicted female preferences best were context independent and also predicted male morphology. We conclude from the combined results that song structure (in addition to song rate or absolute output as previously suggested) does contain sufficient information on the singer for female mate choice. We suggest that the earlier focus on song rate rather than song content might partly account for the differences between studies in the importance attributed to acoustic versus visual signals.

AB Foraging and vigilance conflict in animals that lower their head during food search and handling, but it is less clear whether these activities conflict in animals that handle food with the head raised. In these species, at least part of the foraging process is physically compatible with vigilance. Nevertheless, both vigilance and food handling require cognitive resources, so animals may not be vigilant whenever their head is raised. We tested whether grey squirrels are vigilant when they are handling food items held in their forepaws while in a semiupright posture. If vigilance occurs during handling, we predicted that squirrels finding food in a location with a partially blocked view would change location before handling to improve visibility. Because this test assumes that the benefit of vigilance during handling is greater than the cost of moving, we tested small food items (sunflower seeds) in which the temporal cost of changing position on the rate of food intake was relatively high and large items (crackers with peanut butter) in which the cost of changing position was relatively low. When handling crackers, squirrels that had their lateral view obstructed at the food presentation site changed to a position with a better view more often than controls or squirrels that had their overhead view obstructed. When handling sunflower seeds, squirrels never changed their position. These results support the view that squirrels are vigilant during semiupright handling, but that vigilance may be sacrificed if it leads to high foraging costs.

AB There has been wide empirical and theoretical interest in how diving animals allocate time between obtaining oxygen at the surface and foraging at depth. Assuming diminishing returns in oxygen gain at the surface, classic diving models predict that time on the surface should increase, while time spent foraging at depth should first increase and then decrease as travel time increases. Controlled laboratory experiments have indicated partial support for predictions of diving models; however, their usefulness in understanding patterns of diving behaviour in the wild is still in question. We assessed the applicability of diving models to foraging patterns of common elders, Somateria mollissima sedentaria, wintering in the Canadian Arctic. Underwater footage was used to quantify time foraging at depth and duration of surface pauses in relation to changes in travel time induced by strong tidal currents. Consistent with predictions of diving models, bottom foraging time decreased with increasing travel time, while total dive duration was relatively constant at 58.47 +/- 5.32 s, close to the estimated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, durations of surface pauses were not associated with diving parameters, as anticipated from diving models. Durations of surface pauses were highly variable (183.05 +/- 158.06 s) and often considerably longer than necessary to replenish oxygen stores. While the duration of surface pauses predicted by diving models in relation to travel time may be an optimal strategy when obtaining oxygen at the surface is the predominant constraint to foraging, a variety of processes operating at different timescales can influence behavioural patterns in the wild. Preliminary analysis considering the rate of digestive processing suggests that foraging patterns of eiders could be simultaneously influenced by several different rate constraints. Therefore, while static modelling approaches are an important heuristic tool for elucidating mechanisms underlying diving behaviour, dynamic approaches, which can incorporate variables concerning multiple physiological and environmental states, will probably be required to fully understand complex foraging patterns observed in the wild. 2007 The Association for the study of Animal Behaviour.

AB It has been suggested that individual recognition based on song may be constrained by repertoire size in songbirds with very large song repertoires. This hypothesis has been difficult to test because there are few studies on species with very large repertoires and because traditional experiments based on the dear enemy effect do not provide evidence against recognition. The tropical mockingbird, Mimus gilvus, is a cooperative breeder with very large song repertoires and stable territorial neighbourhoods. The social system of this species allowed us to test individual recognition based on song independently from the dear enemy effect by evaluating male response to playback of strangers, neighbours (from shared and unshared boundaries), co-males (i.e. other males in the same social group) and own songs. Although subjects did not show a dear enemy effect, they were less aggressive to co-males than to all other singers. Our results suggest that recognition in tropical mockingbirds (1) does not simply distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar singers, (2) requires a small sample of both songs and song types, (3) does not rely on individual-specific sequences of song types and (4) is not likely to rely on group-specific vocal signatures potentially available in cooperatively breeding groups. We conclude that this is a case of true recognition and we suggest that the lack of a dear enemy effect in this and other species with large repertoires may relate to the role of song in mate attraction and the perception of neighbours as a threat to future paternity.

AB Many animals hoard food when it is plentiful for periods when it is scarce. The time between storage and retrieval can be a matter of hours to months. To increase the probability that hoards will still be available when needed, hoarding should happen in such a way that it reduces cache loss. Scatter hoarders can do this by manipulating the density and dispersal of caches to minimize the foraging efficiency of pilferers. Previous work has shown that there is an optimal density that reduces cache loss. We investigated whether cache distribution patterns can be manipulated to reduce cache loss. We distributed seeds in a uniform, random or clustered manner in the field and tested their survival. More hyperdispersed distributions reduced seed loss, indicating that these distributions may be useful to hoarding animals. The most clustered distributions of seeds became more hyperdispersed as time progressed, decreasing the risk of discovery for the remaining caches. This suggests that hoarders could adopt the alternative strategy of hoarding a larger number of items to begin with, allowing initial cache loss to produce a more hyperdispersed distribution gradually as the clustered sections are removed. Further work needs to investigate whether it is evolutionarily adaptive to invest in hoarding more items or to invest in a hyperdispersing strategy. Our results also show that seeds disappeared at a lower rate in the winter, suggesting there is some degree of safety for hoarded food when it is needed most.

AB Theoretical studies suggest that mechanisms underlying habitat and population structure are important for shaping inter- and intraspecific variation in dispersal behaviour. Empirical evidence, especially in organisms living in spatially structured populations, however, is scarce. We investigated the relation between habitat configuration (patch size, connectivity) and dispersal by studying variation in tiptoe behaviour in the dune wolf spider, Pardosa monticola, under standardized laboratory conditions. Tiptoe behaviour prepares spiderlings for ballooning and can hence be considered as a precursor of aerial dispersal. The proportion of individuals that displayed tiptoe behaviour was highest in offspring from grasslands in a large dune landscape where habitat was continuously available, intermediate in offspring originating from a fragmented landscape, and lowest in offspring originating from a small and extremely isolated grassland patch. At the level of the fragmented landscape, variation was related to size and connectivity of four subpopulations. Both between and within landscapes, maternal condition had no effect on offspring dispersal. These results indicate that changes in habitat configuration from a large, connected landscape towards a small, fragmented one may lead to a decrease in dispersal rates, even at small spatial scales. Hence, behavioural traits narrowly linked to dispersal evolve towards less mobile phenotypes in small, isolated habitats, indicating high dispersal costs and low efficacy for gene flow in a spider species restricted to fragmented habitats.

AB African elephants are a polygynous species that raise offspring in a matriarchal society. Unlike females, males disperse, spend time in mate groups and search for mates when mature. Urinary chemical signals aid males in detecting reproductively active females. A preovulatory pheromone has been identified in Asian elephants, Elephas maximus, but has not yet been experimentally identified in African elephants. In this study, the goal was to determine whether adult captive male African elephants can distinguish between urine from conspecific females in luteal and periovulatory oestrous stages as an indication that a preovulatory pheromone is released in the urine. Urine was collected from seven different female African elephants during their luteal and periovulatory periods of oestrus. Bioassays were conducted with nine adult male elephants housed at six different facilities. Males were presented with the two urine types and a control sample once a day over 3 days to reduce sample novelty, which can result in misleadingly high responses. All mates showed greater chemosensory responses to the periovulatory urine by trial 3 with the ability to distinguish the urines increasing over the 3 days. This is the first experimental behavioural evidence that African elephants release an oestrous pheromone in the urine. The ability of the captive male elephants to discern between the two urine types bolsters the hypothesis that there is a preovulatory pheromone in African elephants and encourages efforts to identify it.

AB Sibling rivalry, occurring in the form of intense aggression directed at siblings, has been described in many birds, but few mammals. In the spotted hyaena, early aggression directed at littermates has been hypothesized to function as a mechanism for litter reduction by siblicide, particularly within same-sex litters. Alternatively, intralitter aggression might serve to establish and maintain a rank relationship between twin littermates. Our goal here was to use long-term observations of 46 litters to test these two hypotheses in wild Crocuta. Rates of sibling aggression were high during the first 2 months of life, but then dropped to low levels. During the first year of life, littermates fought mainly over milk and meat, both of which are critical food resources, and dominant cubs were heavier than subordinate siblings of the same age. Rates at which mixed-sex littermates fought did not differ significantly from fighting rates within same-sex litters. Rates of intralitter aggression were higher when local prey were scarce than when prey were abundant. Although we found no significant effect of maternal social rank on cub aggression rates, our results were consistent with the notion that aggression rates within litters vary with maternal rank. Our results did not support the hypothesis that intralitter aggression functions to mediate siblicide, particularly within same-sex litters. Instead, our results were consistent with the hypothesis that early sibling aggression in Crocuta functions to establish and maintain a rank relationship within the litter.

AB Males are predicted to trade-off parental effort (PE) for current or future mating effort (ME) at times when this is likely to increase their lifetime reproductive success. We used a cross-validated regression tree analysis to predict the effect of several variables on nest-provisioning visits by male stitchbirds (or hihi, Notiomystis cincta). For 51 first broods, males did not invest in secondary females' broods, nor did they provision nests containing only one chick. Male PE was positively correlated with brood size in nests containing more than one chick: male age, additional mating opportunities and proximity to supplementary food had minor effects on male provisioning rates in moderate-sized broods. For 23 second broods, provisioning was also correlated with female rank and brood size. Regression trees offer advantages over traditional linear parametric techniques. In this study, they outperformed multiple linear regression in their prediction accuracy, in highlighting interactions and allowing visualization of a hierarchy of decision-making rules used to predict offspring provisioning by male stitchbirds. While previous models of paternal investment have focused on ME/PE trade-offs as static functions, we analysed first and second broods separately because of the possibility that the relative importance of some variables changes as the breeding season progresses.

AB When confronted with a predator, individuals often alter their behaviour to minimize predation risk. To investigate behavioural changes induced by predator presence and light in a zooplankton species, we video-recorded the swimming behaviour of waterfleas, Daphnia pulicaria. Chemical cues from two predators with different hunting techniques (a visual predator: bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus; and a tactile predator: phantom midge larvae, Chaoborus sp.) were used in two sets of experiments. We filmed Daphnia individually in either control or predator-treated water, in a light or dark environment (four treatments in total) and recorded swimming speed, hop rate, sink rate and net angle of swimming. All swimming parameters in the fish experiment and two in the Chaoborus sp. experiment changed significantly between treatments. The coefficient of variation (CV) of all parameters except sink rate decreased significantly in the presence of light and/or a predator. In the presence of light, CV values declined by at least two-fold in both fish and Cliaoborus experiments, while the changes in CV values between treatments varied depending on the type of predator used in the experiment. Waterfleas increased their swimming uniformity while isolated from other individuals. We therefore conclude that this swimming behaviour pattern is based on individual perception of both kairomones and light in the environment rather than on social interactions. Our results suggest that uniformity in swimming behaviour may be an important defence mechanism in zooplankton, aiming to minimize oddity among group members in order to decrease predation risk.

AB Socioecological models of the evolution of female-bonded societies predict a relation between resource distribution and the nature of female affiliative and dominance relationships. Species that mainly rely on abundant, widely distributed resources, like African savanna elephants, are predicted to have unresolved dominance hierarchies and poorly differentiated female social relationships. Contrary to this prediction, female elephants have well-differentiated social relationships; however, little is known about the nature of their dominance rank relationships. Here we present the first quantitative analysis of dominance relationships within 'family' groups of adult female elephants in two wild populations: one in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, and another in Tarangire National Park, Tanzania. We tested three possibilities, that female elephants: (1) are egalitarian, (2) have linear, nepotistic hierarchies, or (3) have linear age/size-ordered hierarchies. Our results best support the third outcome: dominance rank relationships were transitive within families and highly asymmetrical within dyads, such that older, larger females consistently dominated smaller, younger females. We discuss the implications of this result for understanding the evolution of female social relationships. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Uneven sharing of reproduction (reproductive skew) among members of a cooperative animal society is one of the key features associated with advanced sociality and task specialization. Allocation of reproduction varies greatly among taxa, and reproductive skew models are evolutionary models that aim at explaining this variation. We tested reproductive skew theory using the Australian social allodapine bee Exoneura robusta. Reproductive skew was negatively correlated with relatedness, as predicted by the so-called tug-of-war model and the restraint model. Both models assume that a dominant breeder in a society does not have full control over the allocation of reproduction among group members, in contrast to classical concession models. Overall, the tug-of-war model seems to account better for the evolution of reproductive sharing in E. robusta than the restraint model. However, neither model can be ruled out, and a tug-of-war as well as a restraint model mechanism could apply in parallel in newly founded and overwintered colonies, respectively. This raises the possibility that skew models are not mutually exclusive and points to a more dynamic view on reproductive partitioning among breeders of an animal society.

AB The evolution of complex signals via sexual selection is becoming a primary focus in mate choice studies. Male swordtail fish, Xiphophorus helleri, have a secondary sexual trait, the sword, which is a composite trait consisting of four components favoured by sexual selection via female mate choice. The components include three coloured stripes and size. Although a complete sword is most attractive to female green swordtails, females prefer partial swords containing complete black stripes to incomplete swords lacking black coloration. Female swordtails also prefer longer swords. We addressed how subcomponents of the sword affect female mate choice. Digitally altered videos were used to investigate whether females respond differently to swords with proximal black stripes than to swords with distal black stripes. Although females preferred complete swords to both of the stimuli with partial stripes, they preferred males with distally striped swords to males with proximally striped swords. These results are discussed in light of hypotheses concerning the evolution of mating preferences for multicomponent traits. This study contributes to the growing body of information regarding the response of females to multicomponent visual traits. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Leaf-cutting ants (Atta spp.) are central-place foragers that use fragments of leaf tissue as substrate for symbiotic fungal gardens. A standard hypothesis of central-place foraging theory is that foragers will select load sizes that optimize their performance, but previous study has shown that Atta workers carry loads well below the size needed to maximize either the rate or the energetic efficiency of leaf tissue delivery to the nest. We propose that the underground processing of leaf fragments following delivery restricts the overall rate of resource acquisition in a way that should favour the collection of small loads. We used laboratory colonies of Atta colombica housed in transparent nests to study tissue transfer between chambers, and hoisting, cleaning and shredding of fragments on the fungal gardens. Leaf fragment size had strong effects on all these processes except hoisting fragment on to the garden. The time needed for these underground activities would often be greater than the time used to retrieve it from a vegetation source. Thus, maximization of the delivery rate may not maximize the overall rate of resource acquisition. Load selection by foragers outside the nest may have evolved to optimize the processing activities below ground in which they do not take part.

AB Cottontop tamarins, Saguinus oedipus, do not spontaneously use tools in the wild or in captivity. Yet, adults and naive infants with no experimental experience with tools show impressive sensitivity to their design features in tool choice experiments. Based on these findings, it has been hypothesized that tamarins are equipped with an innate mechanism for recognizing the functional features of tools (Hauser et al. 2002a, b, Animal Behaviour, 64, 299-311). An alternative explanation is that the initial exposure to one tool during training triggered their sensitivity to a suite of functionally relevant features during generalization. Here, we test this hypothesis, bypassing the training phase, and presenting tool-naive tamarins with a variety of tool choices, each pairing involving novel featural changes to the tool's design. We also tested experimentally naive common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, a closely related species that, like tamarins, do not spontaneously use tools either in the wild or in captivity. Following the first experimental session, there was no evidence that either species selected tools based on their design characteristics. This finding forces a rejection of the hypothesis that tamarins are equipped with an experience-independent, innate representation of tools. Exposure to several more sessions generally failed to alter the tamarins' discrimination, but caused marmosets to preferentially pick the functionally correct tools, attending to relevant featural dimensions (shape, material). Overall, these results suggest that nontool users may have an innate mechanism that operates over object mechanics more generally (i.e. as opposed to tools specifically), and this mechanism is triggered on the basis of a relatively impoverished input. 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal behaviour.

AB There is increasing evidence that mate recognition systems vary within species. We studied the courtship rituals of five Drosophila virilis strains to investigate this intraspecific variation. Males that actively and persistently courted the female without paying much attention to the female's behaviour were the most successful at copulating. Intraspecific variation in mating rituals was high, but not as high as at the species level and it was not high enough to cause sexual isolation between the strains. The differences in courtship interactions of the strains reflected their geographical origin. Males from one of the strains did not produce audible song during their courtship, but still mated with some females of all strains. The courtships of the 'mute' males proceeded in the same way as those of the normal males, and the male's wing vibration (even though silent and produced at a late stage) was still an important part of the courtship.

AB In many species, the genetic quality of gametes is likely to decline with age of the male. Some form of discrimination against mating with old males, or against fertilization by their sperm, can be expected to evolve. We investigated the effect of male age on the probability of mating and on sperm competitiveness in the bulb mite, Rhizoglyphus robini. There was no significant difference between male age classes in the probability of mating with virgin females, but young males were more likely to mate with already mated females. Furthermore, young males won sperm competition against older males. This implies that polyandry may be an effective way of avoiding fertilization by the sperm of older males. It has also been suggested that polyandry insures females against the infertility of old males. Our results do not support this hypothesis: matings with older males did not result in female infertility significantly more often than matings with young males.

ID BEHAVIOR; SPERM
AB We examined the adaptive significance of learning by determining whether classical conditioning increases reproductive success. Male and female quail received conditioning trials in which a small light (conditioned stimulus or CS) signalled access to a copulation partner. After this learning experience, pairs of subjects received a single 2-min (experiment 1) or 5-min (experiment 2) copulation test during which both the female and the male, only the female, only the male, or neither bird received the conditioned stimulus signalling access to a copulation partner. Signalling the copulatory episode for both the female and the male significantly increased the percentage of fertilized eggs that were produced and increased the efficiency of the copulatory behaviours that occurred. Presenting the CS to just one or the other sexual partner had no effect. These findings demonstrate that classical conditioning can enhance reproductive success, but the effect requires that both the male and the female be able to anticipate a sexual encounter.

AB The amplitude of signals has been shown to play an important role in regulating spacing in aggegations of acoustically signalling insects and amphibians. This conclusion is based primarily on experiments in which calls are played back to resident males, thereby mimicking the signals of arriving males. However, such experiments investigate only one side of the interaction between resident and arriving males. We examined the effect of the amplitude of resident calls on the spacing of arriving male barking treefrogs, Hyla gratiosa, by placing two speakers, one playing advertisement calls 6 dB more intense than the other, at the chorus site and beginning playback before males arrived at the chorus. Distances between the speaker and the nearest male were greater for the speaker broadcasting calls at the higher amplitude, but this effect occurred only in low-density choruses. These results, combined with theoretical considerations, raise the possibility that the immediate benefit to males of producing high-amplitude signals may differ at different chorus densities.

AB Gaze following is a basic social cognitive skill with many potential benefits for animals that live in social groups. At least five primate species are known to follow the gaze of conspecifics, but there have been no studies on gaze following in other mammals. We investigated whether domestic goats can use the gaze direction of a conspecific as a cue to find food. They were able to do this, at a level comparable to that off primates. In a second experiment, we tested goats' ability to use gaze and other communicative cues given by a human in a so-called object choice situation. An experimenter hid food out of sight of the subject under one of two cups. After baiting the cup the experimenter indicated the location of the food to the subject by using different cues. The goats used communicative cues (touching and pointing) but not gaze by itself. Since domestic dogs are very skilled in this task, whereas wolves are not, one hypothesis is that the use of communicative cues in the object choice task is a side-effect of domestication.

ID TOOL-USE; BIRDS; FOOD; PRIMATES; MONKEYS; BRAINS
AB Dunking behaviour, the dipping of food in water, has been anecdotally observed in more than 25 species of birds in the wild, but its function and ecology have not been systematically studied. In experiments conducted in the field and in captivity on Carib grackles, Quiscalus lugubris, in Barbados, we showed that: (1) dunking rate in the field was influenced by food type and that moistening dry food seems to be one of the major benefits of dunking; (2) most dunking observed in the field was performed by a minority of individuals, but the vast majority (86%) of grackles tested in captivity were capable of dunking; (3) a higher density of conspecifics at a water source was associated with a lower dunking rate and an increased risk of kleptoparasitism when dunking; and (4) there were consistent individual differences in dunking and stealing frequency. We conclude that dunking is part of the normal behavioural repertoire of Carib grackles in Barbados, and that the low frequency of the behaviour in the field did not result from the inability of some individuals to perform the technique, but more likely from the balance of costs and benefits affecting its expression.

AB Converging experimental and observational evidence suggests that some nonhuman primates are able to co-orient with shifts in visual attention, of both conspecifics and humans. However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms involved are unclear. To investigate attention following in Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana diana, we used photographs of familiar conspecifics orienting towards one of two locations. A subject monkey was shown a photograph, and shortly afterwards a toy appeared at one location or the other. The toy's position therefore either matched the location signalled by the head and body orientation of the photographed monkey (compatible), or was opposite to that location (incompatible). Overall, monkeys' first inspections, total duration of looking and number of looks were more likely to be directed to the compatible location, that is towards the direction of attention shown in the photograph. Furthermore, when a photograph of an adult monkey signalled attention to one location, but the toy appeared at the opposite (incompatible) location, subjects reinspected the monkey photographs more often than when the toy appeared at the compatible location, suggesting a violation of expectancy. This effect was not the case if the photograph was of an immature animal. Our results show that attention following was not limited to simple reflexive orienting by the monkeys, and that monkeys perceived a relationship existing between agent and object of attention.(C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID HEARING; PINNIPEDS; RELATIVES; WHALES; WATER
AB The difference in acoustic impedance between air and water makes it difficult to communicate efficiently with sound in both media. Sounds made in either air or water, for example, are almost completely reflected at the boundary. Several species, however, may use amphibious communication. Here I report that hippos make sounds both in air and underwater, and, with their heads in an amphibious position (eyes and nostrils above water but mouth and throat submerged), are able to transmit sounds to both media simultaneously. Hippos on the surface respond to both natural production and playback of the surface component of a simultaneous amphibious sound (SAS) by calling in the amphibious position (territorial alpha males usually call first). Hippos underwater consistently surface immediately following an SAS, or the playback of the underwater component of an SAS, and usually call in a chorus that can spread in air from one territory to the next for long distances. I also found that hippos in the amphibious position respond to playback of underwater hippo screams that are inaudible in air, and also to natural underwater calls, suggesting that they can hear in air and water simultaneously. I discuss behaviour associated with amphibious communication and probable mechanisms for producing and receiving these sounds. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis was formulated 12 years ago in an attempt to offer a proximate mechanism by which female choice of males could be explained by endocrine control of honest signalling. The hypothesis suggested that testosterone has a dual effect in males of controlling the development of sexual signals while causing immunosuppression. Our purpose in this review is to examine the empirical evidence to date that has attempted to test the hypothesis, and to conduct a meta-analysis on two of the assumptions of the hypothesis, that testosterone reduces immunocompetence and increases parasitism, to ascertain any statistical trend in the data. There is some evidence to suggest that testosterone is responsible for the magnitude of trait expression or development of sexual traits, but this is by no means conclusive. The results of many studies attempting to find evidence for the supposed immunosuppressive qualities of testosterone are difficult to interpret since they are observational rather than experimental. Of the experimental studies, the data obtained are ambiguous, and this is reflected in the result of the meta-analysis. Overall, the meta-analysis found a significant suppressive effect of testosterone on immunity, in support of the hypothesis, but this effect disappeared when we controlled for multiple studies on the same species. There was no effect of testosterone on direct measures of immunity, but it did increase ectoparasite abundance in several studies, in particular in reptiles. A funnel analysis indicated that the results were robust to a publication bias. Alternative substances that interact with testosterone, such as glucocorticoids, may be important. Ultimately, a greater understanding is required of the complex relationships that exist both within and between the endocrine and immune systems and their consequences for mate choice decision making.

AB Observations of field-caged guava trees, Psidium guajava, revealed that males of the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata, occasionally formed tight aggregations on the trunk and branches of certain trees. Males at these aggregation sites (stations) appeared to feed on the bark, and chemical analyses showed that stations contained high levels of the male attractant alpha-copaene whereas 'nonstations' on the same tree lacked this chemical. Previous work showed that male medflies exposed to pure alpha-copaene had a mating advantage over unexposed males. Here, we present data showing that the occurrence of stations is highly variable both within and between individual guava trees. Concurrent mating trials showed that male medflies exposed to entire guava trees containing stations or to individual stations for 3 h gained a mating advantage over unexposed males in tests conducted 1 or 3 days following exposure. In contrast, males exposed to entire trees lacking stations or only to nonstations on trees with stations had similar mating success as unexposed males. Additional experiments showed that exposure to guava leaves had no effect on male mating frequency but that exposure to fruits enhanced male mating success. The discussion considers potential mechanisms underlying the plant-induced increase in mating success and potential effects of alpha-copaene and other plant-borne compounds on the spacing of medfly leks in the environment.

AB Prey densities often show fluctuating patterns over various timescales. Focusing on short-term, within- generation fluctuating patterns of local prey availability, we suggest that prey that show synchronized and high-amplitude fluctuations in availability experience decreased risks of predation, but also enhance the maintenance of predator interference hierarchies by affecting the relative foraging success of unequal conspecific interferers. When predators interfere with each other, the forage less intensely on prey, which benefits prey in terms of decreased predation risk. The system hence involves a positive feedback. We thus argue that short-term temporal fluctuations in local prey availability could be an important mechanism behind how interference-structured social predator systems are developed and sustained. The temporal fluctuations also have implications for the phenotypic diversity of predators, and may be involved in speciation processes. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Endogenous circannual rhythms control the time course for moult, migratory fattening and autumn Migration in juveniles of several bird species that breed in the temperate zone. Exogenous factors, such as daylength, can also exert a measure of control: photoperiodic cues detected by birds that hatch late in the season induce accelerated juvenile development, assuring that late-hatched young migrate at the same time as early-hatched young. Whether these same mechanisms of control also apply to birds that migrate between breeding and nonbreeding areas entirely within the tropics at latitudes characterized by little seasonal variation in photoperiod is unknown. We conducted a common-garden experiment in Panama (9degreesN) in which we hand-reared wild-caught nestling yellow-green vireos, Vireo flavoviridis, under a constant photoperiod and monitored them for the expression of juvenile moult, migratory fattening and migratory activity. Even in the absence of a seasonal photoperiodic cue, juveniles moulted, accumulated fat reserves and initiated migratory activity, suggesting endogenous control of these processes. Age at the onset of moult, migratory fattening and migratory activity were each significantly negatively correlated with hatch date, however, so that the expression of these three processes was synchronized among juveniles with respect to the time of the season. We suggest that the slight differences in daylength perceived either by the nestlings themselves in the short time before they were collected (at 6-8 days of age) or by the adult females during egg production influenced rate of nestling development, thus allowing later-hatched young to moult, accumulate fat and migrate at a younger age than early-hatched young. Remarkably, photoperiod differed between the earliest and latest hatch dates in this study by only 33 min. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Insects feeding on plants may induce chemical and physical changes in the host plants. Here, we present evidence of host plant modification following an insect attack that may be associated with a reduction in intraspecific competition for food. We demonstrate that feeding by larvae of the cranberry fruitworm, Acrobasis vaccinii, induces a change in fruit colour (from green to red) of cranberry fruits, Vaccinium oxycoccos, that is associated with a significant increase in the concentration of anthocyanin. Host fruit colour affected larval foraging behaviour and food acceptance: significantly more cranberry fruitworm larvae were attracted to, and accepted, green rather than red fruits. Our experiments suggest that fruit reddening also prevents exploitation by conspecific larvae of other green fruits adjacent to the attacked fruit.

AB The behavioural. determinants of male mating success play a pivotal role in sexual selection, but remain poorly known for most kinds of organisms, including most reptiles. In Manitoba, Canada, large numbers of red-sided garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, court and mate in early spring near communal over-wintering dens. To understand how a mate's morphology and behaviour might influence his mating success, we videotaped 21 groups of snakes each comprising four males of varying body sizes plus a female. All males engaged in courtship, and mating occurred in all groups. Males with better body condition courted more vigorously and successfully than their smaller rivals did. The males that obtained matings were those that maintained their own cloaca closest to that of the female, aligned most of their body with the female, showed high rates of caudocephalic waving, chin pressing and tail searching, and did not allow other males to insert their body beside the female's. These behavioural differences between 'winners' and 'losers' were apparent from the beginning of each trial. Thus, male mating success in this 'scramble' system is determined not by chaotic, stochastic struggle (as has often been inferred) but instead is strongly linked to male courtship tactics. Energy stores (as evidenced by good body condition) may be critical determinants of mating success in these vigorous courtship episodes. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Experiments have shown that pigeons, Columba livia, are able to develop navigational abilities even if reared and kept confined in an aviary, provided that they are exposed to the natural winds. In contrast, pigeons reared in a wind-screened aviary do not learn to navigate. Pigeons kept confined in a screened aviary when young do not learn to navigate even if, once they become adult, the screens are removed and the birds are exposed to natural winds for a period sufficiently long for map learning. In all of these experiments, pigeons were kept confined until the day of test release. In the present study we found that pigeons reared in a wind-screened aviary developed navigational abilities if, once adult, they were allowed to perform spontaneous flights around the loft. Nevertheless, their navigational performance never reached the level of controls. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MATING SUCCESS; ADVANTAGES; DIPTERA; ESCAPE; COSTS; FLY
AB Male dance flies (Diptera: Empididae) are major predators of mating swarms of male nonbiting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae). Studies have indicated that chironomid midges are excellent fliers with extraordinarily high wing muscle power, acceleration and tortuosity for their size. We compared the relative flight performance and morphometrics of male empids Empis tesselatta Meigen and their prey, Chironomus plumosus L., in a series of laboratory and field studies. High-speed digital video camera footage revealed that there were no significant differences between predator and prey in terms of straight-line acceleration or maximum flight velocity, although the mean speed of empids was higher. In curved flight, measured as tortuosity, the smaller chironomids held a considerable advantage over their larger predators. Flight muscle ratio (e.g. flight muscle mass/body mass) of chironomids was also greater in chironomids than in empids. In field studies, small male chironomids suffered much lower levels of predation than large males. This result is consistent with the prediction of small midges being less likely to be captured because of superior aerobatics, although we are unable to exclude empirically that empids select large male midges. We discuss the possible mechanisms of prey capture by empids given the greater manoeuvrability of their prey, the coevolutionary dynamics of flight performance and the apparent selective advantage of small size in male chironomids.

AB Pheromone trails laid by foraging ants serve as a positive feedback mechanism for the sharing of information about food sources. This feedback is nonlinear, in that ants do not react in a proportionate manner to the amount of pheromone deposited. Instead, strong trails elicit disproportionately stronger responses than weak trails. Such nonlinearity has important implications for how a colony distributes its workforce, when confronted with a choice of food sources. We investigated how colonies of the Pharaoh's ant, Monomorium pharaonis, distribute their workforce when offered a choice of two food sources of differing energetic value. By developing a nonlinear differential equation model of trail foraging, and comparing model with experiments, we examined how the ants allocate their workforce between the two food sources. In this allocation, the most profitable feeder (i.e. the feeder with the highest concentration of sugar syrup) was usually exploited by the majority of ants. The particular form of the nonlinear feedback in trail foraging means that when we offered the ants a choice between two feeders of equal profitability, foraging was biased to the feeder with the highest initial number of visitors. Taken together, our experiments illuminate how pheromones provide a mechanism whereby ants can efficiently allocate their workforce among the available food sources without centralized control.

AB Interest in relationships between behaviour and development has been spurred by research on related topics, including phenotypic plasticity, parental effects, extragenetic inheritance, individual differences and trait syndromes. Here, I consider several emerging areas of research in the interface between behaviour and development, with a focus on behavioural processes that are likely to affect the development and maintenance of interindividual variation in a wide array of morphological, physiological and behavioural traits. Using a norm of reaction approach, I introduce and illustrate the complexities of phenotypic development. Next, I consider the implications of environmental selection and niche construction for phenotypic development, and consider why these behavioural processes are likely to encourage the development and maintenance of repeatable, stable individual differences and trait syndromes. Parental effects involving behaviour also affect the development of a wide array of phenotypic traits; differential allocation is a currently underappreciated type of parental effect, by which males can affect the development of their offspring via nongenetic means, even if those males have no contact with their young. Behavioural parental effects also contribute to extragenetic inheritance, and recent studies suggest that this phenomenon may be more widespread than previously suspected. The effects of behavioural processes on phenotypic development have interesting implications for problems in related disciplines (e.g. ecology, evolution and conservation biology), providing additional impetus for future research on the effects of behavioural mechanisms on the development of behavioural and other traits.

AB Failure to recognize conspecifics in social interactions such as mate choice and aggressive encounters will often result in reduced fitness. Studies on mate choice show that the ability to recognize conspecifics as mates is not universally present at birth, but often needs to be learned. In contrast, little is known about the ontogeny of intrasexual species recognition. To test whether learning influences the recognition of sexual rivals, we compared the aggressive response towards intruders of interspecifically cross-fostered individuals and controls reared by conspecific parents. We simulated territorial intrusion by presenting either a caged individual or playback song near the nest of breeding pairs of great tits, Parus major, and blue tits, P. caeruleus. Great tits reared by blue tit parents responded much more to blue tit stimuli than did great tit controls, and furthermore showed stronger responses to blue tit stimuli than to those of their own species. Blue tits reared by great tits responded much more to great tit stimuli than did blue tit controls. In contrast, blue tits cross-fostered to coal tits, P. ater, did not respond more to coal tits than did blue tit controls. There was a species difference in the response to conspecifics: blue tits cross-fostered to great tits responded more to conspecifics than did cross-fostered great tits. The results were similar for males and females. We conclude that learning influences intrasexual species recognition in these tits.

AB In many species where social hierarchy mediates conflict over resources, dominant individuals monopolize food, shelter and reproductive opportunities. The benefits of social dominance, however, can often be offset by a prior residence advantage, whereby individuals arriving first in a new habitat obtain, and subsequently defend, the most profitable sites. We investigated the relative influence of these two factors on the acquisition of feeding territories by juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., by placing groups of six individuals of known dominance rank sequentially into an experimental arena with feeding sites of varying quality. Dominants had an advantage over subordinates in the percentage of time spent in a good-quality feeding site and individual feeding rate. There was also a significant time of arrival effect: those individuals that arrived first in a habitat monopolized the resource. The two effects were of approximately equal strength, so that late-arriving dominant fish had similar success as prior resident subordinates. These results indicate that both dominance and prior residence are important in the feeding behaviour of juvenile Atlantic salmon, and that the two factors can have independent and additive effects.

AB Neighbouring territorial songbirds often interact through countersinging, where birds sing in response to the singing of neighbours such that their song bouts are temporally related. Complex forms of countersinging such as song type matching or song overlapping appear to be correlated with aggressiveness and readiness to escalate confrontations. Less attention has been paid to the importance of simpler forms of countersinging, where matched song types are not used and where individual songs do not temporally overlap. I examined countersinging behaviour in male Carolina wrens, Thryothorus ludovicianus, which countersing regularly. Why they countersing and how countersinging is perceived by neighbours is unknown. By comparing singing behaviour before and after simulated intrusions, I determined that subjects countersing with their neighbours more readily when highly aroused. Comparing responses to countersinging and noncountersinging playbacks showed that countersinging elicited more aggressive responses than did noncountersinging. Carolina wrens appear to exchange aggressive signals regularly through countersinging. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To investigate factors promoting monogamy, we studied the reproductive behaviour and ecology of the monogamous Caribbean cleaner goby at two sites near St Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. We assessed mate fidelity and the amount of time required to acquire a new mate in experimentally widowed males and females. We also measured behavioural responses of pair members and single females to experimentally introduced conspecific intruders of both sexes. Finally, we evaluated the distribution of suitable habitat relative to existing goby territories. We found that pairs often separated due to males abandoning females and moving to a new territory, that most widowed fish soon acquired a new mate, and that there was strong aggression towards large same-sex intruders. We also found an abundance of suitable, unoccupied habitat. We conclude that pairs are maintained by intrasexual aggression that is related to both mate availability and other resources, such as high-quality, food-rich cleaning stations. Combined with observations of frequent pair separation, interterritory male movement, and relatively rapid remating by both sexes, these results suggest a complex mating system that is best classified as serial monogamy.

AB We examined predictions on the proportion of dispersing natal males and females, dispersal distances, the age at dispersal and the potential for inbreeding over a 6-year period in a free-living population of grey mouse lemurs. We used monthly mark-recapture procedures to determine individual locations and interindividual distances. The analysis of seven polymorphic microsatellite markers for 213 (130 males, 83 females) individuals allowed us to estimate relatedness coefficients and kinship relationships. Closely related males ranged further from each other than closely related females and natal males were found further from their potential mothers than were females. Natal males were more likely to disperse from their birth sites than females, although male dispersal was not universal. Male breeding dispersal was detected in half of the long-term observations. Males therefore seem to be the predominant vectors for gene flow between populations and social units. Females usually stayed within one to two home range diameters of their potential mother, facilitating the evolution of cooperative behaviour by kin selection among females. Most dispersal took place before the mating season, indicating an age of less than 7 months for natal dispersal. The analysis of spatiotemporal coexistence revealed the potential for inbreeding in only 3.8% of the potential mother-son dyads, but in 21.9% of the potential father-daughter dyads and in 41.7% of other closely related male-female dyads.

AB Early work on loud calling in mammals emphasized the importance of dynamic characteristics such as calling rate as cues to fitness and fighting ability. In contrast, little is known of the potential for fine-scaled acoustic cues to provide receivers with direct information on fitness. Fundamental frequency has typically been considered a good potential indicator of body size in the literature, but resonance frequencies (formants), which should be constrained by the length of the vocal tract, have received less attention. We conducted a detailed acoustic analysis on an extensive database of roars from red deer stags, Cervus elaphus, in a free-ranging population to investigate which variables provided honest information on age, body weight and reproductive success. Although fundamental frequency was higher in young stags than in adults, it did not decrease with body weight within adults and source cues (i.e. those generated by the larynx) in general did not provide clear information on fitness-related characteristics. In contrast, minimum formant frequencies, reached during the part of the roar when the mobile larynx is most fully retracted towards the sternum, decreased with body weight and age and were strongly negatively correlated with our index of reproductive success. Such production-related acoustic cues to body size and fitness, rendered honest by an anatomical constraint limiting the downward movement of the larynx, provide receivers with accurate information that could be used to assess rivals and choose mates.

AB Mammals use chemical signals for individual and kin recognition, to establish social hierarchies, mark territories and choose mates. The nocturnal and social lifestyle of bats suggests that, besides acoustic signals, they also use scent to communicate. We investigated in the communally breeding Bechstein's bat, Myotis bechsteinii, whether secretions of the facial interaural gland contain information that can-be used for individual and colony recognition. Since female Bechstein's bats live in closed societies and show cooperative behaviour, we predicted they would recognize colony members. We analysed interaural gland secretions, which we repeatedly sampled from 85 females belonging to four free-ranging colonies. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry profiles were individually specific and differed between colonies. Comparing odour profiles between colonies we found a relation between chemical similarity and the mitochondrial haplotype of colony members. Within colonies there was no correlation between mass spectrometer profile similarity and genetic relatedness. Our results suggest that female Bechstein's bats may use interaural gland secretions for individual and colony recognition but not to infer kinship directly.

AB We tested the decision-making abilities of emigrating ant colonies. The colonies had to choose a new nest site when presented with two or more potential nest sites, each with different attributes or different combinations of attributes. For Leptothorax albipennis colonies in the laboratory, darkness of the nest cavity, internal height of the cavity and width of the entrance were all important attributes. The colonies ranked these attributes: darkness of the nest site was more important than internal cavity height, which in turn was more important than entrance width. These choices conform to the logic of transitivity. In addition, the colonies used a sophisticated decision-making strategy in which they took all alternatives and all attributes into consideration. Furthermore, the ants, in effect, weighed the different values of different attributes. They also chose the best nest when presented with only one excellent nest among four mediocre ones or one excellent nest in an array of one excellent, one good and one mediocre. Altogether, our results suggest that these ant colonies, in deciding upon a new home, used a weighted additive strategy, one of the most computationally expensive and thorough decision-making strategies.

AB Tadpoles of the microhylid frog Phrynomantis microps form swarms near the water surface of savannah ponds during the day. Observations of tadpole distribution at night showed that these aggregations disappear and that tadpoles instead swim in a random distribution near the water surface. The clarity of pond water had significant effects on the distribution of tadpoles during the day. The size of aggregations, and the densities of tadpoles within them, both increased with increasing water clarity. Since tadpoles of this species are known to aggregate in response to visually hunting aquatic predators, these results suggest that tadpoles respond to high water clarity as an indicator of increased predation risk. This supports the hypothesis that, under conditions of increasing predation risk, animals should form larger and more dense groups up to a critical group size.

AB We analysed the temporal and sexual patterns of intra- and interspecific aggression in sympatric harriers during the breeding season, to determine the main resource defended (food, nest sites, mates) and how factors such as body size or breeding system (territorial versus colonial) influence aggressive behaviour. We predicted that if aggression is (at least partly) related to competition for food, the hen harrier, Circus cyaneus, because of its large size and territorial system, should be more aggressive (both intra- and interspecifically) than the smaller, colonial Montagu's harrier, Circus pygargus. The intraspecific aggression rate of both harriers peaked early in the season, was mainly intrasexual and increased with the number of neighbours. These patterns support the mate competition hypothesis to explain intraspeciflc aggression in both species. Montagu's harriers were more aggressive towards conspecifics than hen harriers. Their aggression rates towards heterospecifics were high at the start of the season then decreased, supporting the hypothesis that interspecific aggression serves primarily for nest site defence. Hen harriers showed lower interspecific aggression rates in the prelaying period and a gradual increase throughout the breeding cycle, particularly by females, who hunt around the nest for food for the nestlings. These patterns correspond to food competition, as food resources around the nest are probably more important and interspecific intrusion more costly for territorial hen harriers than for colonial Montagu's harriers.

AB The sensitivity of play to variations in food availability has been cited as evidence of the costliness of play, since energetically stressed animals dispense with costly behaviours, However, the causality of the, relationship between nutrition and play has not been adequately tested., Using weight gain as a measure, of food intake, we documented the food consumption of free-ranging meerkat, Suricata suricatta, pups and found that long-term nutritional status (weight gain over a 6-week period) was positively correlated with rates of play. We confirmed the causality of this relationship by conducting long-term (4-8 weeks) provisioning experiments, that raised the nutritional status of experimental pups, subadults and adults., Experimental animals more than doubled their rate of play compared with their nonprovisioned controls. Short-term variations in food consumption (daily weight gain) were not correlated with subsequent rates of play, and we used a short-term feeding experiment to document the transitory effects of hunger satiation. We established that an increase in available energy contributed to the increase in rates of play, rather than the animals simply having more time available to play as a result of being released from the constraints of foraging. We conclude that play in meerkats was energetically costly, and must be adaptive given that the cost of play to juveniles (in terms of future reproductive success) was potentially high.

AB It has been argued that social learning helps animals either avoid noxious substances or identify food items, but evidence suggests that avian social learning is fundamentally different from that of mammals. In two experiments, we investigated whether the preferences of domestic hens, Gallus g. domesticus, for novel food were influenced by observing the feeding behaviour of conspecifics. In experiment 1, we attempted to confirm that birds can develop socially learnt aversions to unpalatable foods. Despite demonstrators showing a highly visible 'disgust reaction' after eating unpalatable coloured food, observers did not develop aversions to similarly coloured food. In experiment 2, we aimed to determine whether preferences for palatable food were socially learnt, and whether the extent of a demonstrator's preference for novel food affected the magnitude of the observer's socially learned preference. Demonstrators ate coloured food of standard or high palatability, or did not peck food at all. When the demonstrators pecked more frequently or fed more quickly from the food, the observers consumed a greater proportion of food of the same colour; however, this was only when the food was red, not green. We argue this indicates an unlearned aversion to red food, overcome by social learning of the food being highly palatable. The results provide no evidence that adult hens learn aversions through observing disgust reactions, but show that hens are sensitive to the extent of demonstrator preferences for palatable food. The data do not support the hypothesis that avian social learning is fundamentally different from that of mammals. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male greater sac-winged bats, Saccopteryx bilineata, use hovering flights to court females in their harem territory. While hovering, males fan a fragrant perfume from sac-like organs in the wing membrane towards the females. Each afternoon, males renew the perfumes of their wing sacs during a stereotypical and time-consuming behavioural sequence, which includes blending secretions from genital and gular glands. I investigated whether male perfume-blending behaviour varies between the mating and the nonmating season, and whether successful males, those with large harems, have different patterns of perfume blending than less successful males. I measured variation in perfume-blending behaviour in 21 adult males. The pattern of perfume blending was not significantly different between the mating and the nonmating season. However, the time at which perfume blending began and terminated differed between seasons. During the mating season, males spent about the same time cleaning their wing sacs during phase I of perfume blending, irrespective of the number of females in their harem. During phase II, males with large harems spent significantly less time refilling and blending perfume than males with small harems. In addition, males with large harems took up fewer droplets of secretion from the genital region. Overall, male-male interactions were rare during perfume blending, and the decrease in duration in phase II was not attributable to more disturbance in large harems. There was also no evidence that males prevented each other from transferring secretions into their wing sacs. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Hornbills display a unique breeding habit in which the female seals herself into the nest cavity prior to egg laying and remains ensconced for most of the breeding cycle. This habit necessitates long-term sperm storage, which considerably lengthens the fertile period of the female. This in turn increases the amount of time available to females to engage in extrapair copulations. Because food delivered by the male is the primary source of energy for female maintenance, egg production, incubation, female moult and offspring provisioning, male parental investment (and thus cuckoldry) in these hornbills is extremely expensive. This combination of costly male parental care and female dependence potentially places hornbills at a critical endpoint in the spectrum of genetic promiscuity operating within pairs of socially monogamous birds. A paradigm of reproductive conflict suggests that these factors might allow males to coerce females into a state of genetic monogamy. Sperm storage, however, might allow female hornbills to thwart monopolization attempts by their mates. We used minisatellite multilocus DNA fingerprinting to analyse paternity in a Namibian population of Monteiro's hornbill, Tockus monteiri. Despite the ability of female hornbills to store sperm for long periods, we found no evidence of extrapair paternity (EPP). Although we cannot explicitly rule out a role for coercion in the evolution of the genetic monogamy we observed, the benefits of EPP appear to be devalued to the point that the reproductive interests of males and females overlap considerably.

AB The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey responses to predation risk should depend on the temporal pattern of risk. In systems where activity is dangerous, predicted activity levels should be ranked as follows: activity during a pulse of safety>activity during continual safety>activity during continual risk>activity during a pulse of risk. We conducted the first experimental test of the basic predictions of the risk allocation hypothesis by examining responses of freshwater physid snails, Physa gyrina, to chemical cues associated with predation on snails by predatory crayfish, Orconectes juvenilis. As predicted, the snails' pattern of activity, microhabitat use and response to risk depended on the temporal pattern of risk. Snails held in continual risk had very low activity levels, but showed an immediate, large increase in activity during a brief period of safety. In contrast, snails held in continual safety showed moderate levels of activity, but surprisingly, only a weak reduction in activity when exposed to a pulse of danger. Further studies are needed to identify general patterns for how temporal variation in risk influences antipredator behaviour. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

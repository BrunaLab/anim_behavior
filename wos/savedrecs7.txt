SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Arrhenotokous parthenogenesis was confirmed in Trichogramma dendrolimi and T. papilionis. Subsequently the possible links between mating systems and biological traits of males, and sex ratios, were investigated in these two species, using Papilio xuthus eggs for their hosts. T. dendrolimi males attained 100% insemination of females in the parasitized host before egress from it. The high insemination rate was guaranteed by male precedence in emergence, lack of courtship in mating behaviour and short copulation time, combined with a long stay of emerging wasps within the host. The males were often the last to leave a host and made no mating attempts outside the host. Most but not all T. papilionis females were also inseminated in the host. The lower insemination rate of this species resulted from almost simultaneous emergence of both sexes, which prevented males from mating with inactive females. Another mating site of T. papilionis was just outside the host, which males left prior to most females. A reduced possibility of outbreeding was inferred in T. dendrolimi on the grounds that males were short-lived, frequently failed to expand their wings and died in the host. The reduced outbreeding was reflected in considerably lower sex ratios in T. dendrolimi.

TI BEHAVIOR OF COLONIAL AND SOLITARY SPIDERS OF THE THERIDIID SPECIES
   ANELOSIMUS-EXIMIUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Most A. eximius live in colonies, but a few females emigrate short distances and establish small, individual webs. Field studies were conducted on 1 colony and nearby smaller webs in order to describe communal activities and division of labor and to note costs and benefits of remaining in the parental colony and emigrating. Adult and juvenile females repaired the web and captured prey. Adult females, rather than juveniles, cared for egg sacs and fed young. When colonial egg sacs were abundant, females moved from sac to sac. Several colonial females regurgitated food to spiderlings which had recently emerged from a particular sac. In smaller webs inhabited by 2 or 3 females, the mother cared for the sac but all females fed the young by regurgitation. Males rarely participated in communal activities. Advantages of colony living include protection from predators, the availability of large prey and in the event of a female''s death, the care of her egg sac and feeding of her young. Cannibalism of the egg sac is a potential cost of coloniality, affecting .apprx. 10-20% of colonial sacs. Cannibalism was not observed in the smaller webs. The costs of emigrating are very high: most of the solitary females disappeared, leading to interspecific predation on their eggs and young.

TI AN INVESTIGATION OF INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION BY VOICE IN FEMALE RED-WINGED
   BLACKBIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to determine if female red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) recognize each other as individuals on the basis of voice alone, playback experiments with 31 resident female redwings were performed. Female redwings sing 2 distinct song types. Females (15) were exposed to Type 1 neighbor and Type 1 non-neighbor songs, and 16 females were exposed to Type 2 neighbor and Type 2 non-neighbor songs. Based on matched-pairs comparisons of the females'' behavioral responses to the playback songs, female redwings do not appear to distinguish each other individually by voice. Loudspeaker placement may be 1 confounding variable of significant importance in auditory individual recognition experiments.

   AN INTERMEDIATE HOST, THE 3-SPINED STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sticklebacks parasitized by S. solidus larvae recover more quickly from a frightening overhead stimulus than non-parasitized individuals. Parasitized fish often feed subsequent to the stimulus, non-parasitized fish do not. Recovery time from the stimulus is significantly negatively correlated with parasitic load, indicating a progressive curtailment of the fright reaction. Modification of the anti-predator behavior of the intermediate host may depend on the metabolic demands of the parasite  and potentially may be of adaptive value for the parasite.

TI CHANGES IN THE FORAGING PATTERN OF PLOVERS IN RELATION TO
   ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of environmental conditions on the foraging behavior of ringed and grey plovers (Charadrius hiaticula and Pluvialis squatarola) were investigated at Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve, Northumberland [Great Britain, UK]. Plovers forage by an apparently visual searching technique, scanning an area while standing still, before running to peck at prey. Plovers appeared to select large prey, in suitable conditions, by not responding to cues of small prey at the start of each waiting period. Within a waiting period, they became progressively more ready to take smaller prey, before eventually giving up and moving to a new waiting site. Giving-up time was adjusted to different conditions, resulting in the section of larger prey when prey availability was high, notably at high temperatures. The birds tended to concentrate their activity on clumps of high density of available prey, by moving less far after taking large prey than after taking small or no prey. When no prey was taken after a wait, the bird moved on sufficiently far to scan a new area, or further in areas of low-density, highly clumped prey. In addition to feeding by day, plovers also forage at night. Night observations of foraging behavior and performance are presented and discussed in relation to visual foraging and the increased activity of some intertidal invertebrates at night. Although plovers apparently use visual searching, for which the prey detection ranges are probably shorter at night, they were able to maintain fairly high pecking rates at night, partly because of higher surface activity levels of prey.

TI BUSH DOG URINE-MARKING - ITS ROLE IN PAIR FORMATION AND MAINTENANCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The urine-marking behavior of captive, paired male and female bush dogs, S. venaticus, was investigated during pair formation and maintenance. Urine-marking frequencies decreased as pair members became familiar, but urine-marking remained an important aspect of the bush dog''s precopulatory display. Paired females exhibited a handstand posture, as well as several other urine-marking behaviors less often or never shown by males. The onset of urine-marking occurred later in female vs. male  juveniles living in the family group. Bush dogs can discriminate between male and female urine and that female handstanding may serve as a visual signal in sexual recognition. Sexual differences in urine-marking behaviors are interpreted in relation to intrasexual competition for the high level of parental care exhibited by males in this monogamous species.

TI MALE SUCCESS, COURTSHIP COMPLEXITY AND PATTERNS OF SEXUAL SELECTION IN 3
   CONGENERIC SPECIES OF SEXUALLY MONOCHROMATIC AND DICHROMATIC
   DAMSELFISHES (PISCES, POMACENTRIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Social behavior, ecology and distribution and correlates of male mating success are compared for 3 spp. in the damselfish genus Glyphidodontops: G. rollandi, which is premanently sexually monochromatic; G. biocellatus, which is normally monochromatic, but which exhibits male-specific colors during courtship and spawning (= temporary dichromatism); and G. cyaneus, which is permanently sexually dichromatic and also develops male-specific courtship colors. Variance of male success (assessed by the number of clutches of eggs obtained by each male) doest not differ significantly between the monochromatic and temporarily dichromatic species, but is significantly higher in the permanently dichromatic one. Courtship complexity, in contrast, is lowest in the permanently dichromatic species, highest in the permanently monochromatic one and intermediate in the temporarily dichromatic species. Data from the literature on 2 additional temporarily dichromatic species are consistent with these trends. Overall, there is also no association between the occurrence of sexual dichromatism and that of sexual size dimorphism, suggesting that each results from a different set of selective factors. Permanent sexual dichromatism in G. cyaneus coincides with strong intrasexual selection. Sexual selection in other damselfish species is principally epigamic and based on the vigor of male courtship. Temporary sexual dichromatism appears to be primarily a courtship display, 1 of several channels by means of which the male conveys information to the female regarding its sexual readiness.

Three barrier problems (short-, long- and U-barrier) were administered to four 6-wk-old Eastern wolf (c. l. lycaon) pups. Post hoc comparisons with results obtained by Scott et Fuller confirm the hypothesis.

DT Article
AB Agonistic interactions were recorded in a captive group of wolves (C. lupus) for a period of 21 mo. Of all the interactions, 75% were accounted for by 4 or fewer of a possible 28 pairs during any given period of the study. Several animals were involved in very few agonistic interactions; in many relationships such interactions were absent. Patterns of agonistic interaction alone did not suggest social relationships or an overall social structure applicable to all group members, although some evidence of a dominance hierarchy was found. Patterns of agonistic interactions were shown to involve several independent dimensions in different relationships. Further details of an underlying social organization are likely to emerge only from long-term studies which examine several dimensions of, and the interrelations between, a wide range of social interactions.

AB The behavioral thresholds of the 2 principal components of the mandibular gland secretion in major workers of the weaver ant O. longinoda, hexanal and 1-hexanol, were 1.99 .times. 1010 and 3.35 .times. 1011 molecules cm-3, respectively. The mandibular gland contains an average of 2.896 .times. 1015 molecules of hexanal and 1.274 .times. 1016 molecules of 1-hexanol. From these measurements, molecular diffusion theory predicts behavioral active spaces for 1-hexanol (an attractant) which agree with those observed in response to the whole secretion, but there is no such agreement for hexanal (a releaser of behavior with no directional component). The effect of microturbulence on the transmission of releaser and chemotactic stimuli is discussed.

Voles which were background-fed with lab diet during the experiment showed a long lasting increase in preference for the recently available experimental diet, while voles which were not background-fed showed a short term (2 day) decrease in preference for the recently available experimental diet. Nutritional cues are important in determining which way the preference changes. Learning is involved in associating peripheral cues such as color or taste with the nutritional effects.

AB Quantitative data on the ways in which adult yellow baboons (P. cynocephalus) distribute their time among various activities are presented. Baboons spend .apprx. 3/4 of their time feeding or moving. Interseasonal variability in the proportions of time spent feeding and socializing is statistically significant, as are individual differences in the proportions of time spent feeding and moving. Although males and females spend approximately equal proportions of time in each of the activity states, the distributions of the duration of activity bouts show significant intersexual differences in central tendency and dispersion that are consistent with a model of intersexual differences in overall foraging strategies. Consistent diurnal patterns are absent, and the relationship between this finding and other ecological variables is discussed.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Virgin female rats were mated at a freely cycling estrus, and then again with the same males at the subsequent postpartum estrus. Copulatory behavior at each mating was compared and the temporal patterning of the female''s mating and maternal behavior was analyzed. Postpartum females conserved the number of ejaculatory series received, yet the series were shorter, resulting in a shorter time being occupied by this mating. During mating, females spent little time with their litters, and then mainly in the post-ejaculatory intervals. Ejaculatory series were rarely disrupted by nesting. The postpartum female rat may engage in behavioral time-sharing.

   LEMMUS-TRIMUCRONATUS .2. SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of the maternal environment in the development of sexual behavior was investigated by reciprocally cross-fostering 2 spp. of lemmings (D. groenlandicus and L. trimucronatus). Non-fostered and within-species-fostered animals served as controls. When adult, cross-fostered (CF) animals engaged in more contact social and sexual behaviors with the foster species than did controls. Lemmings reared by conspecific dams directed sexual behavior exclusively toward conspecifics. Since CF animals also mated with conspecifics, cross-fostering may have resulted in a broadening of species identity to include the foster species. Neonatal learning of the species characteristics of the mother is apparently important in the ontogeny of premating sexual isolation of these species.

TI EXOCRINE GLAND INVOLVEMENT IN TRAILING BEHAVIOR IN THE ARGENTINE ANT
   (FORMICIDAE, DOLICHODERINAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experimental trails, run off natural field trails of I. humilis, were used to demonstrate the range of exocrine glands involved in trailing behavior. Complex trailing reactions were recorded by high-speed movie photography, and their interactions were assessed by multivariate analysis. Pavans gland is confirmed as the source of major trailing pheromone(s) deposited on the substrate, which act as strong, persistent attractants and activators. The mandibular glands produce volatile, transient behavioral signals in air; the anals produce anti-trailants; and the pharyngeals and venoms may be implicated as the producers of trailing synergists. The findings for I. humilis are considered in relation to the evolution of trailing behavior through the Formicidae.

TI THE EFFECTS OF GROUP-SIZE ON PREDATOR AVOIDANCE IN A MARINE INSECT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ocean skater, Halobates robustus (Hemiptera: Gerridae), is a flightless insect, which forms loosely aggregated flotillas of various sizes close to lava and mangrove edges in the Galapagos [Ecuador]. A clear effect of group size on the distance at which an approaching predator model induced avoidance behavior (rapid withdrawal and/or dispersal) was shown. In large, highly aggregated groups, the insects are maximally aroused as a result of frequent bodily encounters with adjacent members of the flotilla. An approaching object induces avoidance behavior with minimal visual stimulation at maximal distance. With small groups and single individuals, which are less aroused, a closer approach of the object is required to produce visual stimulation sufficient to activate the escape response.

TI INTERACTION OF HUNGER AND SEXUAL MOTIVATION IN THE MALE-RAT -
   TIME-SHARING APPROACH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To examine the interaction of hunger and sexual motivation, male rats were given sexual behavior tests under 0, 24 and 48 h of food deprivation. Each male was placed with with an estrous-induced [with estradiol benzoate and progesterone] female and allowed to copulate until sexual exhaustion. Food was freely available throughout the test period. Mount and intromission latencies increased under both levels of food deprivation, but neither ejaculation frequency nor any of the other 14 measures of sexual behavior were altered under deprivation conditions. There was a decreased latency to start eating, an increase in time spent eating, and an increase in the amount of food eaten with increased food deprivation. The frequency of feeding bouts increased, but the duration of feeding bouts was constant over deprivation conditions. Under food deprivation, animals shifted from sexual behavior to feeding more frequencly than when they were non-deprived. These shifts occurred primarily during periods of low sexual arousal. The majority of feeding occurred during the post-ejaculatory intervals. Bouts of sexual behavior were not usually interrupted by bouts of feeding. Feeding and sexual activity probably occur on a time-sharing basis with sexual behavior as the dominant activity.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Vocalizations and social organization of a semi-flightless passerine (Philesturnus carunculatus) were studied in a color-banded population on a densely forested island. Pair bonds and territories were permanent. Males sang from 1-4 highly diverse loud songs. Each song pattern was sung by group of up to 20 birds occupying contiguous territories. Temporal and spatial continuity of song groups by cultural transmission to new recruits was observed. Song groups overlapped where they met. Development of new song groups arising from errors in song learning, described as cultural mutations, were studied. Father/son song relationships and dispersal of sons of known parentage are discussed in relation to the proposed function of song groups in promoting gene flow in an otherwise extraordinarily static population.

AB Postural stance as an intention movement to leave a dyadic social situation was studied in several hundred human adults. Equal weight vs. unequal weight stance (one leg bearing more weight than the other), stance weight shifts and stance shifts toward and away from the other member of the dyad (social-distance changes) were systematically recorded. Sex and whether the members of the pairs left together or separately were noted. Unequal weight stances and stance weight shifts are intention movements indicating imminent departure. Also, shifts toward or away from the other member of the dyad just prior to departure correlated with sex and whether the members of the pair left separately or together. The intention movements in other species, particularly avian flight and primate troop movement, were discussed.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of visual social stimulation upon age at 1st spawning of S. (Tilapia) mossambicus was studied by rearing newly-released young in 1 of 2 conditions: isolated, or in visual contact with a conspecific of the same age in an adjacent aquarium. Isolation delayed 1st spawning by about 10 days for isolated females as compared to socially stimulated females. The rate of color development was the same for all males suggesting that testicular maturation was not greatly affected by visual social stimulation. Growth of social females lagged behind that of isolates. Some mechanisms and biological effects are discussed.

TI ONE-ZERO AND SCAN METHODS FOR SAMPLING BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB Scan and one-zero sampling are common quick methods for scoring activities on check-sheets. Real data are used to test the performances of these methods. There are conditions where one-zero sampling reflects the proportion of time spent in an activity, and methods for discovering such conditions are shown. These methods require information about the behavior which is not avilable from one-zero samples. Certain temporal patterns in the sampled activity may prevent one-zero counts of it from consistently reflecting the proportion of time spent in that activity. Such temporal organization can be of biological interest, but it poses problems for techniques of measurement and description.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two lone silverback mountain gorillas (G. g. beringei) were followed during a 13 wk study period in an attempt to describe the size and differential use of their respective home ranges. The ranging behavior was compared to that of groups and possible causes of daily movement were examined. The daily activity of 1 individual is described. Considerable differences between silverbacks were found not only in the time spent within areas of their ranges but in the ways they ranged over their core areas. The subject that had left his parent group earlier covered his core area more vigorously, by means of circuitous routing. Lone silverback ranges overlapped their parent group ranges considerably and the group frequently entered the silverback''s core area. Lone males did not move further nor more rapidly than groups. Feeding, social interactions and location of nest sites were examined to reveal the possible causes of daily ranging behavior and it was tentatively concluded that availability of food supply regulated the silverback''s movements.

TI EFFECTS OF ALBINO GENE UPON BEHAVIOUR OF MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Albino mice (cc) otherwise congenic with strain C57BL/6J (C-) escaped more slowly from water, were less active in an open field and made more errors on a black-white discrimination in a water maze. Significant differences were not found in activity in a revolving cage, nor in several measures of reproduction and survival under laboratory conditions. Albinos appeared to be more severely stressed by the test procedures. The use of mutants in behavioral research generally is considered. Mutant genes in the mouse frequently impair effectiveness of behavior as well as producing morphological and physiological variations. Although behavioral effects may be important in evolution through modifying fitness, it is impossible to deal with them quantitatively because they are inextricable from other components of gene action. The major value of the mutant gene to behavioral research is as a treatment producing a discrete physiological effect which is difficult or impossible to achieve by other means.

TI BEHAVIOUR MODIFICATION IN INFANT RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Infant rats received 3 days of shock avoidance training in a straight runway beginning either at 10 or 13 days of age. Litter mate controls received the same number of trials in which only the conditioned stimulus was presented. The number of avoidance responses was significantly affected by days of training, age, and treatment. The data are interpreted as evidence either of associative learning or stimulus sensitization. In either case, the infant rat becomes more rather than less responsive as stressful stimulation is repeated, contrary to current theoretical formulations.

TI FURTHER STUDIES OF MIDDLENESS CONCEPT WITH CHIMPANZEE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a previous experiment a chimpanzee was trained to select the middle of 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17 objects when the objects were 1.25 in. diameter pipe plugs and were placed adjacent to one another on a WGTA [Wisconsin General Test Apparatus]. In the present study, retention for the previous task was tested and then the subject was trained to select the middle object of 5, 7, 9 and 11 stimulus objects when they were asymmetrically arranged and were separated by from 1 to 6 stimulus positions. The results showed a 50% saving score in retention and that with an increase in the distance between the groups of stimulus objects, there was a corresponding increase in the difficulty to discriminate the middle objects. As the stimulus difference increased (a 9-object problem with a 4-5 arrangement would have a stimulus difference of 1 and with an 8-1 arrangement would have a stimulus difference of 7) the discrimination became easier.

AB The genera studied were Microtus, Peromyscus, Onychomys, and 3 strains of Mus. The 1st 20 days of life of the pups were investigated daily in regard to maternal defense, weight gain, the appearance of fur and teeth, the ability to walk, right themselves, and cling to a balancing wheel apparatus; finally, the maternal interest of the mother was evaluated. These results were discussed with particular attention to the ethology and emerging behavioral profiles of the adults. The importance of slow development and longer periods of interaction within the nest for predators such as Onychomys and commensals of man such as Mus was noted. These parameters were related to neurochemical and physiological findings as already described from this laboratory.

TI AN ASSESSMENT OF REVERSAL INDEX
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The results of recent experiments on reversal learning by cats and rhesus monkeys were reviewed to test the value of the ''reversal index'' of Rjalakshmi and Jeeves (1965) as a measure of comparative learning capacity. Values of the reversal index did not vary systematically among groups differing in age, species, previous testing experience, task difficulty, infantile stimulation or environmental enrichment. Values of the reversal index for the same animals tested in 2 different apparatuses were uncor-related. Several independent analyses indicated that the value of the reversal index for an individual or for a group is significantly related to the number of errors made in initial discrimination learning; this artifact implies that the reversal index has little or no merit for the comparative study of learning.

TI GENETIC ASPECTS OF RESPONSE OF DOMESTIC CHICK TO VISUAL STIMULI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Chicks of Brown Leghorn X Light Sussex were tested at the age of 24 [plus or minus] 6 hr for their response to a distant visual stimulus which in many previous experiments had been found to be effective. Chicks representing a wide range of performance in these experiments were later mated to provide a further generation which was tested under identical conditions and later provided another (F3) generation which was in turn tested under identical conditions. Comparison be-tween the performance of samples of the latter 2 generations indicates that genetic factors do not make a statistically significant contribution to responsiveness to distant visual stimuli. The most likely value of any genetic effect is approximately 18%.

The effect of extraneous solid objects on the formation of aggregations is described and reactions to various chemical stimuli are compared. Sensitivity to at least one substance is shown not to reside in the antennae. In the laboratory, aggregation can be influenced by chemical stimuli applied externally. Aggregation is shown to be initiated by thigmokinetic behavior and, in dry air, maintained by hygrokinetic reactions.

   REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR IN RHESUS MONKEY (MACACA-MULATTA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Data are reported on the reproductive behaviors of 14 rhesus monkeys which had been reared from infancy in relative social isolation. The 10 females were able to conceive; the 5 permitted to bear their young vaginally at term reacted to the offspring normally. The 4 males mated satisfactorily with species -typical positioning and, in 3 cases, sired offspring. The differences between these behaviors and those reported elsewhere are striking. The characteristics of the rearing conditions suggest the importance of visual and auditory contact in infancy and adolescence for the development of normal sexual behavior.

TI PERFORMANCE OF DORMICE + OTHER HIBERNATORS ON TESTS OF HUNGER MOTIVATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Appetitive aspects of feeding behavior were investigated in hibernators that naturally become obese to discover if there were resemblances to the behavior of hypothalamic obese rats. Dormice (Glis glis) showed only slight activity increments when food-deprived; there were no increases in intake of adulterated diet as body weight dropped; performance on fixed ratio schedules was poor. Ground squirrels (Citellus lateralis) showed changes in their reaction to an adulterated diet over the summer. On the other hand hamsters and rats became more active when food-deprived and increased their intake of adulterated diets as body weight dropped. A functional quiescence in the area of the ventromedial nucleus of hibernators that become obese would account for these behavioral results, and also for annual obesity and reproductive dysfunction in these animals.

TI MANIFESTATION + DETECTION OF OESTROUS IN HEIFERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations on the manifestation of the estrus were made on a group of 18 yearlings, dairy heifers. There was considerable variation in the intensity of estrus and in the degree of interest aroused by an estrous heifer in other heifers in the group. Usually only a small proportion of the group mounted an estrous heifer, frequency of mounting varied, and different heifers tended to mount an estrous heifer at different periods of observations during an estrous period. Heifers simultaneously in heat were not of equal interest to the rest of the group and repeatability of mounting behaviour at successive heats was low. Mounting behavior did not appear to be affected by stage of the estrous cycle except that estrous heifers were the most active mounters and best indicators of other estrous heifers. Bunting rating and size of the group did not appear to influence mounting behavior. The effect of various factors on the detection of estrus are discussed.

AB Research across primate species showed that social models (e.g. conspecifics) enhance memory (social memory effect, SME). In this preregistered study, we examined the ontogeny of the SME and its cognitive mechanism in great apes from infancy to adulthood (3 monthse47 years), and explored both its persistence after a delay and its interaction with attentional measures of arousal (heart rate, HR). Fortytwo individuals from four nonhuman great ape species viewed videos of social (hand) and nonsocial (mechanical claw) models constructing a tower, which was subsequently presented next to a novel tower. After 2 days, we showed the familiarized tower again next to a novel tower. Looking longer at the novel tower was interpreted as processing and recognizing the familiar tower (novelty response, NR). Results showed that adults (only) demonstrated higher NR for the tower built by the hand compared to the tower built by the claw when tested immediately, but not after a 2-day delay. We propose that this memory effect may have been driven by enhanced attention towards the social model, as adults demonstrated decreased HR relative to baseline in the social condition and accelerated HR in the nonsocial condition. However, we found no such differentiation in NR and HR in the younger individuals. (c) 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Play fighting is a multifunctional behaviour allowing the development of both cooperative and competitive skills. During play fighting, animals perform 'competitive' actions that are typical of the agonistic context and/or 'cooperative' actions to avoid escalation into aggression. Several structural features of play fighting (asymmetry, duration, variability and repetition) provide information on whether a session is more, or less, competitive. In many mammalian species, the relaxed open mouth (ROM) is a metasignal that communicates that the interaction is playful. In the Felidae family, play fighting has been poorly investigated and it is challenging to tell whether play fights are cooperative or competitive. Here, we explored whether the ROM could provide information about the cooperative/ competitive nature of play fighting in felines. To do so, we videorecorded and analysed dyadic play- fighting interactions in kittens of domestic cats, Felis silvestris catus, and Asian leopard cats, Prionailurus bengalensis. For both species, we found that play-fighting sessions with ROM were more symmetric, lasted longer, were less variable and showed lower evenness and repetition than those without ROM. As a whole, our results suggest that in both species ROM may help manage unpredictable play-fighting sessions and therefore this signal can be used to increase cooperation during the playful interaction, thus prolonging it.

AB Predation pressure is a selective force that leads to the evolution of defensive mechanisms in prey. Efforts are being made to measure and evaluate predation pressure qualitatively and quantitively, using various methods. As a guide for researchers, I review and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of several commonly used methods, including direct field observations, camera traps, animal-borne instruments, prey remains identification, biochemical methods, enclosure/exclusion experiments, prey damage identification, predator survey and spoor tracking. Among these methods, molecular tools to identify prey in the predator's gut, regurgitate or scat provide reliable estimates of the type and even quantity of prey in a predator's diet. Camera traps or direct observations also provide reliable information but are limited by the often-rare predation events. There is considerable potential in combining several methods to balance out the advantages and disadvantages of individual methods. For example, attack bites on artificial prey models can be combined with molecular analyses of the eDNA left behind by the predator. However, most methods still lack experimental validation to demonstrate that they actually quantify aspects of predator-prey interactions. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Maternal kinship can structure social relationships in mammals, as demonstrated in species characterized by female philopatry. In these species, females tend to be closely related and interact more often with maternal relatives. However, there is limited evidence indicating a role of maternal kinship in species characterized by male philopatry. To increase our understanding of the role of maternal kinship on the social structure of these species, we explore how maternal kinship influences the structure of association networks in a group of wild Geoffroy's spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi, over 24 years. Using 53 546 instantaneous scan samples collected from 1997 to 2020 (mean +/- SD 1/4 2231 +/- 890 per year), we built yearly association networks using the simple ratio index to establish links among 93 individuals observed over the study period. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and vector generalized linear models (VGLMs) to examine whether edge weight, network modularity and eigenvector and betweenness centrality were related to five maternal kin categories, four age-difference classes, three sex classes and matriline membership. We found that among individuals of similar age difference, maternal kin had higher edge weight and higher probabilities of being assigned to the same module in the association network than nonmaternally related individuals; maternal brothers, maternal sisters and maternal female-male siblings associated more than nonmaternally related individuals; and matriline membership influenced the eigenvector and betweenness centrality of its members, resulting in higher centrality values within certain matrilines. Matriline size was positively associated with eigenvector centrality, indicating that members of larger matrilines tended to be better integrated into the overall network through close connections with their maternal kin. Our results suggest that, in addition to age and sex, maternal kinship plays a significant role in structuring association networks even in a species characterized by male philopatry.

AB The navigational mechanisms of homing pigeons, Columba livia, have been extensively studied and represent a useful model for the navigation of birds and other animals. Pigeons navigate with an olfactory map and sun compass from unfamiliar areas and, in familiar areas, are largely guided by visual landscape cues, following stereotyped and idiosyncratic routes. However, the mechanisms by which they gain familiarity, improve their navigation and transition between navigational strategies during learning are not fully understood. Addressing these outstanding questions in this navigational model will help to improve our understanding of navigational ontogeny. We sought to investigate whether passive exposure to the cues at a site, without release, was sufficient for navigational learning, given that pigeons can determine the home direction before taking off. We exposed pigeons to cues at a novel site before returning them to the site the next day and releasing them alongside controls. We found no differences in the directional distributions, mean vector lengths, virtual vanishing times, efficiency indices or homing efficiency indices between birds that had and had not previously visited the site. We therefore found no evidence to suggest that passive exposure to the cues at a novel site was sufficient to facilitate a detectable improvement in navigational performance. There are three possible explanations for this result: first, a larger sample size would have detected a weak effect of learning; second, passive exposure to a release site is insufficient to generate navigational learning; and third, pigeons learn from passive exposure but do not rely upon this information, showing no difference in performance, despite learning. We discuss these three explanations with reference to previous findings on navigational learning in homing pigeons. We suggest that experiments should continue to examine navigational ontogeny in homing pigeons to help address this major problem for the field of navigation. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Conferences are an integral part of academia, providing researchers with the opportunity to collaborate and disseminate their research. Traditionally these conferences have been in-person, but COVID-19 restrictions and growing recognition of systematic barriers have led many academic societies to reimagine the conference format. Social media platforms are often used to promote and broadcast in-person academic conferences, so with the development of online conferences they have naturally become hosting platforms. For example, during the peak of COVID-19 restrictions, when in-person meetings were not possible, Twitter conferences, like the first Global Animal Behaviour Conference (#AnimBehav2021), provided a much needed platform to collaborate and share science. Recently, conferences have returned to an in-person format. In addition, a change in ownership of Twitter led to widespread restructuring of the Twitter workforce and misinformation management policies that resulted in a massive exodus of academics from the platform. During these changes, we organized and held the second Global Animal Behaviour Twitter Conference (#AnimBehav2023) in January 2023. In this paper, we report (1) how engagement in the Twitter conference changed as a result of return to in-person conferences and changes in Twitter ownership, (2) how the community views online conferences in general and Twitter conferences in particular and (3) reflect on how online conferences can be organized moving forward. Given the widespread benefits of and need for online conferences, we urge academic societies and researchers to continue systematically exploring these alternative conference formats to ensure inclusivity and accessibility in academic spaces.

AB An individual's future behaviour and fitness are strongly in fluenced by early life experience. Within the suite of factors that underpin juvenile development, sleep plays a particularly important role, ful filling vital physiological and cognitive functions. Sleep ontogeny is the process by which sleep time becomes shorter and more consolidated into fewer bouts from in utero development to adulthood; however, how sleep quantity, fragmentation and quality develop in neonates in the wild is unknown. We investigated this question in 19 free-ranging fallow deer fawns, Dama dama , during the first 5 weeks of life. Specifically, we examined how sleep developed, how it differed between and within individuals, and how it was affected by environmental conditions, using accelerometer-derived estimates of sleep and a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach. We showed that sleep duration rapidly decreased and became more consolidated, quickly approaching an adult-like condition. Moreover, fawns exhibited consistent individual differences in sleep quantity, fragmentation and quality, as well as in the rate at which sleep developed. Finally, environmental conditions affecting thermoregulation mediated sleep behaviour; sleep time was reduced and was of lower quality on warmer days, and sleep quality was further compromised in more humid conditions but was higher with greater rainfall. While sleep ontogeny in free-ranging fawns is partially shaped by the environment, our study reveals previously unknown individual differences in sleep behaviour present from birth, and in the rate of sleep development. We suggest that such individual differences may represent pace-of-life syndromes and may have important consequences for individual fitness later in life. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Parasites and infectious diseases constitute important challenges particularly for group -living animals. Social contact and shared space can both increase parasite transmission risk, while individual differences in social capital can help prevent infections. For example, high social status individuals and those with more or stronger af filiative partnerships may have better immunity and, thus, lower parasitic burden. To test for health trade-offs in the costs and bene fits of sociality, we quanti fied how parasitic load varied with an individual's social status, as well as with their af filiative relationships with weakly and strongly bonded partners, in a free -ranging population of rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta . We found that high status was associated with a lower risk of protozoa infection at older ages compared to younger and lowstatus animals. Social resources can also be protective against infection under environmentally challenging situations, such as natural disasters. Using cross-sectional data, we additionally examined the impact of a major hurricane on the sociality - parasite relationship in this system and found that the hurricane in fluenced the prevalence of speci fic parasites independent of sociality. Overall, our study adds to the growing evidence for social status as a strong predictor of infection risk and highlights how extreme environmental events could shape vulnerability and resistance to infection.

AB Social interactions are fundamental properties of gregarious species, helping to establish dominance hierarchies and maintain social bonds within groups. Cattle, Bos taurus, are social ungulates which engage in affiliative and agonistic relationships with other individuals. Although there are approximately 1.5 billion cattle on the planet, the opportunity to research cattle behaviour in free-ranging groups is rare, as there are few feral populations worldwide. Cattle engage in positive social behaviours such as allogrooming, where one individual licks the body of another. The relationship between affiliative behaviours and other individual characteristics (such as sex and dominance status) are frequently studied in other gregarious species, but are largely undetermined in cattle. To investigate the relationships between sex, dominance status and allogrooming, we observed a mixed-sex feral cattle herd in Hong Kong, recording dominance interactions and allogrooming events. The hierarchy was linear and stable, consisting of 22 adult males and 33 adult females. We found that dominant females received more allogrooming than subordinate females, but subordinate females did not perform it more. Males performed allogrooming more towards females than other males, but females groomed both sexes equally. Sex affected dominance position, with males obtaining higher status than females, but not all females were subordinate to males. These preferential allogrooming patterns improve our knowledge of sex-specific interactions and help us to understand the dynamics of agonistic and affiliative behaviours in multimale, multifemale ungulate groups. Studying a free-ranging feral population provides us with a unique insight into ungulate behavioural patterns and the evolution of cattle social behaviours.

ID TIT-FOR-TAT; STOCHASTIC STRATEGIES; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR
AB Altruism and spite are costly, so from an evolutionary perspective their existence is mysterious. Both altruism and spite have been studied, but the latter has been investigated less than the former. One set of mechanisms that facilitates the evolution of altruism is repeated interactions. Upon repeated interactions, conditional altruistic strategies can be favoured by natural selection, and successful conditional strategies have already been proposed. Mechanisms that encourage the evolution of altruism can also encourage the evolution of spite. A previous study showed that spite could evolve under repeated interactions, by investigating (just) one conditional spiteful strategy. However, the kinds of conditional spiteful strategies that are successful/unsuccessful have not been comprehensively studied. Here, by using evolutionary game theory, I investigated what kinds of conditional spiteful strategies are favoured by natural selection under repeated interactions. The results showed that a successful spiteful strategy involves choosing the opposite of the opponent's last move and does not involve holding a grudge. In these two aspects, a successful spiteful strategy and a successful altruistic strategy are different. Spite is altruism's evil twin in the sense that repeated interactions facilitate both; however, the conditional strategies that are likely to evolve are different. (c) 2023 The Author.

AB One area of animal behaviour of growing interest is related to the behavioural traits that favour species' survival in rapidly changing environments (e.g. cities). In this regard, one animal group that is resilient to urbanization is that of odonate insects. These animals are formidable generalist predators that exhibit large behavioural flexibility. Here we tested whether adult odonate communities show differences in behavioural traits associated with reproduction, foraging and thermoregulation in relation to an urbanization gradient. Our results indicate that individuals were more efficient at capturing prey in more urbanized places. More effective predation in cities may occur because of changes in the environment, changes in odonate behaviour or modifications in prey communities whose characteristics influence the success rate of odonates during hunting.

AB Kangaroos are an iconic group of Australian fauna. Despite considerable research on kangaroo behaviour, key gaps remain in our understanding of their social organization in the wild. In particular, it remains largely unknown whether kangaroos form long-term social bonds and what factors might prompt individuals to associate or dissociate from one another. Over 6 years, we monitored the social affiliations of individually identified eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, in a large wild population. We investigated the short-term and long-term relationships of kangaroos and the extent those relationships varied with age, sex and reproductive state. We found evidence that long-term relationships among eastern grey kangaroos are possible, especially between adult females. Those individuals that were more sociable within years were also more likely to establish affiliations across years. Contrary to previous studies, we observed females actively associating with other mothers in the years in which they had young. These data suggest that the fission-fusion dynamics of eastern grey kangaroo social behaviour allow females to modulate their social position with conspecifics according to their current reproductive state. We highlight the adaptive implications of the formation of long-term bonds and the changes in social behaviour observed in females.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Juvenile hormone (JH) in insects plays a key role in regulating reproduction, but in some social insects it has also acquired secondary functions in regulating the age-related division of labour among the workers. Previous work has shown that JH regulates division of labour in honey bees, in several prim-itively eusocial paper wasps and in leafcutter ants, which comprise three independent origins of sociality. It remains unclear, however, to what degree JH could have a conserved role in regulating division of labour within these clades. To this end, we investigated whether JH also regulates division of labour in the highly eusocial Vespine wasp Vespula vulgaris, in which JH had previously been shown only to regulate reproduction and affect queen pheromone signalling. In line with JH having a conserved role in regulating division of labour in social wasps, we show that JH in this species indeed affected behavioural maturation and division of labour in the worker caste. In particular, topical application of the JH analogue methoprene onto workers accelerated behavioural maturation and hastened the onset of foraging, thereby significantly decreasing the time they spent conducting activities inside the nest. We discuss how this conserved role of JH in regulating division of labour could indicate the same conserved genetic toolkits being used to regulate division of labour across several independent origins of sociality. In addition, we examine the implications of JH having several pleiotropic effects in this species and discuss whether this could constrain the expression of reproductive conflicts in their societies.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Skilful fighting encompasses an individual's ability not only to perform agonistic behaviours accurately and efficiently, but also to choose the most appropriate behaviour or tactic from its repertoire based on the information available. The efficacy of different tactics may depend both on the behaviour of the opponent and on the individual's internal state, for example a specific behaviour may become less effective over time as fatigue sets in. Furthermore, because fights are dynamic interactions, the ability to choose the appropriate tactic will require rapid information processing and may thus be constrained by an individual's cognitive ability. Here, we conducted a three-phase experiment to investigate the effects of reduced performance capacity induced by exposure to hypoxia and decision-making speed on skilful fighting in the European hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus. During fights attackers attempt to elicit an eviction either by rapping on the defender's shell or by rocking the defender's shell back and forth. By analysing the effect of exposure to hypoxia and decision-making speed on the relative use of these tactics, we show that contrary to our prediction, neither performance capacity nor decision-making speed alone predicted the type of behaviour performed. Rather, these two traits interacted to deter-mine the amount of effort (raps and rocks) attackers needed to exert to elicit an eviction. Furthermore, we show that while neither performance capacity nor decision-making speed predicted skill when fights were analysed as a whole, the effects of these variables became apparent when analysing the change in accuracy as fights progressed, likely due to the accumulating effects of fatigue.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Songbird vocal learning is a popular model for understanding the evolution of complex communication. When multiple tutors are available, juvenile songbirds prefer to learn vocalizations from some tutors over others, their preferences partly guided by postnatal acoustic experience and social interactions. The potential for prenatal sound to also influence song tutor choice remains largely untested, despite recent evidence that prenatal sound affects other aspects of songbird development. Previously, we showed that Australian zebra finches, Taeniopygia castanotis, learnt more song syllables from nonpaternal tutors if they had previously experienced 'heat calls' (parental vocalizations produced at high ambient temperatures) as embryos. This suggests that heat call exposure may trigger changes in offsprings' social behaviour or learning strategy as juveniles, thereby indirectly affecting their song tutor preferences. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by prenatally exposing male zebra finches to either heat calls (treatment) or contact calls (control) and then assessing their song preferences as adults. Song preferences were measured in a four-way choice apparatus in response to playback from four different individuals: their social father (paternal song), an unrelated conspecific (nonpaternal song) and two heterospecifics (both male canaries, Serinus canaria). As expected, subjects were more attracted to conspecific songs than to canary songs, regardless of their prenatal sound exposure. In addition, prenatal sound experience altered subjects' conspecific song preferences: treatment birds preferred nonpaternal conspecific song over their social father's song while control birds showed no preference. That prenatal sound produced long-lasting differences in individual song preferences, which are typically reflective of vocal tutor choice, has implications for understanding both the flexibility of vocal learning and the influence of prenatal soundscapes on individual phenotypes.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Social dilemmas play an important role in the study of cooperative behaviours. In this experiment we tested the strategies adopted by tufted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus spp., when faced with a cooperative situation involving a conflict of interest, simulating a Snowdrift game. We tested 12 capuchin monkeys (six dyads) in two experimental conditions: Snowdrift (cooperation) and Competition. Monkeys had the opportunity to pull a string to move a rotating bar and obtain a reward while delivering a different reward to their partner. Pulling in the Snowdrift condition delivered a smaller reward to the individual pulling the string and a larger reward to the partner, while the opposite happened in the Competition condition. If neither monkey pulled within 30 s, neither received a reward. Monkeys were also individually tested in a battery of self-control tasks. Capuchin monkeys successfully coordinated (i.e. obtained a reward) in 100% of trials and flexibly adapted their behaviour to the different experimental conditions, by pulling earlier in the Competition and later in the Snowdrift condition. Dominance rank and self-control had no effect on the latencies to pull in either experimental condition. No evidence of any alternation strategy was observed. Our results suggest that capuchin monkeys can solve a conflict of interest without engaging in complex calculations. (c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Remaining immobile for an unpredictable time following contact with a predator (postcontact immobility) is a successful tactic to reduce predation. However, the mechanisms that may cause this variation are poorly known. We explored whether size, personality, substrate type and predation risk influence the duration of postcontact immobility in antlion larvae. Using field experiments on a large number of larvae, we detected a highly unpredictable postcontact immobility duration. This suggests that motor routines selected to improve the performance of this sit-and-wait predator larvae, such as staying immobile for an indefinite period, can also be adaptive to avoid predation. Postcontact immobility showed similar duration between low- and high-predation risk levels and was unrelated to larvae size. However, larvae showed longer postcontact immobility on compact soils than on loose soils. Antlions took longer to bury themselves in compact substrate, increasing the probability of being detected by a predator. Hence, it seems reasonable that, on compact soils, larvae showed longer postcontact immobility. On the other hand, larvae showed some degree of consistency in presenting short or long postcontact immobility independently of the nature of the treatments. Since repeated inductions of postcontact immobility in the same prey by a predator are rare, unpredictable variation at the population level may be an emergent property of consistency in postcontact immobility duration at the individual level. We conclude that factors generating unpredictable postcontact immobility duration may be intrinsic or extrinsic but are often associated with traits that predators cannot easily detect in advance, reinforcing the adaptive value of playing dead as an antipredator strategy.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Reintroductions involve the relocation of animals into their historical range following extinction or extirpation. In this context, individuals with certain personalities may be more successful than others. For example, proactive individuals may dominate by being bolder, exploratory and more willing to take risks in familiar, stable environments (i.e. the source environment). Reactive personalities, in contrast, may thrive in novel, unstable environments (i.e. the release site) by being vigilant and risk averse. In addition, an individual's ability to adjust its behaviours over time (plasticity, or responsiveness) can play a pivotal role in determining postrelease performance. There is uncertainty, however, surrounding which behavioural measures translate to reintroduction success. We conducted behavioural assays and post release monitoring for eastern quolls, Dasyurus viverrinus, to determine whether behavioural measures (e.g. latency to emerge, time spent vigilant) could predict postrelease survival and dispersal in a fenced sanctuary. Using the 'behavioural reaction norm' approach, we found that personality derived from time spent exposed or vigilant during the assays had significant associations with postrelease den sharing and home range, while plasticity derived from latency (i.e. time delay) to reach food had a significant association with mean distance between consecutive dens. We recommend that proactive and rigid founders be preferred for initial trial reintroductions, and that reactive and plastic founders be used to supplement the population in later translocations. Our study demonstrates that, by including novelty, innovative behavioural assays offer significant value as a conservation tool to provide the fastest pathway to reintroduction success.

AB Carotenoids play an import role as one of the most prevalent pigments in animals. Carotenoid-based coloration accounts for striking sexually and naturally selected colour adaptations. Several anurans (frogs and toads) change body coloration either slowly and permanently between life stages (ontogenetic colour change), or rapidly and temporarily within minutes or hours (dynamic colour change). We investigated ontogenetic colour change from orange to green morphs in the Wallace's flying frog, Rhacophorus nigropalmatus, and tested the influence of dietary carotenoids on colour change during post metamorphic development. At the age of 9 months, while all individuals still possessed orange-red body coloration, a 20-week-long feeding experiment was performed by supplying the frogs with either no carotenoid supplements or dietary carotenoids once or four times per week. A high carotenoid diet resulted in a faster increase in green colour chroma as well as higher levels of green and carotenoid chroma of back coloration. Less or no carotenoid supplementation led to an increase in UV-blue chroma, contributing to a dull turquoise appearance often observed in captive-bred and captive-raised anurans. In addition, we showed for the first time that Wallace's flying frogs also perform dynamic colour changes. We tested dynamic changes triggered either by 2 min tactile handling or varying 1 h dark and light conditions. Our results demonstrate that a high carotenoid diet facilitates rapid and reversible change of body coloration in response to a tactile stressor, an adaptation absent in frogs receiving no carotenoids. Dynamic colour changes were likewise observed in response to changing light conditions presumably camouflaging individuals and providing protection from UV irradiation. The ontogenetic and dynamic pigmentation changes are discussed in relation to mechanism and as a likely strategy to avoid predation both at different life stages and in different environments.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Like passerines among birds, rodents among mammals have experienced an enormous radiation. Similar to songbirds, this radiation is associated with the evolution of a critical innovation in how vocal signals are produced. Recent studies on the anatomical and physiological bases of vocal production provide an opportunity to understand how proximate mechanisms shape acoustic variation to influence signal function and evolution. Acoustic variation ranges from subtle changes within individuals in different social contexts to extreme divergence among closely related species. Despite increased appreciation of this modality, relatively few studies have assessed variability of acoustic features within individuals over time and/or the consequences of such variation. Moreover, our understanding of the mechanisms that promote and constrain acoustic variation is limited. Herein, we review ontogenetic, social and endocrine factors associated with intraspecific acoustic signal variation in murid and cricetid rodents, summarize the functional consequences of such variation and describe morphological and physiological adaptations underlying vocal displays. We then suggest a framework for developing mutually informative mechanistic and functional studies to explore the evolution of signal elaboration. Clarifying the causes and consequences of interspecific and intraspecific acoustic variation is critical to understanding the evolution and function of vocalizations in the largest radiation of mammals.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Much research on sexual selection focuses on evolutionary forces that drive sexual trait elaboration. Yet sexual traits are also shaped equally in their evolution by countervailing factors, namely costs and constraints, which curtail continued sexual trait elaboration. In this essay I consider the roles of these factors, particularly constraints, in curbing sexual trait expression and evolution. First, I review basic definitions of costs and constraints, with emphasis on the distinction between them. Second, I discuss operational strategies for identifying constraints on sexual traits, emphasizing the value of studies on mechanisms that underlie sexual trait expression. Third, I offer new speculations regarding the relative roles of costs and constraints over evolutionary timescales. In particular, I suggest that (1) during initial stages of trait elaboration, costs play dominant roles as countervailing factors, (2) for systems in which trait elaboration proceeds, constraints become increasingly influential as a countervailing co-factor alongside costs and (3) for nature's most elaborate sexual traits, constraints emerge as the most dominant countervailing factor, yet never to the point where costs are eliminated. Finally, I apply this new speculative framework in re-evaluating definitions of two categories of sexual signals that are often regarded as hinging on costs and constraints: handicap signals and index signals.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Hypotheses regarding the evolution of uniquely human social cognition often emphasize not only mental state representation, but also mental state sharing. Mental state sharing is evident in instances of joint intentionality -mutual understanding between individuals of each other's simultaneous and interdependent commitment to a shared activity or goal. Comparative studies supporting the human uniqueness of joint intentionality show that, as compared to human children, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, who engage with humans as cooperative partners do not altruistically help others achieve their goals across the same range of contexts, do not attempt to re-engage cooperative partners in problem-solving or social games at the same rate and do not show spontaneous role reversal. Although recent work supports the possibility that bonobos, Pan paniscus, may re-engage conspecific partners after interrupted social grooming, the extent to which other animals show similar behaviour across more diverse contexts remains largely unexplored. Domestic dogs', Canis familiaris, propensity to interact with humans in cooperative contexts makes them a potentially promising comparative model of prosocial mental state sharing. Here, we investigated a behavioural signature of joint intentionality during social play between humans and dogs (N 1/4 82). Our results present the first experimental evidence of re-engagement behaviour in dogs, as dogs preferentially attempted to reinitiate an interrupted social game with their previous partner relative to a passive bystander. These findings suggest that dogs exhibit a key marker of joint intentionality and open the door for future research on the cognitive mechanisms supporting this behaviour.(C) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Movement patterns may reflect individual age-specific variation. For example, individuals that sample novel areas (e.g. natal dispersal) may show different movements from those of adults settling in more stable areas and moving around local environments to procure food and shelter. The long-term study of a solitary large carnivore, the brown bear, Ursus arctos, allowed us to test for age-related differences in movement behaviour and, more specifically, for potential inter-versus intraindividual variation among adult versus subadult bears. In addition to age, we also explored factors other than individual charac-teristics that have the potential to determine movement patterns: sex, season (mating versus hyper-phagia) and body weight. The contribution of age to movement patterns seemed to be irrelevant, most of the observed movement patterns being primarily explained by season and body weight. Moreover, intraindividual movements within a home range were more marked among subadult brown bears. We hypothesize that two mechanisms may lead to subadults and adults moving similarly. First, both must hibernate and, consequently, need to store energy during hyperphagia. Second, although triggered by different factors, both make erratic/long movements after hibernation, for dispersal (subadults) or mating (adults), which might contribute to shaping similar movement patterns. Different motivations could thus be expressed through the same behavioural patterns, and equifinality (i.e. similar ecological patterns emerge from different initial conditions) might be considered an intrinsic property of animal behaviours.

AB Parental care can be associated with novel or altered social relationships with conspecifics, yet little is known about how the broader structure of the social environment is modulated by individuals caring for dependent offspring. Here, we compared the social environments of breeding groups in which dependent offspring were either present or absent. We conducted a field study with Neolamprologus multifasciatus, a group-living cichlid fish endemic to Lake Tanganyika, in which females provide direct care for their offspring within a group's territory. We used two methods to characterize the social environments in each group: (1) behavioural scoring to quantify the interactions among all group members and (2) automated, computer-assisted, visual detection to track the movements of fish on their territories. We found that relative to groups without offspring, groups with dependent offspring showed heightened conflict among females, as well as appreciable contests between dominant males and noncaregiving females. Patterns of space use revealed that territories comprise distinct, female-held subterritories, and although caregiving females used wider spaces than noncaregiving females, their subterritory areas remained largely nonoverlapping. By combining two complementary approaches for characterizing the social environment we were able to show how periods of parental care can be associated with marked differences in the makeup of breeding groups' social environments.

AB Unexplained behavioural inconsistency in individual animals, termed unpredictability, could account for more than 50% of variance in some behaviours. Unpredictability is likely to be selectively beneficial as a predator mitigation strategy and thus should be of adaptive value. Between-individual differences in behavioural unpredictability and how it changes across environmental contexts may thus have important consequences for selection, particularly in the face of extreme environmental changes. Associations between unpredictability and other risk-mitigating behavioural traits such as boldness could further influence individual fitness and population health. In this study, we investigated patterns of unpredictability in Actinia equina individuals at high and low temperature extremes. We investigated two boldness-related behaviours, immersion response (tentacle extension with submergence) and startle response (tentacle extension after a fright). We took bursts of six repeated measures of each behaviour, one at 6 degrees C and one at 21 degrees C in two crossed-over treatments, and two at 13 degrees C in a control treatment. Large sample sizes allowed us to use double-hierarchical linear mixed modelling to investigate between-individual variation in unpredictability and in the plasticity of unpredictability. Significant between-individual variation in unpredictability was present for both behaviours and was influenced by temperature. For the startle response, animals collected from less stochastic environments were more unpredictable at 21 degrees C than those from more stochastic environments. For the immersion response, animals were more unpredictable at 21 degrees C than at 6 degrees C; this difference was clearer in those individuals that started at the high, rather than the low, temperature. Unpredictability was further positively correlated with the mean level immersion response at both temperatures; intermediate and moderately shy individuals were more unpredictable than bold in both environments. Metabolic rate in A. equina increases as the temperature rises, so energetically taxing unpredictability, coupled with reductions in foraging associated with shyer behaviour, could prove selectively detrimental during heatwaves.

AB The origin of novel communication systems has long been an evolutionary puzzle because communi-cation requires interdependent signals and responses. Either component is not useful in isolation. Pre-vious work has shown that novel communication systems may arise when pre-existing traits are co-opted for a novel function. However, research on developmental plasticity suggests we may benefit from considering how plasticity facilitates the origin and diversification of communication systems. In particular, plasticity can stabilize novel traits that are the first step towards signals or receiver responses (precursors) because plasticity allows individuals to rapidly adjust their phenotype based on their partner's phenotype, termed 'reciprocal plasticity'. For example, exposure to a new sender precursor (e.g. new song) can produce a rapid, reciprocal change in receiver responses (e.g. preference for the new song). Reciprocal plasticity may facilitate the origin of new communication systems because precursors that influence conspecifics are more likely to become established signalling systems than precursors that are ignored by conspecifics. We review evidence that plasticity is important in the development and expression of a range of signals and preferences, the implications for divergence in signalling systems and its potential impacts on speciation and diversification. We outline areas of exciting future research, from incorporating more developmental realism into evolutionary models of signalling systems to using experimental evolution and novel anthropogenic environments to study genetic assimilation of plastic signals and preferences.

AB Visual signals in animals are often shaped by sexual selection. For aposematic species, advantages may result from advertising unpalatability to decrease predation and attracting mates to increase reproductive success. On Green Island, Taiwan, most Eupyrgops waltonianus weevils have metallic blue spots on the body; however, some weevils have no conspicuous coloration. The role of coloration in sexual selection and any disadvantages encountered by dull individuals are unknown. To understand whether morphological traits affect mating success in E. waltonianus, we compared different traits between mating and nonmating individuals in the field. A manipulation experiment was also used to test whether coloration affects mating choice and behaviour. The function of colour as an aposematic signal was tested. Results showed that body size and coloration were important indicators of female mating success in field and laboratory experiments, respectively. In the field, males preferred to mate with larger, more conspicuous females, and females preferred to mate with conspicuous males; however, no such preference was shown in the laboratory. Intrasexual competition was stronger in males than in females. Predators avoided colourful weevils. Thus, conspicuous coloration in both sexes is a multifunctional trait and could be an attractive or aposematic signal for different receivers.

AB Despite the ubiquity of web-borne vibratory communication among many web-building spiders, few empirical studies, to date, have quantified the characteristics and mechanisms of the signals involved. In this study, we used western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, and examined male signal characteristics, signal production mechanisms and signal transmission efficacy on webs. It is not clear how vibrations are transmitted through the chaotic cobweb typical of this species and relatives, and previous work argued that L. hesperus courtship vibrations lacked structure. We videorecorded courtship and copulation behaviour, and used laser vibrometry to record and characterize web-borne vibrations. We examined signalling mechanisms using synchronous high-speed video and vibrometry recordings. Lastly, we examined signal transmission by measuring transfer functions between body movements and the resulting vibration signal. We found that males displayed three distinct signal types (abdominal tremulation, bounce and web plucks), each of which were generated by a different signal production mechanism. Our results also show that male bounces and web plucks may convey information about male size. Contrary to earlier work, we show that during the later phases of male-female interactions, males intermittently organize individual signal types into stereotyped sequential displays (?structured signalling?). Moreover, despite the cobweb structure, transfer function analyses showed that female webs transmit male signals with high efficacy. These results suggest that vibratory communication in L. hesperus, previously classified as simple signallers, can comprise emergent forms of signal complexity and lay the foundation for future studies on this mode of communication in other web-dwelling species. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural lateralization, the asymmetric expression of cognitive functions, is reported to enhance key fitness-relevant traits such as group coordination, multitasking and predator escape. Therefore, studies reporting negative effects on lateralization in fish due to environmental stressors such as ocean acidification, hypoxia and pollutants are worrisome. However, such studies tend to use a detour test and focus on population level measures, without validating whether lateralization is consistent within individuals across time. We conducted a multispecies, international assessment of the repeatability (R) of lateralization in four previously studied fish species using a detour test (T-maze), a common method for testing lateralization. We also reanalysed a published data set on a fifth species using new statistical methods. We expected the three shoaling species to exhibit greater within-individual consistency in lateralization than their nonshoaling counterparts given previous reports of stronger lateralization in group-living fishes. Absolute and relative lateralization scores were highly nonrepeatable in all five species (0.01<R<0.08), irrespective of their shoaling status. We carefully reviewed 31 published studies in which the detour test was employed to examine lateralization in fish and identified statistical issues in all of them. We develop and propose new statistical analyses to test for population and individual level lateralization. The commonly used detour test does not appear to be appropriate for quantifying behavioural lateralization in fishes, calling into question functional inferences drawn by many published studies, including our own. Potential fitness benefits of lateralization and anthropogenic effects on lateralization as a proxy for adaptive brain functioning need to be assessed with alternative paradigms.

AB The nonlinearity and fear hypothesis predicts that the structure of alarm vocalizations will be influenced by the signaller's internal state. Specifically, stressed or otherwise more aroused individuals will produce alarm calls that are relatively more nonlinear (i.e. they sound noisier). The position of an individual in a social network can influence an individual's sense of security. More centrally located individuals may feel more secure and thus we might expect that they would produce noisier calls. Building on previous research about the influence of social relationships on an individual's sense of security, we asked whether social network position explained variation in the noisiness (quantified as Wiener entropy) and goodness of pitch of alarm calls produced by trapped yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. More socially isolated individuals, characterized by lower outstrength, produced alarm calls with higher entropy and higher goodness of pitch. These isolated individuals may be more aroused because they have fewer social partners to depend on when presented with a predatory threat; therefore, they produce both noisy and potentially louder calls. Additionally, individuals with higher outcloseness produced calls with higher goodness of pitch, which may be indicative of their ability to better inform neighbours of impending threats. Overall, this study further illustrates how an individual's social network position influences the structure of its alarm calls, which could reflect how individuals perceive their current safety levels.

AB Theory suggests that the balance between unknown dangers and novel opportunities drives the evolution of species-level neophobia. Juveniles show lower neophobia than adults, within mammals and birds, presumably to help minimize the costs of avoiding beneficial novelty, and adults tend to be more neophobic, to reduce risks and focus on known stimuli. How these dynamics function in island species with fewer dangers from predators and toxic prey is not well understood. Yet, predicting neophobia levels at different age classes may be highly valuable in conservation contexts, such as species' translocation programmes, where responses to novelty can influence the effectiveness of prerelease training and animals' survival postrelease. To better understand how neophobia and its age-related patterns are expressed in an island corvid, we surveyed object neophobia in 84% of the world's critically endangered 'alala, Corvus hawaiiensis. Individuals repeatedly demonstrated high neophobia, suggesting that neither captivity nor their island evolution has erased this corvid-typical trait. Unexpectedly, juveniles were exceedingly more neophobic than adults, a pattern in stark contrast to common neophobia predictions and known mammalian and avian studies. We discuss the potential conservation ramifications of this age-structured result within the larger context of neophobia theory. Not only may the expression of neophobia be more complicated than previously thought but predicting such responses may also be important for conservation management that requires exposing animals to novelty.

AB To develop an evolutionary theory of social decision making, we require an understanding of how individuals utilize environmental cues to form decision rules. We exposed 'cleaner' fish (bluestreak cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus) to a biological market task, where giving priority to an ephemeral (i.e. 'visitor' client) food plate, over a permanent (i.e. 'resident' client) plate, doubled the food reward. Previously published experiments revealed that adult cleaners from a complex social environment regularly solved this task and outperformed adult cleaners from a simple social environment as well as juveniles from both habitat types. In these studies, plates were differentiated by colour and/or colour pattern. However, client size is another potentially useful cue that may be used by cleaners to solve the biological market task in nature, as visitor clients are typically larger than resident clients. Here, we tested cleaners in a setting where plates differed only in size and not colour/pattern: the majority of cleaners exhibited a spontaneous preference for inspecting larger plates or were more likely to reach the task-solving criterion if the visitor plate was larger. All cleaners were able to solve the task when we incorporated both size and colour/pattern cues; however, only cleaners from the complex social environment settled on the more precise colour/pattern cue. In contrast, cleaners from the simple social environment relied on size as the primary, yet less precise, cue to solve the task. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that intraspecific variation in the performance of cleaners in the biological market task is based on variation in the relative salience of available cues and correlates with variation in a cleaner's natural social environment. Variation in the relative salience of available cues may therefore explain a portion of the intra- and interspecific variance in cognitive performance and social behaviour documented in other animal species.

AB The performance of vocal motor control is crucial for vocal communication; however, its evolution and ecological drivers are largely unknown. Doppler shift compensation (DSC), which has been found only in bats, represents an excellent model for studying the mechanisms and evolution of vocal control. We tested whether species that are more dependent on DSC for pulse-echo separation have a more precise DSC and whether changes in environmental clutter would result in adjustments in DSC performance. We recorded the echolocation and flight behaviour of the greater horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, and the great leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros armiger, flying through a corridor and a window in turn. The DSC precision in H. armiger was significantly lower than that of R. ferrumequinum; the offset between the reference frequency and resting frequency, however, was not significantly different between the two species. We also studied the DSC of H. armiger flying through windows of different sizes. Their flight speed decreased significantly with reduced window size. However, DSC precision and the offset did not vary significantly with window size. Our results suggest that DSC is more precise in rhinolophids, which have a higher demand for pulse-echo separation by DSC, than in hipposiderids. Changes in environmental clutter do not necessarily result in adjustments of DSC performance. Functional importance associated with high-performance vocal control may be critical in shaping the precision of vocal control in the course of evolution. Instead, habitat clutter encountered by vocalizing animals may not play an important role. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In some cooperatively breeding species, breeding and nonbreeding individuals within a group care for young through provisioning and guarding, commonly referred to as alloparental care. The question of why nonbreeders contribute to the care of young is at the centre of research on the evolution of cooperative societies, and the mechanisms that drive the behaviour are a topic of debate. We employed a novel approach to examine grey wolf, Canis lupus, space use at pup-rearing sites by using genotyped scats to measure the distance between wolves and evaluate the influence of genetic relatedness and other group characteristics on this space use. Specifically, we evaluated how group composition and individual characteristics influenced space use and whether the distance between adults and pups influenced pup survival. We genotyped 3093 wolf scats collected at pup-rearing sites during June -August 2008-2016 and calculated the distance between scats. We found that space use at puprearing sites did not influence pup survival. We also found that nonbreeders, especially yearlings, remained closer to pups than did breeders, and that individuals more genetically related to the pups were found closer to them, suggesting kin-directed attendance behaviour. Finally, we found evidence suggesting that direct fitness benefits, such as gaining access to food, may influence space use as well and help to explain why yearling nonbreeders were found the closest to the pups. This is the first study to provide indirect evidence for kin-directed attendance behaviour in wolves and it contributes novel methodology for investigating space use and helping behaviour in cooperative breeders at reproductive sites.

AB Dispersal involves many behavioural interactions that if inefficient or ineffectual would lead to serious fitness consequences. Such costs would be particularly dear for passively dispersing organisms for which direction of movement is determined by external forces. In this study, we investigated whether environment and morphology influence dispersal behaviours of a passive, aerially dispersing organism, the eriophyoid wheat curl mite, Aceria tosichella. We used a wind tunnel to generate stable wind speeds and analysed mite behaviour, morphology and dispersal rate for each wind speed treatment. We found that dispersal events were phenotype and context dependent with an important behavioural component. Aerial dispersal increased significantly via chains formed by individuals and mites dispersing in chains were significantly more elongated than controls. This difference in shape interacted significantly with wind speed but diminished at high wind speeds. Contrary to expectations, we found that an upright position was not related to the likelihood of being blown away. The results indicate that departure events for this mite are influenced by the interaction of behaviour, morphology and environment. Our study represents a substantial step toward explaining wheat curl mite dispersal and its colonization potential, with implications for passively dispersing organisms in general.

AB Although inbreeding depression in life-history traits has been well characterized, inbreeding effects on mating behaviour and sexually selected traits have been less well studied. Here, we assess levels of inbreeding depression in a number of fitness-related reproductive parameters of female decorated crickets, Gryllodes sigillatus. We predicted that due to direct negative effects of inbreeding and a potential trade-off between reproduction and current survival, as suggested by effects of inbreeding on immunity, inbred females would show significantly reduced reproductive output compared with outbred females. We also examined sex-specific effects of inbreeding on mating competency, focusing specifically on the female's decision to mount a male and the male's ability to transfer a spermatophore. We predicted that any inbreeding depression in sexual competency should be more evident in the success of spermatophore transfer than in female mounting propensity because of the tighter link between mating success and fitness in males than in females. Inbred females produced fewer offspring with longer development times compared with outbred females, results consistent with theory, as inbreeding depression is expected to be more severe for traits more tightly coupled with fitness. Inbreeding also had sex-specific effects on sexual competency. Inbred females were less likely to mount outbred males than were outbred females to mount inbred males. Inbred males were significantly less likely than outbred males to transfer a spermatophore regardless of female inbreeding status. These results reveal that inbreeding may have unexpected consequences for sexual competency and highlight the importance of considering mating behaviour when assessing effects of inbreeding within populations.

AB Although animal social information is most commonly utilized by conspecifics, some conditions may favour heterospecific transmission. Generalists living in social groups are thought to produce information that is conspicuous and broadly useful to other species. Information may be signalled intentionally to other species when the sender benefits. We examined these predictions in a scavenger guild comprising two generalist social corvids (ravens, Corvus corax; magpies, Pica hudsonia), four raptor species and coyotes, Canis latrans. We used game cameras to monitor scavenging at 89 mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus, carcasses in Oregon and Washington, U.S.A. Corvid appearance times explained variation in golden eagle, Aquila chrysaetos, bald eagle, Haliaeetus leucocephalus, hawk (Buteo jamaicensis and Buteo lagopus) and coyote arrivals, indicating that raptors and canids use corvids to locate food. Larger numbers of magpies, but not ravens, were associated with shorter raptor appearance times, providing partial support for the importance of group size in broadcasting information to heterospecifics. We also directly observed simulated carcasses composed of a deer hide and antler. Seventy one corvids and 13 raptors appeared among 16 treatments accompanied by raven decoys and playbacks, whereas only one corvid and no raptors appeared at paired controls. The time that ravens first flew in circles above a simulated carcass explained 98% of the variation in subsequent raptor arrival time, indicating that a specific raven behaviour provides a cue of carrion. After hide-cutting raptors opened a carcass, corvids benefited by switching from feeding at the eyes and the anus to feeding on flesh. However, raptors did not arrive sooner after corvids at closed carcasses than experimentally pre-opened carcasses, suggesting that corvids do not intentionally transmit more information to raptors when a carcass requires opening, at least under these conditions. A scavenging mutualism with corvids built on carrion discovery and access, but not intentional recruitment, may facilitate winter survival of raptors.

AB The origins of speech, the most complex form of animal communication, remain a puzzle. Human speech and nonhuman primate vocalizations have traditionally been viewed dichotomously, with several aspects of speech having no clear analogues in the calls of our primate relatives. The putative unique aspects of speech include a diverse array of learned sounds that are rapidly produced in rhythmic strings and continuously recombined in new sequences. However, recent research challenges the idea that these features are indeed unique to humans and suggests more continuity between nonhuman and human primates than was previously appreciated. Here we review recent findings in four areas of this emerging continuity. In light of these studies, we argue that the evolution of human speech abilities most likely originated in a primate ancestor capable of (1) producing a 'speech-ready' range of vowel-like sounds, (2) vocalizing with simultaneous rhythmic mouth movements, (3) combining long strings of varied and structured sounds and (4) exercising some volitional control over calls that were modified based on experience. Taken together, these results suggest that the considerable latent vocal ability that we observe in nonhuman primates is consistent with the hypothesis that a key step towards human speech was the evolution of greater cognitive control of the vocal apparatus (and not the evolution of speech-specific anatomical adaptations). By shifting research emphasis away from the mechanics of how speech is produced to the conditions that favoured more diverse, open-ended and imitative vocal systems, we hope to encourage new avenues for future comparative research.

AB To reduce the impact of biological invasions, we need to understand the behavioural mechanisms that enable some species to be successful invaders. Testing differences in behaviour between sympatric congeneric species with different invasive potential is an opportunity to study specific behavioural traits associated with invasion success. Using the invasive Italian wall lizard, Podarcis sicula, and a noninvasive congeneric, the green Iberian wall lizard, Podarcis virescens, which live in sympatry in a location that is novel for P. sicula, we tested their exploratory behaviour, neophobia and boldness: all traits that should promote invasion success. The invasive P. sicula was more exploratory, bold and neophilic than the sympatric native P. virescens. Native lizards had highly repeatable behaviour, whereas in P. sicula boldness was the only behavioural trait that was repeatable. The behavioural traits of the native species, but not the invasive species, were correlated. A lack of correlation between behavioural traits, as well as a lack of repeatability in two of the three behavioural traits, suggests higher levels of behavioural plasticity in P. sicula, which may also explain the success of this lizard during invasions. Our experiment highlights the potential importance of behavioural traits in invasions and provides insight into why P. sicula is such a successful invader.

TI Dismantling Babel: creation of a universal calibration for honey bee

AB Noisy animal communication presents a unique challenge for biologists interpreting a produced signal precisely and accurately. One past approach has been to reduce noise. Lately, with the advance of quantitative tools, an alternative is to use the noise to improve model predictions. Here we take the latter approach to improve our ability to recover honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) foraging locations, in particular the distance at which they forage, from observed waggle dance communications, which encode the vector from the hive to the forage. This vector gives both the distance from the hive to the forage, which is encoded in dance duration, and the direction from the hive to the forage, which is encoded in the angle that the bee makes while dancing. We analysed the waggle dances from individually marked honey bees (N= 859 dances from 85 bees from 3 hives) that foraged at multiple known locations to determine a distance-to-duration calibration. Next we compared this calibration to a previously published calibration, which demonstrated that while their slopes were similar (P = 0.82), their intercepts differed (P < 0.001); however, the individual variation, or noise, between bees was so high that this difference was rendered biologically irrelevant. We then collated our data with all published calibration studies to generate a universal calibration that incorporates the interindividual and interstudy differences. Lastly, we verified that the universal calibration performed as well as a landscape/subspecies-specific calibration, first with a hold-out sample of waggle dances (N = 84) (performance comparison: P = 0.36) and second with a linear discriminant analysis, which failed to assign dances to their originating population. Both results confirm that the universal calibration may be used, irrespective of landscape or subspecies. Therefore, by allowing noise to be part of our analysis, the usability of our calibration is broadened for use in future settings. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Network analysis has driven key developments in research on animal behaviour by providing quantitative methods to study the social structures of animal groups and populations. A recent formalism, known as multilayer network analysis, has advanced the study of multifaceted networked systems in many disciplines. It offers novel ways to study and quantify animal behaviour through connected 'layers' of interactions. In this article, we review common questions in animal behaviour that can be studied using a multilayer approach, and we link these questions to specific analyses. We outline the types of behavioural data and questions that may be suitable to study using multilayer network analysis. We detail several multilayer methods, which can provide new insights into questions about animal sociality at individual, group, population and evolutionary levels of organization. We give examples for how to implement multilayer methods to demonstrate how taking a multilayer approach can alter inferences about social structure and the positions of individuals within such a structure. Finally, we discuss caveats to undertaking multilayer network analysis in the study of animal social networks, and we call attention to methodological challenges for the application of these approaches. Our aim is to instigate the study of new questions about animal sociality using the new toolbox of multilayer network analysis. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In a food-limited system, parents may have to allocate resources in ways that do not benefit all their offspring equally. We investigated food allocation and parent and chick behaviours in Magellanic penguins at their colony in Punta Tombo, Argentina, by observing feedings in one- and two-chick broods after the chicks were more than 20 days of age. Feeds lasted 21 min on average, and the length of a feed was not correlated either with the number of chicks in a brood, or with the amount of food the parents gave. Parents with two-chick broods distributed food evenly to both chicks. Although single chicks were fed more than chicks with siblings, as a proportion of a chick's start weight, both single chicks and lighter chicks in two-chick broods received significantly more food than heavier chicks. Chicks continued begging after the last feed in nearly half of the two-chick broods, suggesting they were not sated and so are food-limited. In linear mixed-effects models that considered, respectively, the absolute amount of food a chick received and the amount of food it received as a proportion of its start weight, chick begging was the most significant predictor of how much it was fed. Jostling behaviours between the chicks did not correlate with the amount of food either one received. Parental nonfeeding behaviours in two-chick broods (e.g. bending towards a chick and opening the bill but not regurgitating food) were more frequently directed at the lighter chick, but did not correlate with the amount of food a chick received. These results suggest (1) parents are motived to feed their chicks quickly, (2) parents try to allocate food equally to chicks of this age and (3) chicks devote most of their energy trying to get fed by the parent, rather than competing antagonistically with one another.

AB Prey species defend themselves behaviourally and morphologically, and often use varied antipredator strategies against dissimilar predator types (i.e. terrestrial versus aerial). Striped skunks, Mephitis mephitis, spray noxious secretions at predators and advertise this danger with deterrent behaviours and black-and-white aposematic coloration. Evidence suggests skunks are effective at deterring terrestrial mammalian predators but are vulnerable to aerial predators; how skunks assess the risk posed by different predator types, however, has not been examined empirically. We recorded the behavioural responses of skunks to audio playbacks of coyotes, Canis latrans, and great horned owls, Bubo virginianus (the primary terrestrial and aerial predators of skunks, respectively), and peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, and white noise as controls. Skunks ran away more often from vocalizations of their main predators, great horned owls and coyotes, than from diurnal falcon vocalizations or white noise recordings. Skunks also tended to run away sooner in response to owl vocalizations than falcon or coyote vocalizations. Finally, subjects tended to engage in vigilance more frequently in response to owl vocalizations than in response to coyote vocalizations, which together with other results suggest that skunks may perceive owls as more threatening relative to coyotes. This study elucidates how a well-defended mammal can determine which perceived threat is the riskiest and alter its behaviour when its main defence strategy may not be successful against all predator types.

AB Animals are expected to optimize energy intake when choosing between different foraging options. A common explanation for deviations from optimal economic decisions is that there is an imperfect relationship between physical reality and an animal's perceptual processes, which can constrain assessment of profitability. One such phenomenon that is apparently ubiquitous across taxa is proportional processing, where a perceived change in a stimulus is proportional to the change in stimulus magnitude. In this study, we investigated whether proportional processing explains how frog-eating bats, Trachops cirrhosus, discriminate between patches of frog choruses that vary in their number of calling frogs. To test this, we created artificial choruses consisting of one to six calling frogs. In the flight cage, we then tested the preference of bats (N= 17) with every pairwise combination of chorus size. We found that while bats generally preferred larger choruses, preferences for larger choruses were better explained by the relative, not absolute, differences in chorus sizes. This indicates that T. cirrhosus is perceptually limited in its ability to discriminate between choruses of varying size as the choruses increase in size. Foragers are likely to be less choosy when choosing among larger patches. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Individuals should adjust investment in parental care in order to maximize current and future reproductive success. In cooperative breeders, where helpers assist with raising offspring, larger groups may allow for a reduction in investment (load lightening) of each individual. Additionally, the type of individual, and thus the social context, can play an important role in individual investment. Less attention has been paid to how provisioning rules vary across ecological contexts, although theory suggests that individuals can only afford to reduce their investment when nestling starvation is unlikely, thus under mild conditions. Here, we tested whether previously reported provisioning rules based on social context vary with ecological conditions, by experimental manipulation of signals of chick need, in the cooperatively breeding red-winged fairy-wren, Malurus elegans. Previous work in this species has shown that all group members load-lighten with additional male helpers, but not in response to the number of female helpers in the group (additive care). We show that experimental begging playback resulted in all individuals increasing their provisioning rates, indicating that our treatment was perceived as increased chick need. However, in contrast to our prediction that load lightening should only occur when individuals can afford to do so, signals of increased chick need did not stop individuals from reducing their investment with an increasing number of male helpers in the group. These results suggest that despite some flexibility in parental effort, individuals use strict rules with respect to group composition, suggesting that individual provisioning effort is based on multiple integrated cues, and responses to changes in the environment are highly context dependent.

AB Mammalian herbivores are known to be extremely selective when foraging, but little is known about the mechanisms governing the selection of patches and, at a finer scale, individual plants. Visual examination and direct sampling of the vegetation have previously been suggested, but olfactory cues have seldom been considered. We examined the use of olfactory cues by foraging African elephants, Loxodonta africana, and asked whether they use plant odours to select specific patches or plants when making feeding decisions. Scent-based choice experiments between various preferred and nonpreferred plants were conducted across two spatial scales (between plants and between patches). We used coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of headspace extracts of volatile organic compounds emitted by the different plant species to explore similarities among the overall odour profiles of each species. We found that elephants selected their preferred plant species across both spatial scales, probably using differences in plant odour profiles. The ability to differentiate between plant odours allowed elephants to reduce their search time by targeting preferred plant species both within a feeding station and between patches. This suggests that olfactory cues probably play an important role in driving herbivore foraging decisions across multiple spatial scales. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In this study, we aimed to evaluate how air temperature is related to variation in activity patterns and habitat selection by two species of tropical armadillos, which are imperfect homeotherms. Although their behaviour is little studied, armadillos provide valuable models for understanding how physiology affects mammalian behaviour in response to environmental changes. We used GPS devices to track yellow armadillos, Euphractus sexcinctus, and southern three-banded armadillos, Tolypeutes matacus, at three sites of the Pantanal wetlands, Brazil. We used linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the variation in the timing and duration of activity patterns according to changes in air temperature. We fitted step selection functions to evaluate the effects of cover type, diel cycle and air temperature on armadillo habitat selection. Our models suggest that E. sexcinctus activity during the daytime decreases as air temperature increases. In contrast, T. matacus shows less variation, maintaining a predominantly nocturnal activity pattern. However, as air temperature decreases, activity periods of T. matacus are of shorter duration and peak earlier in the day. Both species should select forested areas when experiencing air temperatures outside their thermoneutral zones, as these areas act as thermal shelters. This study provides specific examples of the dynamic nature of activity patterns and habitat selection, and illustrates how thermal constraints, which vary dynamically over the daily cycle and among days, can alter behaviour. Our results highlight the importance of habitat heterogeneity for the long-term conservation of animal species that rely on behaviour to achieve adequate thermoregulation.

AB Vertebrate alarm calls signal danger and often encode graded or categorical information about predator proximity or type. In addition to allowing communication with conspecifics, alarm calls are a valuable source of information for eavesdropping heterospecifics. However, although eavesdropping has been experimentally demonstrated in over 70 species, we know little about exactly what information eavesdroppers gain from heterospecific alarm calls. Here, we investigated whether Australian magpies, Cracticus tibicen, extract relevant information about the type of threat from functionally referential alarm calls given by noisy miners, Manorina melanocephala. Miner aerial alarm calls signal a predator in flight, whereas mobbing calls signal a terrestrial or perched predator. We therefore tested whether magpies gain information on the elevation of expected danger. We first confirmed, by measuring bill angles on video, that magpie head orientation changes appropriately with differences in the elevation of a conspicuous moving object. We then conducted a field experiment that measured magpie bill angle in response to playback of miner aerial and mobbing alarm calls. The maximum and mean bill angles were higher in response to aerial than to mobbing calls, suggesting that magpies use information from miner alarms to search visually at appropriate elevations for the specific type of danger. Magpies were also vigilant for longer after aerial alarm calls that followed mobbing calls, implying perception of an escalating threat level. Our work shows that individuals can gain information on the type or location of danger from heterospecific alarm calls, which is likely to increase the effectiveness of antipredator responses.

AB One outcome of the extensive work on the ways that birds and insects use visual landmarks to return to a rewarded location is that they use landmarks differently. But this conclusion may have been reached because the almost exclusive training and testing of birds in small laboratory environments may prevent birds from using the view-matching strategies seen in insects. To test how birds use landmarks in an open-field environment, we trained free-living hummingbirds to search for a reward near two experimental landmarks. When the angular size and panoramic position of the landmarks were kept consistent, the hummingbirds searched in the direction of the flower and matched either the retinal angle of the landmarks or the absolute distance of the flower during training, even when the actual size and distance between landmarks changed. These data are more similar to data from view-matching ants solving a similar problem than they are to data from birds trained to use landmarks in the laboratory. This suggests that hummingbirds may also use a remembered view to relocate a rewarded site. Regardless of whether hummingbirds use a remembered view for navigation or just to recognize landmarks, data on landmark use collected from birds tested in the laboratory may not fully reflect how birds return to locations in the wild.

AB In mammals, and especially primates, group size and social complexity are typically correlated. However, we have no general explanation why this is so. I suggest that the answer may lie in one of the costs of group living: mammalian reproductive endocrinology is extremely sensitive to stress, and forms one of the hidden costs of living in groups. Fertility declines with group size widely across the social mammals, including primates, and will ultimately place a constraint on group size. However, some species seem to have been able to mitigate this cost by forming bonded relationships that reduce the impact of experienced aggression, even if rates of aggression remain high. The downside is that they reduce network connectivity and hence risk fragmenting the group by providing fracture lines for group fission. To explore this, I compare network indices and fertility patterns across the same range of group sizes for two species of Old World monkeys, Colobus guereza and Theropithecus gelada: the former relatively unsocial, the latter intensely social with frequent use of grooming-based alliances. Compared to those of the guereza, gelada social networks lose density more slowly, maintain connectedness more effectively and are less likely to fragment as they increase in size. Although fertility declines with group size in both species, in gelada the impact of this effect is deferred to larger group sizes. The differences in fertility and network structure both predict the very different maximum group sizes typical of these two species, as well as the typical sizes at which their groups undergo fission. This finding may explain aspects of wider mammalian sociality. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In species with female polygamy, pair bonds are frequently established since mate guarding can determine male fertilization success. However, extending the duration of pair bonds also implies reducing the chances of finding new mates. Males face a trade-off between mate guarding and looking for new mates, which can be shaped by their body condition. Here, we investigated the effect of male body condition and mate guarding over the female mating system (genetic monogamy or polygamy) and the male fertilization success in the common quail, Coturnix coturnix, a species with sperm storage and thus the potential for postcopulatory selection, and without paternal care. We monitored 20 females and 32 males. We genotyped them, the 21 clutches laid by these females and a large proportion of the males present in the population, which could have sired the clutches, to perform paternity analyses. We tested whether it is the pairing order or the duration of the pair bond that determines the fertilization outcome in clutches with multiple fathers. We hypothesized that males with better body condition might be able to find a mate faster, reducing the cost of mate switching and increasing fertilization success by spending less time in a pair bond. We observed socially monogamous and polygamous females, and our genetic analyses revealed that broods could be sired by one and by multiple fathers. Female genetic polygamy was more frequent when first matings were with males in good body condition. We detected two or three different fathers in multiple paternity broods. The male that mate guarded for longest was the one that sired most of the clutch. Although males in better body condition seemed to establish shorter pair bonds, further data are needed to confirm this trend. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Chimpanzees' natural propensity to explore and play with objects is likely to be an important precursor of tool use. Manipulating objects provides individuals with pivotal perceptual-motor experience when interacting with the material world, which may then pave the way for subsequent tool use. In this study, we were interested in the influence of social models on the developmental patterns of object manipulation in young chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, of the Sonso community of Budongo Forest, Uganda. This community is interesting because of its limited tool repertoire, with no records of stick-based foraging in over 20 years of continuous observations. Using cross-sectional data, we found evidence for social learning in that young individuals preferentially played with and explored materials manipulated by their mothers. We also found that object manipulation rates decreased with age, whereas the goal directedness of these manipulations increased. Specifically, stick manipulations gradually decreased with age, which culminated in complete disregard of sticks around the age of 10 years, a pattern not found for other tool materials, which were all used throughout adulthood. Overall, young chimpanzees initially explored and played unselectively with any object found in the environment before becoming increasingly influenced by their mothers' goal-directed object manipulations.

AB Animals are commonly exposed to multiple environmental stimuli, but whether, and under which circumstances, they can attend to multiple stimuli in multitask learning challenges is elusive. Here, we assessed whether simultaneously occurring chemosensory stimuli interfere with each other in a dual-task learning challenge. We exposed predatory mites Neoseiulus californicus early in life to either only conspecifics (kin) or simultaneously conspecifics (kin) and food (thrips or pollen), to determine whether presence of food interferes with social familiarization and, vice versa, whether presence of conspecifics interferes with learning the cues of thrips. We found that N. californicus can become familiar with kin early in life and use kin recognition later in life to avoid kin cannibalism. However, when the juvenile predators were challenged by multiple stimuli associated with two different learning tasks, that is, when they grew up with conspecifics in the presence of food, they were no longer capable of social familiarization. In contrast, the presence of conspecifics did not compromise the predators' ability to learn the cues of thrips. Memory of experience with thrips allowed shorter attack latencies on thrips and increased oviposition by adult N. californicus. Proximately, the stimuli for learning the features of thrips were apparently more salient than those for learning to recognize kin. We argue that, ultimately, learning the cues of thrips at the expense of impeded social familiarization pays off because of negligible cannibalism risk in the presence of abundant food. Our study suggests that stimulus-driven prioritization of learning tasks is in line with the predictions of selective and limited attention theories, and provides a key example of interference in dual-task learning by an arthropod.

AB Dispersal is a key life history trait impacting ecological and evolutionary processes. Yet, the fitness consequences of dispersal remain poorly investigated. Using a displacement experiment of 616 individuals in a patchy population of collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, we investigated behavioural responses to forced movement in terms of settlement, subsequent breeding performance and return rate. Newly arrived birds were caught and displaced between patches or released back in the patch of capture. We analysed (1) the probability of successful settlement within the study area, (2) for displaced birds, the probability of accepting the forced movement rather than returning to the patch of capture, (3) components of reproductive performance and (4) return rate in subsequent years according to experimental treatment. The probability of settling within the study area tended to be lower for displaced than control birds and was lower for immigrants than local birds. This suggests that displacement induced long-distance dispersal movements or nonbreeding, which could reflect costs of unfamiliarity with the environment. Nondispersers (individuals caught early in the breeding season in the same patch as their previous one) were more likely to return to their patch of capture, probably because of higher benefits of familiarity. Once individuals had settled, their breeding performance did not vary markedly between treatments, although displaced individuals that did not return to their patch of capture raised lighter young than other individuals. This could indicate a lower phenotypic quality of these individuals or, again, a cost of breeding in an unfamiliar environment. Finally, individuals that settled (and non-dispersers) were more likely to return to the study area in subsequent years than individuals that disappeared (and immigrants/dispersers, respectively). Together, these results suggest that, in addition to the costs of transience, dispersal (here forced) may entail costs linked to settlement in an unfamiliar habitat.

AB 'Hilltopping' is a common mate-locating behaviour exhibited by numerous insect taxa; individuals aggregate on summits, ridges and other topographic features, and thereby increase their likelihood of mating. Recently, hilltopping has gained interest as a model system to study nonrandom dispersal. We tested four predictions from the hilltopping literature regarding individual movement behaviour and the resulting spatial distribution of summit aggregations. Through observations and capture-mark -recapture studies using the day-flying tiger moth, Arctia (formerly Platyprepia) virginalis, we found evidence for all predictions. The highest densities of moths were associated with a few, high-elevation summits and were recaptured over multiple days. No individuals were found to move between summit aggregations and mated females had shorter residency times than males. We discuss our results in the context of the predictions, the behaviour of other hilltopping species, implications for population structure and spatial population dynamics.

AB Through domestication, dogs have developed a robust ability to form interspecific bonds with humans. Recent work comparing dogs and wolves suggests that eye contact is an important behaviour underlying these social bonds; however, it remains unclear how this feature of interspecific social bonding evolved. We explored eye contact in a unique comparison species that represents an intermediate point in canid domestication: the Australian dingo (Canis dingo). Across two different studies with two different human handlers, we examined dingo-initiated eye contact using a method similar to one previously used with dogs and wolves. In contrast to wolves tested previously, dingoes initiated eye contact with a human, but did so for a shorter time than dogs. Given that dingoes share only an early domestication history with dogs, our results suggest that the motivation to initiate eye contact with humans may have evolved relatively early in domestication. However, the tendency to maintain prolonged eye contact with a familiar human may have evolved later. These results shed new light on the evolutionary steps by which humans and dogs developed their unique social bond. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB There is a growing interest in identifying specific causes and consequences of variation in individual social behaviour as a means of understanding how different individuals balance the costs and benefits of group living. In this study, we used social networks to examine variation in individual social behaviour in wild Grant's gazelles, Nanger granti, and explored potential drivers and consequences of this variation. First, we quantified two aspects of individual network position (weighted degree and closeness) on a monthly basis for 12 consecutive months and examined life-history (age) and abiotic (rainfall) factors that could explain among-individual variation in network position. Next, we examined the level of within-individual repeatability in network position over time. We then tested for potential consequences of this variation focusing on parasite infection and diet quality. Rainfall and age were strong predictors of variation in closeness but not degree. Interestingly, we found that one aspect of individual network position (closeness) varied over time, while another (degree) was moderately repeatable. The difference in within-individual repeatability of the two measures may be explained by the dependence of closeness on rainfall. In addition, we found that individual network position had consequences for both parasitism and diet, but the magnitude and direction of these effects depended on parasite type, connectivity measure and environmental conditions. Overall, our results suggest that environmental and host factors strongly influence variability in certain aspects of social connectivity in Grant's gazelles, and that abiotic and biotic forces, together, mediate the consequences of social network position.

AB All animals sleep and it is essential for maintaining optimal brain function. However, cetaceans engage in the unusual practice of unihemispherical sleep, where only half of their brain sleeps at a time, due to their constant need for movement and breathing. Most studies of sleep in cetaceans have occurred in captivity. However, tagging devices have now developed to the point where the data collected from wild animals can be assessed against published criteria for defining sleep behaviourally. Seven acoustic and behavioural data loggers were deployed on harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, in Danish waters between May 2010 and August 2011 and stayed on the animals between 53 and 72 h, recording 1884 to 2755 valid dives per animal. Parabolic dives with significantly reduced bioacoustic activity and a stereotyped behavioural pattern were identified as potential sleeping periods. The recordings for nearly half of the parabolic dives were found to contain no vocalization (echolocation clicks), significantly more than other dive types. Of the remaining parabolic dives, the click rate was, when normalized to their individual means, also significantly lower than detected in other dive types. Additionally, parabolic dives were shallow compared to all other dive types, and found to have a stereotypic low-energy profile. They were also found to contain fewer rolls and incorporate a lower vertical descent rate than most other dive types. If the data are representative, harbour porpoises spend a small, but meaningful amount of their diving time engaged in parabolic dives and thus potentially sleeping. All animals have a fundamental need for undisturbed sleep. These quiet periods thus need to be considered in studies of anthropogenic effects, but also those employing passive acoustic monitoring techniques, as well as in efforts to reduce incidental bycatch in fisheries, given the associated periods of reduced environmental awareness.

AB Division of reproductive behaviour and alloparental care are key aspects of many animal societies. In cooperatively breeding species, variation in helping effort and unequal task participation are frequently observed. However, the extent to which the reproductive state of an individual affects the tasks performed during offspring care remains poorly understood. In the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola, approximately 40% of females reproduce, and mothers show extended maternal care including eggsac tending, regurgitation feeding and matriphagy, in which they are consumed by the offspring. We asked whether and to what extent virgin females participate in extreme maternal care and whether they differ from reproducing females in foraging activity. We show that virgin females contributed to all aspects of extended brood care, including regurgitation feeding and matriphagy. This suggests a physiological adaptation in virgin females to cooperative breeding, since in the subsocial Stegodyphus lineatus only mated females provide extended maternal care. Although virgin females and mothers are behaviourally totipotent, we found evidence for task differentiation as virgins engaged less in brood care and more in prey attack than mothers. High relatedness among nestmates and low probability of future reproduction in virgin helpers suggest alignment of reproductive interests between mothers and allomothers. Therefore, extreme allomaternal care by virgin helpers can be considered an adaptation to cooperative breeding in social spiders. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural syndromes (i.e. population-level behavioural correlations) arise when individuals, on average, maintain the same behavioural expression across different ecological contexts. Population-level syndromes can appear maladaptive, such as when prey remain active across the absence and presence of a sit-and-wait predator. Yet in nature, individuals often vary in syndrome adherence, exhibiting individual-level differences in behavioural plasticity. Here, I use an experiment to show that individual behavioural plasticity (a reduction in activity level in the presence of predation threat) increases a prey's likelihood of surviving predator exposure, and further predicts survival better than single-context activity level measures. In an additional experiment, I identify conditioning (nonlethal predator exposure) as a process that reduces prey activity level. This work demonstrates that although population-level behavioural syndromes can appear maladaptive, behavioural plasticity and conditioning could potentially ameliorate negative effects at the individual level.

AB In long-lived species, care-giving parents are expected to balance their own condition with that of their offspring. Many species of seabirds display a unique behavioural adaptation for managing these conflicting demands known as dual foraging, in which long trips, largely for self-maintenance, are alternated with short trips, which are primarily for offspring care. While dual foraging is a widely studied behaviour, it entails a complication that is seldom discussed: if parents independently employ a dual-foraging strategy, chicks might be abandoned for extended periods when the long trips of both partners coincide. Whether partners coordinate their dual-foraging strategies, however, is largely unknown. To investigate this possibility, we used radiofrequency identification readers coupled with passive integrated transponder tags to record extended sequences of foraging trips for breeding Manx shearwaters, Puffinus puffinus. Our results show a pattern of foraging trips that indicates a high level of coordination between parents, which facilitates consistent provisioning. Additionally, we show that the propensity for pairs to coordinate declines across the chick-rearing period. Given the potential costs of not coordinating, we expect this behaviour to be widely spread among dual-foraging species. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social complexity has been invoked as a driving force shaping communicative and cognitive abilities, and brain evolution more generally. Despite progress in the conceptual understanding of societal structures, there is still a dearth of quantitative measures to capture social complexity. Here we offer a method to quantify social complexity in terms of the diversity of differentiated relationships. We illustrate our approach using data collected from Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, at 'La Foret des Singes' in Rocamadour, France, as well as simulated data sets for a proof-of-concept. Based on affiliative and agonistic behavioural categories, we calculated four indices that characterize social relationships (diversity of behavioural patterns, dyadic composite sociality index, relative interaction frequency and tenor). Using cluster analyses, we identified four different relationship types: rarely interacting agonistic dyads, rarely interacting affiliative dyads, moderately frequently interacting ambivalent dyads and frequently interacting affiliative dyads. We then calculated for each individual a derived diversity score that integrates information about the number and diversity of relationships each subject maintained. At the individual level, one may be interested to identify predictors of this individual diversity score, such as age, rank or sex. At the group level, variation in the relative shares of affiliative and agonistic interactions affects the distribution of individual diversity scores more than the interaction frequency, while the omission of ambivalent relationships (i.e. a discontinuous variation in the share of affiliative or agonistic relationships) leads to greater variation in diversity scores. The number of realized relationships had only a moderate effect. Overall, this method appears to be suited to capture social complexity in terms of the diversity of relationships at the individual and group level. We suggest that this approach is applicable across different species and facilitates quantitative tests of putative drivers in brain evolution.

AB Dynamic physiological colour change allows animals to alter colours and patterns for communication, camouflage and thermoregulation. Using reflectance spectrometry and digital photography, we found that males of the Indian rock agama, Psammophilus dorsalis, can rapidly express intense colours that are different from the neutral state and specific to the social context. The distinct bands on males shifted between yellow and red (dorsal) and between orange and black (lateral) within seconds, and the resulting colour pattern was diametrically different depending on whether males were in courtship or aggressive interactions. Although males showed higher chromatic contrast when courting females, the colour change was faster during competitive encounters with other males. The nature of this social colour communication also differed across populations in anthropogenically disturbed landscapes. Compared to males from rural areas, suburban males were slower to change colour and showed duller and paler colours during staged social encounters. Consistent with other disturbance-induced shifts in phenotypic traits seen in numerous taxa, we provide the first evidence that social signalling through dynamic colour change in terrestrial vertebrates is also affected by urbanization.

AB To explain reciprocity, direct or indirect, several proximate mechanisms have been proposed, yet little attention has been given to the specific underlying cognitive mechanisms. Regardless of what proximate rules underlie reciprocity, some kind of memory would be paramount. Corvids in general, and ravens, Corvus corax, specifically, have been shown to possess an array of sophisticated cognitive mechanisms involved in memory. In this study, we tested the memory of nine ravens in an exchange paradigm where they could exchange a low-quality for a high-quality food item. Specifically, we tested whether they remembered who was a reliable 'fair' experimenter and who would not reliably exchange (the 'unfair' experimenter), and whether they would subsequently choose to interact with the former when given the choice. In addition, we tested whether ravens that observed the initial seeding of information about who was 'fair' or 'unfair' could transform bystander information into first-person interactions, i.e. also preferring to interact with the 'fair' experimenter when given the choice. The results show that ravens with first-hand experience were more likely to interact with experimenters with whom they had had a positive previous experience, and that this memory lasted at least 1 month. In contrast, observers did not distinguish between the experimenters when given the choice to interact with them. Previous first-hand experience with the paradigm, however, seemed to help observers to be more successful in solving the task, albeit not significantly above chance. In sum, this study shows memory for direct reciprocity in ravens, and tentatively suggests memory for indirect reciprocity. Accordingly, these results provide hints for the underlying mechanism of memory in raven social interactions. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Robust evidence shows that voice quality affects various social interactions, including mate preferences. Previous research found that male voices perceived as attractive are characterized by low voice pitch, lower or sexually typical formants and relatively high breathiness. These features tend to be seen as markers of an individual's quality as a potential mate. Although there are considerable differences between languages in vocal parameters that could influence the perceived attractiveness, the above-mentioned findings rely on research based mainly on participants from European or North American countries. In our study, we therefore tested the main acoustic predictors of vocal attractiveness using two male samples from Cameroon and Namibia. Standardized vocal recordings were then assessed for vocal attractiveness by a panel of female raters from the Czech Republic. Our results show that in the Cameroonian voices, fundamental frequency was strongly negatively associated with perceived vocal attractiveness. In the Namibian sample, however, it was not the fundamental frequency but lower mean formants and harmonics-to-noise ratio that were negatively associated with vocal attractiveness. This pattern may be partly attributed to differences in morphological characteristics such as the body mass index, indicating variation across individual populations.

AB In many social insect species, pheromones coordinate defining features of social life. Queen-produced pheromones mediate many of these processes, and thus there is substantial interest in understanding both the mechanisms by which queen pheromones organize behaviour and how these chemical communication systems evolved. It is hypothesized that queen social pheromones evolved from sex pheromones found in their solitary ancestors. Here we begin to test this theory in the honeybee, where the queen-produced pheromone 9-ODA (9-oxo-2-decenoic acid) serves as both a social pheromone (priming physiological processes mediating worker behavioural maturation) and sex pheromone (attracting males during mating flights). While we expected the primer effects of 9-ODA on workers to represent a derived worker-specific function, we surprisingly found similar effects in drones. Exposure to 9-ODA resulted in a significant increase in expression levels of vitellogenin in drones. Since previous studies in workers found that vitellogenin levels regulate behavioural maturation, we investigated 9-ODA's effects on sexual maturation in drones. Drones exposed to 9-ODA initiated mating flights later and took fewer flights than control drones. Our results demonstrate that honeybee queen pheromone has primer effects on drone bees, and thus chemical communication systems involving honeybee drones are more complex than previously appreciated.

AB Vocal production can be a two-way channel for the exchange of information between males and females during courtship. Although the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of male house mice, Mus musculus, during interactions with females have been a focus of communication research, the vocalizations of females in this context remain poorly understood. During interactions with males, female mice produce audible vocalizations with a broadband harmonic structure ('broadband vocalizations', or BBVs) that are often described by human listeners as 'squeaks'. We tested the hypothesis that the production of BBVs corresponds to male and female behaviours, as well as to contextual variables like oestrous phase, by measuring BBVs, USVs and nonvocal behaviours during 39 unique male-female pairings. We found that the relationship of BBVs to other behaviours depends on the phase of courtship. A high incidence of BBVs accompanied by male-directed kicks and lunges early in interactions predicted a lack of later male mounting and male-produced '50 kHz harmonic' USVs. In contrast, there was significant temporal overlap between BBVs and 50 kHz harmonic USVs at later stages of courtship, potentially driven by mounting events. The duration of acoustically nonlinear segments of BBVs varied significantly among females, even across interactions with different males, but also varied across oestrous phase within females. These findings suggest that vocalizations could play a role in signalling acute female motivational state, identity or oestrous state during opposite-sex interactions. Since the information-bearing features of BBVs are relatively easily measured, they are potentially a useful readout of negative motivational state suitable for many research and educational applications.

AB Studies of vocal development in the white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys, and other songbirds led to Peter Marler's formulation of the auditory template hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, young songbirds possess an auditory template system that serves three functions in song learning: to focus attention on appropriate song models during the sensitive period, to facilitate memorization of these models, and later, to guide motor development of song during the sensorimotor phase. Marler postulated two types of innate templates: latent templates that require activation by external input, and preactive templates that do not. Here, I review experiments that examined the specifications of these templates in the white-crowned sparrow and suggest that this system also serves a fourth function, acting to shape the final repertoire at the end of song development. I then discuss the template system in a comparative context, first reviewing the influence of results from several species on the derivation of the auditory template hypothesis and then describing variation in several aspects of auditory templates across species. Finally, I address ways in which the template model can continue to be informative in the comparative study of song learning. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Inbreeding occurs when relatives mate with each other, and it often has detrimental effects for the fitness of any resulting offspring. It is an important issue in ecology and evolutionary biology with profound implications for genetic variation and the evolution of mating systems and reproductive strategies. For example, inbreeding may shape mate choice through the avoidance of outbred, related individuals to prevent inbreeding, or through the avoidance of inbred, unrelated individuals that have been produced through inbreeding. Although the former has been studied extensively, little is known about mating preferences based on the inbreeding status of potential partners. It is also unclear whether these mating preferences are influenced by the inbreeding status of the choosing sex. Here, we examined female mating preferences for outbred versus inbred males using dichotomous choice tests in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We found that these mating preferences were conditional upon the female's own inbreeding status: inbred females preferentially mated with outbred males, whereas outbred females did not show such a preference. Our findings suggest that inbred males suffer reduced mating success only when interacting with inbred females. In species where this is the case, the fitness costs of inbreeding with respect to male mating success will therefore depend on the frequency of inbred females relative to outbred females, which depends on the rate of inbreeding in the population.

AB Neophobia, or the fear of novelty, may offer benefits to animals by limiting their exposure to unknown danger, but can also impose costs by preventing the exploration of potential resources. The costs and benefits of neophobia may vary throughout the year if predation pressure, resource distribution or conspecific competition changes seasonally. Despite such variation, neophobia levels are often assumed to be temporally and individually stable. Whether or not neophobia expression changes seasonally and fluctuates equally for all individuals is crucial to understanding the drivers, consequences and plasticity of novelty avoidance. We investigated seasonal differences and individual consistency in the motivation and novelty responses of a captive group of rooks, Corvus frugilegus, a seasonally breeding, colonial species of corvid that is known for being neophobic. We tested the group around novel objects and novel people to determine whether responses generalized across novelty types, and considered whether differences in dominance could influence the social risk of approaching unknown stimuli. We found that the group's level of object neophobia was stable year-round, but individuals were not consistent between seasons, despite being consistent within seasons. In contrast, the group's avoidance of novel people decreased during the breeding season, and individuals were consistent year-round. Additionally, although subordinate birds were more likely to challenge dominants during the breeding season, this social risk taking did not translate to greater novelty approach. Since seasonal variation and individual consistency varied differently towards each novelty type, responses towards novel objects and people seem to be governed by different mechanisms. Such a degree of fluctuation has consequences for other individually consistent behaviours often measured within the nonhuman personality literature. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

AB Pollinators frequently use complex motor routines to find and extract floral rewards. Studies of pollinators foraging for nectar rewards indicate these routines are typically learned, and that constraints associated with learning and memory give pollinators incentive to continue foraging on these flowers. However, plants offer rewards besides nectar, including pollen, lipids and essential oils. In particular, bees use a complex motor routine termed floral sonication to extract pollen, their primary source of protein, from the more than 6% of flowering plant species (>22000 species) that conceal pollen rewards within tube-like poricidal anthers. If floral sonication requires learning, this pollen extraction behaviour could contribute to floral fidelity. However, no studies have quantified the effect of experience on flower handling for bees extracting pollen from poricidal species. We therefore examined the degree to which floral sonication behaviour was modified by experience. We found that the key elements of the sonication motor routine appeared in full-blown form in a flower-naive bee's first visit to a flower. We additionally found consistent, albeit modest, effects of experience on certain aspects of sonication behaviour. The latency to sonicate slightly decreased with experience. Bees also adjusted the length and amplitude of their sonication buzzes in response to pollen receipt. We conclude that the role of experience in foraging for concealed pollen rewards is different from that reported for nectar rewards. We offer an alternative explanation for its function in sonication. Finally, we discuss alternative hypotheses for the function of poricidal anthers and for how pollen-bearing plants may ensure floral fidelity even in the absence of a significant impact of experience on pollen extraction behaviour.

AB The production of edible rainforest fruits is characterized by fluctuating and seasonal patterns that require frugivores to flexibly adjust their ranging behaviour. We investigated whether significant changes in a forager's travel direction can inform us about the importance of the nutritional and energetic aspects of different food sources for a wild animal's diet. We recorded the ranging patterns of five adult female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, for a total of 275 full days in the TaI National Park in Cote d'Ivoire and designed two models that predicted their directional changes at, and on the way to, fruit -bearing feeding trees. In both models, directional change was significantly influenced by the density of the feeding tree species and the crude fat content of that species' fruit. Female chimpanzees were more likely to change their travel direction for rarer trees, at which they fed on fruits that contained higher amounts of fat. In addition, directional changes tended to be positively influenced by the content of nonstructural ('easy energy') and structural carbohydrates (NDF) in that species' fruit. We did not detect any effect of sensory cues or social factors on the directional changes, in either model. The amount of fruit available and the time since the start of the fruiting season positively influenced directional change in the second model, which suggests that chimpanzees were updating their knowledge of the fruit availability in individual trees over time. Our results indicate that the nutrient content of fruit and its abundance exerted a significant impact on the shape of chimpanzee female travel paths, which opens up a new avenue for investigation of food preferences in wild animals through analyses of their ranging patterns.

AB We addressed the role of nocturnal singing in the diurnal field sparrow, Spizella pusilla. We were particularly interested in whether nocturnal song is used to repel intruders (intrasexual function) and/or to attract females seeking extrapair copulations (intersexual function). First, we used autonomous acoustic recording units (ARUs) and an automated detection and classification system to examine the associations of singing behaviour of mated field sparrows with social factors (fertility stage, presence of neighbour song and presence of intruder song). Second, using an automated radiotelemetry system (ARTS), autonomous acoustic recording units (ARUs) and automated playback systems, we conducted a nocturnal playback experiment to explore how mated male and female field sparrows respond to nocturnal songs at night and across prefertile, fertile and postfertile stages. We found that neighbours and intruder males tended to sing complex songs on the same nights when focal males sang. While not all focal males sang at night, all male birds (resident males, neighbours and intruders) that sang tended to sing according to the fertility periods of the resident male's female. Our playback experiment demonstrated that, although field sparrows usually slept and were inactive at night, they moved in response to nocturnal field sparrow songs more than to control stimuli (other species vocalizations). Interestingly, we found that males did not respond by singing or countersinging to field sparrow nocturnal songs (simulated intrusions). We also demonstrated that male activity responses were similar during the prefertile and postfertile stages, while females responded more during the prefertile and fertile stages than during the postfertile stage. Consequently, the nocturnal song in the field sparrow appears to play a role in extrapair mate attraction (intersexual function) more than in repelling intruders (intrasexual function). While nocturnal singing is an infrequent behaviour of most diurnal birds, it may be important in the mating system of these birds. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Migrating animals typically make stopovers to rest and replenish the fuel used during previous travel bouts. In birds, fat or fast refuelling individuals are generally more likely to depart from stopover than lean or slow refuelling birds. The departure decision, however, involves more than the day-to-day departure likelihood. Also, the time of night (or day) at which migrants depart is relevant, as this largely determines the duration of the flight bout and thereby affects the speed of migration. Because stopovers serve to replenish fuel stores, longitudinal data are most informative regarding the relationship between fuel stores and nocturnal departure time, but no such data exist. To fill parts of this gap, we caught and temporarily caged migrating northern wheatears, Oenanthe oenanthe, at a spring stopover site. We related the birds' evening fuel stores to their start of nocturnal migratory restlessness. In northern wheatears, this is a reliable proxy for their actual departure time under free-flying conditions. We observed a strong negative within-individual effect of fuel stores on the start of migratory restlessness. With an increase in fuel stores birds advanced their start of restlessness. This clearly shows that evening fuel stores are important for migrants' timing of departure at night. Hence, next to the regulation by innate rhythms, the timing of nocturnal departures during spring migration also depends on cues from fuel stores.

AB Predators have evolved many different ways to detect hidden prey by using advanced sensory organs. However, in some environmental contexts sensory information may be obscured. The relation between sensory organs, obstruction and searching efficiency remains little explored. In this study we experimentally examined the ways in which a sensory system ('remote detection'), which enables red knots, Calidris canutus, to detect hard objects buried in wet soft sediments, is obstructed by plants. At an important coastal nonbreeding site of this species, the Banc d'Arguin (Mauritania, West Africa), most of the intertidal foraging area is covered by sea grass. The structurally complex networks of belowground roots and rhizomes and aboveground sea grass may obstruct information on the presence of buried bivalves and thus affect searching efficiency. Under aviary conditions we offered red knots buried bivalves in either bare soft sediments or in sea grass patches and measured prey encounter rates. Red knots detected prey by direct touch in sea grass but remotely in bare sediment. Physical modelling of the pressure field build-up around a probing bill showed that within a layer of sea grass rhizomes, permeability is reduced to the extent that the pressure field no longer reveals the presence of an object. In bare sediment, where searching efficiency is constant, red knot intake rate levelled off with increasing prey density (described by a so-called type II functional response). In the sea grass beds, however, prey density increases with sea grass density and simultaneously decreases searching efficiency, which will at some point lead to a decrease in intake rate when prey densities increase (i.e. a type IV functional response). Clearly, prey detection mechanisms dictate that the combined effects of prey density and habitat complexity should be taken into account when predicting forager distributions and habitat preference.

AB The differential allocation hypothesis (DAH) predicts that an individual should vary its reproductive investment according to the attractiveness of its mate. A recently revised version of the DAH makes explicit that investment can be positive, i.e. higher for the offspring of attractive males which should be of higher quality, or negative, i.e. higher for offspring of unattractive males, for example compensating for inheriting poor paternal genes. Moreover, investment can be made by the father and the mother. Here, we tested whether experimental manipulation of male attractiveness affected parental investment at different reproductive stages and thus influenced fitness-related traits in offspring. In two aviaries, all male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were given red leg rings to increase attractiveness and in two aviaries all males received green leg rings to decrease attractiveness. This controlled for assortative mating between treatments. Ring colour was merely an experimental manipulation of male attractiveness, not paternal quality, so we might expect additional investment to elevate offspring quality. Eggs were cross-fostered between and within treatments to allow differentiation of effects of investment in eggs and nestlings. Clutch and brood sizes were standardized. Both positive and negative investment were observed: Eggs from red-ringed fathers had higher yolk to albumen ratios than eggs from green-ringed fathers. Nestlings from eggs laid and incubated by parents in the red-ringed group had higher hatching masses than those in the green-ringed group. Both parents in the green-ringed group fed nestlings more frequently than red-ringed parents. Offspring performance was influenced by the treatment of both foster and biological parents, but combined effects of these different investment patterns on fitness-related traits were ambiguous. Male attractiveness appeared to affect patterns of reproductive investment but not consistently across all forms of reproductive investment suggesting that the costs and benefits of differential allocation vary among individuals and across contexts.

AB Colourful male ornaments such as the bright plumage of birds or flashy wing patterns of butterflies serve to highlight the fitness of the bearer and are subject to sexual selection via female mate choice and/or direct male-male competition. Males of many species have markings that reflect ultraviolet (UV: wavelengths 280-400 nm). Recently, studies have focused on the role of either UVA (315-400 nm) or UVB reflectance (280-315 nm) in intraspecific communication, but the specific importance of UVA and UVB colours in sexual signalling remains unexplored. Here, we address this using Cosmophasis umbratica, a sexually dimorphic jumping spider species (Salticidae) in which males possess both UVA and UVB reflective patches. By conducting a series of female mate choice and male-male interaction trials with manipulated UVA and UVB coloration of males, we provide the first evidence that both UV components are prerequisites for intraspecific communication. Furthermore, UVA but not UVB is specifically used by both sexes for sex recognition, as shown by distinct, unexpected changes in behaviour by spiders encountering conspecifics with UVA removed. Our study revealed the adaptive significance of the presence of dual UV peaks in male ornamentation. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Prey exposed to unknown species have the ability to label them as predatory if they are closely related to a predator already known to the prey. This phenomenon is coined generalization of predator recognition. While increasing the threat level of the known predator widens the generalization window (i.e. prey respond to species that are more distantly related), nothing is known about whether or not certainty associated with the identity of the known predator affects the generalization window. Here, we compared the generalization of tadpoles that were conditioned once (low certainty) or five times (high certainty) to recognize the odour of a rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and subsequently tested them for their response to rainbow trout, brown trout, Salmo trutta (closely related), brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis (more distantly related) or goldfish, Carassius auratus. We found that the window shifted in two opposite ways, with high-certainty tadpoles responding more to brown trout but less to brook trout, when compared to their low-certainty counterparts. Our results highlight the nonlinear nature of stimuli generalization. We discuss potential mechanisms for our results and provide directions for future research aimed at understanding the role of uncertainty in antipredator decision making.

AB Social-rearing environment has profound effects on behaviour, physiology and development. A complex social environment enhances an individual's social skills and competence in many animal taxa. Consequently, complete social deprivation seriously impairs various aspects of behaviour, development, brain function and hormone levels. Although sexual selection is a major evolutionary force, studies investigating the effects of social environment on the development of reproductive behaviour are scarce. Thus, we aimed to examine how long-term social deprivation influenced sexual behaviour in both sexes of Pelvicachromis taeniatus, a biparental cichlid fish with mutual mate choice. In particular, we focused on intersexual behaviour, i.e. courtship and intrasexual aggression of fish reared and maintained either in a group or in isolation. We found significant differences between socially deprived and group-reared fish. Males and females reared in isolation were less likely to perform courtship behaviour and showed less interest towards potential mates than group-reared fish. Intrasexual aggression of isolated fish was reduced as well in both sexes. Furthermore, in males we found positive behavioural correlations between inter-and intrasexual behaviour at the individual level independent from the social-rearing environment. In females, this correlation was only found in group-reared fish, indicating an effect of social environment on behavioural correlations. Consequently, our results suggest that long-term social isolation seriously impairs social competence of P. taeniatus in sexual selection. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Pheromones, arguably the most ubiquitous mode of animal communication, are determined by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent evidence suggests that diet may be an important determinant of pheromone variation, which may both enhance and reduce the reliability of the chemical signal. We investigated experimentally the impact of population origin and diet on chemical signals used in mate assessment by monogynous males of the golden-banded orb web spider, Argiope trifasciata. Initial mate preference experiments revealed environmentally determined fine scaling of male mate choice: shortly after their introduction into the laboratory, male spiders preferred females from either their own or a nearby population rather than females from a distant population, suggesting that male choice is driven by phenotype matching, ensuring correct species identity. However, when diet was controlled, males preferred females originating from a distant rather than the same population, allowing males to choose a mate with the most potential genetic benefits. A second set of experiments clearly demonstrated that diet affected the chemical compounds on the surface of the silk threads produced by females, and that males preferred females that had experienced a similar diet. We suggest that phenotype matching strongly influences broad-scale male mating preferences, but it remains to be seen how a combination of genetic and environmental (e.g. dietary) factors influence the relative abundance of these, and perhaps other, mate choice-relevant, silk-bound chemical cues.

AB Understanding the properties of a social environment is important for understanding the dynamics of social relationships. Understanding such dynamics is relevant for multiple fields, ranging from animal behaviour to social and cognitive neuroscience. To quantify social environment properties, recent studies have incorporated social network analysis. Social network analysis quantifies both the global and local properties of a social environment, such as social network efficiency and the roles played by specific individuals, respectively. Despite the plethora of studies incorporating social network analysis, methods to determine the amount of data necessary to derive reliable social networks are still being developed. Determining the amount of data necessary for a reliable network is critical for measuring changes in the social environment, for example following an experimental manipulation, and therefore may be critical for using social network analysis to statistically assess social behaviour. In this paper, we extend methods for measuring error in acquired data and for determining the amount of data necessary to generate reliable social networks. We derived social networks from a group of 10 male rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, for three behaviours: spatial proximity, grooming and mounting. Behaviours were coded using a video observation technique, where video cameras recorded the compound where the 10 macaques resided. We collected, coded and used 10 h of video data to construct these networks. Using the methods described here, we found in our data that 1 h of spatial proximity observations produced reliable social networks. However, this may not be true for other studies due to differences in data acquisition. Our results have broad implications for measuring and predicting the amount of error in any social network, regardless of species. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although polyandry is common, it is often unclear why females mate with multiple males, because although polyandry may provide females with direct or indirect fitness benefits, it can also be costly. Our understanding of polyandry is also restricted by the relative paucity of studies that disentangle the fitness effects of mating more than once with a single male and mating with multiple males. Here we investigated potential benefits and costs of polyandry in the horned beetle, Gnatocerus cornutus, while controlling for the number of matings. We found that female life span was independent of mating frequency, indicating that mating itself is not very costly. However, females that mated more than once laid more eggs and had greater lifetime reproductive success than singly mated females. Because the magnitude of these effects was similar in monandrous and polyandrous females, this improved fertility was due to multiple mating itself, rather than mating with multiple males. However, although polyandrous females produced more attractive sons, these males tended to have smaller mandibles and so may fare less well in male-male competition. These results indicate that polyandry is relatively cost free, at least in the laboratory, and has direct and indirect benefits to female fitness. However, because the attractive sons produced by polyandrous females may fight less well, the indirect benefits of polyandry will depend on the intensity of male-male competition and how free females are to exert mate choice. Where competition between males is intense, polyandry benefits via son attractiveness may be reduced and perhaps even carry costs to female fitness.

AB Dispersal is a fundamental life history trait in animals that governs species distribution and population dynamics. However, the key mechanisms that promote dispersal are difficult to identify and remain unclear for most free-living organisms. Inbreeding avoidance is commonly invoked as a major driver of dispersal, but inbreeding can also be favoured by kin selection if inbred mating increases the inclusive fitness of the parents. Here, we investigated the relationships between inbreeding, kinship, sex and dispersal propensity in a carefully monitored population of captive-bred North African houbara bustards, Chlamydotis undulata, in Morocco. Over 8 years, 79 houbaras (of known pedigree) were released into the wild and radiotracked over a large spatial scale until settlement. Using several dispersal metrics, we confirmed that both inbreeding and kinship affect dispersal, with differential effects depending on sex. In males, settlement distance was associated with movements soon after release, whereas in females, later movements determined settlement distance. When released with close kin, females in female-biased release groups covered greater distances than when released with distant kin, suggesting that intra-sexual kin competition governs dispersal in females. In males, dispersal was reduced when associated with genetically close relatives but increased with the individual coefficient of inbreeding. Overall, our results highlight complex (but consistent with theoretical expectations) sex differences in movement patterns that depend on inbreeding, kinship, group structure, type of movement and stage of the dispersal process.

AB In temperate songbirds, song is traditionally considered a reproductive and territorial signal produced by males. Previous research has described the production of male and female songs by black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, a temperate songbird species. Statistical classification revealed that the frequency decrease in the first note of the song is a potential acoustic mechanism that would allow birds to distinguish between the sexes. Here we used an operant discrimination task to examine whether this statistical difference in song is an acoustic difference that is perceived by black-capped chickadees in a manner that would allow birds to quickly assess the sex of a singing conspecific. To better understand the underlying perceptual mechanisms for this sex-based discrimination, we also presented birds with untrained, manipulated songs. In experiments 1 and 2, we tested black-capped chickadees using a true category/pseudo category task. Birds in a true category group performed similarly to birds in a pseudo category group, suggesting that there is no advantage in discrimination abilities for birds using categorization (i.e. true category group) over rote memorization (i.e. pseudo category group), possibly because the heightened biological salience of the song influenced the performance of the chickadees. However, responses to untrained songs suggest that birds learned a sex-based category rule when discriminating among songs. In experiment 3, we trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) using an analogous task in order to examine responding in the absence of experiential or biological factors. Results from ANNs suggest that male and female songs are acoustically distinct and can be discriminated using categorization, and that acoustic features within the fee note are an important acoustic mechanism for this sex-based discrimination. Overall, the results suggest that the biological salience of the songs affected the birds' responses. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Overestimation of the strength of size-assortative pairing in taxa with

AB Size-assortative pairing is one of the most common pairing patterns observed in nature and it probably occurs in many taxa with cryptic diversity. Observed patterns of size-assortative pairing in natural populations may thus be influenced by the co-occurrence of noninterbreeding cryptic groups of individuals living in sympatry. To quantify this potential bias, we sampled amphipods from the Gammarus pulex/Gammarus fossarum crustacean species complex in rivers containing two sympatric and morphologically cryptic groups, i.e. molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs). Within each river, MOTUs did not interbreed and differed in mean body size. We measured the strength of size-assortative pairing both within MOTUs and overall, combining both MOTUs for the analysis to test for potential effects of cryptic diversity on pairing patterns. Owing to body size differences between MOTUs, we expected size assortment to be stronger when combining MOTUs, which could represent a case of Simpson's paradox on measures of size-assortative pairing. In accordance with our predictions, in most rivers, combined-MOTU size-assortative pairing was stronger than within-MOTU size-assortative pairing. Combined-MOTU size-assortative pairing also increased with increasing body size difference between the two sympatric MOTUs. We discuss how such spurious correlations may lead to inferential fallacies when studying potential causes of pairing patterns and their consequences for sexual selection and phenotypic diversification. Previous results from studies measuring mating patterns in species in which cryptic diversity is likely to occur should be reappraised in the light of our findings.

AB If a single mechanism influences multiple traits, it may facilitate functional integration or impede optimal trait expression to produce consistent individual differences and correlations among those traits. The fields of animal personality and ecological immunology each aim to understand variation and covariation of behavioural and immune traits. Studying these traits together may provide additional insight into patterns of (co)variation than studying behaviours or immunity in isolation, as trade-offs between behaviour and immunity are likely. Hormonal mechanisms may be involved in the variation and covariation between behavioural and immune traits, and the role of receptors in particular has rarely been tested in wild animals. In wild-caught Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi, we delivered mifepristone to experimentally block the actions of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), a component of the stress response. Then we evaluated whether cortisol binding with GRs affects the plasticity of behavioural and immune traits, consistent individual differences and phenotypic integration of exploratory behaviour, activity, antipredator behaviour, response to restraint and bacteria-killing ability, a measure of innate immunity. Mifepristone treatment abolished relationships between faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels and both exploratory behaviour and bacteria-killing ability. This result indicates that cortisol binding with GRs is a mechanism of plasticity of those traits. Mifepristone also affected relationships among traits. Specifically, mifepristone treatment significantly modulated the relationships between bacteria-killing ability and two behaviours, exploration and activity. This result supports the hypothesis that the GR-cortisol binding is a mechanism of phenotypic integration. Together, these results suggest that GR-cortisol binding balances the often observed trade-off between behaviour and immunity to produce patterns of (co)variation of behavioural and immune traits seen in nature.

AB Morphological and behavioural traits often covary with each other, and the links between them may arise from shared physiological mechanisms. In particular, androgens such as testosterone have emerged as prime candidates for linking behaviour and morphology due to the environmental sensitivity and pleiotropic effects of these hormones. In this study we investigated the hypothesis that androgens simultaneously relate to morphological and behavioural variation, thereby producing the integrated reproductive phenotypes of male red-backed fairy-wrens, Malurus melanocephalus. Males of this species can adopt one of three discrete breeding phenotypes: breeding in red/black plumage, breeding in brown plumage, or remaining as nonbreeding brown natal auxiliaries. Although the expression of morphological traits in this species is regulated by androgens and phenotypes differ in baseline androgen levels (red/black breeder > brown breeder > auxiliary), injection with GnRH failed to expose phenotypespecific constraints on androgen production. Observations of territoriality, nestling feeding and extraterritorial forays revealed phenotype-specific patterns of mating and parental effort, yet these were largely related to age and were not correlated with baseline or GnRH-induced androgen levels, or the androgen change between these points. While these findings support the idea that morphological and behavioural traits are linked via phenotypic correlations, they do not support the hypothesis that behavioural differences arise from variation in circulating androgens or the capacity to produce them.

AB Pheromones are a diverse class of biological molecules that play critical roles in mediating social and sexual behaviours. In many systems, pheromones exist in complex mixtures, with the precise composition and ratios of the different components essential for bioactivity. The interactive effects of complex pheromone mixtures, however, have been minimally studied in vertebrates. In the red- legged salamander, male salamanders use nonvolatile proteinaceous pheromones to modify female courtship behaviour and mating receptivity. One component of this pheromone mixture is a hypervariable 7 kDa protein, plethodontid modulating factor (PMF). Within a single population, individual male salamanders express more than 30 variants (isoforms) of PMF. While the complete pheromone secretion increases female mating receptivity, a subset of PMF isoforms was demonstrated to reduce receptivity. In the current study, we demonstrated that a single PMF isoform had no effect on female mating behaviour, while a more complete mixture of PMF variants recapitulated the effect of the whole pheromone mixture and increased female receptivity. From these data, we hypothesize (1) that female preference and sexual selection have promoted the rapid gene duplication of PMF over similar to 20 MY, resulting in the complex mixture we observe today and (2) that PMF isoforms act synergistically through complex neurophysiological pathways to modulate female courtship behaviour. These studies help define a framework for further investigations of the complex interactions and molecular mechanisms by which protein pheromones modulate female mating behaviour.

AB Maternal care, either of a female's own biological offspring or of fostered young, alters the behavioural, endocrine and brain functions of rodents. We asked whether female African striped mouse alloparents (i.e. those assisting in raising their younger siblings) are similarly influenced. We tested whether alloparental care enhances factors of ecological importance by assessing the emotional response, social competitive ability and spatial learning and memory of age-matched, sexually mature females assigned to one of five treatments based on their housing arrangement: housed with their mothers (Alloparents), housed with their mothers, but did not raise a litter (Resident), separated from their mothers and younger siblings with a barrier (Barrier), housed alone (Alone) and primiparous breeders (Breeder). Ten females per treatment were subjected to a range of behavioural tests from 125 to 145 days of age. Breeders and Alloparents were indistinguishable in displaying greater disinhibition of novelty in open field tests, improved competitive ability during social interactions and improved spatial memory in the Barnes maze. Females that did not encounter pups (Resident, Barrier, Alone) did not show such enhanced abilities. These tests indicate that females that raise their own biological pups or help others to raise young benefit through better foraging skills and lowered anxiety in novel situations. Ultimately, alloparents derive direct benefits by improving their parental and foraging skills, in addition to indirect inclusive fitness benefits of caring for their young siblings.

AB Responding to allospecific territorial signals may result in the unnecessary expenditure of energy and time and is therefore, in general, not adaptive. The signals of closely related species are often similar owing to common ancestry, especially when species evolve in allopatry. However, selection for species recognition in sympatry tends to result in distinct territorial signals. The endangered pink pigeon, Nesoenas mayeri, endemic to Mauritius, occurs in sympatry with the invasive Madagascan turtle dove, Nesoenas picturata, and their perch-coos are remarkably similar. We conducted playback experiments to test whether pink pigeons respond to coos from Madagascan turtle doves. Pink pigeons responded similarly to playback of conspecific and Madagascan turtle dove coos but not to those of the more distantly related and sympatric Stigmatopelia chinensis. This study stresses the need to identify the impact of N. picturata on the breeding success and conservation of N. mayeri.

AB Parent-offspring conflict exists because the optima of parental care differ between parent and offspring. In many polygynous species, males are larger than females and may require additional allocation of maternal resources. Differential allocation to sons and daughters requires either spontaneously increased supply of maternal resources in the more expensive sex or that sex to induce additional supply by its greater demand. In the Galapagos sea lion, Zalophus wollebaeki, males are larger than females from birth to weaning. However, offspring begin to forage by diving before weaning. Therefore, we investigated whether sons demand more supply of maternal resources than daughters or contribute more by independent foraging. Our results show that during the first 2 years of life, sons were much less likely than daughters to forage independently, despite very similar diving abilities. During this time, females apparently sustained sons by providing milk whereas daughters contributed substantially to their energetic needs by independent foraging. The observed difference in reliance on self-feeding between male and female offspring is consistent with the idea that males demand more, but could also be due to benefits to the mother when supplying more milk in sons. Sex differences in offspring contribution to their own maintenance during the transition to independence offer a new perspective on mother-off-spring conflict worth further investigation.

AB Two theoretical models, the 'economic' and the 'optimal' model, have been proposed to explain how the fitness of prey changes in relation to flight initiation distance (FID): the distance between predator and prey when the prey initiates escape. Both hypotheses assume that the cost for the prey of remaining foraging (=capture by a predator) influences their decision to escape and this cost should decrease as FID increases. Much qualitative research supports this prediction; however, no quantitative estimate of the cost of escape behaviour exists. Here, we used a seminatural experiment on predatoreprey interactions using the black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, as prey. We quantified the probability of survival of the prey as an ecological proxy of the cost of remaining at the foraging patch, and the FID of crickets at four different starting distances. The shape of the curve for the prey's cost of remaining foraging for the 'economic' model graphically fits the cost of staying in the patch most closely. The shape of the curve of survival of the prey, as proposed by the 'optimal model', is also appropriate, but the equation that best represents this curve is quadratic rather than exponential as suggested by the model mentioned.

AB The evolution of social behaviour from solitary antecedents has traditionally been attributed to inclusive fitness benefits. Direct fitness components account for individuals' lifetime reproductive success through the production of offspring. In contrast, indirect fitness components account for the transmission of genes via aiding relatives and may explain apparent altruism among some members of social groups. Hamilton's rule gives the conditions under which altruism may evolve, but measuring the parameters in Hamilton's rule has proved to be very difficult for most social species. Here we quantify direct and indirect fitness in a facultatively social bee, Ceratina australensis, capable of both solitary and social nesting. Social colonies of this species contain one reproductive (the primary) and one nonreproductive female (the secondary), and it is therefore straightforward to measure the lifetime fitness of each individual. In the absence of the primary, the secondary female is fully capable of reproduction and produces equivalent numbers of offspring as solitary females. Per capita brood production was lower in social colonies than solitary nests. We found that inclusive fitness arguments do not explain social nesting in this bee. Moreover, social nesting cannot be attributed to subfertility or manipulation. The frequency of natal nest reuse is highly correlated with the frequency of social nesting in this and other Ceratina species. In other words, social nesting might be influenced by dispersal patterns and latent genetic differences in any tendency for natal philopatry. We argue that for C. australensis and perhaps many species with simple forms of sociality, life history traits such as nest reuse and natal philopatry are key selective factors for the origin of group living. Future work on this and other Ceratina species will reveal genetic, life history and ecological correlates with transitions in social evolution and their potential causes.

AB Cooperation in coalitions against coresident males has been shown to increase male reproductive success directly via increased mating success (levelling coalitions) or indirectly via increased dominance success (rank-changing coalitions). Two mechanisms guiding coalitionary supporter selection have been proposed. First, supporter selection may depend on the supporters available, whereby an animal chooses the highest ranking supporter present to maximize their chance of winning. Second, males may also select supporters based on the strength of the social bond they share with them. Different studies on male Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, have produced support for both mechanisms but crucial assumptions and predictions remained untested. The aim of this study was to test predictions derived for both mechanisms after establishing whether Barbary macaque males formed social bonds. We observed two wild groups of macaques in Morocco (>2000 h focal animal data) and recorded the identity of males recruited to join a coalition, of all bystanders, and of the coalitionary target. We demonstrate for the first time that male Barbary macaques formed strong, equitable social bonds that were stable for 2 years. Corroborating earlier studies we found that males selected supporters by more than one criterion, namely by the strength of their social bonds to the potential ally and by their dominance rank position among potential supporters. The animals who received recruitment signals were more likely to reject the recruitment invitation the weaker their social bond to the recruiter was and if the target was higher ranking than the recruiter. In a subset in which we examined only levelling coalitions that would flatten the mating skew, males only used the mechanism that would maximize the feasibility of the coalition by more frequently selecting the highest ranked bystander. These results suggest that males flexibly apply different criteria for supporter selection depending on the context of the conflict. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many mammalian societies are structured by dominance hierarchies, and an individual's position within this hierarchy can influence reproduction, behaviour, physiology and health. In nepotistic hierarchies, which are common in cercopithecine primates and also seen in spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, adult daughters are expected to rank immediately below their mother, and in reverse age order (a phenomenon known as 'youngest ascendancy'). This pattern is well described, but few studies have systematically examined the frequency or causes of departures from the expected pattern. Using a longitudinal data set from a natural population of yellow baboons, Papio cynocephalus, we measured the influence of maternal kin, paternal kin and group size on female rank positions at two life history milestones, menarche and first live birth. At menarche, most females (73%) ranked adjacent to their family members (i.e. the female held an ordinal rank in consecutive order with other members of her maternal family); however, only 33% of females showed youngest ascendancy within their matriline at menarche. By the time they experienced their first live birth, many females had improved their dominance rank: 78% ranked adjacent to their family members and 49% showed youngest ascendancy within their matriline. The presence of mothers and maternal sisters exerted a powerful influence on rank outcomes. However, the presence of fathers, brothers and paternal siblings did not produce a clear effect on female dominance rank in our analyses, perhaps because females in our data set co-resided with variable numbers and types of paternal and male relatives. Our results also raise the possibility that female body size or competitive ability may influence dominance rank, even in this classically nepotistic species. In total, our analyses reveal that the predictors of dominance rank in nepotistic rank systems are much more complex than previously thought.

AB Predators are usually larger than their prey, but because size changes during ontogeny, predator and prey roles may be reversed. Hence, an individual may be prey when juvenile, but as an adult, it may counterattack the juveniles of its childhood enemy. Earlier, we showed that juvenile predatory mites, Iphiseius degenerans, recognize adults of another predatory mite species that attacked and killed conspecifics of the juveniles. Upon becoming adult, these former juveniles showed an increase in attacks on juveniles of their enemy. Here, we tested whether adult females of I. degenerans show a similar response after witnessing attack on conspecific juveniles in the presence of suitable alternative food (i.e. pollen). We used three predatory mite species involved in reciprocal intraguild predation. We found mixed results: the rate of attack on juveniles of one species of predator, Neoseiulus cucumeris, did increase after witnessing the killing of conspecific juveniles, but the rate of attack on juveniles of another species, Amblyseius swirskii, did not increase after such an experience. Furthermore, we found no conclusive evidence for species-specific antipredator responses. It is unlikely that cues of previous predation events affected the behaviour of adult predatory mites, because the trials were conducted on new experimental arenas free of predation cues. We conclude that adult predatory mites can change their antipredator behaviour in response to having witnessed predation on vulnerable juvenile conspecifics.

AB Alloparental care can be maladaptive if foster parents invest in unrelated young. Alternatively, adopted young may benefit foster parents if the presence of adopted young reduces predation on genetically related young. Convict cichlids, Amatitlania siquia, form monogamous pair bonds and provide biparental care for their eggs and free-swimming young for up to 6 weeks. Alloparental care is widespread in this species. Parents accrue fitness benefits from adopting unrelated young (1) by dilution of predation risk for their own young and (2) by selectively adopting relatively small young to be the preferred targets of brood predators. The mechanisms by which unrelated young enter foster care are poorly understood. Here, we examined whether displaced young use chemical cues to orient to parental protection and whether they discriminate between odour cues of their biological parents versus those of unrelated parental-phase adults. Young convict cichlids were more attracted to the odour of their parents and to the odour of a maternal female that was not their biological mother (allomaternal) than they were to a blank water control, and they showed no overall preference between the odour of their biological mother and the odour of an unrelated maternal female of aged-matched young. Small young were biased towards biological maternal cues whereas large young were biased towards allomaternal cues. Taken together, these results indicate that displaced young can rely solely on chemical cues to seek out caregiving adults and do not express preference on the basis of biological relatedness. Alloparenting in fishes, altricial birds and other systems with self-feeding young is driven in part by generic attraction of young to any parental conspecific.

AB Prior contest experiences can predictably alter an individual's contest performance and probability of contest success. Although winner and loser effects have been well studied across many animal taxa, the mechanisms underlying these effects and their adaptive value currently are topics of intense interest. Two predominant hypotheses posit that contest experiences alter either an individual's perceived fighting ability or its actual fighting ability. We addressed these hypotheses, and potential physiological and behavioural mechanisms driving experience effects in the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. Prior losers went on to lose a significant proportion of future contests while prior winners were equally likely to win or lose against size-matched opponents. Further analysis revealed that the loser effect arose as a result of individuals updating their perceived fighting ability following a loss. Both prior losing and winning experiences influenced future contest performance with prior losers decreasing and prior winners increasing their aggressiveness in subsequent contests. Status-dependent changes in metabolic physiology were not associated with the presence of the observed loser effect. However, contest status and contest performance interacted to influence metabolic physiology. Plasma glucose concentrations decreased as a function of the frequency of high-risk, escalated behaviours performed by eventual losers, and muscle lactate concentrations increased as a function of the frequency of low-risk threat displays performed by eventual winners. Our results support the notion that prior contest experiences influence an individual's perceived, not actual, fighting ability and that status-dependent changes in metabolic physiology are not a likely mechanism underlying the presence/magnitude of experience effects.

AB Sex allocation in haplodiploid arthropods is a central fitness-related decision that has received much attention in insect parasitoids. The effect of temperature on the reproductive strategy of female parasitoids has rarely been addressed, despite evidence of its influence on other fitness-related traits. We explored mechanisms inducing the higher production of males typically observed at low and high temperature in parasitic wasps, considering that this pattern may result from both behavioural adjustment and physiological constraint. By observing the oviposition behaviour of an egg parasitoid, Trichogramma euproctidis, we were able to distinguish the sex ratio intended by the female from the secondary sex ratio, thereby discriminating between a change in behaviour and a physiological constraint on egg fertilization. More males emerged from eggs laid at low (+45%) or high (+80%) temperature than at medium temperature, but the underlying mechanisms differed between the two conditions. We observed a behavioural change in sex allocation at high temperature, suggesting that laying of sons may be advantageous at high temperature. At low temperature, the females' intended sex ratio was similar to that at medium temperature, but physiological constraints prevented egg fertilization during oviposition, resulting in more males emerging from eggs intended to be females. To our knowledge this is the first experimental evidence that temperature modulates both sex allocation and physiological constraints in egg fertilization in parasitoids.

AB We spontaneously categorize people as male or female, and when hearing a human voice we expect to see an appropriate sex-matched visual image. The extent to which domesticated species, which share our social environment, spontaneously develop such categorization abilities remains underinvestigated. Here we used a cross-modal preferential looking design to determine whether domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, spontaneously attribute an unfamiliar voice to a person of the corresponding sex. Fifty-one dogs were played a prerecorded male or female voice in the presence of a man and a woman. The responses were scored as correct or incorrect from both the direction of the first look and the total gaze duration towards each person after the voice presentation. Dogs living with one adult, or one man and one woman, performed significantly below chance as more (71%) of these dogs looked towards the incorrect person first. However, dogs living with more than two adults (including at least one man and one woman) performed significantly better, and significantly more (80%) of these dogs looked at the correct person for longer than they looked at the incorrect person. This suggests that while all of the dogs had spontaneously learnt to categorize human gender across sensory modalities, this ability was expressed differently depending on their social experience with humans. Dogs with greater experience, through regular exposure to multiple male and female human exemplars, responded by orienting towards the correct person, while those with more limited experience avoided looking towards the correct person. We discuss the importance of experience in determining the way that individuals spontaneously form and express categorization abilities. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   EVOLUTION; FOOD
AB In birds, male song has been extensively studied, but female vocalizations have received little attention. Females of several North American species produce a unique vocalization, the nest departure call (NDC), upon leaving nests. Producing NDCs has costs due to acoustical properties that make nests easy to locate by predators. Thus, NDCs must also have benefits that balance or outweigh costs, and females should modulate call production as costs and benefits change. We explored whether female song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, adjust calling rate to reflect differential costs and benefits of calling induced by male presence, male quality (measured by body mass and song complexity), nest predator presence and nest height. Results suggest that calls benefit females by promoting male nest guarding and that females display adaptive plasticity in call production. Specifically, calling rate increased when the male was present, and male nest guarding increased when females gave an NDC. Females called less in the presence of a model nest predator, probably because the perceived costs of predator attraction outweighed the benefits of male recruitment. Conversely, females with heavier mates called more, perhaps because the efficacy of male nest guarding increases with mass. In addition, females called more from elevated nests in the presence of the predator and decreased calling later in the day. Male song complexity failed to predict calling rate, suggesting that this sexually selected trait does not reflect direct benefits gained by producing an NDC. Plasticity in calling probably exists because context-appropriate communication elevates fitness, whereas contextual mistakes in the decision to communicate result in fitness declines.

AB Forming foraging groups may help to improve protection from predators, foraging efficiency and exchange of information, but to benefit from these advantages, animals need to maintain group cohesion. Several studies have investigated how social status or behavioural and physiological traits promote leadership and followership in various species, but the potential role of ecological factors in modulating social cohesion of foraging groups has received less attention. We used social network analysis to investigate how a temporary shortage of food affects within-group following behaviour in house sparrow, Passer domesticus, flocks and which individual characteristics influence birds' positions in the following networks. To test this, we observed nine captive house sparrow flocks, composed of 12 individuals each, in three consecutive sessions, in which the food availability was altered. We found that food reduction did not modify the following network structure and that individuals had consistent positions within the flocks, as males and adults were followed more often than females and juveniles, respectively. However, short-term food reduction affected individuals' following behaviour according to their age: adults increased their following rates during food scarcity, whereas the opposite trend was found in juveniles. This pattern also remained after the re-establishment of initial conditions, suggesting that ecological changes can also induce individual-level lasting effects. Our study provides empirical evidence that food reduction does not affect the global social structure of house sparrow flocks but nevertheless individuals respond differently to ecological changes according to their age.

AB Domestic dogs', Canis familiaris, responsiveness to human action has been a topic of scientific interest for almost two decades. However, are all breeds of domestic dog equally prepared to succeed on human-guided object-choice tasks? In the current study we compared three breeds of dog with distinct predatory motor pattern sequences still under direct selection pressure today based on their traditional working roles. Airedale terriers (hunting dogs) are bred for a fully intact predatory sequence, matching the wild-type form. Border collies (herding dogs) are bred for an exaggeration of the eye-stalk-chase component of the predatory sequence. Anatolian shepherds (livestock-guarding dogs) are bred for the inhibition of the full predatory sequence. Here we asked whether and how these opposing selection pressures correspond with each breed's tendency to track and follow a human point to a target in an object-choice task. Our results suggest that the presence or exaggeration of key components of the predatory sequence may in fact predict superior initial performance on pointing tasks when compared to a breed selected for its inhibited predatory response. This is the first time relative success on a pointing task has been tied to a known heritable behavioural mechanism (breed-specific motor patterns). However, we also demonstrate that breed-specific differences can sometimes be overcome with additional experience. Thus, an individual's performance on human-guided tasks is still best predicted by a combination of genetic and lifetime factors. Broader implications for the understanding and investigation of canine social cognition are discussed. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Extraterritorial prospecting forays are an important route to fitness in many species, allowing the assessment of dispersal opportunities and often extragroup mating prior to dispersal. However, few studies have examined the factors affecting individual variation in prospecting effort and the extent to which individuals time their forays so as to maximize the benefits and mitigate the costs of prospecting. We used 11 years of prospecting data from a wild population of cooperatively breeding meerkats, Suricata suricatta, to investigate how subordinate males modulate their prospecting effort according to their social and physical environment and internal state. Prospecting effort showed strong seasonal variation, in which peak prospecting broadly coincided with the breeding season. When we controlled for this seasonal variation, we found that males were more likely to prospect when there were larger numbers of females evicted from foreign groups (with whom prospecting males found new groups) and on days when they encountered another social group (to which they could then prospect at minimal cost). Males were also more likely to prospect when older, in stronger body condition and in years of higher rainfall (when greater food availability may reduce prospecting costs and improve the chance of encountering fertile females). Finally, although travelling in larger coalitions can mitigate the costs of prospecting, males with more potential coalition partners were less likely to prospect. Together, our results indicate that individual investment in predispersal prospecting forays is influenced by social, environmental and state-dependent factors that may shape the benefits and mitigate the costs of extraterritorial prospecting. Our findings suggest that males rely more on extragroup than within-group social cues when timing their forays, and provide new insights into the likely drivers of spatiotemporal patterns of dispersal and extragroup mating in social species.

AB Recent research with several species of nonhuman primates suggests sophisticated motor-planning abilities observed in human adults may be ubiquitous among primates. However, there is considerable variability in the extent to which these abilities are expressed across primate species. In the present experiment, we explore whether the variability in the expression of anticipatory motor-planning abilities may be attributed to cognitive differences (such as tool use abilities) or whether they may be due to the consequences of morphological differences (such as being able to deploy a precision grasp). We compared two species of New World monkeys that differ in their tool use abilities and manual dexterity: squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus (less dexterous with little evidence for tool use) and tufted capuchins, Sapajus apella (more dexterous and known tool users). The monkeys were presented with baited cups in an untrained food extraction task. Consistent with the morphological constraint hypothesis, squirrel monkeys frequently showed second-order motor planning by inverting their grasp when picking up an inverted cup, while capuchins frequently deployed canonical upright grasping postures. Findings suggest that the lack of ability for precision grasping may elicit more consistent second-order motor planning, as the squirrel monkeys (and other species that have shown a high rate of second-order planning) have fewer means of compensating for inefficient initial postures. Thus, the interface between morphology and motor planning likely represents an important factor for understanding both the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of sophisticated motor-planning abilities.

   left-handedness in the Ultimate Fighting Championship
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID HAND PREFERENCE; ADVANTAGE; PERFORMANCE; SKILL
AB Given the heritability of human left-handedness and its purported associations with fitness-lowering traits, the persistence of the minority of left-handedness in human populations is an evolutionary puzzle. The fighting hypothesis proposes that these negative fitness costs are offset by fitness gains for left-handers when involved in fights with right-handers, as being a minority would generate a surprise effect increasing the chance of winning. The finding that left-handers are overrepresented in many combat sports is interpreted as evidence for this hypothesis. However, few studies have examined sports that show good similarity with realistic fights and analysed winning chances in relation to handedness of both fighters. We examined both, in a sample of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a fierce fighting sport hardly constrained by rules. Left-handers were strongly overrepresented as compared to the general male population but no advantage for left-handers when facing right-handers was found, providing only partial evidence for the fighting hypothesis.

AB Several species of birds and mammals cache food items, which in harsh conditions may translate into improved survival or reproductive success. Animals may benefit from evaluating the quality of cache items in terms of size, nutrition and storage viability. Steller's jays, Cyanocitta stelleri, which cache seeds for later consumption, may handle multiple food items with their beak prior to making a selection. By picking items up, individuals may use visual and tactile cues to evaluate size and shell condition. The number of items an individual jay handles is repeatable, reflecting consistent individual-specific foraging behaviours that may differentiate success at selecting high-quality cache items. In this study we quantified population-level preferences for food items based on size and shell integrity, and individual Steller's jay sampling behaviour when presented with these choices. Using field trials with free-ranging subjects, we quantified sampling frequency in a variety of choice tests and measured individuals' success at choosing higher-quality items. We found that Steller's jays selected items of greater weight and items with intact shells, and preferences for these properties were of comparable magnitude. Jays sampled more nuts during choice sets involving cracked and intact shells, resulting in individuals selecting more profitable nuts for caching. These results may suggest that Steller's jays evaluate cache items based on both current and future expected energetic values, and that sampling behaviour may enable them to choose more valuable forage items.

AB Insect societies are characterized by advanced cooperation, but at the same time the complexity of their colonies renders them susceptible to reproductive parasitism. Recently, a genetic study on the Brazilian stingless bee Melipona scutellaris showed that unrelated queens frequently invade and take over colonies in which the mother queen had died. In the present study, we investigated this phenomenon using radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. We confirmed that alien queen take-overs are common within this species, and demonstrated that mated queens actively seek out colonies without a queen to reproduce in. Furthermore, we found that queens only penetrate their target colonies in the evening, when guarding efficiency is significantly reduced. We hypothesize that this strategy reduces the chance of the queens being attacked by entrance guards, thus maximizing their chance of successful infiltration.

AB The social structure of a population is based on individual social associations, which can be described using network patterns (motifs). Our understanding of the forces stabilizing specific social structures in animals is limited. Structural balance theory was proposed for exploring social alliances and suggested that some network motifs are more stable than others in a society. The theory models the presence of specific triads in the network and their effect on the global population structure, based on the differential stability of specific triad configurations. While structural balance was shown in human social networks, the theory has never been tested in animal societies. Here we use empirical data from an animal social network to determine whether or not structural balance is present in a population of wild rock hyraxes, Procavia capensis. We confirm its presence and show the ability of structural balance to predict social changes resulting from local instability. We present evidence that new individuals entering the population introduce social instability, which counters the tendency of social relationships to seek balanced structures. Our findings imply that structural balance has a role in the evolution of animal social structure. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In many species individuals advertise their quality via vocal communication. Although sound production requires energy, it is still unclear to what extent vocalizing increases metabolic rate. A substantial energetic cost of vocalization may suggest that it serves as a handicap. In this study, we evaluated the energetic cost of vocalization in the context of other activities in a free-living mammal. In the rock hyrax, Procavia capensis, males produce loud complex songs that convey multiple types of information about the singer. We used the doubly labelled water method to estimate field metabolic rate (FMR), in males that were collar-fitted with miniaturized recorders. Higher-ranked males sang longer songs, which also featured higher sound energy. However, contrary to our predictions, the duration of singing was negatively correlated with FMR, whereas the duration of other social sounds, typically associated with social conflicts, had a positive effect on FMR. We suggest that higher-ranking males expend overall less energy due to lower intrinsic metabolism, and thus the singing duration effect on FMR is a reflection of social rank. Rock hyrax singing is therefore assessed as requiring a high effort over a short period but not as a lengthy activity, matching the category of index signals. Singing may also serve as a handicap to the signaller, not because of its energetic cost but because it exposes the singer to potential predation. Our study is the first to record the activities and vocalizations of a free-living mammal in such detail. We discuss the costs and benefits of hyrax songs, suggesting that singing males trade safety from predators for increasing their reputation.

AB Social information is invaluable in assessing the need for antipredator behaviour. Individuals can acquire such information by observing the behaviour of others, but reliance on visual cues may be undermined by visual obstructions and social monitoring is often incompatible with foraging. Vocal communication does not require the close proximity of senders and receivers or the suspension of other activities, and there is increasing evidence that foragers can use vocalizations to inform decisions about their own vigilance. However, less work has focused on what factors influence signallers in this context. We used detailed behavioural observations and a playback experiment manipulating perceived risk to investigate the calling behaviour of dwarf mongoose sentinels. Sentinels vocalized more often in dense habitats and when foragers were further away, when visual cues were less likely to be useful. Sentinels also vocalized more in situations most advantageous to others, including when groupmates were likely to be distracted (e.g. when babysitting or foraging) and following an alarm call; sentinels may provide an 'all clear' signal. Call rate was reduced in high-risk situations, such as immediately after an alarm call. Individuals of different age, sex and dominance status varied in their likelihood of calling and their response to situations of similar risk, probably because of different cost-benefit trade-offs for separate classes. Our study offers strong evidence that dwarf mongoose sentinels are adjusting their vocal behaviour both to enhance the likelihood that groupmates are aware of their presence and to provide potentially valuable social information about current risk.

AB In many species, there are antipredator benefits of grouping with conspecifics. For example, animals often aggregate to better avoid potential predators (the 'avoidance hypothesis'). Animals also often group together in direct response to predators to facilitate escape (the 'escape hypothesis'). The avoidance hypothesis predicts that animals with previous experience with predation risk will aggregate more than animals without experience with predation risk. In contrast, the escape hypothesis predicts that immediate exposure to predation risk causes animals to aggregate. We simultaneously tested these two nonexclusive hypotheses in threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Schooling behaviour (time spent schooling, latency to school and time schooling in the middle of the school) was quantified with a mobile model school. Fish that had been chased by a model predator in the past schooled more, started schooling faster and spent a marginally greater proportion of time schooling in the middle of the school than fish that had not been chased. In contrast, there was no difference in the schooling behaviour of fish that were immediately exposed to either a model pike or a control, stick stimulus. A second experiment confirmed that fish perceived the model pike and stick differently: fish froze more often in the presence of the model pike, oriented to it more often and spent less time with the model pike than they did with the stick. These results provide strong support for the avoidance hypothesis. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Male fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) force-copulate with females during the females' short vulnerable period following eclosion. Although sexually immature at that time, the females produce viable progeny from forced copulations. While the females could gain fitness from remating with their chosen male when reaching sexual maturity, mating in female fruit flies is typically followed by a long period of reduced attractiveness and receptivity. To test whether forcibly mated females can overcome the typical effects of mating, we quantified the effects of consensual versus forced matings on female attractiveness and receptivity. Forcibly mated females were as attractive to males as same-age virgin females and more attractive than consensually mated females. The forcibly mated females, however, remated at lower frequencies than same-age virgin females but at higher frequencies than consensually mated females. Our results suggest an intriguing outcome of sexual conflict in which males can sire offspring with and reduce the receptivity of forcibly mated females, but these females can retain their attractiveness and partial receptivity to males.

AB To be useful as mate choice cues, behavioural traits have to be performed consistently within individuals. This may also be true for nest construction, which, in addition to influencing offspring survival, can also function as an extended phenotype of the builder. We tested whether choice of a nesting resource and subsequent nest-building performance are repeatable traits in the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, a small marine fish with paternal egg care and female mating preferences that are influenced by male nest-building behaviour. When given a choice between three different-sized nesting resources (flowerpots), males, on average, preferred medium-sized nesting resources, with larger males preferring larger nests than smaller individuals. At the individual level, the choice of nesting resources was so variable between consecutive trials that choice behaviour was not repeatable. Furthermore, nest building, measured as the amount of sand piled on top of the nesting resource, was highly repeatable when males were free to choose their nest, but had only a low repeatability when males had just a single option. In neither case was the size of the nest entrance repeatable between consecutive rounds of nest building. These results highlight the context-dependent signal value of extended phenotypes. In particular, reliability of nest-building behaviour as a signal seems to be influenced by the male's opportunity to choose the object it uses for nesting.

AB Subterranean ant nests are structures that emerge from collective building. The mechanisms used by individual ant workers to coordinate their building behaviour are largely unknown. We discovered that isolated workers of the Chaco leaf-cutting ant Atta vollenweideri stridulate while excavating in soil, and we investigated the possibility that workers communicate via vibrational signals in the context of collective nest excavation. Workers were observed to stridulate at similar rates, not only while manipulating soil with their mandibles, but also several seconds before grabbing the material. The measured attenuation rate suggests a detectable signal range of less than 6 cm. When presented with stridulation signals in an experimental arena offering distinct locations to excavate, workers were more likely to dig close to the source than at an alternative site. The probability of a worker digging at a location increased with the intensity of the vibrational signals produced at this location. Group-level stridulatory activity was monitored in the context of nest enlargement, in which ants excavating a tunnel were allowed suddenly to break into an existing chamber. Recordings before and after having gained access to the chamber showed that workers stridulated while excavating, but gradually discontinued signal production when nest space was available. Our results indicate that beyond the previously described use of vibrational signals in the contexts of food recruitment and alarm communication, workers stridulate while engaged in nest digging and attract nestmates to join excavation activity at the same location, thus contributing to the spatial organization of collective nest building.

AB Understanding how social species differentially allocate reproduction within groups is a major problem in evolutionary biology. A key issue is whether relatedness among nestmates can be assessed by group members and then used to determine levels of skew. Several studies have shown a relationship between skew and relatedness, but this might indicate correlational rather than causal relationships. For example, if fecundity has a genetic component, then more closely related females might have similar reproductive outputs, and hence low skew, owing to genetic similarity in genes controlling reproduction, rather than relatedness per se. Here we show that in a facultatively social bee ovarian differentiation between queens and secondary reproductives, prior to egg-laying declines with increasing relatedness. This finding could not be explained by genetically determined similarities in fecundity, by variation in body size or age, or by selective execution of brood by workers. Our results indicate that females are able to assess pairwise relatedness, either directly or indirectly, and use this information to mediate ovarian development. This points a way forward for future developments in skew theory by throwing attention onto what has been largely treated as a 'black box': the ability of organisms to acquire and process the kinds of information needed for skew theories to operate.

AB Inequity aversion (IA), a willingness to incur temporary costs to prevent unequal outcomes, is common in humans and thought to be beneficial in the context of cooperative relationships with nonkin, since it might allow individuals to regulate contributions to cooperative activities. Attempts to address whether nonhuman animals also show IA have produced mixed results: some studies found that cooperative species are more likely to show IA while others did not. This ambiguity may arise because animals are typically tested for an aversion to working for differential food rewards, even though most tested species do not regularly cooperate to access food. We used the interspecific mutualism between cleaner fish and their reef-fish 'clients' to investigate whether IA exists in a species that regularly cooperates with unrelated individuals in the food domain. Cleaners were tested in pairs of actors and recipients. Actors had to perform a task to provide a food reward to both actor and recipient. Cleaners show consistent food preferences in the wild and under laboratory conditions, allowing us to vary the value of the food reward offered to actor and recipient to test whether actors were less likely to work when recipients received higher value rewards. We performed two experiments: actors worked either for their opposite-sex partner or for a same-sex competitor. We found no evidence that cleaners were sensitive to inequity: actors were equally likely to perform the task in all experimental conditions. We discuss these results in light of theories of the evolution of IA. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   TRANSMISSION; COMPETITION; ATTRACTIVENESS
AB Studying the mechanisms by which immature males learn courtship behaviour is essential to our understanding of the evolution of different mating strategies, yet generally this has been neglected. Here I demonstrate an effect of early social experience on the sexual behaviour of male guppies, Poecilia reticulata. I tested whether the social rearing environment (visual access to females only, males only or both males and females) affects males' sexual performance, including the time and frequency of courtship displays and forced copulation attempt frequency. I conducted trials in which focal male guppies were allowed to interact with a female. Males that experienced early social interactions with mature males performed significantly longer courtship displays than males that grew up without observing other males. This result suggests that young males learn to court efficiently by observing other males courting. Males raised with females performed more forced copulation attempts, possibly because males might need to physically interact with females in order to learn to strategically alternate courtship displays and forced copulation attempts. Early social interactions may play a stronger role in the structure of the mating system in guppies than previously recognized, and might contribute to the differences in sexual behaviour observed between different populations of guppies.

AB In variable environments variance-sensitive foraging should be replaced by more profitable sampling behaviour whenever the variation in foraging rewards becomes predictable enough to track. We tested this suggestion in groups of wild Siberian jays, Perisoreus infaustus, during prewinter food-hoarding visits to experimental feeders. As predicted, all groups of jays switched to sampling once food items were clumped into 'patches' to create reliable patch-based information concerning prey sizes. However, increases in individual foraging success above chance were not achieved according to a simple 'win-stay lose- shift' rule of thumb. Instead jays employed a win-and-return-later strategy, returning more often over the experimental session to privately sampled patches containing the four largest of five prey sizes. In contrast, public information that was gained by observing patch sampling by other group members involved a more gradual increase in the probability of patch use with the prey size involved. Use of public versus private information did not differ according to sex or social status. Even though the jays did not achieve the individually optimal strategy in this specific experimental set-up, their sampling behaviour using both public and private information are suggested to maximize both individual and group-wide foraging efficiencies when exploiting the ephemeral food sources typical of boreal taiga forests.

AB In many species, females mate with multiple males, suggesting that polyandry confers fitness-enhancing benefits. The benefits of polyandry are usually attributed to either the cumulative acquisition of direct material benefits from consecutive mates or genetic benefits resulting from access to greater sperm diversity that facilitates cryptic female choice and sperm competition or simply elevates genetic diversity among offspring. With the notable exception of studies in birds that contrast within-pair and extrapair copulations, the alternative explanation that females receive different benefits from different types of mates is rarely explored. In the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi, females mate multiply using two distinct mating tactics: surface and burrow mating. We found that females gained a different benefit from each type of mating. Females that initially mated on the mudflat surface secured the help of their mate in burrow defence. Male neighbours were significantly more likely to help after mating. In contrast, a female's final mating allowed her to choose the mate that would sire most of her offspring and gain access to a burrow that she then used for breeding. Together, these benefits provide a strong incentive for females to mate multiply. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although behaviours associated with territory maintenance are extensively studied, little is known about the establishment of territorial boundaries, a key process influencing individual fitness and population demography. In this regard, conspicuous features of the landscape and constructions such as scent marks (landmarks) can have an effect on whether and where boundaries are established. Landmarked boundaries have also been associated with altered social interactions, particularly contests that take place on boundaries. Some of these landmarks physically constrain a resident's perception or movement and may thus make the use of space beyond the landmark too costly. Other landmarks are purely conspicuous and appear to have no constraining effect, yet still have strong influences on boundary location by affecting social interactions. Factors that may influence whether a landmark is adopted for a boundary include the properties of the resident, properties of the landmark and the rate of encounter between neighbours. The purpose of this review is to consolidate and explicitly describe hypotheses relating to landmarked boundaries and highlight areas most in need of research. Ultimately, understanding the decision to adopt landmarked boundaries and the implications of these decisions for territorial populations is critical for understanding the link between landscapes, individual decisions and population ecology.

AB In mammals, maternal care is essential for offspring survival, yet individual differences in this care can dramatically affect offspring growth and development. Few studies have, however, investigated the sources, magnitude and consequences of naturally occurring interindividual variation in maternal care during the neonatal period. In this study, we examine several hormonal and nonhormonal predictors of naturally occurring variation in the mother-neonate relationship during the first 8 weeks of infancy in 34 wild baboon (Papio cynocephalus) mother-infant dyads in Amboseli, Kenya. We use data on physical contact and suckling patterns to assess the quality of the mother-neonate relationship and to evaluate the extent to which variation in this relationship is predictable from perinatal ovarian steroids (i.e. faecal oestrogen and progesterone metabolites), previous infant care experience, maternal dominance rank and offspring sex. We found that newborn infants of more experienced mothers initiated higher rates of changes in mother-infant contact than newborns of less experienced mothers. However, at each level of maternal experience, newborn males initiated higher rates of changes in mother-infant contact than newborn females. Moreover, we found evidence suggesting that variation in suckling activity among daughters (but not sons) was predictable from maternal dominance rank and faecal oestrogen (fE) concentrations before birth. To our knowledge, our study provides the first evidence of (1) the influence of cumulative maternal experience on the mother-infant relationship and (2) the emergence of sex differences in the mother-infant relationship during the neonatal period in wild primates. Our results suggest that the well-documented sex differences in life history, behaviour and ecology in primates (and other social mammals) may originate very early in life.

AB Nest site selection can have important fitness consequences for bees: nest location and substrate influence conditions experienced by developing broods, and competition for nesting substrate influences the structure of bee communities. One approach to investigate how bees respond to limitations in nesting resources is to compare patterns of resource usage in the field to the outcome of choice experiments. If different species show overlapping resource preferences but nonoverlapping resource use, this suggests that interspecific competition results in resource partitioning. We investigated nest site selection and its fitness consequences in two closely related dwarf carpenter bee species (Ceratina mikmaqi and C. calcarata) in southern Ontario. Ceratina nests were found in the exposed pith of common teasel, Dipsacus fullonum, which grows in full sun, and in wild raspberry, Rubus strigosus, and staghorn sumac, Rhus typhina, which grow in shade. When experimentally given the opportunity to choose among equal numbers of nests in any combination of substrate (raspberry, teasel, sumac) and site (sunny, shady), both species preferred to nest in raspberry twigs in sunny sites. Collections from naturally occurring nests showed that C. calcarata nests occur primarily in the preferred substrate (raspberry), while C. mikmaqi nests occur in the preferred site (sun). Thus, competition for nesting substrate is partially offset by spatially partitioning nesting resources. Ceratina calcarata nesting in sunny microclimates produced larger and more offspring, and experienced less parasitism, whereas C. mikmaqi showed no effect of microclimate. Overall, this suggests that C. mikmaqi is the superior competitor for nesting substrate. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the ability of bonobos, Pan paniscus (N = 39), and chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes (N = 74), to infer the target of an experimenter's visual attention in a series of three experiments. In each experiment subjects were first introduced to a novel object while an experimenter's (E1) visual access to this object was manipulated by (1) having E1 orient towards or away from the object, (2) positioning a visual occluder that did or did not block E1's view of the object, or (3) substituting a different experimenter for E1 during the introduction phase of the trial. After subjects were introduced to the objects in one of these ways, E1 vocalized excitedly while gazing ambiguously towards the previously introduced target object and a second location on the same visual plane. In each experiment we measured whether subjects looked at the object or the alternative target of the E1's gaze. We predicted that if subjects recognized when E1 was previously familiar with the object, they would search for an alternative target of his attention more frequently in these trials. In all three contexts, chimpanzees, and in one context, bonobos, behaved consistently with this prediction. These results are not easily explained by learning or behaviour-reading hypotheses because responses were never rewarded, few trials were conducted per subject, and the experimenter's behaviour was the same across experimental conditions at the moment subjects were required to respond. Therefore, similar to human infants, subjects most likely remembered what the experimenter had or had not seen in the past, allowing them to infer the target of his attention in the present.

AB The chemical integration strategies of facultative social parasites of social insects have not received the scientific attention they deserve, even though there is considerable research being done on the strategies of obligate social parasites. We simulated intraspecific nest usurpations in the social paper wasp, Polistes biglumis, by dividing each nest into two parts and putting one half in the care of the original foundress and the other half in the care of a usurper. After 8 days, we removed and killed foundresses and usurpers, and later tested the responses of naive, sister-offspring to them. In each half-colony, the offspring were more tolerant to the female that was last on the nest, regardless of whether she was the foundress or a usurper. This suggested that usurpers had the chemical means to be tolerated by the host offspring. Comparisons between the epicuticular hydrocarbon profiles of foundresses and usurpers showed that usurpers were neither chemically insignificant nor transparent, nor were they mimetic, as obligate parasites often are. Instead, usurpers had chemical profiles richer in methyl-branched hydrocarbons than those of the foundresses. Analyses of the hydrocarbon profiles of nest paper revealed that usurpers supplemented host nests with their own hydrocarbons, a sort of nest marking. As a result, the chemical profiles of the host nests became qualitatively more similar to those of the usurpers. These chemical strategies illustrate that branched hydrocarbons play a role as semiochemicals and that facultative parasites may not all be on the main pathway to obligate parasitism.

AB Avian brood parasitism reduces the reproductive success of hosts. Thus, hosts have evolved antiparasite strategies such as rejection of parasitic eggs and aggressive nest defence against brood parasites. Japanese bush warblers, Cettia diphone, do not reject the parasitic eggs of little cuckoos, Cuculus polio-cephalus, because their eggs mimic warblers' eggs. To examine whether Japanese bush warblers show nest defence behaviour against their parasite, I investigated the responses of the warblers to a little cuckoo dummy. Japanese bush warblers are residents, while little cuckoos are summer visitors; thus, the warblers start breeding earlier than the cuckoos. Accordingly, the risk of being parasitized increases as the season progresses. Therefore, I also examined whether the intensity of nest defence differed before and after cuckoo arrival. Japanese bush warblers showed remarkably aggressive responses to the cuckoo dummy, and levels of aggression were higher after the cuckoo arrived. These results suggest that Japanese bush warblers adaptively adjust their nest defence behaviour in response to increased risk of being parasitized. This study indicates that differences in migratory habits between hosts and brood parasites produce seasonal changes in antiparasite behaviour.

AB Helpers in cooperatively breeding groups can vary hugely in the variety and level of care they provide. Several studies suggest that kin selection alone cannot be invoked to explain variation in helping for many species, but there have been few explicit tests of this under controlled conditions. Here, we investigated whether relatedness to the breeding pair or consistent individual differences in behaviours explained variation in helping by the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. We established standardized social groups consisting of a breeding pair and one related (r = 0.5) and one unrelated (r = 0) helper. Two forms of helping, territory maintenance and territory defence, were measured repeatedly under controlled conditions: helping was variable between, but consistent within, individuals. Furthermore, there was some evidence that helpers that carried out more maintenance also performed more defence. Contrary to the kin selection hypothesis, relatedness did not predict the amount or variety of helping executed. Risk responsiveness, activity levels and aggressiveness were repeatable within individuals, so constituted 'behavioural types' (or personality traits), but were uncorrelated with each other. More aggressive, risk-prone or more active helpers participated in more territory defence than submissive, risk-averse or inactive helpers. Risk-prone individuals contributed more to territory maintenance than risk-averse helpers. Overall, differences in behavioural type, rather than relatedness, explained most variation in helping behaviour in N. pulcher. This study highlights the importance of considering consistent individual differences in behaviour for predicting participation and performance in complex social interactions.

AB Determining the context in which animals move through unfamiliar landscapes helps elucidate the risks associated with returning to known resources and the factors that outweigh those risks. For example, females that become separated from their nests can return to protect their offspring from predation, thereby increasing fitness, but also risking having the nest preyed upon or being preyed upon themselves. We predicted that after being displaced, long-tailed skinks, Eutropis longicaudata, guarding eggs would adjust their homing behaviour to minimize these risks. Nest-guarding females reduced the likelihood of encountering predators by homing at night, when lizard predators were inactive. Homing success rates decreased with increasing displacement distance (50-300 m), probably because homing took longer from further away, which may increase the chances of nest predation during the female's absence. However, large clutches were associated with successful homing at distances over 50 m, suggesting that increased fitness benefits provided by having more eggs outweighed the risks of returning. Females were more likely to return to a nest with freshly laid eggs, possibly because fresh eggs are easier for predators to locate, and thus more susceptible to predation. Finally, when females were exposed to an egg predator prior to displacement, they homed almost 50% faster, reflecting the ability to adjust homing behaviour according to the risk of nest predation. As predicted, nest-guarding mothers adjusted their homing behaviour so that the fitness benefits of returning to protect a nest outweighed the risks associated with becoming preyed upon or returning to an empty nest.

AB The effects of moon phases on predator-prey relationships have so far been mainly investigated from the prey's perspective. The response of a predator to moon phases may represent a complex trade-off between overcoming the antipredator strategies of its prey and balancing other needs/constraints (e. g. individual status and condition). We explored the year-round effects of the lunar cycle on radiotagged breeders and dispersers of an avian predator, the eagle owl, Bubo bubo, from the perspective of movement patterns, foraging effort and display intensity. In general, the movements of breeders suggested an increase in activity around the time of the full moon. This may be related to an increase in both the time needed to detect prey (on brighter nights prey are more concealed and wary) and the time the predator devotes to visual displays (the full moon increases the conspicuousness of signalling). However, hunting activity also peaked during dark nights, when prey might be harder to see. In contrast, the behaviour of dispersing owls was not affected by lunar cycles. Natal dispersal involves potentially dangerous crossings of unknown landscapes (which probably requires similar effort throughout the year), and because of the absence of reproductive constraints should not require greater activity when food profitability is low. The status of individuals may thus play a crucial role in cost-benefit considerations and behavioural decisions, by directly affecting the time and effort individuals need to allocate to various activities related to their most immediate needs (e. g. breeding successfully versus overcoming dispersal costs).

AB Organisms are often simultaneously prey for predators and hosts for parasites. The two challenges require different defence mechanisms, which may be traded off if based on the same resources. We investigated how predation risk perceived by mothers affects, via a maternal effect, the survival of parasites feeding on offspring. In an experiment on great tits, Parus major, we manipulated the perceived predator density for females before and during ovulation by simulating the presence of either birds of prey (sparrowhawks) or controls (song thrushes) in their breeding habitat. To test exclusively for the maternal effect as a consequence of the higher perceived predation risk, the offspring were raised by foster parents without treatment. We then let groups of hen-fleas, the main ectoparasite of the great tit, feed on nestlings from both treatment groups for a fixed period of time, and thereafter measured flea survival under standardized laboratory conditions. Fleas feeding on offspring of mothers experiencing increased predation risk before egg laying survived significantly longer than those feeding on control nestlings. Higher survival may be associated with maternal stressors transferred via the egg to the host offspring or may result from the resolution of an investment trade-off, whereby maternal resources can be used to prepare the offspring to deal with either increased predation risk or parasites. This finding emphasizes the need for understanding multitrophic interactions arising from the interplay between parasite-and predator-induced maternal effects and their consequences for parasite population dynamics, the composition of ecological communities and host-parasite coevolution.

ID BEHAVIOR; MIND
AB The idea that yawning contagion in humans is predicated on an empathetic response was recently extended to dogs following the report of cross-species contagious yawning in this species (human-dogs). We attempted to replicate contagious yawning in dogs and to investigate what conditions promote yawning contagion. We tested the emotional connectedness hypothesis, which predicts that contagious yawning is precipitated by exposure to (1) familiar model (primary caregiver) and/or (2) similar model (conspecific) stimuli, if contagious yawning is empathy related. In our sample of family-owned and rescue centre dogs we further predicted that rescue centre dogs would yawn contagiously less than owned dogs on the basis that they are more lacking in emotional closeness and have more weakly bonded relationships with their primary care provider than owned dogs. We also controlled for stress since stress can induce yawning. While we found that five of 19 dogs did yawn in response to an unfamiliar human yawning, we were unable to confirm contagion. Our results provide no support for empathy-based, emotionally connected yawning contagion in dogs and casts doubt on the recently documented phenomenon of cross-species contagious yawning. We interpret our findings as showing that if dogs are seen yawning contagiously then the contagion must be explained on less cognitively stringent grounds than empathy.

AB It is now recognized that many vertebrates and a few invertebrates show individual-specific consistency in their behaviour across time and context, sometimes in ways that can be paralleled with human personality. Our work aimed at assessing behavioural consistency in a social insect: the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We focused on a behavioural dimension commonly used in personality studies: the response of an individual to novelty (neophilia/neophobia spectrum). We used a foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model, we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal personality in the common sense of the term. Instead their behavioural response to novelty appears to be plastic, varying on a day to day basis. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Interference can be defined as the reduction of intake rate caused by the presence of congeneric individuals. However, surrounding congeneric individuals may also accelerate food depletion. Therefore, it is difficult to quantify interference (contest) and exploitative (scramble) competition separately, particularly in the field. In an individual-based model, where food was immediately replenished in patches after a foraging bout, we isolated the effect of interference competition. In this way, we investigated how interference shapes the intake rates of flocking Bewick's swans, Cygnus bewickii, consuming tubers of fennel pondweed, Potamogeton pectinatus. The model predicted that intake rate declines with increasing swan density, and that the rate of decline is greater in subordinate birds than in dominant birds. Subordinate birds suffered a large reduction in intake rate at high densities because they spent a large proportion of the time avoiding more dominant individuals. A major decline in intake rate of subordinates occurred close to the maximum swan densities observed in the field. We expected subordinates to leave high-density flocks and look for another foraging location: interference competition seemed to regulate the maximum swan flock density in the field. Hence, the mean population intake rate at realized densities was only slightly lower than in the absence of interference. As interference occurred mainly as avoidance behaviour, which is difficult to observe in the field, it might commonly remain cryptic for the observer. Our results may explain other field studies where interference competition seemed to be of lesser importance. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Chickadees produce elaborate vocalizations, but their basic auditory capabilities remain unexplored. We used auditory brainstem responses to tone bursts to assess the auditory sensitivity of Carolina chickadees at frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz and the percentage of frequency selectivity (quality) of auditory filters at frequencies from 2 to 4 kHz. The high-frequency limit of sensitive hearing was relatively high in chickadees compared to other songbirds tested using the same method, while the low-frequency limit was similar among species. These results support a previously noted correlation across songbirds between the high-frequency limit of sensitive hearing and the maximum frequency of vocalizations. The frequency selectivity of auditory filters in chickadees increased with increasing frequency. Frequency selectivity was intermediate compared to other species at 2 and 3 kHz, and relatively high at 4 kHz. This pattern suggests that frequency selectivity is generally greatest within the frequency range of long-range communication signals, and maximum frequency selectivity may be greater in woodland species than in open habitat species. Greater frequency selectivity may have evolved for greater frequency resolution of vocal signals, which are relatively tonal in woodland species, or for better signal detection in noise. Finally, males had greater auditory sensitivity than females, whereas females had greater frequency selectivity than males. Greater frequency selectivity may enhance perception of the frequency difference between song notes, which indicates male quality in another chickadee species.

AB Living in large, stable groups is often considered to favour the evolution of cognitive abilities related to social living, such as the ability to track relationships among group members and to make transitive inferences about relationships based on indirect evidence. Greylag geese are relatively small brained, but live in complex societies with social support and clan structures. They form dominance hierarchies in which families dominate pairs and unpaired individuals. However, competition is costly and the ability to transitively infer relationships among flock members may be highly advantageous. We tested five free-living, juvenile greylag geese embedded in a flock of 150 birds for their ability to track multiple dyadic relationships and their transitive inference competence. Individuals were trained on discriminations between successive pairs of five implicitly ordered colours (A-E). All individuals learned to track four dyadic relationships simultaneously and showed transitive inference when presented with nonadjacent colours. Remarkably, the amount of training required was related to the individual's early social environment. Our study is one of the first to show transitive inference in a precocial bird and suggests an influence of early social experience on sociocognitive abilities. Furthermore, it improves our understanding of social complexity as an important selection pressure for the evolution of cognition. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Drosophila melanogaster flies use both olfactory and taste systems to detect sex pheromones and select the most suitable mate for reproduction. In nature, flies often face multiple potential partners and should have an acute sensory ability to discriminate between different pheromonal bouquets. We investigated both the pheromones and the chemosensory neurons influencing Drosophila mate choice. We measured various courtship traits in single tester males simultaneously presented with two target male and/or female flies carrying different pheromonal bouquets (pairs of control flies of the same or different sex, same-sex target pairs of pheromonal variant strains). The courtship traits reflected the perception of either olfactory cues perceived before or gustatory cues perceived after the first physical taste contact. Our results suggest that male mate choice exists in D. melanogaster and that male discrimination between potential mates could be a two-step process involving chemical cues perceived before and after the first gustatory contact. In addition, when a male was simultaneously presented with two potential sexual partners, the olfactory and gustatory cues he used depended on the pheromonal patterns of both flies, but his response could also depend on additional effects resulting from the simultaneous perception of the two flies, leading to a nonlinear choice of a sexual partner. Moreover, some tester males with genetically altered gustatory receptor neurons strongly changed their partner preference, indicating that the fly's peripheral nervous system is essential for pheromonal detection and mate choice.

AB The amount of food ingested by chicks has often been suggested as being the main proximate factor controlling broodmate aggression in facultatively siblicidal species. Although several experiments have demonstrated that short-term food deprivation causes a temporary increase in aggression, no study has, to our knowledge, experimentally manipulated overall food supplies and considered long-term effects on chick behaviour and life history traits. We provided supplemental food to breeding pairs of black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla, over an entire breeding season and compared the aggressive behaviour of their chicks with that of chicks of control pairs. Control A-chicks (first to hatch) showed more frequent and intense aggression than their experimental counterparts. Furthermore, the more A-chicks begged and the lower their growth rate the more aggressive they were. The consequences of increased aggression for B-chicks (second to hatch) were lower begging rate, lower growth rate and lower survival. We thus provide evidence that a sustained increase in food availability affects broodmate aggression and chick survival at the nest and we discuss the various proximate and ultimate causes involved in the evolution of broodmate aggression.

AB We investigated social interaction behaviour (amicable versus agonistic) to evaluate parent-offspring recognition in male and female Brandt's voles. We first examined whether the parents were able to distinguish their own familiar related offspring at the age of weaning from unfamiliar unrelated offspring. Both male and female parents, when encountering unfamiliar unrelated juveniles in a neutral arena, showed significantly more agonistic behaviour than when encountering their own familiar offspring, which suggested that adult Brandt's voles might be able to discriminate their own familiar descendants from unfamiliar unrelated ones. Second, we used cross-fostering to investigate the underlying parent-offspring recognition mechanism. Both males and females showed more amicable behaviour and less agonistic behaviour to familiar related offspring than to unfamiliar related offspring. Males showed significantly more amicable behaviour to familiar related offspring than to unfamiliar related offspring, and significantly less agonistic behaviour to familiar unrelated offspring than to unfamiliar unrelated offspring. Remarkably, females showed less agonistic behaviour to familiar related offspring than to unfamiliar related offspring. Furthermore, males and females did not show a significant difference in amicable or agonistic behaviour between familiar related and familiar unrelated offspring or between unfamiliar related and unfamiliar unrelated offspring. Our results suggest that the mechanism of parent-offspring discrimination in Brandt's voles could be familiarity. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The early social environment can affect the social behaviour of animals throughout life. We tested whether the presence of adults during early development influences the social behaviour of juveniles later on in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. In a split-brood design we raised half of the broods together with parents and with or without brood care helpers, and the other half without adults. During early rearing, fry raised with adults showed more aggressive and submissive behaviour to each other than fish raised with siblings only. After transferring the young to a neutral environment lacking adult conspecifics we tested their social performance in a competitive situation. Either young were assigned the ownership of a shelter or they had no shelter of their own. As shelter owners, fish that had been raised with adults showed more of an energetically cheaper, restrained form of aggression, while as intruders they behaved submissively more often than fish raised without adults. The strength of these treatment effects depended on the opponent's social experience, and contests were terminated earlier only when both opponents had been raised with adults. Our results show that the social-rearing conditions persistently affect the economy and adequacy of individual reactions to social challenges, which is reminiscent of social competence effects known from humans. Remarkably, during the social treatment period brood care involved only protection but no direct interactions between adults and young. We discuss potential mechanisms by which the presence of brood-caring adults may persistently affect social skills in animals. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In recent years, studies have shown that animals can communicate their physiological state or condition by means of chemical signals. However, as the chemicals involved in the condition-dependent signals have rarely been identified, evolutionary mechanisms that ensure their reliability are not well understood. We identified a volatile chemical signal that may serve as a reliable indicator of hormonal state in burying beetles, and is involved in their partner recognition system. Burying beetles reproducing on carcasses are able to distinguish between their breeding partners and infanticidal conspecifics. This discrimination depends on breeding status, which is positively linked to juvenile hormone III (JH III) titre. Breeding Nicrophorus vespilloides beetles, in contrast to nonbreeding ones, emitted considerable amounts of (E)-methylgeranate. The amount of emitted (E)-methylgeranate was positively correlated with juvenile hormone titres known from other burying beetle studies. Moreover, our behavioural experiments showed that dummies treated with methylgeranate induced tolerant behaviour, whereas control dummies were treated aggressively. The fact that (E)-methylgeranate and JH III share a conspicuous structural similarity and the same biosynthetic pathway may explain how the reliability of the signal for JH titre is ensured. We discuss the implications of our results in the light of theoretical work on the evolution of chemical communication, particularly on the origin of chemical signals.

AB In animals without any courtship behaviour, persistent mating attempts by males are frequently observed. Male harassment affects female reproductive success in the laboratory, but few studies have evaluated the costs of male harassment in the wild. In the damselfly Ischnura senegalensis, females exhibit colour dimorphism (andromorph and gynomorph), and the morph frequency varies between local populations. In two populations where gynomorphs were common, we found that males harassed more gynomorphs than andromorphs throughout their daily foraging and oviposition activity period. Gynomorphs excreted less faeces than andromorphs, indicating that preferential harassment of gynomorphs decreased their food intake. Gynomorphs also produced fewer eggs than andromorphs. As a result, gynomorphs laid 35% fewer eggs per day than andromorphs, suggesting that male harassment decreased their reproductive success. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Movement ecology is a growing field, and an important component of movement ecology is investigating how environmental factors influence animal movements. The structure of food resources, such as density and distribution, has been shown to influence the speed, distance and tortuosity of animal paths. We investigated the influence of the type of ground substrate on the movement paths of groups of captive rhesus macaques. Grass substrate provides supplementary food resources (e.g. insects, blades of grass) having more random and unpredictable distribution and higher density relative to gravel substrate, which is more depauperate in supplemental foods. Adult females in four grass enclosures travelled along more tortuous paths, as measured by higher frequency of changes in direction and stops and a smaller straightness index compared to adult females in two gravel enclosures. These results were largely replicated in a group that was moved from an enclosure with gravel to one with grass. Dominance rank further influenced tortuosity within enclosures with gravel substrate: higher-ranking animals showed less tortuous paths and shorter total distances than lower-ranking animals. Additionally, movement bouts in which the apparent goal was feeding on monkey chow were faster (regardless of substrate) and longer (in enclosures with grass substrate) compared to movement bouts in which the apparent goal was foraging for supplemental foods. Captive macaques, like free-ranging animals, move along more tortuous paths and at slower speeds when their food resources are randomly distributed and high in density.

AB The potential reproductive rate (PRR, the rate at which each sex could reproduce if given unlimited mates) has proven to be a useful tool in predicting the direction and strength of sexual selection. We conducted a 2-month study of the PRR in the polyandrous gulf pipefish, Syngnathus scovelli, a year-round breeder. In this sex-role reversed species, the female transfers eggs to a male's brood pouch during mating and thus renders him unavailable to mate for 2 weeks. We predicted females would have a higher PRR than males and that the rates in both sexes would change over successive breeding bouts in relationship to previous reproductive output. Females did have a higher overall PRR than males for the entire study period. However, PRR was not constant across individual breeding bouts. For each sex, the PRRs from the first and third bouts of mating were significantly higher than the PRR of second mating bout. Our results are consistent with individuals making trade-offs between current and future reproductive investment. We also discuss how ovarian morphology may contribute to elevated female PRR in this species. To our knowledge, this is the first study of PRR in a North American pipefish.

AB Feather pecking in laying hens is a redirection of normal pecking behaviour. There is clear evidence that severe feather pecking is influenced by the motivational system of foraging and feeding. Feather pecking is positively associated with feather eating, indicating that feathers are seen as a feeding substrate by laying hens. Feed choice may be affected by many factors, including learning processes. In this experiment, feathers of other birds were made distasteful by adding a bitter taste (quinine). We investigated whether laying hens could detect quinine and learn to avoid the feather cover of conspecifics. We also examined the effects of quinine on birds' own feather-related activity (preening). Six groups of 10 high feather-pecking birds and six groups of 10 low feather-pecking birds were kept on litter. Half of these groups were quinine treated. Each bird of the quinine-treated groups was individually sprayed with a quinine solution. We investigated whether the presence of quinine on birds' feather cover affected severe and gentle feather pecking, aggressive pecking and preening. In the present study, severe and gentle feather pecking decreased when feathers were made distasteful, suggesting that learning occurred. Furthermore, the results suggest that quinine is an effective reinforcing agent to alter feather-pecking behaviour. Distasteful feathers did not influence preening, whereas aggressive behaviour was reduced. Our experiment showed that birds in the quinine treatment were able to learn that feathers from conspecifics were not attractive to peck at and they learned to avoid them for a period of time.

AB Costs and benefits of parental care are expected to affect filial cannibalism. One factor that increases the costs and decreases the benefits of care is the presence of egg predators. In general, the effect of egg predators on filial cannibalism is unknown. Here, we examine the effect of an egg predator on filial cannibalism in the sand goby. Males caring for eggs were exposed to three treatments: no egg predator, visual cues from an egg predator, and chemical and visual cues from an egg predator. We hypothesized that the perceived benefits of providing care in the presence of an egg predator would be relatively low, and we expected filial cannibalism to increase in the presence of the egg predator, especially when both chemical and visual predator cues were present, as this might represent a greater threat. When both visual and chemical predator cues were present, whole-clutch cannibalism increased. In addition, larger males and males in poorer condition showed less whole-clutch cannibalism than smaller males or males in better condition. There was no effect of egg predator on partial-clutch cannibalism. However, males that engaged in partial-clutch cannibalism ate more of their eggs when the eggs were spawned by a female in relatively good condition, but a smaller proportion and number of eggs when only a single female spawned. In general, our findings suggest that male sand gobies are sensitive to the costs and benefits of care and are more likely to terminate care when the expected benefits are relatively low.

AB Many predators are averse to attacking ants and many palatable arthropods are Batesian mimics of ants. We considered whether aggregating Batesian mimics of ants can become more repelling to ant-averse predators by, as a group, resembling groups of ants (collective mimicry). Myrmarachne melanotarsa is a gregarious ant-like jumping spider (Salticidae) that resembles and associates with the ant Crematogaster sp. We used three large ant-averse salticids as predators in experiments. Besides M. melanotarsa and Crematogaster we used midges (Chaoborus sp.) and a small nonant-like, but gregarious, salticid (Menemerus sp.) as prey. The predators readily attacked both live midges and the nonant-like salticids that were presented singly or in groups but rarely attacked ants or ant mimics. Predators attacked ants and ant mimics presented in groups less often than they attacked solitary ants and ant mimics. In another experiment, motionless lures (groups of arthropods mounted in lifelike posture) were used. The findings showed that, independent of prey behaviour and movement, the predators were averse to being in close proximity to groups of ants and ant mimics, but had no evident aversion to the close proximity of groups of nonant-like salticids. Palatability tests demonstrated that the predators fed for long periods on M. melanotarsa, Menemerus and Chaoborus, but released Crematogaster almost immediately. Our results suggest that these predators have an innate aversion to ants and ant mimics and also that they are innately predisposed to perceive a group of ants (or ant mimics) as more repelling than solitary ants or ant mimics.

AB For coordinated movement, group-living individuals have to reach consensus decisions through recruitment processes. Success in recruitment can depend on the spatial distribution and behaviour of animals before and/or after departure, and on their affinitive relationships. We tested the effect of such factors on recruitment processes in a group of 19 ewe lambs, Ovis aries, at pasture. Two observers continuously videotaped the behaviours of animals from a platform located in the centre of the field. Results showed that group orientation, group vigilance and activities such as head movements, stillness and number of steps increased before departure. Using general linear modelling we found that changes in most of these variables predicted the number of participants in movements. Similarly, activity of the first mover was modified in the last 2 min preceding departure, and at departure time the location and number of close neighbours of the first mover were especially influential in recruiting conspecifics. Animals first recruited were those that were close to the first mover and also its preferential partners. The behaviours of the second and third moving individuals could further influence the recruitment process. Moreover, there were clues that individuals were able to recruit others intentionally. Our findings emphasize that decision making in a group of domestic sheep was a continuous and distributed process. Recruitment depended both on group state and on the behaviour of individuals and their social relationships. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many studies of sexually selected vocal communication assume that calls remain stable throughout the breeding season. However, during this period, physiological and social factors change and these can have strong effects on the structure of calls and calling rates. During the rut, fallow bucks, Dama dama, reduce their feeding and increase the time and energy spent on vocalizing and fighting to gain matings, and consequently their body condition declines greatly. The availability of matings and intensity of competition between males also change. Therefore, we predicted that male vocal signalling would vary over time in response to the changing intersexual and intrasexual selective environment. We measured the structure of fallow buck groans and the groaning rate throughout the rut. Fundamental frequency-related parameters were highest at the beginning and at the end of the rut, and lowest during the middle when most matings occur. The fundamental frequency perturbation along the groan (Jitter) remained stable throughout the rut, whereas the number of pulses and duration of the groans decreased linearly. The minimum formant dispersion did not vary significantly over the rut. Groaning rate increased towards the middle of the rut and then rapidly decreased afterwards. We suggest that changes in the structure of groans and groaning rate are associated with the declining body condition of males and variation in the availability of mating opportunities. The breakdown in some aspects of call structure towards the end of the breeding season may represent an honest signal that could be widespread in other species.

AB Although photoperiodic cycles are known to be the most powerful entraining agent of circadian rhythms in homeotherms, social factors can also play a role in synchronizing activity rhythms. Here we review social influences on circadian behavioural rhythms in vertebrates, focusing on the types of possible effects and the types of stimuli eliciting these effects. Social factors can strongly influence rhythms by inducing full entrainment, mutual synchronization or desynchronization. Such effects have been observed in social species living in a constrained environment, between mothers and offspring in altricial mammals, between sexual partners or competitors, and between social partners linked by hierarchical relationships. However, the presence of social partners sometimes induces weaker influences, such as partial entrainment or relative coordination with masking effects. A weak effect of social cues on rhythms between social and sexual partners has also been reported. The stimuli involved in these social influences were olfactory stimuli or social stress in rodents and auditory stimuli in birds and mammals. Social cues sometimes have no significant effects on rhythms, not only in solitary species, but also in social species. We discuss the technical problems with such research, in particular the difficulty of recording simultaneously the activities of several individuals. Finally, we point out that knowledge of a species' behaviour and life history may significantly improve chronobiological research. Social characteristics and different levels of organization (group, relationship or individual levels), in particular, should be considered when studying social influences on behavioural rhythms.

AB Foraging desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, rely on path integration for navigation. If the path integrator has not led them to the exact position of the point of departure, the nest entrance, they start a systematic search for the nest. Previous studies have shown that the longer the preceding outbound run has been the less confidence an ant has in its path integrator. This lower confidence is expressed by wider search loops. In this study, we investigated whether additional cues influence the systematic search patterns of desert ants. We captured ants that were trained to a feeder, either at different points during their inbound journeys or when they were about to enter the nest. They were then transferred to an unfamiliar test area, within which their paths were recorded. Most of the ants captured along their inbound path reeled off the remaining part of their runs and then commenced their nest search, whereas those captured at the nest entrance started searching for the nest entrance immediately. The latter group of ants had far narrower search patterns than ants that were captured during their inbound runs, irrespective of search path length (20, 40 or 50 m). This indicates that the ants' systematic search behaviour is more flexible than assumed hitherto. We compare the results with two previous studies and discuss different potential cues that ants could use to adapt their search patterns. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural resistance to remating by females is common, but the causes and consequences of resistance are rarely explained. Prominent hypotheses include resistance as a means of avoiding costly and superfluous mating, or as a means of biasing mating towards high-quality males. In species in which males produce nutritious nuptial gifts, females may further modulate resistance according to their need for nutrition. We investigated these hypotheses in the ladybeetle Adalia bipunctata, in which females frequently display vigorous resistance before copulation and ingest a spermatophore after copulation. In two experiments, we manipulated female nutritional state, depriving or satiating females for a short (16 h) or long (96 h) interval before a remating trial. We found that food-deprived females resisted mating more frequently and for longer periods than satiated females and consequently remated less frequently. This condition dependence of resistance supports the hypothesis that resistance functions to reduce superfluous and costly mating. Our finding that food-deprived females were more resistant suggests that mating imposes energetic costs, and that nuptial feeding does not offset these costs. In a third experiment, we investigated whether the extent of resistance depended on male size or whether resistance itself biased mating towards large males. The extent of female resistance was independent of male size, but resistance itself resulted in a mating bias towards large males. In summary, our results support the hypotheses that females resist mating simply because it is costly and superfluous, and that a side effect of resistance is sexual selection for large male size.

AB Many group-living animals approach and mob nest predators, since grouping can increase the effectiveness of defence against predators. Some nonexperimental evidence shows that the intensity of harassment of predators increases with increasing mob size, indicating a group size effect for mobbing. In this field study we tested whether the intensity of mobbing depends on breeding group size in semicolonially breeding pied flycatchers. We recorded nest defence by parents when chicks were at least 8 days old and again 4 days later. When group size decreased naturally between the first and second trials, the intensity of mobbing a stuffed owl by the nest owners decreased. In contrast, when the number of neighbours remained unchanged the intensity of mobbing by nest owners increased significantly in the second trial. These results reveal the importance of group size in mobbing, indicating that the mobbing behaviour of the first individuals to mob is influenced by the presence of other mobbing conspecific individuals.

AB During mating, male Lepidoptera transfer spermatophores that consist of accessory gland material, eupyrene (nucleated) sperm and apyrene sperm that is incapable of fertilizing eggs. Sexual selection theory predicts that males should allocate these materials strategically based on the risk and intensity of sperm competition. We studied the relationship between behavioural and physiological cues and material allocation by male monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus. Males that had waited longer between matings transferred larger spermatophores and more apyrene and eupyrene sperm. Eupyrene sperm number was also correlated with female mating history, with males transferring more sperm to females that had larger amounts of spermatophore material stored from previous mates, regardless of whether this came from one or three mates. This result suggests that males use stored ejaculates to assess female mating history and increase eupyrene sperm investment under increased sperm competition intensity. Male monarchs appear to be capable of independently manipulating the different components of their ejaculates. Ejaculate allocation patterns suggest that males benefit by maximizing spermatophore size and apyrene sperm number, possibly to delay future female remating. However, males allocate more eupyrene sperm to females when sperm competition is more intense, which is consistent with predictions from recent sperm competition models.

AB We conducted experiments on the intersexual and intrasexual consequences of epaulet colour in male red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus. In the female choice experiment, we gave captive females a choice between males with normal or dulled epaulets, and between males with normal or reddened epaulets. Females tended to associate more with normal males than with dulled males, but were equally likely to perform precopulatory displays to the two types of males. Females associated significantly more with redder-than-normal males and were more likely to perform precopulatory displays to reddened males. In the male-male competition experiment, we presented free-living territorial males with a male model to which we could attach wings with dulled, normal or reddened epaulets. Presence of the model with reddened epaulets resulted in significant increases in display rates by territory owners, but the increase in display rates was probably in response to males other than the territory owner flying through and trespassing rather than to the reddened epaulet model per se. Normal epaulets produced a significant decrease in song rates and approach distances of owners. Responses of territorial and other males did not differ significantly during normal and dulled epaulet presentations. These results support the hypothesis that epaulets of male red-winged blackbirds are salient inter-and intrasexual signals: unusually red epaulets were attractive to females and attracted more attention and aggression from male conspecifics than normal epaulets. Epaulet colour may thus be an example of intrasexual selection opposing intersexual selection. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The lunar cycle has been shown to affect the behaviour of a variety of marine animals. However, changes in the behaviour of seabirds and marine mammals and how they respond to the lunar cycle have been less well documented, principally because of the technical difficulties in long-term recording of their at-sea behaviour. Because seabirds generally rely on visual cues at small spatial scales, ambient light levels by moonlight may have a strong influence on their foraging and predator avoidance behaviours at sea at night. We used global location sensor loggers attached to wintering streaked shearwaters to examine whether the birds' at-sea behaviour varied with the lunar phase. The shearwaters migrated from Japan to the seas off northern New Guinea. Their activities at night changed synchronously with the lunar phase: birds flew for longer periods and landed on water more frequently on nights with a full moon than when there was a new moon. Our results indicate that at-sea behaviour of pelagic seabirds is closely associated with the lunar cycle. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We tested for differences in spatial memory of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, from low- and high-predation populations in a maze task. We also measured the time each fish took to make a decision in the maze, because individuals can show a trade-off between the speed and the accuracy of their decisions during this kind of task. Because brain size can affect cognitive performance, we also measured brain size. There were no differences in the number of errors made or time to find the reward between predation regimes. However, high-predation guppies tended to take longer to make the decision about which maze chamber to enter than low- predation guppies; thus, low- predation guppies were more willing to make quick and potentially inaccurate decisions, a strategy we have termed 'hastiness'. Individuals within populations also varied in hastiness and we found that hasty guppies tended to have smaller telencephalons, the brain region most responsible for spatial memory. There was no difference in brain size in relation to predation regime, although lab-reared fish had smaller brains than wild-caught fish. This study shows that the careful observation of an animal's strategy for solving spatial problems may reveal subtle differences that are associated with ecology and brain size.

AB The fringe-lipped bat, Trachops cirrhosus, uses frog mating calls to detect and locate its prey. The tungara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus, a preferred prey species of this bat, produces two types of sexual advertisement calls, simple and complex, and both female frogs and predatory bats prefer complex calls to simple ones. Complex calls differ from simple ones in that they contain chucks: short, broadband suffixes with distinct onsets and offsets, acoustic properties that should maximize binaural comparisons and facilitate localization. We investigated the hypothesis that frog-eating bats prefer the complex calls of tungara frogs to simple ones because they find complex calls easier to localize. We tested bats under experimental conditions that mirror the conditions they encounter in nature: we broadcast tungara frog calls with and without background noise and with and without intervening obstacles. We broadcast calls either continuously during the hunting approach or only prior to the bat's flight to mimic the conditions under which frogs have detected an approaching bat and ceased calling. Bats showed a trend for better localization performance of complex calls than of simple ones under all treatment conditions. We found significant differences in localization performance in some but not all levels of localization task complexity. This study is the first to offer evidence that an eavesdropping predator shows better localization performance for a preferred signal variant of its prey.

AB The effects of exogenous testosterone on the breeding biology of avian females are largely unknown. One unanswered question is whether testosterone has a role in female mating strategies affecting, for example, the rate of extrapair offspring ( EPO) obtained. We experimentally increased circulating testosterone in females of a free-ranging population of the spotless starling, Sturnus unicolor, and measured rates of mixed paternity in their broods. Females treated with exogenous testosterone had a significantly reduced percentage of extrapair offspring in relation to controls and this difference persisted in the years after treatment. In addition, female age was negatively, and the number of nestlings was positively, related to EPO. To our knowledge, this is the first study on females in which EPO has been analysed in relation to an experimental testosterone manipulation. We suggest that females treated with testosterone are less attractive to males seeking extrapair mates and that there are delayed effects of testosterone on female mating that persist for years.

AB Bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops sp.) calves are unusual among social mammals in that they have a have prolonged nursing period ( 3e8 years), but precocious motor ability, enabling them to separate from their mothers and form distinct social bonds at an early age. We examined two measures of calf sociality from birth to 4 years of age: ( 1) the number of unique associates and ( 2) the proportion of time that calves spent in groups with nonmothers. Calves ( N= 89) associated with a mean +/- SE of 27.56 +/- 2.24 individuals ( range 0-77) and spent 46.84 +/- 3.00% of their time in groups ( range 0-100%). Mothers ( N= 49) averaged 39.39 +/- 5.32 associates ( range 0-139), when data were combined across all years ( and often multiple offspring). Both calf characteristics ( sex, age and separation time) and maternal characteristics ( sociality and foraging time) contributed to this variation. Although calf associate number and time in groups were positively correlated, sex and age- specific patterns differed depending on the measure used. As separation time increased, both sexes increased associate number, but females decreased and males increased time in groups, indicating that males sought more social contact. Maternal socioecological strategy largely contributed to calf social development, particularly for daughters. As maternal foraging time increased, maternal and calf sociality decreased. Second, the number of associates that calves had when with their mothers predicted associate number during separations, but time spent in groups was not similarly correlated. These early patterns probably influence subsequent social development, including the structure of female networks and male alliances. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We conducted experiments on two populations of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, to determine whether they would take advantage of opportunities to provide food rewards to familiar group members at little cost to themselves. In both of the experiments described here, chimpanzees were able to deliver identical rewards to themselves and to other members of their social groups. We compared the chimpanzees' behaviour when they were paired with another chimpanzee and when they were alone. If chimpanzees are motivated to provide benefits to others, they are expected to consistently deliver rewards to others and to distinguish between the partner-present and partner-absent conditions. Results from both experiments indicate that our subjects were largely indifferent to the benefits they could provide to others. They were less likely to provide rewards to potential recipients as the experiment progressed, and all but one of the 18 subjects were as likely to deliver rewards to an empty enclosure as to an enclosure housing another chimpanzee. These results, in conjunction with similar results obtained in previous experiments, suggest that chimpanzees are not motivated by prosocial sentiments to provide food rewards to other group members.

AB Colonies of Pheidole ambigua ants excavate soil and drop it outside the nest entrance. The deposition of thousands of loads leads to the formation of regular ring-shaped piles. How is this pattern generated? This study investigated soil pile formation on level and sloping surfaces, both empirically and using an agent-based model. We found that ants drop soil preferentially in the direction in which the slope is least steeply uphill from the nest entrance, both when adding to an existing pile and when starting a new pile. Ants respond to cues from local slope to choose downhill directions. Ants walking on a slope increase the frequency and magnitude of changes in direction, and more of these changes of direction take them downhill than uphill. Also, ants carrying soil on a slope wait longer before dropping their soil compared to ants on a level plane. These mechanisms combine to focus soil dropping in the downhill direction, without the necessity of a direct relationship between slope and probability of dropping soil. These empirically determined rules were used to simulate soil disposal. The slight preference for turning downhill measured empirically was shown in the model to be sufficient to generate biologically realistic patterns of soil dumping when combined with memory of the direction of previous trips. From simple rules governing individual behaviour an overall pattern emerges, which is appropriate to the environment and allows a rapid response to changes.

AB Ants, especially those species that use pheromone trails for communication and orientation, are dominant in many ecosystems. Trail- using ants form large networks of foraging trails, which require regular updating because of pheromone decay and physical interruptions to continuity. We tested the hypothesis that leaf-cutter ants, Atta spp., possess trail maintenance workers to maintain trail network connectivity. The smallest workers in leafcutter ant colonies ( minims) are always present on trails but never engage in leaf transport. Using smoked glass we visualized trails and found that minims deposited pheromone trail with a much higher frequency ( 83.3%) than nonminims ( 20%). In the field, minims were observed to perform frequent U- turns on trails. Over the course of 10 min minims made a mean frequency of 18.0 U- turns while walking on the trail, whereas nonminims not engaged in leaf transport made a mean of only 2.02 U- turns. Ants carrying leaves never made U- turns. We investigated the effect of interruptions on trail traffic composition and the subsequent process of trail re- establishment. We simulated trail interruptions with two techniques: scraping away a section of trail and covering trail with soil. We found that the frequency of minims in the interrupted regions of trails increased by 21.0% following both types of interruption treatment. In contrast the frequency of nonminim workers in the interrupted regions declined by 44.8%. In the interrupted regions the proportion of workers represented by minims increased by 118%. Our results show a key role for Atta minims in the maintenance of pheromone trails.

AB Effective communication is critically dependent on the successful transfer of information and, because environmental and social conditions can affect signal transmission, animals should be able to adjust their signals to optimize reliability. We show, apparently for the first time in a movement- based signal, that visual displays are adjusted with respect to the distance of signal receivers. Not only does this show the ability of the fiddler crab to judge distance, but this also shows that signalling is context dependent on surprisingly. ne spatial and temporal scales. We elicited courtship behaviour in the crabs with tethered females and simultaneously recorded the displays of males from above and from crab- eye level. As females approached, males increased signal intensity by shortening display duration and altered signal form by reducing the lateral movement component of the waving signal. We suggest that males tune their waving display depending on receiver distance ( a) to balance energetic costs with reproductive benefits, ( b) to alter the information content of the signal and ( c) to avoid signal misinterpretation. Such fine- scale context sensitivity is likely to be far more widespread in animal communication than hitherto recognized from similar signal modi. cations in auditory communication.

AB This study aimed at understanding the influence of biogenic amines on the agonistic behaviour of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii, a model organism for crustacean decapods. Specifically, we investigated whether the hierarchical rank of fighting individuals might be altered by injecting solutions of either serotonin or octopamine into their haemolymph. First, we assessed the effect and duration of the bioamines on the behaviour, posture, and chelar force of 60 adult males paired for size. Then, we examined their potential to modify dominance hierarchies by observing, for 2 h after the treatment, the behaviour of three categories of familiar size-matched pairs: (1) 20 'control pairs' (both individuals injected with a physiological solution), (2) 20 'reinforced pairs' (the dominant individual, alpha, injected with serotonin, and the subordinate individual, beta, with octopamine), and (3) 20 'inverted pairs' (alpha injected with octopamine and beta with serotonin). The results clearly show that the two bioamines were able to alter the posture and aggressiveness of the treated individuals in opposite directions without affecting their chelar force. However, the large majority of the 'inverted pairs' retained their former position in the hierarchy. The role that intrinsic characteristics and prior social experience play in maintaining dominance hierarchies in crayfish is discussed. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Ravens scavenging on carcasses devote much of their time to carrying off loads of food for temporary storage in caches. Ways of reducing conspecific pilfering of these caches include camouflaging caches with debris and positioning caches at a distance from and/or out of sight of potential competitors. We examined the acquisition and improvement of these caching skills in young captive ravens. We identified a hierarchy of elements in the caching behaviour, ranging from simply pressing the caching items towards solid structures to the appropriate covering of them with surrounding material. The development of these elements was closely linked with the birds' acquisition of Piagetian Stages of object permanence. Furthermore, we distinguished between the young ravens' initial caching of edible and inedible items. We tracked the individuals' temporal development of placing their caches at a distance from and out of sight of conspecifics and their social interactions over caches. Behaviours aimed at preventing pilfering were associated with competitive interactions and were manifested only with edible items. We conclude that the skills for camoflaging caches are primarily affected by maturation of representational capacities for hidden (i.e. not visible) items, whereas the skills for the positioning of caches are strongly affected by experience gained through social interactions.

AB The assessment strategy used by adult male crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus ( de Geer), during conspecific aggression was deduced from the effects of handicaps ( disabled mandibles, blackened eyes, size) and altered aggressive motivation ( after defeat and flying) on aggressiveness, fight duration and win probability under laboratory conditions. The contestants received either the same ( symmetrical) or different ( asymmetrical) treatments. Despite handicaps, all crickets showed essentially normal escalating fighting behaviour. In symmetrical contests, fights became even harsher and longer with multiple handicaps. In asymmetrical contests, neither disabling the mandibles nor blackening the eyes significantly influenced win probability. However, 'blinded' crickets nearly always defeated opponents with disabled mandibles that could not inflict bites. Furthermore, small crickets and losers showed physical fighting more frequently when prevented from seeing. Handicap effects became more pronounced when both contestants were. own, to maximize aggressive motivation, before fighting. Our findings conform to the cumulative assessment hypothesis. We conclude, first, that contestants need longer to accumulate the cues required to surpass a threshold to flee when visual and physical inputs are reduced. Second, the decision to flee is based solely on the opponent's actions. Third, flying enhances aggressiveness by reducing disparities in motivation, making other disparities, such as in weaponry, more decisive. Thus, a cricket's aggressiveness is a trade-off between its inherent, experience-dependent agonistic motivation and the accumulated perceived actions of the adversary.

AB Males with limited sperm reserves should allocate sperm efficiently during the reproductive season. As efficiency depends on the temporal distribution of mating opportunities with females of high reproductive quality, we examined whether the sperm allocation strategy of stone crab males with limited sperm reserves changes in response to the temporal distribution of mating opportunities. First, to examine how sperm number per ejaculate depends on female quality and mating opportunities, we artificially controlled female size or timing of mating within a reproductive season and skewed the sex ratio towards females in laboratory experiments. Next, we investigated the temporal distribution of mating opportunities for males in a natural population. Sperm number per ejaculate increased with increasing female size and with decreasing mating opportunities, but did not change with increasing mating opportunities. The number of fertilized eggs per unit number of sperm increased with increasing female size, indicating that larger females are beneficial as mates. Larger males did not mate with small females during mating trials, implying that the males practised mate choice and avoided females of lower quality. Mating opportunities with larger females were limited to the early reproductive season in a natural population. In conclusion, the observed sperm allocation pattern seems to be adapted to maximize reproductive success with a finite number of sperm. The temporal distribution of mating opportunities with females of high quality during a reproductive season should be considered when predicting sperm allocation strategies.

AB Males in different taxa are likely to suffer from a reduction in the quantity and/ or quality of their sperm with age. This predicts age- related direct and indirect effects on female fitness. Hence, females may be selected to avoid matings with old males, or to employ alternative mating tactics, such as polyandry, to avoid fertilization by sperm of older males. In contrast, ` viability indicator' models of mate choice predict female preference for old males that have proven their survival ability and signal more reliably. We used a polygamous seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, to test for the effects of male age on male mating success and examine the relationship between male age and female fitness, measured as female life span, lifetime fecundity, hatching success of eggs, larval development rate and egg- to- adult survival of offspring. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that polyandry may protect females against low numbers of functional sperm produced by old males. We report, contrary to previous findings, that male mating success indeed decreases with male age in this species. However, mating with older males did not in any way compromise female fitness and, consequently, we found no support for the idea that polyandry helps females reduce any costs of mating with older males.

AB Extrapair sexual behaviour may facilitate mate switching in monogamous species by allowing individuals to appraise and acquire a different mate. An individual benefits from mate switching if the new mate enhances the switcher's reproductive success more than the current mate. Several factors, including mate compatibility, may influence whether another individual represents a better option than the current mate. In a large, communally housed, captive colony of cockatiels, Nymphicus hollandicus, we tested three related hypotheses. (1) Members of pairs that show low mate behavioural compatibility should be more likely to engage in extrapair sexual behaviour than members of pairs with high mate behavioural compatibility. (2) Individuals that pursue extrapair sexual behaviour should be members of pairs with a high likelihood of reproductive failure. (3) Individuals that engage in extrapair sexual behaviour should later pair with their extrapair partner. We operationally defined pairmate relationships as more compatible when they involved lower within-pair aggression, less distance between mates and greater within-pair allopreening responsiveness, behavioural synchrony and copulation frequency than the opposite pattern of behaviour. Pairs in which neither pair member engaged in extrapair sexual behaviour had significantly higher behavioural compatibility scores than pairs in which at least one member did so. Every individual that engaged in extrapair copulation subsequently re-paired with their extrapair partner. This extrapair copulation and subsequent mate switching effectively dissolved relationships that had poor reproductive prospects and established new, reproductively successful relationships. This result suggests that extrapair sexual behaviour facilitates mate switching in cockatiels, and that behavioural compatibility is important in mate retention and divorce.

AB At the onset of adaptive differentiation caused by colonization of new environments, patterns of ancestral plasticity can influence trait expression, and thus determine which phenotypes are exposed to selection. This hypothesis can be evaluated in the postglacial adaptive radiation of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, in northwestern North America. The very large oceanic populations that gave rise to the freshwater radiation are unlikely to have changed significantly since colonization was initiated, so the pattern of plasticity in oceanic fish can be used to infer the ancestral pattern. We demonstrate that courtship behaviour in oceanic sticklebacks is plastic and suggest that its expression is mediated by large cannibalistic foraging groups that attack and consume young in nests defended by males. We then demonstrate that, under laboratory conditions, males from two benthic (bottom-feeding) populations, where group cannibalism is common, zigzag less than males from a limnetic (plankton-feeding) population in which such groups do not form. The difference in courtship behaviour of these ecotypes parallels that seen in the field and the pattern of plasticity observed in oceanic fish. Ecotypic differences were also retained in laboratory-reared fish from one limnetic and one benthic population. Biting was a more common component of courtship in the laboratory than in the field, and males from freshwater populations bit more than those from the oceanic population, a difference that disappeared in laboratory-reared benthic and limnetic males. Our results suggest that ancestral plasticity may have influenced the subsequent evolution of some elements of courtship behaviour in the stickleback radiation.

AB We developed an 'assured fitness returns' model for the evolution of sociality independent of high relatedness within colonies. We first developed this model based on parameters from the northern social spider Anelosimus studiosus, which shows a higher incidence of multiple-female colonies caring for a common brood at higher latitudes and colder conditions within latitudes. The mathematical model developed predicts that multiple females will cooperatively care for a brood in those environments in which a single female has a high probability of dying before her offspring are able to care for themselves. The frequency of multiple-female nests observed in variable temperature sites in eastern Tennessee, U.S.A., is consistent with that found in our latitudinal censuses: a higher frequency of multiple-female colonies was present at cold-water sites than at warm-water sites. A test of a critical model assumption found a positive correlation of temperature and juvenile development rate in both the field and the laboratory. Colony success in field studies was also consistent with model predictions. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Postnatal manipulation studies involving human handling suggest that rats adjust the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system in response to environmentally induced variations in maternal behaviour but adverse environmental conditions can constrain this potentially adaptive mechanism. We studied whether other variations in postnatal maternal environment have similar effects on maternal behaviour and the offspring's behavioural and HPA responses to stressors. We housed Lister hooded dams and their litters in systems made of a nest cage (NC) and an exploration cage (EC) connected by a tunnel and varied access to food either spatially or temporally until postnatal day 8. Dams recein periods each day (IEC-fed dams). Although EC-fed dams spent more time in the EC and less time ived food ad libitum in the NC (NC-fed dams) or EC (EC-fed dams) or intermittently during nine 30-mat the nest site than NC-fed dams, FC-fed dams nursed in longer bouts which may indicate a more active nursing style. Intermittent feeding resulted in reduced food intake, but did not affect maternal behaviour. Compared to NC-fed offspring, EC-fed offspring showed reduced HPA reactivity and fearfulness, whereas IEC-fed offspring showed increased HPA reactivity compared to EC-fed offspring. These findings support the view that moderately challenging maternal environments may down-regulate the offspring's HPA system, possibly by altering maternal behaviour, while adverse environmental conditions (e.g. food restriction) may exert opposing effects, independent of maternal behaviour.

AB When selection pressures for an adaptation relax, the trait may decline, or it may be maintained if there are no fitness costs. The interactions between avian brood parasites and their hosts are dynamic, with selection pressures changing as host or parasite ranges shift, or as parasites switch to new hosts once old hosts evolve defences. The extent to which hosts retain defences in the absence of parasites has important consequences to parasite-host coevolution. We tested whether island scrub-jays, Aphelocoma insularis, and western scrub-jays, A. californica, have maintained egg ejection behaviour in the absence of brood parasitism and provide an estimate of how long they have maintained ejection. Island scrub-jays and western scrub-jays ejected 100% of foreign eggs placed into their nests, and genetic analyses revealed no evidence of conspecific brood parasitism that could maintain ejection. Extreme variation in intraclutch egg appearance may result in hosts ejecting their own oddly coloured eggs, which would select against the maintenance of ejection. However, island, western and Florida scrub-jays, A. coerulescens, also an ejecter, showed less variation than the common grackle, Quiscalus quiscula, a species that has an extremely high level of intraclutch egg variation and may have lost its rejection defence, because it rejects its own oddly coloured eggs. Based on molecular clock analyses of mitochondrial DNA control region and ND2 sequences, island and western scrub-jays split approximately 140 000-151000 years ago, western and Florida scrub-jays 1000 000 years ago, and island and Florida scrub-jays 1250 000 years ago. Ejection behaviour may have been maintained this long in the absence of parasitism, but it is possible that scrub-jays were parasitized as recently as the end of the Pleistocene 10 000 years ago, when cowbirds were more abundant. Nevertheless, these results indicate that (1) egg ejection is not a costly trait to maintain in scrub-jays, (2) brood parasites may not be able to alternate between well-defended hosts and hosts that have lost ejection defence following past episodes of parasitism and (3) brood parasites may have to deal with host communities that have well-developed defences by evolving specialized adaptations for a single host species or a small set of species.

AB Learning may allow animals to fine-tune predator avoidance responses to specific environments, but the degree to which predator avoidance behaviour depends on experience is not known for most taxa. We assessed whether perception of predation risk and choice of defensive strategies by the snail Physa acuta is influenced by experience by performing three experiments in which we manipulated exposure to predators and then assayed behavioural responses to predator cues. We first assessed the scope for learned avoidance behaviour by comparing the antipredator response of wild snails (exposed to predators) and captive-reared snails (not exposed to predators). Wild-caught snails showed a stronger response than did captive-reared snails to predators feeding on insect prey, predators feeding on snails and crushed-snail cues. A second experiment in which snails were reared with and without exposure to crayfish predators showed that snails from both rearing treatments responded to fish and crayfish, but the choice of defensive strategy depended on experience. Snails reared without exposure to predators responded to fish cues by moving under cover, whereas snails reared with crayfish responded to fish by moving to the water's surface. The final experiment also manipulated exposure to predators and showed that although snails from a fish-free pond responded to both fish and crayfish, their responses did not depend on experience. Overall, the effects of experience were significant but small relative to the overall effects of predator cues on snail habitat use, showing that the antipredator responses of P. acuta are largely innate.

AB The use of information from chemical cues about the presence of conspecifics and their social interactions may be advantageous because it allows individuals to assess the social environment in the absence of the signallers. We tested experimentally whether the selection of nocturnal shelters by juveniles of the common lizard was influenced by the scent marks from three isolated or three socially housed adult males or females, keeping constant the number of donors for all treatments. We gave each juvenile a choice between a shelter containing odours from adults and a shelter with no odour and we compared the response to odours from three adults housed singly with that to odours from three adults that had the opportunity to interact. The shelter site selection of juveniles was influenced by the odour of socially housed adult males, but not by that of isolated males, and partly depended on the mother's site of origin and the juvenile's body condition. This study shows that juveniles use social information from conspecific chemical cues and that various phenotypes may use this information in different ways.

AB We investigated aggressiveness and anxiety during late pregnancy in mice, Mus domesticus in relation to the pups' characteristics. The female's aggressive behaviour towards a male intruder and behavioural anxiety were evaluated in separate experiments during late pregnancy (days 17-18) and individual scores were correlated with the number and sex of the delivered pups. We did a preliminary experiment to compare the behavioural measures of anxiety in the classical elevated plus-maze test and in a new experimental condition designed for pregnant females (three-compartment test choice: clean, own and unknown male's bedding): the time spent in the male's compartment by pregnant females was negatively correlated with the percentage of entries and time spent in the open arms of an elevated plus-maze. This allowed us to measure anxiety twice in the same female: in dioestrus and during pregnancy. Females' anxiety increased during late pregnancy and no significant correlation was observed between individual scores. Aggressive behaviour and anxiety were affected by the number of pups the pregnant female was carrying: the larger the litter, the more aggressive and more anxious the female was towards a male's cues. By contrast, the offspring fetal sex ratio did not affect the amount of aggressive behaviour and the level of anxiety shown by the mothers to be.

AB In animal contests, individuals can either engage in mutual assessment of both their own and their opponent's resource-holding potential (RHP) and adjust their behaviour according to estimated differences, or instead persist in accordance with thresholds determined by assessment of just their own RHP. We examined the predictions of alternative mutual assessment and self-assessment models for decision rules in contest resolution during struggles between males over females in precopula in the amphipod Gammarus pulex. Contest duration was positively related to the weight of the loser but not the weight of the winner. Our results support the hypothesis that males rely on information about their own RHP in determining contest behaviour and do not use information about their opponent. Fighting was energetically costly, and energy reserves were depleted during contests. Contest duration was associated with the physiological state of the loser (but not the winner) at the end of the contest, and to a lesser extent his size, further supporting self-assessment.

AB Small birds show the greatest rates of body mass gain at dawn and before dusk. Some environmental and internal factors may change the intensity and duration of the first period of body mass gain relative to the second one, and thus may change the shape of daily fattening trajectories. A frequent problem for researchers is setting the periods of the day when each of the main environmental factors operates, because its effects usually decay or increase smoothly from dawn to dusk. We solved this problem by fitting the body mass to time of day with a model generated with a differential approach. This model shows the typical bimodal pattern of daily fattening routines in small birds and allows calculation of the inflexion point, that is, the time of day when the trajectory ends the decelerated period of body mass gain and. starts the accelerated increase in body weight. A delay or advance in the inflexion, point can be related to environmental stress that may otherwise pass unnoticed. We calculated a mean delay of 10% in the inflexion point in a sample of studies with limited food availability, and a mean advance of 6% in a sample of studies with increased predation risk. The change in the shape of daily trajectories of body mass between stressful and nonstressful conditions was inversely correlated with, body mass at dawn.

AB We examined behavioural switching in the cricket Acheta domesticus. Animals are constantly exposed to sensory information that must be integrated by the nervous system and transformed into an appropriate behavioural response. Often, the same sensory inputs can play a crucial role in different behaviours. For example, in isolated crickets, tactile activation of specific cercal sensory receptors can trigger escape, but these same sensory inputs are also important during mating. We mechanically stimulated crickets before, during and after copulation and found that most touch-evoked escape responses are suppressed in copulating males. The behavioural switch from escape to mating occurs following a male's chemosensory contact with a female and requires the continued presence of the female for its full expression. We removed the antennae from male and female crickets to examine whether chemosensory cues detected by the antennae are necessary for this escape suppression and mating initiation. Although the antennae are the primary source of this chemosensory information, we determined that the maxillary palps are another important source. Removal of male antennae did not significantly impact mating success. The loss of the female antennae, however, did have a significant negative effect on both female and male receptivity and mating behaviour.

AB To reduce the risks involved in investigating potential food, individuals may use social information from more experienced conspecifics. Infants of generalist foragers are those most often confronted with unknown food items. To investigate the extent to which the response of infant common marmosets, Callitrix jacchus towards novel food is influenced by the presence of experienced adults, we confronted six infants with novel and familiar food, either in their family group or in the absence of adults. In the absence of adults, the infants either refused to eat the unknown items or ate only small amounts, waiting longer and investigating the food more before feeding than when food was familiar. When adults were present during food presentation, differences in the treatment of familiar and novel food were much less pronounced, suggesting that social facilitation helped to overcome neophobia in the infants. Short approach latencies and high exploration rates indicate that the infants simultaneously showed high levels of both neophobia and neophilia, as predicted for individuals living in complex and variable environments that hold substantial foraging risks. Food transfers from adults to infants made up 17.5% of the food ingested by the infants and were usually initiated by the infants. Infants were more likely to take the first piece of food from an adult when it was novel than when it was familiar. The mean number of food transfer attempts and the proportion of ingested food that was acquired socially were higher for novel than for familiar food. Such effects of novelty suggest that food transfers function to transmit information. (c) 2006 The Associatioo for the Study of Animal Behaviour, Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB joint territory defence, mate guarding and pair bond formation are the three principal hypotheses put forward to explain the occurrence of duet singing in birds and primates. We tested predictions from all three hypotheses in a subspecies of the plain, or canebrake, wren, Thryothorus modestus zeledoni. This species performs one of the most complex antiphonal duet songs described, and we examined the function of these duets through a combination of observations and playback experiments. There has been little consensus on how to distinguish between the different hypotheses, and we combined experiments and observations to help to distinguish between the hypotheses in the field. Duets in this species appeared to function primarily in cooperative joint territory defence, but our results suggest that both males and females also used their contribution to the duet to mate-guard. We found evidence of learning duet performance after pair bond formation but, contrary to predictions, not in the temporal coordination of a pair's duets. Instead, more established pairs were more consistent in their duet repertoires than newly formed pairs, which combined their song types more randomly. We also found plasticity in the speed of duet performance, with pairs apparently adjusting the temporal pattern of their duet in response to different stimuli. We discuss the implications of these results for the use of duets in this species. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This may have consequences in colonial species in which individual recognition of offspring by parents is important if care is to be directed appropriately. In bats, mothers use isolation calls of pups to locate their own infants. For isolation calls to function effectively for individual recognition, they must vary among individuals while remaining relatively consistent for any given individual. We investigated the effect of variation in body temperature on the isolation calls of the big brown bat. Young pups are unable to thermoregulate and thus experience a wide range of body temperatures, potentially affecting their ability to produce consistent vocalizations. We recorded the isolation calls of pups at different body temperatures and measured various characteristics of the calls. Pups produced isolation calls at body temperatures ranging from 11 to 3 7 degrees C. However, with increasing body temperature, the isolation call frequencies as well as the call interval decreased, while call duration increased, but changes in call structure with body temperature were not consistent among individuals. Overall, isolation calls produced at various body temperatures were identified no more accurately via discriminant function analysis when body temperature was accounted for than when it was not. Isolation calls produced by different individuals at approximately the same body temperature were classified most accurately (79%). Variation in body temperature of young therefore has the potential to hinder individual recognition by mothers in colonial situations. Other identification cues, such as odour and spatial memory, may be important. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many insect species with high levels of polyandry, females benefit directly from remating. The effects of remating on female fitness have generally been examined by comparing the fitness of females in multiple-mating and single-mating treatments. In this standard approach, females in the multiple-mating group that refuse to remate are often excluded from the analysis. We investigated the effects of remating in the adzuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis, a species with low levels of polyandry. Females that refused to remate when given an opportunity to do so were less fecund and shorter lived than females that accepted remating. In this case, excluding females that refuse to remate from the multiple-mating treatment biases the composition of the two treatment populations, and is thus problematic. When we included such females, we found no difference in fecundity fertility and longevity between females given an opportunity to remate and those that were not. In addition, when we compared females that were allowed to complete remating naturally and those whose remating was interrupted before sperm transfer we found significantly negative effects of female remating on fecundity, suggesting that remating reduces the fitness of polyandrous females in C. chinensis, which is inconsistent with many studies on polyandrous species.

AB When approached by humans, virtually all species flee, but we lack an understanding of the factors that influence flight response among species. Understanding this variation may allow us to understand how 'fear' structures communities, as well as to predict which species are likely to coexist with humans. I used flight initiation distance (FID) as a comparative metric of wariness and examined the relative importance of life history and natural history traits in explaining variation in FID in 150 species of birds. In a series of comparative analyses, I used independent contrasts to control for phylogenetic similarity and regressed continuous life history traits against flight initiation distance. Body size had a large and significant effect in explaining variation in flightiness: larger species initiated flight at greater distances than smaller species. After controlling for variation explained by body size, there was a nonsignificant positive relation between the age of first reproduction and FID. There were no relations between FID and clutch size, number of days spent feeding young, longevity, or habitat density. I used concentrated changes tests to look for evidence of coevolution between flightiness and dichotomous traits. Flightiness evolved multiple times and some clades were flightier than others. Flightiness was more likely to evolve in omnivorous/carnivorous species and in cooperatively breeding species. These results suggest that body size and age of first reproduction are important in explaining variation in disturbance tolerance in birds, and that species that capture live prey and those that are highly social are relatively wary. The results suggest a novel mechanism of how anthropogenic disturbance may contribute to extinction. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We used laboratory and field-based experiments to examine male mate choice in the promiscuous Panamanian bishop Brachyrhaphis episcopi (Poeciliidae) (also referred to as Brachyraphis episcopi). As females of this species can store sperm, males could increase their reproductive success by selectively mating with different females. To test this, males in both the laboratory and field were allowed to choose between a familiar (same tank or pool) and an unfamiliar female (different tank or pool). We compared males from streams and seasonally occurring pools to see whether lack of access to new females in pools promotes male mate choice for unfamiliarity. In addition, we chose streams and pools both with and without predatory fish to examine the influence of predation risk. In both the laboratory and the field, males attempted more matings with unfamiliar than familiar females. Field experiments showed that courtship preferences differed between males from populations with and without predatory fish: males from populations with predators were choosy only when light levels were dim, whereas males from populations without predators were choosy when light levels were brighter. Males from both streams and pools discriminated between familiar and unfamiliar females, but there were no differences in mating preferences between males from each habitat. Although the reasons for a preference for unfamiliar females remain unclear, the plasticity of this behaviour is evident. Differences in male mate choice between populations with and without predators suggest that males may face a trade-off between the costs and benefits of being choosy.

   CONSEQUENCES; BENEFIT; LITTER
AB Rabbit pups, Oryctolagus cuniculus, are nursed only for about 3 min once every 24 h, and we have previously reported indirect evidence of strong competition among littermates for the mother's milk. In the present study, we examined the nature of this competition more closely. In experiment 1, we investigated the temporal pattern of milk intake during nursing and found that pups obtain almost all milk available to them each day during the second minute of a 3-min nursing event. In experiment 2, we investigated the availability of milk across the eight nipples and found a tendency for more milk to be available from the two middle pairs. In experiment 3, we observed the behaviour of pups beneath the mother during nursing and found no evidence of a fixed 'teat order,' of overt aggression, or of pups displacing one another from nipples. However, the results confirmed previous findings of a positive correlation between milk intake and pups' birth weight. In experiment 4, the attempt to increase competition among pups by covering half of the mother's nipples did not lead to the expression of overtly aggressive behaviour or to recognizable displacements from nipples. We conclude that in the rabbit, littermates compete for milk by scramble rather than by contest competition, in which the heaviest pups have a clear advantage. It is a strategy presumably well suited to a situation in which milk is effectively available only for 1 min every 24 h, leaving little time for aggressive tussles.

AB We used long-term data on mate guarding and paternity in mandrills, Mandrillus sphinx, (1) to examine cycle day and cycle selection by males; (2) to examine associations between male rank, periovulatory mate guarding and paternity outcome; (3) to test the predictions of the priority-of-access model; and (4) to investigate factors influencing the ability of alpha males to monopolize females. Males mate-guarded on periovulatory days more than on other receptive days, and during conceptive cycles more than during nonconceptive cycles. Both periovulatory mate guarding and paternity outcome correlated significantly with male rank. Alpha males accounted for 94% of periovulatory mate guarding and 69% of paternity, confirming the existence of extremely high reproductive skew in this highly sexually dimorphic species. The fit of the observed distributions of mate guarding and paternity to predictions from the priority-of-access model was good, but in both cases the alpha males accounted for a greater proportion of reproduction than predicted. Mate guarding was a good predictor of paternity, but consistently overestimated the reproductive success of the alpha male. Splitting data into group-years revealed that the percentage of mate guarding by the alpha male decreased with increasing numbers of adult males, and the percentage of paternity decreased with increasing numbers of reproductive males (all postpubertal males). Furthermore, mate guarding became less effective as the number of reproductive males increased. We attribute this to the fact that only males aged 8 years or more mate-guarded, but that all males aged at least 3.8 years may sneak copulations, reducing the effectiveness of mate guarding and therefore reducing paternity concentration in the alpha male.

AB Animals using sound communication have developed different strategies to overcome noise interference, but studies have rarely examined animals behaving in their natural environments. Males of the leptodactylid frog Eupsophus calcaratus exposed to natural noises of wind, rain, creek and sea surf and to a band-pass noise encompassing the main spectral components of the conspecific advertisement call increased their call rate in the presence of noises of moderate level, and this effect was particularly strong for the band-pass noise. Frogs exposed to band-pass noise of different intensities increased their call rate in response to exposures of 66-78 dB RMS sound pressure level. Call duration followed similar trends, but the effects of noise exposure on this measure of evoked vocal response were not as strong as those on call rate. The vocal responsiveness of males of this species in the presence of noise denotes adaptations to cope with high interference, in spite of the relatively simple acoustic environment of the austral temperate forest.

ID SIAMESE FIGHTING FISH; RED DEER; EVOLUTION; STRESS; INFORMATION; COST
AB One of the most common displays made by fish is the opercular display. This display appears in virtually all taxa of fish, and is typically associated with aggressive contests between individuals. In addition, the frequency and duration of this display is often correlated with success in aggressive contests. Despite the ubiquitous nature of this display, no explanation has been provided to explain why this display is used. Here, we test the hypothesis that the opercular display functions to honestly convey information about physiological condition. While making this display, fish are unable to pass water efficiently over their gills and hence, display duration may be dependent upon underlying body condition. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the duration and frequency of opercular displays of Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, displaying to their mirror images in normoxic or hypoxic water. We observed that fish significantly reduced their displays under hypoxic conditions. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that opercular displays provide an honest indication of current physiological condition.

   BEHAVIOR; INVERTEBRATES; ENVIRONMENT; COMPETITION
AB When natural clonal aggregations of the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima expand and encounter other clones they can form distinctive anemone-free zones, several centimetres across. Contact between isolated pairs of nonclonemate polyps often triggers a directed, aggressive response via deployment of fighting tentacles (acrorhagi), suggesting that agonistic interactions between polyps arrayed along interclonal boundaries produce the anemone-free borders. Prior studies indicated that competing clones consist of at least two morphologically and functionally distinguishable castes: (1) small, well-armed 'warrior' polyps along borders and (2) larger 'reproductive' polyps that are more likely to carry ripe gonads. Here we show that patterns of division of labour are more complex, with clones potentially consisting of up to five intergrading castes: 'scouts' (small polyps along interclonal borders); 'warriors' (larger polyps in rows immediately adjacent to scouts); 'free-edge' polyps; and in the centres of clones, large 'reproductives' and small 'reserves'. Quantitative observations of interactions between intact clones further revealed the expression of a complex array of previously unknown behaviours, including (1) incursion of 'scouts' into border areas and their subsequent death or,repulsion, (2) the occurrence of multipolyp conflicts and (3) stereotypical searching behaviour of heavily armed warriors immediately following tidal inundation. Field surveys of intact clones also corroborate the existence of substantial interclonal variation in patterns of division of labour. To distinguish environmental from genetic and ontogenetic contributions to this variation, we experimentally tested the capacity of two stimuli characteristic of interclonal contact (tentacular contact and acrorhagial attacks) to induce morphological characteristics typical of warrior castes. These stimuli significantly increased average numbers of acrorhagi per polyp for reproductive polyps, but the magnitude of response varied among clones. This clone-specific variation in responsiveness, together with the complexity of agonistic behaviours, may partially explain the expression and maintenance of interclonal variation in the frequencies of different castes and patterns of division of labour.

AB Previous studies showed that dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, gain only partial information when their flockmates detect threats, and that they can detect threats peripherally even when they are feeding intensely. Here, we tested how this 'peripheral (head-down) vigilance' interacts with overt (head-up) vigilance and the collective detection of threats. Low barriers were used to prevent juncos from seeing to the side while pecking for food on the ground; a bird with its head raised could easily see over the barriers. Juncos and other ground-feeding birds preferred to feed without the barriers. When the barriers were present, birds generally took longer scans but spent similar periods between scans. Also, scanning patterns were less variable when the barriers were present. Following the threat-induced departure of a single bird, nondetectors were more likely to initiate scans when feeding among barriers. Barriers prevented feeding juncos from. seeing the early stages of threat-induced departures of flockmates and thus impeded the collective detection of attack. The results suggest that juncos value peripheral vigilance and that scanning patterns are affected by interactions between peripheral vigilance and overt scanning behaviour.

AB The cost of vocal behaviour is usually expressed in energetic terms; however, many animals may pay additional costs when predators or potential prey eavesdrop on their vocal communication. The northeastern Pacific is home to two distinct ecotypes of killer whales, Orcinus orca, called residents and transients. Resident killer whales feed on fish, a prey with poor hearing abilities, whereas transient killer whales hunt marine mammals, which have sensitive underwater hearing within the frequency range of killer whale vocal communication. In this study, we investigated how the superior hearing ability of mammalian prey has shaped the vocal behaviour of the transient killer whale ecotype. We recorded pulsed calls and the associated behavioural context of groups of transient and resident killer whales in British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. Transient killer whales produced pulsed calls significantly less frequently than residents. Transient killer whales only showed significant amounts of vocal behaviour after a marine mammal kill or when the whales were displaying surface-active behaviour. Vocal activity of transients increased after a successful attack on a marine mammal. Since marine mammals are able to detect killer whale pulsed calls and respond with antipredator behaviour, the reduced vocal activity of transients is probably due to a greater cost for calling in this ecotype resulting from eavesdropping by potential prey. The increase in vocal behaviour after a successful attack may represent food calling (informing other animals in the area about the presence of food), but is more likely to reflect an increase in social interactions during feeding and/or the fact that the cost for vocal behaviour is comparatively low after a successful attack.

AB The relations linking glucocorticoids, testosterone, social and sexual behaviour in vertebrates are complex and poorly understood. The conventional view is that: (1) subordinate individuals should have higher glucocorticoid concentrations (the subordination stress paradigm); (2) dominant and more active mates during the breeding season should have higher testosterone concentrations; and (3) the relation between glucocorticoid and testosterone concentrations should be negative. I investigated the relation between hormones and behaviour in male ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus. Dominant and high-displaying males over the whole mating period had a higher level of both testosterone and corticosterone. As a consequence, testosterone and glucocorticoid levels were positively correlated. These results do not support the subordination stress paradigm, but they may support the stress-mediated version of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis.

   JUVENILE; MONOGAMY; PATTERNS; COSTS
AB Biparental care is expected to occur if (1) the costs of desertion for a parent are high, because of greatly reduced survival prospects of offspring, or (2) the benefits of desertion are low. Among mouthbrooding fish, biparental care is rare because the mouth cavity provides a safe brooding site, thus reducing the selective advantages of shared brood care. Eretmodus cyanostictus is a monogamous mouthbrooding cichlid in which the entire clutch is brooded first by the female and then by the male. To test the hypothesis that females alone can produce viable young, we designed an experiment in which females were separated from their mates. Unassisted females prolonged incubation but released as many young as females assisted by males. However, they compensated only partially for male incubation and released smaller and less-developed young. This may substantially reduce offspring survival chances in the wild. The body condition of single females decreased more during incubation and they had a prolonged interspawning interval, but produced similar egg numbers and weights in the next clutch. Our results suggest that the male's brood care effort is an important cause of the maintenance of biparental care and monogamy in E. cyanostictus.

   COMPLEXITY; PREY; MACROPHYTES; EFFICIENCY; CHOICE; SIZE
AB Increasing substrate structural complexity has been linked to higher densities of various refuge-seeking aquatic macroinvertebrates, many of which constitute major prey species in a variety of freshwater communities. We investigated (1) whether the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a predator of such macroinvertebrates and an established model organism in studies of animal behaviour, is capable of discriminating between structurally complex and simple substrates, and (2) whether they show a substrate preference when foraging. Hunger-motivated sticklebacks presented with a choice of simple and complex substrate types preferentially foraged over complex substrates. This was seen when the prey density was equal on both substrate types, and when it was greater on the complex substrate. Where prey density was greater on the simple substrate, fish showed no preference for either. The preference for complex substrates existed in both the allocation of time spent foraging and in the direction and frequency of feeding strikes. No substrate preferences were seen in fish that were satiated, or when prey were absent from both substrates. This ruled out refuge as an explanation for the observed preference. We discuss the results in the context of the relative usefulness of substrate discrimination in effective patch foraging in fish. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Recently mated females of some species experience a refractory period following mating during which a physiological change or a mating plug prevents remating. Males that determine female mating status from a distance will minimize time spent searching for mates by avoiding unavailable females. Female redsided garter snakes experience a refractory period after mating due to a mating plug. Female garter snakes leave pheromone trails, which males detect and follow to find potential mates. We investigated the ability of male garter snakes to determine the mating status of females based solely on these pheromone trails. Males were given a choice between following two trails on a Y maze to examine whether they discriminate between mated and unmated females, whether this discrimination is based on changes in the sex-attractiveness pheromone or the copulatory fluids, and whether they continue to discriminate after the mated females have lost their mating plug. We found that male garter snakes discriminate between the trails of mated and unmated females. This discrimination is based on the presence of a copulatory pheromone, rather than changes in the sex-attractiveness pheromone. The duration of the copulatory pheromone coincides with the duration of the mating plug. Thus, male garter snakes are able to minimize time spent searching for unavailable females by determining female mating status from a distance.

AB Song learning in songbirds often includes an extended sensorimotor phase, in which birds gradually refine their vocal output to produce accurate copies of previously memorized song models. Increasing accuracy of song model reproduction during this phase occurs as birds refine the neural substrates that underlie vocal control, and as they develop proficiency with the vocal apparatus. We here test the hypothesis that sensorimotor learning also provides birds with an opportunity to calibrate their vocal learning targets, in the event that a bird's own vocal proficiency differs from that required to successfully reproduce song models to which it is exposed. We tutored hand-reared male swamp sparrows with song models that we manipulated to vary in how challenging they would be to reproduce, and then tracked patterns of song development. The calibration hypothesis was supported by two lines of evidence. First, we found that copies of manipulated models underwent comparatively large-scale modifications in syntax and note composition over development, in directions consistent with expectations about motor proficiency relative to the structure of learned models. Second, we found that birds tended to retain selectively, in their crystallized repertoires, song types that appeared to be comparatively easy to produce. Our results are consistent with an 'active' model of song learning, and also suggest a specific mechanism by which learning can act as a creative or a stabilizing force in song evolution.

AB Magnitudes and patterns of energy expenditure in animal contests are seldom measured, but can be critical for predicting contest dynamics and understanding the evolution of ritualized fighting behaviour. In the sierra dome spider, males compete for sexual access to females and their webs. They show three distinct phases of fighting behaviour, escalating from ritualized noncontact display (phase 1) to cooperative wrestling (phase 2), and finally to unritualized, potentially fatal fighting (phase 3). Using CO2 respirometry, we estimated energetic costs of male-male combat in terms of mean and maximum metabolic rates and the rate of increase in energy expenditure. We also investigated the energetic consequences of age and body mass, and compared fighting metabolism to metabolism during courtship. All three phases involved mean energy expenditures well above resting metabolic rate (3.5 X, 7.4 X and 11.5 X). Both mean and maximum energy expenditure became substantially greater as fights escalated through successive phases. The rates of increase in energy use during phases 2 and 3 were much higher than in phase 1. In addition, age and body mass affected contest energetics. These results are consistent with a basic prediction of evolutionarily stable strategy contest models, that sequences of agonistic behaviours should be organized into phases of escalating energetic costs. Finally, higher energetic costs of escalated fighting compared to courtship provide a rationale for first-male sperm precedence in this spider species.

AB When females mate multiply, the competition among males for fertilizations occurs cryptically within the reproductive tract of the female. Under such sperm competition, the amount of spermatogenic tissue, the efficiency of sperm production and the capacity for sperm storage should all be under strong selection. Males of several species of fairy-wrens (Malurus) have been found to store large numbers of sperm for ejaculation, a suggested adaptation to male-biased sex ratios and high levels of reproductive promiscuity. In this study we examined the histology of testes of three species of fairy-wren: the splendid, Malurus splendens melanotus, variegated, M. lamberti assimilis, and white-winged fairy-wren, M. leucopterus leuconotus, as well as the quantity and quality (viability) of sperm in captive male splendid fairy-wrens to estimate the temporal pattern of sperm production and depletion. The daily rates of sperm production in all three species were high: 306 X 10(6) sperm/day for splendid, 125 X 10(6) sperm/day for variegated and 204 X 10(6) sperm/day for white-winged fairy-wrens, and the efficiency of sperm production (sperm per day per g of body mass) was several orders of magnitude greater than values reported for other domestic and wild species. For splendid fairy-wrens, the estimates of sperm production varied with the method used for estimation (range of estimates 306 X 10(6)-1367X10(6)sperm/day). Splendid fairy-wren males held in captivity replenished their sperm reserves within 12 h, which is faster than that reported for most other species thus far. There was a negative correlation between length of sampling interval and the proportion of live sperm in ejaculate samples, indicating that males that copulate more frequently have higher-quality ejaculates. Together, both experimental and morphological estimates suggest that all three species of fairy-wren invest considerable energy in the production as well as the storage of massive numbers of sperm. Intra- and interspecific variation in the rates of sperm production is most likely linked to differences in the operational sex ratios of social groups and the opportunity for extragroup parentage.

AB Spix's disc-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, roost in young, rolled leaves of Heliconia or Calathea plants. In this paper, we examined how the combination of high habitat availability, low occupancy rate and short longevity of those roosts may affect the pattern of interactions among individuals in the population. We regularly censused a 5.69-ha study area in northeastern Costa Rica and examined patterns of association using mark-recapture data. Thyroptera tricolor formed behaviourally cohesive social groups of mixed sex, ranging in size from four to 14 individuals. Approximately 85% of dyads maintained associations over time periods of up to 100 days, and 40% of dyads maintained longer-term associations of at least 420 days across sex classes. Individuals within social groups did not always roost together, but they shared a small common roosting home range, which averaged just 0.19 ha. Members of different social groups rarely associated, although limited associations between members of select social groups in one subunit were observed. However, roosting home ranges of adjacent social groups often overlapped (up to 39% of home ranges, and up to 92% of the area of the smaller home range), and home range centres were situated less than 100 m apart. Thus, social groups rarely interacted but overlapped in space. The features of this social system are unique among bats and mammals in general, and point to groupings based on kinship or cooperation.

AB Female song and the significance of duetting in birds remain puzzling, in part because of the limited number of species studied. We investigated duetting behaviour in the tropical boubou in West Africa. Birds produced a diverse song repertoire consisting of solos, duets and trios, with duets being the most conspicuous vocalization. We identified 12 distinct duet types in which tonal and broadband notes were combined by males and females in highly synchronized and temporally precise patterns. Molecular sexing and observations of colour-banded birds revealed that duets were initiated by both sexes, with strict sex-specific roles maintained within the duet. An equal number of duet types was initiated by males and females. Seven of 12 duets were terminated by the male. Male-initiated duets were also more common (89% of total) and were repeated more often, i.e. sung more frequently. Solo singing occurred when partners did not respond and was also used by unpaired birds. Trios were produced by subadult birds joining the duet of a resident pair. The wide variety of contexts in which duets were sung suggests that they serve several functions, including territorial defence and mutual mate guarding.

AB The genetic diversity in social insect colonies that is generated by multiple mating or multiple queens has been hypothesized to promote worker task specialization and therefore facilitate division of labour. However, few studies have actually examined the mechanisms by which genotype may influence individual worker behaviour. In this study, we dissect possible genetic effects on worker task performance in the desert leaf-cutter ant. We hypothesize that genotype could affect worker behaviour via (1) the rate of age-related task switching (age polyethism schedule), (2) individual task preference, and/or (3) task performance rates. To discriminate among these possible mechanisms, we generated composite colonies of workers from different genetic sources and followed the behaviour of individually marked workers over their lifetimes. We found significant differences among matrilines (offspring of different queens) in overall task performance. In particular, we found a negative covariance in likelihood of foraging versus tending fungus inside the nest. Worker's of different matrilines also varied in the age of transition from inside the nest to foraging, but did not vary in task performance rates. Our results suggest that division of labour in this system is affected by genetic influences on individual task preference and age-related task choice, but not on variation, in activity level.

TI Predatory wasps learn to overcome the shelter defences of their larval

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID POLYBIA-OCCIDENTALIS HYMENOPTERA; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; EXPERIENCE;
   SUCCESS; SKILLS
AB Larvae of Epargyreus clarus (Hesperiidae), the silver-spotted skipper, inhabit leaf-and-silk shelters that they construct on their leguminous host plants. In the field, Polistes spp. (Vespidae) wasps land on the shelters, quickly extracting and killing the larvae within. In marked contrast, wasps that emerge from field-collected colonies maintained in the laboratory visit and examine leaflets bearing sheltered caterpillars, but only rarely do they extract and kill the sheltered larvae. To examine whether learning is involved in the development of the ability of Polistes wasps to forage successfully on sheltered E. clarus larvae, we tested the responses of P. fuscatus and P. dominulus wasps to sheltered E. clarus larvae before and after their exposure to unsheltered larvae that were visible either on an opened host-leaf shelter (P. fuscatus and P. dominulus) or on a nonhost leaf in the absence of a shelter (P. fuscatus). After killing and processing an unsheltered larva that was visible on an opened leaf shelter, a majority of foragers subsequently extracted and killed larvae from closed shelters. Wasps that killed and processed an unsheltered larva on a nonhost leaf, on the other hand, generally did not later open shelters. Thus, it seems that experience with an exposed larva in the context of its shelter is necessary for a wasp to be able to prey on sheltered larvae. We conclude that the wasps must learn to associate the taste of the larva with shelter-related cues, such as presence of leaf damage and silk. In nature, this initial exposure may occur when the larva is visible in or near its shelter, perhaps when feeding or constructing a new shelter. Learning opportunities will thus depend on larval density. Our results show that invertebrate predators can learn to overcome their prey's defences, and are therefore able to make use of previously inaccessible prey.

AB Previous sound recordings of resident (fish-eating) killer whale groups have revealed matrilineal group-specific call repertoires and a strong tendency for calls of the same type to be produced in series. Vocal interactions between individual free-ranging animals, however, have remained unexplored because it has not been possible to identify signallers reliably with a single hydrophone. Here we link acoustic arrivals of calls on a towed hydrophone array with visual tracking of photo-identified individuals to ascribe calls to a focal animal when it was separated from other members of its matrilineal group by more than 35 m, and thereby out of visual range. We confirm that individual members of a matrilineal group share a repertoire of stereotyped calls, and we statistically examine timing of stereotyped calls produced by one individual relative to calls produced by other members of its group. Analysis of the intervals between stereotyped calls indicated that calls were produced in group bouts with a criterion interval of 19.6 s separating bouts. We were therefore careful to develop randomization tests that preserved call interval structure. Focal whales produced 36% of their calls within 5 s of a call from a nonfocal animal, four times more calls than expected by chance based upon a rotation randomization test. Consecutive calls produced by different individuals during group-calling bouts matched call type more than expected by chance. Vocal exchanges of stereotyped calls with type matching appear to be an important aspect of intragroup calling in killer whales, although the function of this calling behaviour remains to be explored.

AB We used Satellite Relay Data Loggers to obtain the first dive profiles for critically endangered leatherback turtles outside the nesting season. As individuals moved from the Caribbean out into the Atlantic, key aspects of their diving behaviour changed markedly, in line with theoretical predictions for how dive duration should vary with foraging success. In particular, in the Atlantic, where foraging success is expected to be higher, dives became much longer than in the Caribbean. The deepest-ever dive profile recorded for a reptile was obtained in the oceanic Atlantic, with a 54-min dive to 626 m on 26 August 2002. However, dives were typically much shallower (generally < 200 m) and shorter (< 40 min). These results highlight the suitability of this species for testing models of dive performance.

AB Territorial aggression, displayed by male vertebrates in a reproductive context, is generally thought to be mediated by testosterone. The challenge hypothesis predicts that in socially monogamous species, territorial challenges should induce an increase in plasma testosterone concentrations, which will enhance aggressive behaviour and territory defence. This hypothesis is based on northern latitude birds and needs to be tested in tropical birds before it can be universally accepted. We tested the challenge hypothesis in an equatorial population of rufous-collared sparrows in Papallacta, Ecuador. This population shows an extended breeding period during which males aggressively guard territories. During the early breeding season, males were challenged with conspecific or heterospecific simulated territorial intrusions (STIs) lasting 10 min. Conspecific-challenged males responded more aggressively than heterospecific-challenged males. However, there was no increase in plasma testosterone in response to the conspecific STI. During the breeding season, males were challenged with conspecific STIs lasting 0, 10 or 30 min.. Males behaved aggressively regardless of STI duration, and did not differ in plasma testosterone or luteinizing hormone concentrations. During the breeding season, males were implanted with testosterone-filled or empty silastic tubes and subsequently challenged with a conspecific STI. Testosterone implants significantly raised plasma testosterone concentrations, but testosterone-implanted males were not more aggressive than blank-implanted controls. Combined, these findings suggest that testosterone concentrations above breeding baseline are not related to territorial aggression in this population and therefore do not support the challenge hypothesis.

AB We studied the potential influence of predation risk on the competitive ability and habitat use of foraging perch and the effect of these interactions on growth. Groups of four similar-sized young-of-the-year perch were in visual contact with a piscivorous perch during feeding. The fry had the choice of vegetation and open habitat, with food presented in the open habitat. Competitive ability, defined as proportion of prey attacks, varied between perch individuals and was unaffected by predation risk. The variation in proportion of prey attacks was affected by relative size within each replicate group, despite small size differences ( 1 mm), with the largest individual being a better competitor than the smallest ones. The degree of boldness, measured as the proportion of time spent in the open habitat, was significantly related to both competitive ability and prey attack order. Observations of aggressive behaviour indicated a possible occurrence of interference competition, which may contribute to the appearance of different competitive abilities between individuals within a group of perch. A significant correlation was found between competitive ability and growth. Growth variation within groups was not affected by predation risk.

AB Floral shape is a visual cue used by pollinators to discriminate between competing flower species. We investigated whether discrimination is possible between closed shapes presenting the same colour and lacking a centrally presented fixation point. Free-flying honeybees, Apis mellifera L., had to discriminate between a solid square and a solid triangle of the same colour presented on the back walls of a Y-maze. Different colours were used to vary chromatic contrast and receptor-specific contrasts. Discrimination was possible whenever shapes presented contrast to the long wavelength receptor but was independent of chromatic contrast, overall intensity contrast or short and middle wavelength receptor contrast. We suggest that the bees used the edges of the closed shapes to solve the task. Bees failed when shapes were rotated, showing that a single shape edge was not sufficient for recognition.

AB Environmental enrichment, defined as housing conditions that include a combination of complex inanimate and social stimulation, has strong positive effects on brain and behaviour in various species. We extended previous studies to evaluate how enrichment affects mating success. In a series of experiments, we found that male fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, reared in an enriched environment were twice as successful in acquiring mates as were males from standard rearing conditions. The dominant factor increasing mating success was the larger space available per fly. Flies from enriched and standard environments showed no significant behavioural differences, leading us to suggest that different social environments at high and low per capita spaces are associated, on average, with either subtle behavioural differences or distinct pheromonal profiles to which females are sensitive while choosing mates.

AB When females mate with more than one male during their reproductive cycle, males may increase their share of paternity by copulating repeatedly with the same female. Accordingly, males should mate repeatedly with the same female more frequently when the risk of sperm competition is greater. We examined this idea experimentally in the orb-web spider Nephila edulis, which is characterized by both extreme sexual size dimorphism and extreme male size variation. Comparison of the mating behaviour of solitary and pairs of males on the webs of virgin and mated females revealed that males adjust the frequency and duration of copulation according to the mating history of the female and the presence of rival males. Males copulated more frequently and for longer with virgin than mated females. The copulation behaviour of males in the presence of rivals depended upon their relative size. Typically, larger males prevented smaller rivals from gaining access to the female and therefore were able to copulate more frequently. Smaller males copulated less frequently, but for longer periods, which may have increased their share of paternity. The size of male N. edulis can vary by an order of magnitude, and our results suggest that this variation may be maintained by the alternative size-dependent strategies of preventing or winning sperm competition.

AB We compared the efficiency of two mate-finding strategies exploited by representatives of the beetle families Cisidae and Anobiidae (genus Dorcatoma) that live inside fruiting bodies of wood-decaying fungi. In the Cisidae both sexes are attracted to host odour, but no pheromones seem to be present (nonpheromone strategy). In the Dorcatoma species only the females are attracted to host odour, but having found a host they attract males with a sexual pheromone (pheromone strategy). With a simulation model, we compared the efficiency of the two strategies at four densities of trees hosting fungal fruiting bodies and at three relative densities of insects. We found only small differences in efficiency between the two strategies at high relative densities of conspecific individuals, regardless of host tree density. The pheromone strategy was relatively more efficient when the relative density of insects or the density of host trees decreased. Thus, species adopting the nonpheromone strategy are probably more sensitive to habitat fragmentation and more likely to decline and go extinct at low population densities (because of Allee effects) than species using the pheromone strategy.

AB The single enlarged claw of male sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, is used in contests for control of breeding burrows. The larger of the two contestants has the larger claw and usually wins. Males use one or more of 10 agonistic elements that vary in intensity from a no-contact extension of the claw to the flip of an opponent. We used the sequence of elements employed and the duration of unstaged, naturally occurring contests in a South Carolina salt marsh to evaluate three models of extended contests: (1) energetic war of attrition, (2) cumulative assessment and (3) sequential assessment. Contests usually began with elements of low action intensity and often proceeded to elements of high intensity. Elements of higher intensity were correlated with both contest duration and the number of contest elements. Contest duration increased as opponents became more evenly matched in size, a result consistent with both cumulative and sequential assessment models. Variation in duration increased as the relative sizes of opponents increased, also in accordance with sequential assessment. The absolute size of the smaller contestant had no effect on contest duration, in contrast to predictions based on cumulative assessment or energetic war of attrition models. Contestants that lost a fight were more likely to engage immediately in another fight without loss of contest intensity, if their previous fight had been long and intense. This result is inconsistent with contests of endurance, such as the energetic war of attrition or the cumulative assessment game, but it is consistent with the ritualized display of strength and fighting skill. Thus, sequential assessment appears to best explain ritualized fiddler crab contests. Cumulative assessment, however, may be the appropriate model for extended, nonritualized, all-out fights. Cumulative assessment may also explain the tenure of individuals on breeding grounds where multiple engagements are likely to test endurance and tolerance to damage over a period of days.

AB State dependence is thought to be an important factor in resource allocation decisions, particularly in those decisions relating to parental care. Incubation behaviour is a costly part of avian parental care, and therefore likely to depend on the parent's body condition. We manipulated the body condition of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, during incubation by using prelaying diets of different protein content, and induced birds to lay a similar number of eggs. We tested the hypothesis that birds in better body condition would invest more in incubation than birds in poorer condition when incubating on the same diet. Females that had received a high-protein prelaying diet lost more body mass than those that had received a low-protein diet. They also increased the length of their incubation bouts between early and middle incubation, whereas females that had received a low-protein prelaying diet increased bout length only between middle and late incubation. There were no differences between males from the two diet groups, and males were responsible for a lesser proportion of incubation than females. These results indicate that incubation behaviour is state dependent in female zebra finches, and that birds of different body condition adopt different incubation strategies. We found no differences in incubation duration and hatching success between the two incubation strategies in captivity, but the potential risk of nest predation in the wild may differ. We suggest that only females in good condition can afford to adopt a strategy of increasing bout length early in incubation; females in poorer condition first have to recover their body condition after having produced a clutch.

AB The evolutionary basis for female mate choice in lek mating systems has been a common subject of research in animal behaviour. Because males apparently provide only gametes to females in lekking species, most research has focused on possible indirect (genetic) benefits that females might gain by discriminating among males. Despite the emphasis on indirect benefits, it has been recognized that females in non-resource-based systems such as leks could potentially gain direct benefits via mate choice if males varied in fertilization abilities, for example. Previous evidence has, shown that females of a lekking Hawaiian Drosophila, D. grimshawi, vary in fecundity when mated to certain males, and that females possess preferences for vigorously courting males. This study tests the hypothesis that D. grimshawi females gain direct benefits by preferentially mating with more sexually vigorous males. Male courtship vigour (performance of wing and head-under-wing displays) and the consequences of female choice on offspring production were evaluated separately using different females. Unexpectedly, matings involving more vigorously courting males resulted in fewer offspring being produced. Reduced offspring number resulted because females laid fewer eggs when mating with males having greater courtship success. These results are discussed in light of sexual conflict and possible multiple mating by females. Females also demonstrated considerable variation in mating behaviour and behavioural variation was correlated with mating benefits. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID AFRICAN WILD DOG; LYCAON-PICTUS; PRIMATES; SIZE
AB We used data from a natural experiment on adult female chacma baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, to test the hypothesis that variation in aggression through time influences patterns of grooming reciprocity within A social group.-Owing to a change in the baboons' competitive regime, we were able to compare data from periods when aggression was high (period 1) and low (period 2). During period 2, the slope of the relationship between aggression and rank was significantly shallower than during period 1 and less aggression was directed at the lowest-ranking females. suggesting there had been a reduction in the dominance gradient. We attributed this to reduced effectiveness of dominance as a means of excluding other females from feeding resources. The reduction in aggression during period 2 was accompanied by an increase in grooming reciprocity between dyads suggesting that high-ranking females no longer attracted grooming by subordinates in exchange for tolerance, and that grooming in period 2 was exchanged. for its intrinsic benefits. The loss of rank-related effects on grooming reciprocity in period 2 compared with period 1 further confirmed this. These findings show that female baboons are able to respond flexibly and swiftly to changes in their social circumstances and that a dynamic approach to primate social interactions is worth pursuing.

AB Sperm competition has been a major selective force acting on male and female behaviour. Theory predicts that when sperm compete numerically, selection will favour males that vary the number of sperm they transfer with sperm competition risk. This often leads to increased copula duration when sperm competition risk is high, the selective advantage of which is increased paternity. We investigated the copulatory behaviour of the common dung fly Sepsis cynipsea in relation to male and female size, female mating status, age, and presence or absence of dung. This fly is unusual in that males mate-guard before copula while females use the sperm of previous males for their current clutch. Body size had no effect on copula duration, but duration of first copulations depended on female age, with older females having longer copulations. For females that copulated twice, there was an interaction between female age and mating status influencing copula duration: old females had longer copulations than young females, but second copulas were longer for young females. Residual testis size of nonvirgin males was smaller than for virgins, and testis shrinkage was significantly associated with copula duration, which indicates that males transfer more ejaculate with longer copulations. We therefore conclude that copulation duration and ejaculate transfer vary in accordance with sperm competition theory. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   INTRODUCTIONS
AB Behavioural flexibility has long been thought to provide advantages for animals when they invade novel environments. This hypothesis has recently received empirical support in a study of avian species introduced to New Zealand, but it remains to be determined whether behavioural flexibility is a general mechanism influencing invasion success. In this study, we examined introduction success of 69 bird species in different regions of the world as a function of their degree of behavioural flexibility. Specifically, we predicted that species with relatively large brains and a high frequency of foraging innovations in their area of origin should show a higher probability of establishing themselves where they were introduced than species with small brains and low innovation frequencies. An analysis with general linear modelling (GLM) supported the prediction for relative brain size, even when controlling for phylogenetic biases and potential confounding variables. The only covariates that remained with relative brain size were plumage dimorphism, human commensalism and nest site. A pairwise comparison of closely related species also revealed that successful invaders showed a higher frequency of foraging innovations in their region of origin. This result held even when differences in research effort between species were considered. Overall, the results confirm and generalize the hypothesis that behavioural flexibility is a major determinant of invasion success in birds. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Talitrid amphipods spend their days burrowed in sand to avoid predators as well as desiccation and heat stress, although other factors may influence burrowing depth. We investigated the potential role of mermithid nematode parasites in determining burrowing depth in the amphipod Talorchestia quoyana. Mermithids grow as parasites inside amphipods until they reach adulthood, when they must emerge from their host into moist sand to complete their life cycle and reproduce. When allowed to burrow to a depth of their choice in experimental situations, large amphipods burrowed deeper than small ones. In addition, deep-burrowing amphipods were more likely to be infected by mermithid nematodes, and harboured longer worms, on average, than amphipods that burrowed close to the sand surface. This last result is not an artefact of the larger size of deep-burrowing amphipods: the increase in worm length with increasing depth was found after statistical correction for host size. In other words, amphipods that burrowed deeper harboured longer worms than expected based on their body size, whereas those that stayed near the surface of the sand column harboured worms shorter than one would expect based on host size. This implies that the greater burrowing depth of infected amphipods is a consequence, and not a cause, of infection. These results emphasize the importance of parasitism as a determinant of the small-scale spatial distribution of their hosts. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We conducted a playback experiment to study the effect of predation risk on the attraction of forest passerines to heterospecific territory songs and mobbing calls during the breeding season. The experiment consisted of five treatments, which were played at different distances from the nests of sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus: the territory song and mobbing calls of the willow tit, Parus montanus, and of the redwing, Turdus iliacus, with classical music as a control. Song may indicate the absence of predators whereas mobbing indicates a potential danger. We assumed that predation risk increases with decreasing distance to a hawk's nest. Therefore, we predicted that the correlation between the number of species attracted and increasing predation risk would be positive for song and negative for mobbing calls. We also examined the effect of body mass on the species' responses. In general, song and mobbing calls attracted more species than the control. For both willow tit and redwing treatments, mobbing calls elicited the strongest response and these attracted more species the lower the predation risk. Attraction to territory songs, however, did not vary in relation to predation risk. Small bird species (<20 g) showed increasing attraction to mobbing calls with decreasing risk, but large bird species did not. Out results suggest that birds exploit heterospecific signals in their decision making but under the constraints of predation risk. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The polygyny threshold model states that secondary females gain benefits from high territory quality that outweigh the costs of sharing a male. We aimed to test this prediction using the dusky warbler as a model species. We first showed that neither the shifted sex ratio hypothesis nor the no-cost models were likely to apply to our study. Secondary females settled in territories of higher quality (high food abundance, low predator density) and had a nonsignificantly higher reproductive success than simultaneously settling monogamous females. However, there were strong indications that these two groups of females differed intrinsically. Secondary females were older than late monogamous females, and while they replaced lost clutches more often, they also suffered from a nonsignificantly higher winter mortality. Consequently, it was impossible to tell whether differences in reproductive success were caused by differences in territory quality or in female qualities. Our study suggests that female choice may also depend on characteristics that are specific to the individual, and may therefore be more sophisticated than allowed for in traditional polygyny models. In other words, the polygyny threshold may be not the same for all individuals. We suggest that prior breeding experience may help older females to profit more from the benefits and to suffer less from the costs of polygyny than young females.

We used experiments and randomization tests to explore the division of labour within such teams in the New World army ant Eciton burchelli, and the Old World army ant Dorylus wilverthi. We evaluated these teams in the light of a recent proposal that teams should be defined in terms of the concurrent performance of different subtasks by their members. This is a broader and more useful definition of teams than a previous one in which teams were defined by a membership necessarily involving different castes. Within army ant teams there is a front runner who initiates prey retrieval and one or more followers. Hence, there are two qualitatively different subtasks that must be performed concurrently during such teamwork. Previous work has shown that these teams are superefficient: the combined weight of the prey retrieved by the team is greater than the sum of the maximum weights the team members could carry when working singly. Here we show, for both species of army ant, that such teams have a nonrandom composition of members. The front runner is typically unusually large and the second-largest ant in a team is typically unusually small. These analyses are based on worker dry weights rather than assigning, workers to discrete caste categories. Our analysis also suggests that the behaviour of army ants is more sophisticated then previously suspected. Our data imply that if an unnecessarily large supplementary ant (follower) tries to help the front runner to move a large prey item, but finds that the remaining work is too slight to use her full efforts, she does not join the team. One or more smaller ants whose efforts become fully employed become involved instead. This suggests that army ants engaged in teamwork have both upper and lower workload thresholds.

AB Determining whether males make energetic trade-offs between immunity and reproduction remains difficult, partly because of the complexity of the vertebrate immune system. We studied this question in an insect, which has a simpler immune system. We estimated immunocompetence in the cricket Gryllus texensis by measuring: (1) phenoloxidase (PO) activity, (2) haemocyte number and (3) susceptibility to the bacterium Serratia marcescens. From the last instar to prereproductive adulthood, immunocompetence in males was similar to that observed in females. When males reached the age at which they begin to display reproductive behaviour, PO activity and resistance to S. marcescens declined relative to females and younger males. In females, PO activity increased after the onset of sexual behaviour, relative to female nymphs and prereproductive adult females. Both males and females showed a decline in immunocompetence in old age. Neither weight nor body length correlated with resistance to S. marcescens in either sex. Haemocyte number did not differ between males and females at any age, did not change significantly with the onset of sexual behaviour, and did not correlate with resistance to S. marcescens, suggesting that it does not reflect immunocompetence. These results suggest that immunocompetence decreased in reproductively active males, supporting the hypothesis that males trade off immunity for reproduction. Our results also suggest that immunocompetence may increase in reproductively active females. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Living in groups, as most primate species do, can be of great advantage in learning when, how and on what to feed. We tested the hypothesis that social influences foster the acquisition of a safe diet; we investigated whether in tufted capuchins, Cebus apella, social influences on novel food consumption (already demonstrated for this species) are stronger when the physical characteristics of the food eaten by group members and the novel food presented to the subject are the same. In experiment 1, we investigated whether group members eating a food of the same colour makes a novel food more acceptable to the subject than group members eating food of a different colour; in experiment 2, we provided the subject with a choice between a bowl with novel food whose colour matched the food eaten by group members and a bowl with novel food whose colour did not match. Subjects spent more time eating the food matching the colour of the group members' food, but did not ingest more of it (experiment 1) and, when given a choice, did not eat the matching food more than the nonmatching food (experiment 2). Therefore, since social influences were not directed to a specific food target, the hypothesis that these foster the individual's diet acquisition is not supported. Instead, our results support the view that social influences increase acceptance of novel foods or synchronize feeding activities. (C) 2001 The Association for the study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Seyfarth (1977, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 65, 671-698) proposed a model of social grooming among female monkeys that has had an enormous influence in the primatological literature. To test this model, I reviewed published data on primate grooming behaviour, using meta-analytical techniques. An analysis of grooming behaviour in 27 different social groups belonging to 14 different species revealed that a significant role in the distribution of grooming was played by attraction to high-ranking animals, attraction to kin and competition for grooming partners. These results confirm the majority of the predictions of the model. The need for more observational data on grooming (and other affiliative interactions) in New World monkeys, and experimental data on the relations between the exchange of grooming and the formation of agonistic alliances, is emphasized., (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Group territoriality associated with aggressive intergroup interactions is characteristic of most cooperatively breeding species. Neighbours, however, are not only competitors but also potential mates. Intergroup interactions might provide a direct mechanism for the assessment of breeding opportunities in neighbouring groups. I studied 228 intergroup interactions in wild cooperatively breeding common marmosets to understand how animals might balance their cooperation in territorial defence with their assessment of neighbours as potential mates. Intergroup interactions included both agonistic and nonagonistic behaviour. Aggression was directed primarily to same-sex individuals. Reproductive females' involvement in intergroup interactions decreased during the last 2 months of pregnancy and during the first 2 months of lactation. Subordinate females participated more often than reproductive females in territorial defence but they were also more involved in nonagonistic interactions with animals from other groups. Intergroup copulations involved mainly subordinate females, and occurred both during forays into other groups and during agonistic intergroup encounters in the subordinate female's territory. Eldest helper females were more likely than younger females to chase away other individuals, but were also more likely to engage in extragroup copulations. Cooperation by helpers in territorial defence might decrease the cost of defence for the breeders. Furthermore, our data indicate that assessment of neighbours does not occur solely during individual forays into other groups' territories. Helpers' participation in intergroup interactions in their own territory might provide direct benefits related to dispersal decisions as well by allowing nonreproductive individuals to assess individuals from neighbouring groups, evaluate potential breeding vacancies and increase familiarity with neighbouring groups.

AB Alarm-calling behaviour is common in many species that suffer from predation. While kin selection or reciprocal altruism are typically invoked to explain such behaviours, several authors have conjectured that some alarm calls may instead be costly signals sent by prey to inform approaching predators that they have been detected. We develop a general game-theoretical model, the watchful babbler game, in which prey signal awareness to predators. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for alarm calls to function as honest signals. We show that signals can honestly reveal prey awareness if (1) the prey's sense of predation risk accurately reflects the probability that the predator is present, and (2) greater awareness of the predator allows the prey a greater chance of escape. When honest signalling is possible, the model predicts that prey will be more willing to signal when predators are common than when predators are rare, and that greater pursuit costs to the predator will allow cheaper signals by the prey.

AB To determine the combined effects of depth, discharge and time of day on the distribution and velocity use of juvenile barbel, Barbus barbus, we observed groups of 20 fish over replicate 24-h periods at dawn, midday, dusk and midnight in an artificial channel. Four combinations of depth and discharge were examined (low depth-low discharge: LDLS; high depth-low discharge: HDLS; low depth-high discharge: LDHS; high depth-high discharge: HDHS). At dawn and midday, the fish were more aggregated than at dusk and midnight, regardless of depth and discharge. However, the latter variables did have a subtle effect on distribution, but only through a complex interaction with time of day, which we detected by a combination of a modified index of distribution and a wider reference lattice. In particular, at dusk and midnight juvenile barbel were dispersed under lentic conditions of HDLS, were reaggregated when velocities increased at LDLS and HDHS, and were dispersed again under the more lotic conditions of LDHS. Furthermore, the weighted used area for velocity decreased dramatically under LDHS and was highest at HDLS. The ecological significance of these results is discussed, with special attention to their Likely consequences for foraging, growth and, ultimately, recruitment success in barbel.

AB Owing to common descent, related species often show similarity in a number of traits, including those involved in communication. As a result signal similarity and phylogenetic distance are usually inversly, related. However, similarity in signal structure need not correspond with similarity in response to such signals. We tested the hypothesis that individuals are more responsive to signals from closely related species than from distantly related ones. We conducted playback experiments on two turtle dove species (African collared-dove, Streptopelia roseogrisea, and vinaceous dove, Streptopelia vinacea) using conspecific and heterospecific vocalizations. Vocalizations were played from species that differed in degree of relatedness and in relative geographical distribution This enabled us to separate the effects of phylogeny and those of sympatry. There was an effect of phylogenetic distance, with a decrease in response to playback stimuli as phylogenetic distance increased. The results also suggest. a minor effect of sympatry, with the response to sympatric species being lower. (C) 2001 The Association for the study of Animal Behaviour.

   PREDATION RISK; FLOCK SIZE; ANTIPREDATORY VIGILANCE; WILD CHIMPANZEES
AB Predation is considered one of the most important selective pressures on free-ranging animals. Our understanding of it derives mainly from studies of individual vigilance (visual scanning of the surroundings beyond the immediate vicinity) and aggregation in prey. Vigilance bears a direct relationship to aggregation, because animals in groups may rely on associates for early warning of danger. This review addresses the relationship between vigilance and aggregation with particular attention to the prediction that individual vigilance declines with increasing group size. Contrary to most other animals studied, primates do not support the prediction. Exploring this, I examined the assumptions underlying vigilance theory in the light of primate behaviour. First I tested whether manual harvesting and upright processing of food as seen among primates might permit them to feed and scan simultaneously. I found no support for this idea. Next I examined the targets of primate vigilance and found that one component (within-group vigilance) might explain the differences between primates and other animals. Finally, I evaluated whether individual primates in large groups face a lower risk of predation than those in small groups. A conclusion was impossible, but by separating group-level from individual-level risk, I was able to identify several common circumstances in which group size would not predict individual risk or vigilance. These circumstances arose for primates and nonprimates alike. I concluded that the relationship of vigilance to aggregation is not straightforward. The absence of a group-size effect on vigilance among primates is probably due to functional differences in vigilance behaviour or safety in groups, not to methodological differences. Furthermore, future work on animal vigilance and aggregation must fully consider both the targets of glances, and the assumption that larger groups are safer from predators. I predict that animals will not relax vigilance in larger groups if conspecific threat increases with group size. Group size will not predict individual risk of predation nor individual vigilance rates when predators do not rely on surprise, or when predators select a small subset of highly vulnerable group members.

AB We examined the relationship between mate fidelity and breeding site tenacity during a 5-year study of the black turnstone, Arenaria melanocephala, a socially monogamous sandpiper breeding in subArctic Alaska. We tested the predictions of several hypotheses regarding the incidence of divorce and the benefits of fidelity to mate and breeding site. Interannual return rates to the breeding grounds (88% for males, 79% for females) were among the highest yet recorded for any scolopacid sandpiper, and 88% of returning birds nested on their previous year's territory. The annual divorce rate was only 11%, and mate fidelity was significantly linked to fidelity to territory but independent of sex and year. Males arrived in spring significantly earlier than their mates and interannual fidelity was influenced by the relative timing of arrival of pair members. Reunited pairs had significantly higher hedging success than new pairs formed after death or divorce. The incidence of divorce was unrelated to reproductive success the previous year, although birds nested significantly further away after failure than after a successful nesting attempt. Sightings of marked individuals suggested that members of pairs do not winter together, and breeding site tenacity provides a mechanism through which pair members can reunite. We reject the 'incompatibility' hypothesis for divorce in turnstones, and our data contradict predictions of the 'better option' hypothesis. Alternatively, we propose the 'bet-hedging' hypothesis to explain the occurrence of divorce, which transpires when an individual pairs with a new mate to avoid the cost of waiting for a previous mate to return. Such costs can include remaining unmated, if the former mate has died, or experiencing lower reproductive success because of delayed breeding.

AB I investigated how male size, condition and age influence both time spent calling and how signals are apportioned throughout the night (i.e. temporal calling pattern) in the Texas field cricket, Gryllus integer. I quantified male calling time and temporal calling pattern using an electronic apparatus that continuously monitored male calling/noncalling behaviour throughout the night. Male condition, measured using the residuals from an allometric regression of male mass on overall body size, did not explain any variation in either time spent calling or temporal calling pattern. However, some intrapopulation variation in time spent calling and temporal calling pattern was explained by differences in male size and age. Large males called more often than small males. Young and very old adult males called significantly less often than middle-age males. As males aged they initiated calling earlier in the evening, probably increasing their susceptibility to parasitism by the tachinid parasitoid Ormia ochracea. Overall, age and size differences explained 10-40% of signalling variation in male G. integer. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We tested for an association between divorce rate and site fidelity in 42 avian species belonging to the order Ciconiiformst using comparative methods that account for the influences of phylogenetic relationships on the data. Our methods enabled us to detect evidence of correlated evolution and provided information on the temporal ordering of evolutionary changes in these two variables.-We found a significant correlation between divorce rate and site fidelity, indicating that species with little or no site fidelity are more likely to divorce. Our data Suggest that the coupled evolution of divorce and site fidelity can be summarized by three major events. The first event corresponds to a transition from species showing high divorce rate and low or no site fidelity to species that tended to reuse the same nests over consecutive breeding seasons. This was followed by a transition towards higher mate fidelity, with the preservation of pair bonds over consecutive breeding attempts. In a third stage, divorce rate and the rate of site fidelity varied, independently of each other, We discuss our results within the context of the ancestor species and the past environments in which the traits originated, and address the importance of the potential for individual recognition in shaping the observed patterns of covariation between mate fidelity and site fidelity in Ciconiiforms.

AB Studies conducted in laboratory streams have shown that juvenile salmonid fish (parr) can differentiate between their kin and nonkin and may be less aggressive towards their kin. Chemicals produced by salmonids are also known to be used as cues to aid kin recognition. We tested the hypothesis that the ability of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, to recognize kin and hence modulate their level of aggression is influenced by the amount of water recirculation, which would be expected to affect the concentration of odour. Levels of aggression were similar between pairs of kin and pairs of nonkin when there was negligible recirculation of water. However, when water was recirculated, pairs of nonkin were on average 1.56 times more aggressive than pairs of kin, owing to an increase in attacks by the dominant fish. The data do not support the idea that odour concentration affects kin recognition and hence reduces aggression among siblings. Instead they indicate that recirculation of water instigates heightened aggression in dominant fish but only towards nonkin subordinates. The study suggests that the advantages for juvenile salmonids of associating with kin vary spatially, being influenced by water flow dynamics.

AB Studying variations in behaviour at the individual or population level enables insight into the reproductive strategies within a species. We examined individual and geographical variation in the vocal and dive behaviour of male harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, which is associated with aquatic mating. This display behaviour was recorded in the Moray Firth, Scotland, from July 1994 to 1997, and in Orkney, Scotland, during July 1998. One vocalization type was apparent in the Moray Firth and two in Orkney. Time parameters (total and pulse duration) varied between males in the population in the Moray Firth. We used both frequency and time parameters in a discriminant analysis, which showed that 73.2% of individual male vocalizations could be correctly classified; 94.6% of male vocalizations from the Moray Firth and Orkney could be correctly classified according to their geographical areas. Therefore, vocal variation was greater between geographical areas than between individuals. No individual variation was apparent between dive and surface interval durations. However, individuals varied significantly in the percentage of short surface intervals. Male harbour seals showed substantial variability in the parameters affecting their vocal and dive behaviour during the mating season. We suggest that these variations may be indicative of adaptations to varying environmental challenges influencing the reproductive strategies of discrete populations.

AB Multiple spermathecae potentially allow selective sperm use, provided that sperm from rival males are stored differentially, that is, in different proportions across storage compartments. In the yellow dung fly, Scatophaga stercoraria, females have three spermathecae arranged as a doublet and singlet. To test whether females store the sperm of rival males actively and differentially, we mated fixed male pairs to three females. After copulation, females were (1) dissected immediately before they could start laying a clutch of eggs, (2) left awake for 30 min but prevented from oviposition, or (3) anaesthetized with carbon dioxide for 30 min to interfere with the muscular control presumably required for sperm transport from the site of insemination to the spermathecae. For each female, we estimated the proportion of the second male's sperm stored in her spermathecae (S-2 value), using sperm length as a male marker. After copulation, the S-2 values in the singlet and doublet spermathecae differed significantly, indicating differential sperm storage during copulation. Postcopulatory treatment affected differential sperm storage significantly. Females dissected immediately had lower S-2 values in the doublet than in the singlet spermatheca, while females left awake showed the reverse pattern for the same two males. This reversal did not occur when females were treated with carbon dioxide. The results indicate differential storage of sperm from different males during copulation and that female muscular activity can affect storage and separation of competing ejaculates beyond copulation.

AB The possibility that frequency-dependent cheating can persist in an evolutionarily stable communication system has frequently been proposed. Although there is empirical evidence for this idea, however, it has not been investigated in terms of game theory. In the present paper I show for a simple symmetric game that cheating can be part of a mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). Furthermore, despite the widespread assumption that cheaters must be rare, I show that most of the population can be cheaters, while the signalling system remains evolutionarily stable. Consequences for signalling theory and experiments to detect such mixed ESS are discussed. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Self-directed behaviour (SDB) can be used as a behavioural indicator of stress and anxiety in nonhuman primates (Maestripieri et al. 1992, Animal Behaviour, 44, 967-979). We investigated the effect of nearest neighbours' relative dominance status on the SDB of sexually mature female olive baboons, Papio anubis. When the animal nearest to (within 5 m of) a female was a dominant individual, SDB rates (a combined measure of self-scratching, self-grooming, self-touching, body shaking and yawning) increased by ca. 40% over those observed when the nearest neighbour was a subordinate. The results indicate that (1) SDB can be used as a measure of uncertainty during the social interactions of cercopithecine primates and (2) as there was considerable variation in SDB response according to the nature of the dominant individual, SDB can be used to assess relationship security (i.e. the perceived predictability of a relationship for one partner). Finally, in combination with measures of affiliation rate, SDB may provide insight into relationship value. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Size and stability of vertebrate leks
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PHILOMACHUS-PUGNAX; MATING SKEW; LEKKING
AB Lek size varies greatly among lekking species. At present there is no explicit theoretical explanation for this diversity. We extend an existing model of optimal lek size that incorporates female mating preferences and male-male contest competition. The model shows that variation in lek size is predicted by the interaction between lek size, overall copulation rate and the proportion of copulations accruing to males of different rank. In species where females prefer to mate on the largest leks and high-ranking males are able to monopolize females irrespective of the size of the lek, the maximum lek size will be large. Conversely, in species where females show weak preference for mating on large leks or increasing lek size quickly results in scramble competition, the maximum lek size will be Smaller. Thus, differences between species in lek size may be due largely to differences in the extent to which high-ranking males can monopolize mating opportunities. Leks become unstable and break down when high-ranking males can no longer get their 'expected' copulation success. Therefore, the mechanism that generates male clustering, that is, sexual parasitism of high-ranking males by subordinates, also sets a limit to the largest stable lek size.

AB The timing of songs during vocal interactions in male passerines is an important component in territorial signalling as it can reflect information on the singer's state or possibly its quality. Using interactive playback, I investigated effects pf song alternation and song overlapping on the nocturnal singing behaviour of nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos. Subjects timed their songs differently depending on whether the playback songs overlapped their songs or,alternated with them. During overlapping treatments, subjects sang at higher rates and interrupted more songs than during alternating treatments. In addition, during alternating treatments subjects sang at higher rates when they had been exposed to the overlapping treatment than when the alternating treatment was the first treatment they had received. These latter responses indicate that timing of songs is not just an immediate effect such as to avoid signal masking but that prior experience with a rival influences the way an individual uses its song. The results thus suggest that not only song overlapping but also the timing of songs during alternating singing carries important information. Individual differences in response suggest further that state (e.g. arousal or motivation) or possibly quality of a territorial male is important for decisions on how it responds vocally.

AB We examined the possible roles of maternal transmission and independent learning In the development and perpetuation of kin networks across generations of free-ranging rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta, on Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. We tested predictions derived from maternal transmission and independent learning hypotheses by examining the extent to which variation in the degree of kin bias displayed by individual infants was related to variation in mother-infant interaction and aspects of the infant's social environment. High levels of kin bias in infants were related independently to high levels of both proximity to the mother and to potential social risk. At 25-30 weeks of age, infants displayed degrees of kin bias that were moderately correlated with those of their mothers. However, infants that spent large amounts of time near the mother did not necessarily develop degrees of kin bias that were highly similar to those of their mothers. The extent to which infants developed degrees of kin bias similar to their mothers was significantly correlated with: the degree to which they experienced similar levels of social risk. The results suggest that, while intense mother-infant interaction contributes to the development of high degrees of kin bias in infants, the perpetuation of similar degrees of kin bias across generations may depend on mothers and infants having similar experiences with mutual kin and nonkin. We suggest that the perpetuation of kin bias across generations may be viewed as socially biased independent learning (Galef 1995, Animal Behaviour, 49, 1325-1334).

AB Social insects use both environmental and heritable (genetic) recognition cues when discriminating between nestmates and non-nestmates. In honeybees, Apis mellifera, both types of recognition cues are used, although their relative importance depends upon context, experimental design and environmental factors. Our aim in this study was to investigate which cues honeybees use to discriminate between nestmates and non-nestmates under natural conditions. To do this, we used an assay of nestmate recognition that very closely simulated natural conditions, with naturally occurring guards at actual nest entrances and workers that had been naturally reared and had spent their adult life in a hive. Guards exclusively used environmental recognition cues when encountering entering bees. There was no evidence that guards used heritable cues: related nestmates and unrelated nestmates, unrelated non-nestmates and related non-nestmates all had the same probability of being accepted (ca. 80 versus 20%). Possible reasons why heritable cues are not used are discussed. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB 'Species-specific' mating signals may not make a significant contribution to sexual isolation if differences between species are not matched by narrowly tuned differences in female preferences. The courtship song of the melanogaster species group of Drosophila has been studied by several researchers as a potential factor in sexual isolation, but there are few clear demonstrations that species differences are behaviourally significant. We played synthetic song with typical pulse interval parameters for D. melanogaster, D. simulans or D. sechellia to D. melanogaster or D, simulans females in the presence of mute males. Females mated most quickly when stimulated by song typical of their own species, confirming that song can influence sexual isolation between these species. This effect was greater in D. melanogaster than D. simulans, which correlates with reduced variability in mean interpulse interval within D. melanogaster. We also examined the role of 'Kyriacou Sr Hall cycles' (periodic cycling of mean interpulse intervals) in D. melanogaster. Contrary to some predictions, the presence of the Kyriacou & Hall cycle was more important in increasing mating speed than the increased variability of interpulse intervals that is inevitably present in song containing a cycle. The large stimulatory effect of cycles on mating speed is curious, given that the periodicity of cycles would probably be difficult for females to detect during courtship in field conditions.

AB Walnuts, Juglans airanthifolia, are an important food item for Japanese squirrels, Sciurus Iis, which hoard them for later use. We set up feeders in small walnut patches in secondary forest, mounted radiotransmitters on nuts, placed them on the feeders and tracked them when they were cached. Of 720 nuts placed on the feeders over a 3-year period, 32.6% were eaten immediately and 50.6% were scatter-hoarded 0-168 m from the feeders. With increasing distance to the cache site, the squirrels took longer to return to the feeders (range 0.35-35 min). However, the further away a cache was, the less likely it was to be stolen by conspecifics or other nut-eating animals: nuts we hoarded ourselves disappeared more quickly from near the source trees. Squirrels took nuts further away later in the season when caches were lost at a higher rate. Using a simple model maximizing the rate of energy gain per unit time taken to search for and hoard the nuts at different distances from the source, we discuss whether squirrels alter the transport distance of hoarding nuts according to cache survival rate and/or nut availability.

AB The bridled nailtail wallaby, Onychogalea fraenata, is a relatively small, solitary and sexually size dimorphic macropod. We studied the mating system of free-ranging wallabies over 3 years, using microsatellite analysis of paternity, radiotelemetry and behavioural observations. Both sexes were promiscuous, and general reproductive behaviour was similar to that of larger, better-known macropods. Home range size influenced the number of associations with oestrous females, and was a significant component of male reproductive success. Female population density varied within the site, but males with home ranges that overlapped more females did not sire more offspring. Aggression between males occurred only around oestrous females and males did not establish a predetermined dominance hierarchy. Male body weight strongly influenced priority of access to oestrous females, and was related to age. The number of times that males were seen closest to anoestrous female when other males were present (priority of access) was the most important predictor of variation in the number of offspring sired. Females mated with several males within and between oestrous cycles, and may have influenced male-male competition by prolonging advertisement of approaching oestrus, expanding their home ranges at oestrus and engaging in mate chases that attracted groups of up to six males. Despite overall similarities in the mating system of this species and that of other macropods, male mating success may be less skewed in bridled nailtail wallabies than in other species, although paternity analysis of free-ranging populations of other species is required to confirm this conclusion.

AB We investigated the response of water voles to the odours of predators in outdoor enclosures. Water voles were given access to two food cages, one containing the odour of a predator and the other containing no odour, and were videotaped for 22 h. Sheep odour was also used as a control for novel odour. The predators were American mink, Mustela vison, and brown rat, Rattus norvegicus. There was no difference in the voles' response to sheep odour and no odour. The voles entered the treatment cages containing the mink's odour significantly fewer times than they entered the control cages, indicating avoidance of the former. They also gathered less food from, and stayed a shorter time inside, the treatment cages. The voles avoided the mink's odour more than the rat's odour. The fact that the experimental animals had not had previous contact with American mink suggests that the response is innate. These results also suggest that water voles perceived mink as a greater risk than rats, although they avoided odours of both these species. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Female-female mounting is widespread among mammalian species, but little is known about the proximal function of this behaviour. While such mounting is often regarded as a 'masculine' trait, its widespread occurrence may indicate that it serves specific functions within the context of female-female social behaviour. We valuated female mounting behaviour in Long-Evans rats in standard observation chambers and in a seminatural enclosure. Under these conditions, we examined a number of potential factors that might influence mounting, including the oestrous cycle, social hierarchy, familiarity and male presence. The female's mounting was not influenced by her own oestrous cycle, but did vary with the oestrous cycle of the stimulus female. Socially dominant females mounted significantly more than subordinate females, and mounting by the dominant female was most frequent when the subordinate female was sexually receptive. Females mounted (and fought with) unfamiliar females significantly more than they did with familiar cagemates. Female-female mounting was dramatically reduced when males were present. Further testing showed that female mounting did not affect the induction of the progestational state of pregnancy, suggesting that female mounting does not function as a pseudomale behaviour that can substitute for genital stimulation provided by the male. Based on these data, female mounting does not appear to function as a sexual behaviour per se, but may serve as a form of female social behaviour related to maintenance of the female's social status within female groups. In this regard, the results of this study suggest that female mounting is part of the normal female's complex behavioural repertoire and does not necessarily reflect masculinization of some underlying neural substrate.

AB Many hypotheses have been put forward to account for the dawn chorus in birds. Few of these, however, are able to account for variation in song output over the whole day, or for differences in daily singing routines between species, individuals, seasons and environmental conditions. One hypothesis that does offer a more general explanation is based on a stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) model of daily singing routines. This model relates the relative costs and benefits of feeding and singing at different times of day to the size of a bird's fat reserves and calculates the optimal daily routines of singing and foraging that will maximize the amount that the bird can sing while avoiding starvation. The use of SDP models in behavioural ecology has become well established, but they remain largely untested empirically. I tested two predictions of the SDP model,of daily routines of singing, using free-living European robins, Erithacus rubecula. The results supported both predictions: (1) food supplementation causing unpredictable short-term increases in foraging success increased subsequent song output; and (2) changes in ambient temperature were positively associated with changes in subsequent song output.

AB Sexual Selection has been portrayed as acting predominantly on males who compete with each other over copulatory access to females; selection was considered to be driven by females choosing between males at the pre- or postcopulatory level. However, a broader view of sexual selection is now emerging. Examining male discrimination between females and female-female competition has been beneficial in identifying factors influencing the direction and strength of sexual selection. Furthermore, consideration of processes such as sexual coercion or genetic incompatibility, which indirectly influence an individual's set of copulation partners, gamete set or their offspring success, has helped to clarify the ways in which sexual selection may operate. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that not all copulations translate directly to paternity and that paternity does not necessarily translate into successful offspring. Postcopulatory and postfertilization mechanisms that influence not only paternity share but offspring recruitment now require further consideration. The benefits to each sex of copulating with particular partners or with more than one partner remains an area of debate. More carefully designed studies which eliminate alternative possibilities or quantify the relative importance of different selective pressures will also benefit from considering that not all copulations function solely to inseminate or receive sperm. It is also now clear that not all individuals of one sex follow the same strategy. Examining the variation between individuals in reproductive behaviour, fertilization success and offspring success will be important in establishing the selective pressures and mechanisms underlying the operation of sexual selection.

AB We studied how male fifteen-spined sticklebacks, Spinachia spinachia, vary in paternal competence, whether males advertise their competence and whether females prefer better fathers. In this species the male alone provides care for the offspring through nest building, fanning, cleaning and protecting the eggs. We found no female preference for larger males. Instead, females preferred males that during the subsequent paternal phase fanned their nests in shorter fanning bouts. Such males enjoyed a significantly higher hatching success because they fanned more often than males with longer fanning bouts. Males that fanned for short bouts during the paternal phase were also able to increase their fin beat rate. Frequent fanning and high fin beat rates may improve the flow of oxygen to the eggs. Beat rate may be a condition-dependent trait, because males that lost more weight were unable to increase their fin beat rate. During courtship, males perform behaviours such as displacement fanning and body shaking. Females preferred males showing more frequent body shakes during courtship. Body shake frequency correlated positively with hatching success, and negatively with mean fanning bout duration during the paternal phase. The results indicate that female S. spinachia show a preference for direct benefits in terms of better paternal care, and that males may signal this ability to females by shaking their body during courtship.

ID COMFORT BEHAVIOR
AB Social facilitation of reproductive behaviour has been studied extensively in gulls and terns, but social facilitation of preening has been reported only anecdotally, and has not been previously quantified. We studied a common tern, Sterna hirundo, colony during the summers of 1996 and 1997 to test for socially facilitated preening. Scan sampling provided evidence of spatial and temporal synchrony of preening behaviour. Preening occurred more often than expected in groups of three or more neighbours. Breeding pairs also preened simultaneously more often than expected. In leafing (resting) areas, the proportion of preeners present increased with tern density. Behavioural observations suggest that preening spread from neighbour to neighbour. The observed clumping in preening behaviour could not be explained by differences in date, time of day or weather. Social facilitation of preening and other maintenance behaviour may be an important aspect of group living that is often overlooked. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB There is increasing evidence to suggest that pheromone-mediated communication may play an important role in mate choice in many insects. We investigated the possible role of pheromones in mate choice in the lekking sandfly, Lutzomyia longipalpis, and explored whether males or females display any behavioural traits that predict patterns of male mating success. Pairs of virgin males were introduced into a small mating chamber and allowed to interact for approximately 10 min prior to the introduction of a Single virgin female. The trial continued until the female copulated with one of the males. We recorded trials on video for later analysis. After a successful copulation, we determined the quantity of pheromone remaining in the glands of both males and measured the size of the pheromone glands and tergites. We corrected behaviours and measurements for body size (tergite width). Mated males had significantly more pheromone present in their glands after a trial than unmated males. Males differed in how much time they invested in wing fanning. Members of each pair of males Spent similar amounts of time wing fanning but mated males and males with more residual pheromone spent more time wing fanning than their counterparts throughout the trial. The time spent wing fanning and the amount of residual pheromone were not correlated, however. A male's ability to win fights did not relate to his reproductive success. Finally, a female was equally likely to wing-fan directly at, or walk away from, either male in a given pair. The possible relationships between the amount of pheromone released and the residual pheromones left in the glands, and the level of male wing fanning and pheromone productivity, are discussed.

TI Nestling mouth colour: ecological correlates of a begging signal
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID EVOLUTION; SONGBIRD; BIRDS; NEED
AB The mouths of begging nestlings vary widely in colour, ranging from yellow in robins, Erithacus rubecula, to red in reed buntings, Emberiza schoeniclus. Two functions have been suggested for bright nestling mouth colour: (1) it may improve the detectability of chicks, particularly in poorly lit nests and (2) within species, it may signal need. We tested these hypotheses in a comparative analysis, measuring the mouth colours of nestlings from 31 species under conditions of standardized light availability and food deprivation. Changes in mouth colour signalled need only among the seed-regurgitating finches. In these species there was a 'red flush' at the onset of begging, which became redder with increasing food deprivation. No other species showed these changes, including the closely related chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs, which feeds its young insects. We found no evidence that mouth colour was correlated with the light available in the nest. We did find, however, that nestlings in darker nests improved their conspicuousness through the relative colour and size of the flange that borders their brightly coloured mouths. Nestlings from darker nests had relatively wider flanges, which were whiter and less densely coloured in relation to their mouth colour, than those of chicks reared in better illuminated nests. Clutch size was not related to mouth or flange colour, or relative flange size. We suggest that nestling mouth colour has not been selected to make chicks detectable, but that this is the function of the surrounding flange. We also discuss reasons why signals of need through mouth colour are not more widespread. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Voluntary wheel running by animals is an activity that has been observed and recorded in great detail for almost a century. This review shows that it is performed, often with startling intensity and coordination, by a wide variety of wild, laboratory and domestic species with diverse evolutionary histories. However, despite the plethora of published studies on wheel running, there is considerable disagreement between many findings, thus leading to a lack of consensus on explanations of the causality and function. In the initial part of this review, I discuss the internal and external factors that may be involved in the causality of this behaviour, with an emphasis on disparities in both the factual and theoretical development of the subject. I then address the various proposed functions of wheel running, again highlighting evidence to the contrary. This leads to the conclusion that any single theory on the basis of wheel running is likely to be simplistic with little generality. I then present a novel, behaviour-based interpretation in which it is argued that wheel running has no directly analogous naturally occurring behaviour, it is (sometimes) performed for its own sake per se rather than as a redirected or substitute activity, and studies on motivation show that wheel running is self-reinforcing and perceived by animals as 'important'. This review proposes that wheel running may be an artefact of captive environments or of the running-wheel itself, possibly resulting from feedback dysfunction. I also discuss the ubiquity and intensity of its performance, along with its great plasticity and maladaptiveness, all indicating that if it is ari artefact, it is nevertheless one of great interest to behavioural science.

TI Responses of aardwolves, <i>Proteles cristatus</i>, Sparrman 1783, to
   translocated scent marks
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; MAMMALS; ODORS; TERRITORIES; STRATEGIES
AB We tested the discrimination abilities of aardwolves by monitoring their response to scent marks of male or female donors varying in familiarity translocated into their territories. We followed aardwolves in a vehicle and collected grass stalks with single fresh scent marks. The next evening we placed these grass stalks at dens and middens in the territory of another aardwolf, which we subsequently followed for the whole night. During 43 experiments 617 stalks were translocated. Of these, 164 were located by the animal followed. Both males and females overmarked more frequently, changed their dens more often and increased their scent-marking rate more when they found scent marks of same-sex donors than those of the opposite sex, except during the mating season;Along territory borders and at middens, the majority of marks were sniffed for short periods and overmarked. However, aardwolves seldom overmarked marks at dens in use and sniffed them for much longer, often showing flehmen. Flehmen and prolonged sniffing seemed to indicate investigatory behaviours. They were most prevalent towards the first mark of a nonresident found that evening and particularly towards strangers' marks or (in the case of males) those of a female during the mating season. Overmarking seemed to be asserting territorial ownership. After locating a neighbour's scent mark the resident also immediately increased its rate of scent-marking and often went directly to the respective border. The results suggest that scent marks may function in intimidating intruders and to synchronize mating in the aardwolf. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Males play a variable parental role in reproduction, ranging from no male parental care to extensive male care. Females may acquire either direct or indirect fitness benefits from their mate choice, and direct fitness benefits include male parental care. Theoreticians have traditionally emphasized direct fitness benefits to females in species with extensive male parental care. We review the literature and show extensive variation in the patterns of male care, related to the attractiveness of males to females. At one extreme of this continuum, females invest differentially in parental care, investing more when paired with attractive males. The costs of female parental care and other aspects of parental investment may be balanced by benefits in terms of more attractive sons and/or more viable offspring. At the other extreme, in species with extensive direct fitness benefits, males with preferred sexual phenotypes provide the largest relative share of parental care. A comparative study of birds revealed that the extent of the differential female parental investment was directly related to the frequency of extra-pair paternity. Since extra-pair paternity may arise mainly as a consequence of female choice for indirect fitness benefits, this result supports our prediction that differential parental investment is prevalent in species where females benefit indirectly from their mate choice. The consequences for sexual selection theory of these patterns of male care in relation to male attractiveness are emphasized. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We created experimental situations where observers (great tit, Parus major and marsh tit, P, palustris) acquired one of five types of experience near conspecific and non-conspecific demonstrators: (1) neither demonstrator was feeding; (2) only the conspecific was feeding; (3) only the non-conspecific was feeding; (4) both were feeding and the observer received a reinforcement (food) near the conspecific; and (5) as (4), but the reinforcement was given near the non-conspecific. After each treatment, we recorded whether the observer approached a caged conspecific or a caged non-conspecific. There was a baseline preference for approaching conspecifics but this could be overcome by learnt associations so that the birds would then approach non-conspecifics. When there was an opportunity to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful foragers (demonstrators), and the successful forager was not conspecific, observers of the dominant species approached the successful subordinate non-conspecifics, Observers of the subordinate species approached the dominant species only if they had received a food reinforcement near them. Observers followed non-conspecific individuals more often at temperatures below than above 0 degrees C and chose a conspecific individual more often above than below 0 degrees C.

AB I investigated the effects of high plasma levels of corticosterone ir. male pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, during the period of territorial establishment and the nestling period. In a second experiment males were exposed to a territorial intruder, a great spotted woodpecker model and a weasel model during the nest-building and nestling periods and their behavioural and hormonal reactions studied. Males were also exposed to handling stress (hormonal study) during these periods. During the period of territorial establishment, corticosterone-treated males, as well as control males, abandoned the territory in which they were captured; however, males in both groups very soon established new territories. During the nestling period, corticosterone-treated males, but not control males, abandoned their nests. During the nest-building period, intact males frequently attacked the territorial intruder but corticosterone-treated males never did; the woodpecker was only rarely attacked by intact males, and the weasel never. During the nestling period, the weasel was not attacked and territorial intruders only rarely; but woodpeckers were frequently attacked. With the progress of the breeding season, male flycatchers significantly reduced their sensitivity, in terms of the adrenocortical response, to all stressors tested. During the nest-building period, corticosterone levels were significantly higher in males exposed to handling, a weasel and a territorial intruder than in unmanipulated males; corticosterone levels in males exposed to a woodpecker did not differ from those in unmanipulated males; and testosterone levels were significantly elevated in males exposed to a woodpecker and to an intruder, but were reduced in males exposed to a weasel. Handling did not affect the testosterone level. During the nestling period, all groups showed low testosterone levels, and only exposure to a weasel and to handling increased corticosterone levels significantly. The results indicate that environmentally induced changes in testosterone and corticosterone secretion can be affected independently from one another, and that there are ecological bases for the differentiated hormonal responses to stress.

AB To determine whether allomaternal care occurs among bottlenose dolphins, we examined patterns of association and mother-infant separations for eight infants (164.4 focal h) during the first 3 months of life. During the first week of life, three inexperienced females (nullipara and mothers of infants that did not survive the newborn period) attempted to take infants from their mothers 13 times. Mothers responded by rapidly retrieving the infant and threatening the female. By the second week, mothers consistently allowed the same females to escort their infants to tens of metres away from them, suggesting that such separations were no longer risky, possibly because infants had imprinted on their mothers. To determine whether escorts benefited mothers after the first week, we compared maternal behaviour when infants were away from their mothers, but alone (solitary separations), to when infants were away, but with escorts (social separations). Mothers were less likely to forage and were more likely to engage in non-foraging activities (socialize, rest or travel) when infants were with young escorts (other dependent infants) compared with when infants were alone. When infants were with older (juvenile or adult) escorts, maternal activity did not differ significantly compared with when infants were alone. This result suggests that escorts did not benefit mothers by allowing them to forage. Inexperienced females that never raised an infant were more likely to escort newborns than were parous experienced females, supporting the 'learning to parent' hypothesis.

   PIGEONS
AB Laboratory investigations into equivalence class formation suggest how animals in social and communicative contexts learn to place dissimilar individuals, signals, responses and social reinforcers into the same functional class. Kastak & Schusterman (1994, Anim. Learn. Behav, 22, 427-435) demonstrated that a California sea lion performed generalized identity matching-to-sample; that is, it chose visual stimulus A conditionally upon an identical sample A (AA matching), chose stimulus B conditionally upon sample B (BB matching) and chose stimulus C conditionally upon sample C (CC matching). The sea lion was later trained on 30 problems with similar stimuli to select comparison B conditionally upon sample A (AB matching), and trained on another 30 problems to select comparison C conditionally upon sample B (BC matching). Subsequently, the sea lion demonstrated trial-1 BA and CB matching and trial-1 AC and CA matching (Schusterman & Kastak 1993, Psychol. Rec., 43, 823-839). Matching of these derived relations defines the phenomenon of stimulus equivalence: when one member (A) of an equivalence class (ABC) becomes discriminative for a given behaviour, then B and C should become discriminative for the same behaviour. In the current study, we tested whether the sea lion could transfer the relations it had acquired between equivalence class members from a matching-to-sample paradigm to a simple discrimination paradigm. In 28 of 30 tests, the sea lion immediately transferred the discriminative function acquired by one member of an equivalence class to the remaining members of that class. Substitutability among members of an equivalence class is relevant to an analysis of referential communication, for example, the representational function of alarm calls.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID LACTATE METABOLISM; EXERCISE; AGGRESSION; RESERVES
AB While much is known about the functional significance of strategic decisions in animal fighting, relatively little is understood about the mechanisms that underlie the making of those decisions. In mechanistic terms, strategic decisions, such as either escalating a fight or giving up, are made in relation to the proximate costs that opponents inflict (or can potentially inflict) upon one another. These costs include physical injury and also the physiological consequences of engaging in an energetically demanding activity. We studied the role of injury and energy metabolism during fights between male cichlid fish, Tilapia zillii. In relation to injuries incurred during fights, scale loss differed depending on whether the winner was smaller or larger than its opponent; smaller winners inflicted significantly more damage on their opponents than they received, whereas this difference was not apparent in those fights won by the larger fish. In relation to energy metabolism, escalated fighting resulted in a significant depletion of total sugar reserves in the muscle and the liver. It appears that the muscle energy reserves are respired anaerobically, as was evident from the accumulation of lactate in the muscle. Losers had significantly higher levels of muscle lactate than winners. Together, the injury data and the metabolic data suggest that escalated fighting is costly for both winners and losers, but especially so for losers. These data are discussed in relation to models of animal decision making and we conclude that the difference between opponents in the proximate costs incurred during fighting is likely to underlie the making of decisions such as continuing, giving up or escalating the fight.

ID EXPERIMENTER-GIVEN CUES
AB Individuals from five primate species were tested experimentally for their ability to follow the visual gaze of conspecifics to an outside object. Subjects were from captive social groups of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, sooty mangabeys, Cercocebus atys torquatus, rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, stumptail macaques, M. arctoides, and pigtail macaques, M. nemestrina. Experimental trials consisted of an experimenter inducing one individual to look at food being displayed, and then observing the reaction of another individual (the subject) that was looking at that individual (not the food). Control trials consisted of an experimenter displaying the food in an identical manner when the subject was alone. Individuals from all species reliably followed the gaze of conspecifics, looking to the food about 80% of the time in experimental trials, compared with about 20% of the time in control trials. Results are discussed in terms of both the proximate mechanisms that might be involved and the adaptive functions that might be served by gaze-following.

AB Blue crabs mate immediately after the female's final moult. We tested the influence of female moult stage, sex ratio and male size on the pre-mating behaviour of both sexes, and the ability of males to pair with females and aggressively compete for access to females. We observed crabs in field enclosures and surveyed pre-copulatory mate-guarding patterns in the field. Female behaviour changed as they progressed through the final moult cycle, such that early moult-stage females avoided males, but late moult-stage females initiated pair formation. The changes in female behaviour influenced both the behaviour and pairing capability of males. Males courted and paired with late moult-stage females on their first attempt, but pursued early moult-stage females because their first attempts to pair often failed. In the field, early moult-stage females were paired less often than late moult-stage females. The pre-mating behaviour of both sexes also varied with sex ratio; when males were abundant, males traded courtship for forced capture and females courted less. Large males were more successful at take-overs, but did not pair more often with late moult-stage females, suggesting that large males do not consistently guard for less time than small males. The changes in female behaviour are consistent with the female's need to avoid the costs of guarding and suggest that females influence how pre-copulatory mate guarding occurs in this species.

AB Land hermit crabs, Coenobita compressus, prefer the odours of foods that they have not recently eaten. I used a laboratory choice assay to quantify observations of these induced food odour preferences and to examine the mechanisms that may underlie the formation of these preferences. A potential benefit of this behaviour to land hermit crabs was examined by measuring the relative growth rates of crabs fed single-item diets and a mixed diet. Sex and age differences among crabs did not affect their formation of odour preferences. Land hermit crabs that were exposed to one food for at least 9 h preferred foods having other odours for the next 6 h. Crabs avoided odours associated with food consumption. In choice assays using artificial diets, crabs consumed more glucose than casein, yet both nutrients generated an equal amount of avoidance. Land hermit crabs that received a multiple-item diet of flowers, snails and seeds had higher relative growth rates than crabs fed single-item diets. Nutritional analyses showed that these foods differed in their nutritional composition, with flowers containing the most carbohydrates, snails containing the most proteins and seeds containing the most lipids. Broader diets resulting from short-term avoidance of food odours may benefit land hermit crabs by increasing relative growth rates, possibly through the consumption of a more nutritionally balanced diet.

AB Female Xiphophorus cortezi responded to olfactory cues from both conspecific males and heterospecific X. nigrensis and X. montezumae males when given a choice between the stimulus and water. When given a choice between the conspecific and heterospecific cues, however, females demonstrated a strong preference for the conspecific stimulus. Of the two heterospecific species, females responded more strongly to their close relative X. nigrensis than they did to the more distantly related X. montezumae. Mate recognition in northern swordtails is evidently not a simple process based upon a response to one variable, but the outcome of complex responses to information from at least both visual and olfactory cues.

AB Social interactions in red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, are complex and often depend upon the sex and reproductive status of individuals. In the population at Mountain Lake Biological Station, Virginia, adult males outnumber sexually active (gravid) females by approximately 2:1, because males court annually while females accept mates only biennially. Field observations of male P. cinereus suggest that males maintain feeding territories and allow non-gravid (not sexually active) females access to their territories for foraging, whereas they defend their territories against intrusion by males. We used a game-theoretic analysis of models of male fitness to examine conditions that would favour the evolution of this 'permissive' behaviour. Under a series of increasingly realistic behavioural assumptions, we found that the critical factor in the evolution of male permissive behaviour is female preference for permissive males. If non-gravid females are more likely to return to mate with a male that allows access to his territory, then permissive behaviour is likely to evolve. Furthermore, the evolution of permissive behaviour is facilitated when energetic losses due to territorial defence exceed those due to allowing females to forage.

AB Observations of captive female brown capuchin monkeys in five groups revealed that grooming is primarily the occupation of dominant females at both the individual and dyadic levels. When categorized according to rank class, alpha females were the only class to perform significantly more grooming than they received. These results are inconsistent with reports on vervets. baboons and macaques, and suggest that grooming in capuchin monkeys may have different functions from those reported for cercopithecine primates. A dyadic analysis revealed, however, that grooming occurred more often between closely ranked females, similar to what is seen in several Old World monkey species. Therefore, some aspects of grooming in capuchins are similar to that seen in Old World monkeys, but the way they distribute grooming is different, which may prompt a re-evaluation of current theories regarding the social function of allogrooming in non-human primates.

AB In lekking black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, males at the centre of the leks obtain more copulations than males at the edges. We found that males with territories at the edge of the lek obtained fewer matings and also have the most asymmetric tarsi. However, when considering the tail ornament (the lyre) no correlation between asymmetry and mating success was found. Although females are unlikely to select males on the basis of tarsus symmetry, asymmetry in this trait may reflect male condition. We suggest that males in poor condition, as reflected by higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry in the tarsi, do not achieve central positions on the lek arena. This would account for the lower success of males with higher levels of fluctuating tarsus asymmetry. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Experiments on different species have shown female preferences for symmetry, but few previous studies have addressed preferences for symmetry in coloration. Using the bluethroat, Luscinia s. svecica, a passerine with a conspicuous blue and chestnut throat patch, as a model species, we devised an experiment in which the females could choose between males with either symmetric or asymmetric coloured leg bands. The females associated more with symmetric than asymmetric males, indicating a preference for symmetry. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Dawkins (1990, Behav. Brain Sci, 13, 1-61) argued that ideas from economics can be used to assess animal suffering. In particular, she argued that the slope or elasticity of a demand curve generated by making an animal work for a commodity or the chance to perform an activity are suitable measures. Here a simple model is presented which suggests that neither the slope nor the elasticity is likely to be a generally valid measure. Welfare economists do not use the slope or the elasticity of demand curves as a measure of changes in welfare; they use the area under a demand curve. It is argued that this measure is also the appropriate one to use in the context of animal suffering. (C) 1997 The Association for thr Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID SAID
AB Parents are often unable to discriminate their own infants from other parents' infants, and in humans it is appreciated that infants do not necessarily resemble their parents. A number of factors might cause the infants of a species to have a similar appearance, including requirements for camouflage or signalling, the biomechanics of birth in viviparous species, or even the development of so-called 'releasing stimuli'. Alternatively, a simple population genetics model shows that some aspects of neonatal appearance may arise as adaptive strategies on the part of infants actively to conceal the identity of their parents, especially of their father. Concealing paternal identity is advantageous as a strategy to avoid paternal neglect, abuse, or infanticide when the 'domestic father' is not likely to be the 'biological father'. The model reveals that 'anonymity' as a neonatal strategy can be adaptive in a wide range of mating systems, because infants are expected to resemble their fathers only if the 'domestic father' is also the 'biological father' a high proportion of the time: even small amounts of paternity uncertainty are sufficient to select against parent-infant resemblance. The available empirical evidence suggests that human infants have been selected not to: resemble their parents. However, if paternity certainty is sufficiently high in some groups for resemblance to evolve, the model predicts that offspring will resemble their fathers but not their mothers, consistent with the results of one recent study.

AB Field observations of food storing in several species of birds indicate that this behaviour pattern varies seasonally. Storing can be experimentally manipulated in captive birds by altering photoperiod and temperature. The objective of this study was to determine whether photoperiod manipulations affected spatial memory in a food-storing bird, the marsh tit, Parus palustris. One treatment group received a photoperiod of decreasing daylength (simulated autumn) in August, followed by a period of short days (simulated winter) in September and early October, and a sudden onset of long-day photoperiods (simulated summer) in mid-October. The other group was held on long days until mid-October and then suddenly exposed to short days. Results indicate that differences in photoperiod between treatment groups caused differences in storing behaviour and spatial memory. Birds experiencing short days after an accelerated autumn performed better on a test of spatial memory than those maintained on long days. After the photoperiod regimes were switched between treatment groups, this difference disappeared. On a similar spatial memory test in which subjects could rely only on non-spatial cues (e.g. colour), there were no differences between treatment groups, regardless of photoperiod, indicating that the effects of photoperiod are specific to spatial memory.

AB Object play may be a mechanism by which young predators acquire skills in manipulating prey, as well. as physical strength and endurance. It has also been proposed that fledgling raptors play with live or dead prey if available, but would play with surrogates such as sticks or grass if not. Different objects were offered to captive fledgling American kestrels, Falco sparverius, to test whether they prefer to play with objects resembling prey. Individuals were divided into two groups: those in treatment A were offered mouse mimics, along with one of four objects (large and small pine cones, long and short twigs) which were alternated daily. Individuals in treatment B were offered bottle corks, and the same type of alternative objects as in treatment A. There were no significant differences in the mean number of play instances of birds in each of the two treatments (total of 506 instances). However, fledglings in treatment A played significantly more with the mouse mimics, whereas fledglings in treatment B played with the different objects in proportion to their availability. These results support the hypothesis that young raptors devote a relatively fixed amount of time to object manipulation, and that they prefer to manipulate objects resembling natural prey. The same set of objects were offered to adult American kestrels, but they were never manipulated. This suggests that object play has a function in the maturation of hunting skills of young raptors.

AB The breeding and non-breeding distributions of male and female marine iguanas, Amblyrhynchus cristatus, and their mating behaviour were analysed. The population size was low because of a long lasting El Nino. The distribution of female-sized iguanas was more clumped during the mating season than before and afterwards. Model iguanas placed outside territories attracted more females during the breeding season than during the non-breeding season. The majority (75%) of large males established clustered territories while the remainder established single territories. The locations of the clusters were not related to physical characteristics of the habitat and were only partially related to non-breeding female densities. Non-territorial 'sneaker' males, similar in size to females, attempted copulations inside territories when territorial males were absent. Moderate sized, non-territorial males remained in the vicinity of territories and attempted to copulate forcefully with female-sized iguanas. This form of harassment was much higher outside territories, but levels did not differ between lek and single territories. Therefore, while harassment may lead to an increase in grouping among female-sized iguanas, it probably does not influence the type of territory visited. Females preferentially mated with the largest territorial males and reproductive success for these males was independent of lek size. The reproductive success of smaller territorial males, however, increased with lek size. Lekking in marine iguanas, therefore, may represent a 'hotshot' phenomenon where small territorial males associate with large males to increase reproductive success. The likely mechanism behind clustering appeared to be a greater propensity for females to mate in leks where stimulation rates were higher. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB In altricial birds, the food habits of young birds may be affected by extended parental contact. To examine this, five nesting pairs of captive adult house finches were exposed to hulled oats treated with an aversive agent, methiocarb. During the nestling and early fledgling stages, juvenile finches raised by adults that avoided oats received 30-40 times less exposure to hulled oats than did juveniles raised by adults that ate oats. After they were separated from the adults, the juveniles had no further access to oats or to canary seed, the alternative untreated food, until tested individually at 10-12, 20-22, and 35-38 weeks of age. There was no relationship between,the juvenile birds' exposure to oats in the early nestling stage and their subsequent oat preference scores. Birds raised by adults that avoided oats during the late nestling and fledgling stages, however, displayed lower oat preference scores than did birds raised by adults that ate oats. Thus, dietary aversion to oats established in adult birds was expressed in the seed preferences of their offspring. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Most hypotheses explain dispersal patterns in vertebrate populations based upon an assumption that individuals incur costs when moving away from their natal territories. The geometric distribution of dispersal distances that typically reflects observed dispersal, however, may also be modelled from the basic structure and demographic parameters of the resident population, independent of costs to dispersers. For example, sex-biased natal dispersal might then be explained by differential turnover rates of adult males and females. Patterns of natal dispersal were determined for a South Carolina population of eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, from 1985 to 1991 and relationships between different measures of dispersal and initial reproductive success, survival of parents and availability of nest sites were subsequently examined. Females settled significantly further from the natal territory than did males and were more likely to emigrate from the local population. In addition, immigrant females outnumbered immigrant males within local populations. The initial reproductive success of philopatric and dispersing second-year males and females did not differ, but the possibility of high dispersal costs associated with mortality alone could not be excluded. Adult turnover rates did not affect dispersal of individual offspring or general philopatry rates within local populations (as a factor determining overall territory availability). Therefore, alternative factors, such as competitive interactions or intrinsic mechanisms, may be more likely proximate causes of natal dispersal patterns than adult survivorship.

AB An experiment with starlings was conducted to investigate the effect of variability in inter-reinforcement intervals on foraging decisions. The experimental design simulated an environment in which food was distributed in patches. Patches contained zero to four food items which could be collected by pecking at a key. All patches ended with sudden depletion. The time elapsed since the last reinforcement was the only way to detect the depletion of the patch. Once a patch was depleted, a new patch could be reached by completion of a travel requirement of 20 flights between two perches. Key pecks within a patch and the time of the last response in a patch (giving-in time) were recorded. The level of variability in the inter-reinforcement intervals was varied between different conditions. An increase in inter-reinforcement interval variability resulted in B-flattening of response rate functions and giving-in time distributions, and in more asymmetry of the response functions, but not of the giving-in time distributions. Two theoretical models of decision making are presented, which differ in the assumptions about memory constraints. In one case, all inter-reinforcement intervals are remembered but in the other, only the intervals with extreme values are remembered. Both models accommodate response rates as a function of trial time, but only the second is compatible with the observed departure decision. Our results are compatible with net rate maximization.

TI Female European starlings increase their copulation solicitation rate
   when faced with the risk of polygyny
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID STURNUS-VULGARIS; MATE; PATTERNS; BIRDS; SONG
AB Since primary females in most polygynous birds receive less male help in feeding nestlings than monogamous females, paired females should try to prevent or delay the settlement of other females. Recently, it has been suggested that a female may copulate repeatedly with her mate to reduce the likelihood that he mates with other females. One of the predictions of this female mate-guarding hypothesis is that females should solicit at times when there is a risk that their male partners will mate with other females. To test this prediction, the response of captive female European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, that had an exclusive male partner to their male courting a newly introduced female was examined. Resident females significantly increased their copulation solicitation rate after their male started courting the new female. Most of the resident females' copulation solicitations occurred close to the nestbox where their male was trying to attract the newly introduced female, which may suggest that females use the solicitation of copulations to distract their male from the prospecting female. Resident females also behaved aggressively towards the newly introduced females. Male starlings played an active role in moderating female conflicts: they interrupted about 60% of the resident females' aggressive interactions towards the newly introduced females. These results suggest that female starlings use both aggressive behaviour (including song) and the solicitation of copulations to prevent their males from becoming polygynous.

AB Individuals that live in groups may have the opportunity to learn to recognize unfamiliar predators by observing the fright responses of experienced individuals in the group. In intraspecific trials, naive fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, gave fright responses to chemical stimuli from predatory northern pike, Esox lucius, when paired with pike-experienced conspecifics but not when paired with pike-naive conspecifics. These pike-conditioned minnows retained the fright responses to pike odour when tested alone, indicating that learning had occurred, and transmitted their fright responses to pike-naive minnows in subsequent trials. Brook stickleback, Culaea inconstans, are found in mixed-species aggregations with fathead minnows and are also vulnerable to predation by northern pike. In a series of interspecific tests, pike-naive brook stickleback gave fright responses to chemical stimuli from northern pike when paired with pike-experienced minnows but not when paired with pike-naive minnows. Pike-conditioned stickleback also retained the fright responses when tested alone and subsequently also transmitted the fright responses to pike-naive minnows. Individuals may benefit from observations of the fright responses of conspecifics or heterospecifics by (1) being alerted to the immediate presence of unfamiliar predators and (2) learning to recognize unfamiliar predators as a potential threat.

ID COOPERATION; INFORMATION; MODEL; BIRDS
AB The producer-scrounger model of Barnard gr Sibly (1981, Anim. Behav., 29, 543-550) predicts that at a certain ratio of producers and scroungers in a foraging group the payoff curves for individuals of the two phenotypes intercept. At this point all the group members obtain equal payoffs. In this paper, the original model is elaborated further by allowing individuals to differ not only in their food-finding abilities but also in their abilities to compete for the food once it is found. As in Barnard & Sibly's original model foraging individuals are assumed to share information about the whereabouts of food patches and to benefit from patches found by others. Here it is determined under which combinations of searching and sharing characters food intake rate in mixed-phenotype groups would be equal for producing and scrounging individuals. In the present model the payoffs are much affected by both the finder's advantage (the fraction of prey available only to the finder of the food-patch) and the combination of the foraging characters of the two phenotypes. Generally the intake rate of producers increases with their presence in the group and with increases in the finder's advantage. Our model suggests that the equal payoffs arise only when the relative food-searching and competitive abilities of producers and scroungers fall within a narrow range of options acknowledging also the finder's advantage. Moreover, such combinations are predicted to be unstable if only foraging benefits are called for in group formation, this being a common feature of social foraging models incorporating foraging role asymmetries.

ID STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES; RESOURCE SELECTION; COYOTES; BOBCATS
AB Carnivore foraging behaviour is suited for hunting in specific vegetative cover types and therefore is largely stereotypical within taxonomic families. Felids typically employ dense cover to stalk or ambush prey, whereas canids do not make use of vegetation when hunting. Sympatric lynx, Lynx canadensis, and coyotes, Canis latrans, were tracked in snow for three winters and hunting behaviour in relation to vegetative cover was examined. The major prey of both species was snowshoe hare, Lepus americanus. Lynx chased hares more frequently in sparse spruce, Picea glauca, canopy than coyotes, whereas coyotes chased hares more often in dense spruce than lynx. Lynx initiated chases by stalking in sparse spruce and by ambushing from beds in dense spruce. Vegetative cover did not affect lynx hunting success, but lynx did have higher success when ambushing versus stalking hares. Coyotes chased hares from closer proximity than lynx and employed a pouncing hunting behaviour. Coyote chases were shorter and more successful in dense versus sparse forest. It is concluded that lynx hunting behaviour is variable according to cover, whereas that of coyotes is fixed. However, coyotes appeared to use vegetation as concealment when approaching hares: the possible influence of snow on hunting tactics of each predator species is discussed.

AB In some mammal species, females in poor condition (e.g. poor nutritional state) give birth to a lower proportion of sons than do females in good condition. These skewed offspring sex ratios may be adaptive, because poor maternal condition can have a strong negative impact on the success of sons at intra-sexual competition. However, there is little information about the impact of maternal condition on the success of sons at being chosen as mates. Female house mice, Mus musculus, that are undernourished during gestation give birth to a lower proportion of sons, and those sons are smaller as adults than sons of well-nourished females. The preferences of oestrous females for the odours of adult sons of females that were well nourished and of those that were undernourished during gestation were tested, as well as the preferences of females for the odours of heavy and light males. Oestrous females preferred the odours of sons of well-nourished females and of heavier males. Hence, the sons of undernourished females may not be chosen as mates as often and may have lower reproductive potential than the sons of well-nourished females. These results and other evidence suggest that the skewed secondary sex ratios of undernourished female mice are adaptive. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The stability of the sizes of foraging groups of animals is reviewed with a special emphasis on the effect of inter-group competition. A simple model, in which cooperation, within-group and inter-group competition are explicitly accounted for, shows that when resources are scarce and patchy, inter-group competition tends to keep animals within their groups, even when these groups are overpopulated. The model's conclusions are in accord with empirical observations indicating that animals tend to forage in groups that are larger than the expected optimal size.

AB Chicks, Gallus gallus domestictus, of 2 and 6 days of age were presented with a goal-object that was made to disappear behind one of two screens opposite each other. Chicks proved able to choose the correct screen when the goal-object was a social partner (i.e. a red ball on which they had been imprinted), whereas they searched at random behind either screen when the goal-object was a palatable prey (i.e. a mealworm). Chicks, however, appeared able to make use of the directional cue provided by the movement of the mealworm when tested in the presence of a cagemate. These results suggest that previous failure to obtain detour behaviour in the double screen test in the chick was not due to a cognitive limitation, but rather to the evocation of fear responses to the novel environment that interfered with the correct execution of the spatial task.

AB At least two pheromones exist in female house mouse urine that elicit 70-kHz ultrasonic mating vocalizations from males: (1) a potent albeit ephemeral pheromone found in freshly voided urine which disappears within 15-18 h and (2) a more persistent, but less potent pheromone that remains for at least 30 days. Three experiments examined whether male responsiveness to the ephemeral pheromone and its loss in aged urine were due to volatility or oxidation. Experiment 1 demonstrated that both sexually experienced and inexperienced males must physically contact fresh urine before vocalizing. Experiment 2 indicated that storing freshly voided urine in an air-tight syringe does not attenuate the loss of the ephemeral pheromone. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the loss of activity of the ephemeral pheromone can be prevented with either beta-mercaptoethanol or dithiotreitol. Thus, the ephemeral pheromone is non-volatile and appears to be degraded by oxidation. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB This study investigated early interactions between 28 rhesus macaque, Macaca mulatta, mothers and their infants living in captive social groups to assess whether mothers actively encouraged their infants' independent locomotion and if such encouragement could be considered teaching. Mothers differed in their tendency to break contact with their infants in the first days of infant life, and this tendency increased significantly with previous reproductive experience. Mothers that left their infants early in life were also more likely to engage in backward walking and lip-smacking to their infants than mothers that did not leave their infants early in life. Infants that were left by their mothers in their first days of life broke and made contact with their mothers for the first time earlier than infants that were not left by their mothers. Interruption of contact with infants early in their life had no apparent immediate benefits to mothers but did have immediate risks because it increased the probability of infant kidnapping by other group members. Mothers whose infants gave a distress vocalization after the first interruption of contact broke contact with them less frequently in subsequent days than mothers whose infants did not vocalize. Although some of these findings are open to other interpretations, altogether they strongly suggest that some mothers actively encourage their infants' independent locomotion, that maternal encouragement is sensitive to infant competence, and that encouraged infants display some locomotor skills earlier in life than they would have without maternal encouragement.

AB The occurrence and importance of intra- and inter-sexual conflicts were studied in a blue tit, Paras caeruleus, population with a high level of polygyny. Males could increase their chances of becoming polygynous by actively attracting extra females or by displaying towards visiting floater females. Polygynous males allocated their parental care in relation to the hatching interval between the two broods. If the hatching interval was small, males divided their effort between the primary and the secondary nest, If the hatching interval was large, males fed only the nestlings of the primary female. Primary females that had to share male help did not hedge fewer young, but survived less well. Primary females tried to prevent or delay the settlement of secondary females by behaving aggressively towards all intruder females and by guarding their mates. Secondary females fledged more young if they received more help, that is, if the hatching interval was small, but there was no effect on female survival. Secondary females tried to settle early during the breeding season despite severe aggression of primary females. Secondary females needed less time for nest building and incubation and laid a smaller clutch, which increased the probability of hatching their young early relative to the primary brood. It is concluded that sexual conflicts play an important role in shaping the mating system of the blue tit and that parental care is the key factor in these conflicts.

AB Post-weaning mother-daughter associations are typical of many ungulates, but their existence among sheep is controversial. In bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, at high population density, strong mother-yearling associations were found involving mostly ewes whose lamb-of-the-year died at or soon after birth. At low population density, there were no mother-yearling associations regardless of maternal reproductive status. Non-lactating ewes and most ewes caring for a new lamb did not associate with their yearlings. The mother-yearling bond appeared stronger for female than for male yearlings, while maternal age had no effect. Associated yearling females had a nearly significant trend towards greater mass gain and greater body mass by the end of the summer compared with independent yearling females, but no trend was found when comparing associated and independent yearling males. Mothers that associated with their yearlings gained mass faster over the summer than mothers that nursed lambs, and by the end of the summer they were heavier than non-lactating ewes. Therefore, post-weaning association did not appear to be very costly for mothers. This study demonstrates how changes in ecological circumstances can lead to drastic changes in social organization.

AB On the mountain tops of the French Pyrenees (1950-2410 m), alpine accentors bred in polygynandrous groups in which an alpha male, and from one to three unrelated and usually younger subordinate males, shared a large undefended range (mean 18 ha) within which from two to four unrelated females had overlapping ranges (mean 11 ha per female). Group size was not related to range size of males or females but was influenced by the temporal availability of fertile females; alpha males monopolized more mates when females were more asynchronous in their onset of breeding, which was related to age and habitat (snow melt). The diet, determined from prey remains in faeces, was mainly small invertebrates, particularly taxa that dominate the fallout fauna, swept up by the wind from the valleys below. The birds' unusually large ranges were necessary to exploit these prey, which sweep netting showed to be scarcer on the mountain tops than down by the tree line, and also more patchily distributed in space and time. Nestlings were fed either by the female alone or with the help of from one to three males. Male help varied depending on which males mated and on the activities of other females in the group (males preferred to compete for matings than to feed chicks). Chick mass increased with male help, but females could fledge all their young successfully with little or no help, even in severe weather. Sexual conflict is similar to that in dunnocks, Prunella modularis; females gain through increased male help by giving shared paternity to several males while alpha males do best by monopolizing all the matings. Differences in dunnock and alpine accentor mating systems are related to ecology, and it is suggested that the dunnock's variable mating system reflects its derivation from a mountain-living ancestor.

AB An animal's relative social status has major short- and long-term consequences, yet its determinants are rarely known. Here a strong relationship between status and standard metabolic rate (SMR) in juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, is demonstrated; the higher the SMR, the more dominant the fish. After controlling for SMR, the relative size, weight or date of first feeding of two opponents had no effect on the outcome of encounters. Moreover, these differences in SMR are not a consequence of experience in encounters, since it has previously been shown that the onset of aggressive behaviour occurs later. Since relative social status has a significant influence on subsequent developmental pathways in this species, these results indicate an indirect link between intraspecific variation in metabolic rates and life-history strategies.

AB The orientation of four species of passerine long-distance migrants was studied in spring and autumn by orientation cage experiments during the twilight period after sunset in Sweden. Two groups of migrants from the Palaearctic-African migration system were used: migrants wintering mainly north of the magnetic equator in west Africa (pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, and redstart, Phoenicurus phoenicurus) and migrants wintering south of the magnetic equator in southeast Africa (thrush nightingale, Luscinia luscinia, and marsh warbler, Acrocephalus palustris). Orientation experiments were conducted in three magnetic conditions, in the local geomagnetic field and in a deflected and in a vertical magnetic field, under clear and simulated total overcast conditions, respectively. The results did not provide any convincing indications about differences in the orientation system between the two groups of migrants. The responses of all species seemed to be affected in a similarly complex way by celestial as well as magnetic cues, involving conflicting elements of a possible attraction towards the brightest part of the twilight sky as well as orientation in the migratory direction. Shifting the horizontal component of the magnetic field neither shifted nor disrupted orientation. Abolishing the horizontal component of the magnetic field increased the orientational scatter in three species in spring and one in autumn. Simulated total overcast largely abolished orientation, except in two species (in the local geomagnetic field only) that do not migrate across the geomagnetic equator.

AB Vocalizing by natural-living harbour seals has been considered to be rare, limited primarily to aerial threats. A few studies on captive harbour seals, however, indicated that this species produced a wider variety of aerial vocalizations than was previously thought. The objective of this study was to determine whether adult male harbour seals in the wild vocalized under water during the breeding season and whether there was any variation in vocalizations between individuals. Underwater vocalizations of 10 males were tape-recorded at Point Lobos State Reserve, California during the spring and summer of 1991. Females did not vocalize except on land when they threatened other seals. Observational data was taken to identify the vocalizing seal and to determine whether other seals in the vicinity showed any reactions to the vocalizations. Five vocalization types were identified and analysed: grunt, groan, creak, bubbly growl and roar. There were significant differences between males with regard to the frequency measurements of the roars as well as to their entire acoustic displays but there was little intra-individual variation. It is suggested that underwater vocalizations are used in male-male competition and/or as reproductive advertisement displays to attract females.

AB A model for the evolution of cooperation shows that two conditions are necessary for cooperation to be stable: a hunting success rate that is low for single hunters and increases with group size, and a social mechanism limiting access to meat by non-hunters. Testing this model on Tai chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, showed that (1) it pays for individuals to hunt in groups of three or four rather than alone or in pairs, and (2) cooperation is stable because hunters gain more at these group sizes than cheaters, owing to a meat-sharing pattern in which hunting, dominance and age, in that order, determine how much an individual gets. In addition, hunters provide cheaters (about 45% of the meat eaters) with the surplus they produce during the hunts. Thus, cooperation in Tai male chimpanzees is an evolutionarily stable strategy, and its success allows cheating to be an evolutionarily stable strategy for Tai female chimpanzees. In Gombe chimpanzees, cooperation is not stable, first, because hunting success is very high for single hunters, and second, because no social mechanism exists that limits access to meat by non-hunters. The analysis showed that some assumptions made when discussing cooperation in other social hunters might be wrong. This might downgrade our general perception of the importance of cooperation as an evolutionary cause of sociality.

TI SUBSPECIES RECOGNITION AND SONG LEARNING IN ZEBRA FINCHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID DISCRIMINATION; SPARROWS
AB The songs of captive Taeniopygia guttata guttata from Timor, G. g. castanotis from the Australian mainland and hybrid zebra finch males were analysed sonagraphically and the response of females was measured in playback experiments. Guttata and Castanotis young were either raised normally by members of their own subspecies or cross-fostered to members of the other subspecies. Hybrid young were raised by Guttata male-Castanotis female pairs. Guttata songs were significantly longer than Castanotis songs, with more elements per phase, and were sung at a higher frequency, irrespective of whether males had been raised normally or cross-fostered. Hybrid songs were intermediate between Guttata and Castanotis songs. The results suggest that rearing experience has little, if any, effect on these macrostructural differences between the songs of the two subspecies. Females implanted with oestradiol preferred songs of males of their foster-father subspecies, irrespective of whether these males had been cross-fostered or raised normally, indicating that females use macrostructural song features for subspecies recognition and that their song preferences are learned. It is suggested that these macrostructural differences in song function in subspecies recognition.

TI BODY SIZE AND LIFETIME MATING SUCCESS OF MALE MIDGES (DIPTERA,
   CHIRONOMIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Among insects that mate on the wing, small males should have the mating advantage by being more aerobatic than large males. However, this benefit could be outweighed by costs to small size in other components of fitness. The hypothesis that mated males of the midge Chironomus plumosus L. are on average smaller than unmated males was tested. Small males were predicted to pay for any such success with a reduced longevity and a reduction in flight endurance. Hence small males should achieve a lower lifetime mating success than their larger conspecifics. As predicted, small males had the mating advantage. However, small size did not accrue the expected costs. Although body size correlated positively with lifespan and flight duration for starved males, when given access to food, small males lived and flew for as long as larger competitors. Ultimately, small size did run into constraints. The rare, smallest males in a population could not maintain continuous flight. Hence small size is  beneficial to male midges but reduction in size by sexual selection is balanced by physiological constraints on flight.

TI THE ASSESSMENT BY VERVET MONKEYS OF THEIR OWN AND ANOTHER SPECIES ALARM
   CALLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In Amboseli National Park, Kenya, both superb starlings, Spreo superbus, and vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops, give acoustically different alarm calls to different classes of predators. The ''raptor alarms'' of starlings and vervet monkeys are so called because they are given exclusively to avian species that attack from the air. In contrast, while vervets give ''leopard alarms'' to a narrow array of terrestrial predators, starlings give terrestrial predator alarms to a wide variety of species, including some birds. Habituation experiments demonstrate that monkeys compare vocalizations according to their referents, not just their acoustic properties: vervets who learned to ignore playback of a starling''s raptor alarm subsequently also ignored playback of a vervet''s eagle alarm. Experiments also demonstrate that vervets are sensitive to the breadth of referential specificity exhibited by different calls. Subjects who learned to ignore playback of a starling terrestrial  predator alarm subsequently also ignored playback of both vervet leopard and vervet raptor alarms.

TI ASYMMETRIC CONTESTS OVER RESOURCES FOR SURVIVAL AND MIGRATION - A FIELD
   EXPERIMENT WITH BLUETHROATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relative importance of prior occupancy and of asymmetries in both value of winning and in resource-holding potential for the outcome of animal contests was tested. Bluethroats, Luscinia s. svecica, were offered food ad libitum in the field. Prior to migration, at a moulting site, their weight increased rapidily and peaked after a few days. Lean birds won significantly more interactions than fat birds, probably owing to higher motivation to fight for the food. Dominance between individuals shifted and was not correlated with size or prior occupancy. During the subsequent migration, at a stopover site, the bluethroats gained weight throughout their stay. Dominance between individuals was constant and positively correlated with size, whereas fat reserves and prior occupancy had no effect on contest resolution. Fat deposition rates were positively correlated with dominance status. The different dominance patterns are explained in terms of different gain curves of fat for birds putting on fat for survival and migration, respectively. Though prior occupancy had no general effect on dominance patterns, such an uncorrelated asymmetry may have been used to settle single contests between fat birds at the moulting site. The fact that dominance (acting through differences in size) influences fat deposition rates may be important for the spatial and temporal pattern of migration in birds that compete for resources at stopover sites.

TI RISK-SENSITIVE FORAGING IN BITTERLINGS, RHODEUS-SERICUS - EFFECTS OF
   FOOD REQUIREMENT AND BREEDING SITE QUALITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Risk-sensitive foraging preferences in bitterlings were examined in relation to changing food deprivation and intake relative to estimated requirement. When running above estimated requirement and presented with a choice of constant and variable feeding stations, a group of seven fish were all risk-averse (avoiding high variance in reward rate). When running below, six out of the seven fish showed increased risk-aversion and one became risk-prone (choosing high variance). Increasing the degree  of food deprivation while running below requirement for one of the risk-averse fish, however, resulted in a switch to risk-proneness, a response that was repeated in a second group of six fish running below requirement. Variance in reward rate also appeared to influence the choice of a potential breeding site by a male bitterling. When breeding sites of apparent equal quality were provided at the constant and variable feeding stations, the fish preferred the constant station; the variable  station was preferred only when breeding site quality at the constant station was relatively low.

TI BEHAVIORAL POST-INHIBITORY REBOUND IN APHIDS TAKING FLIGHT AFTER
   EXPOSURE TO WIND
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A new case of behavioural post-inhibitory rebound is quantified and partially analysed for the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae. Wind delayed the taking-off of individual aphids but as soon as the wind stopped the latency to take-off dropped to less than in continuous calm, both effects increasing with the wind speed. Wind at 2 m/s reduced the frequency of take-offs among 40 aphids virtually to zero; but 0.3 m/s increased the frequency. When the wind stopped, the take-off frequency rebounded within seconds; these effects likewise increased with wind speed. The rebound after 2-m/s wind also increased with wind duration up to 1 h, but did not change further after at least 4 h. The rebound declined during repeated 1-min alternations between 2-m/s wind and calm, but interpolating longer calmspells sustained the level of rebound. The take-off frequency increased after a wind bout whether it had been reduced, increased or unaffected during the wind bout. The increased frequency therefore appeared to be, not an after-effect of the response to the wind, but a separate, centrally mediated response to the wind stimulus. These effects of wind on aphid taking-off are compared with those of landings on aphid flight vigour and some of their functions in nature are suggested.

TI BROOD CARE IN AMERICAN ROBINS - IMPLICATIONS FOR MIXED REPRODUCTIVE
   STRATEGIES BY FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Parental care of nestling and fledgling American robins, Turdus migratorius, was studied in eastern Ontario, Canada. There was no evidence of brood division prior to fledging but brood division was the predominant pattern after fledging. Females initiating second nests reduced their care of fledglings sooner than males. Once incubation began at second nests, males provided all the care for fledglings from the previous nest. A consequence of overlapping first and second nesting efforts is that  care of fledglings from the first nest allows males little opportunity of mate guarding when their mates are initiating the second nest. Reduced opportunity for mate guarding is probably exacerbated by the wide dispersal of fledglings at the time of egg laying at second nests. In spite of the apparent reduced opportunity for mate guarding, males fed nestlings in second nests as much as those in first nests. This results suggests that females initiating second nests may refrain from extra-pair  copulsations if their mates have proven themselves by the success of the first nest, because confidence of paternity ensures male parental care at the second nest. Information from the literature suggests that the mixed strategy by females of being willing to engage in extra-pair copulations when initiating first but not broods may occur in other species with overlapping broods.

TI DAILY TIME ALLOCATION AMONG ADULT AND IMMATURE YELLOW-EYED JUNCOS OVER
   THE BREEDING-SEASON
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Daily time-budgets of adult and immature yellow-eyed juncos, Junco phaeonotus, were examined over the course of the breeding season to compare the relative severity of time constraints among breeding adults and between breeding adults and their offspring. No significant differences in time allocation between males and females were found at any stage of the breeding cycle. Adults feeding nestlings spent substantially more time foraging and flying than females engaged in incubation and the males paired to such females. The allocation of time to foraging peaked after the young left the nest and, among adults, parents caring for recently fledged young faced the most severe time constraints. The allocation of time to foraging and flycing among dependent juncos gradually increased over the fledgling period. Of all the age classes and reproductive stages examined here, the recently independent juveniles faced the most severe time constraints, spending almost all of the daylight hours foraging. Older independent juveniles spent less time foraging and more time flying than recently independent juncos. The first few weeks of independence provides a strong opportunity for selection on the efficient allocation of time to competing activities among yellow-eyed juncos.

TI MOBBING BY FLORIDA SCRUB JAYS - BEHAVIOR, SEXUAL ASYMMETRY, ROLE OF
   HELPERS AND ONTOGENY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behavioural patterns used in mobbing predators by the cooperatively breeding Florida scrub jay, Aphelocoma c. coerulescens, are described from films, field observations and field experiments. The roles of individual group members and the ontogeny of mobbing by fledglings were investigated experimentally by releasing a 1.6-m snake in the presence of jays. Jays used at least nine action patterns and one variable vocalization in mobbing. Male breeders mobbed most intensely, female breeders and  helpers mobbed with lesser and approximately equal intensity, and fledglings mobbed the least. Fledglings began mobbing by 47 days post-hatch and gradually acquired adult-like mobbing behaviour by 3 months of age. Coordinated by flying ability may be necessary before fledglings begin to mob. Mobbing fledglings were often ignored by adults that had not yet seen the predator. A comparison of the mobbing of the Florida scrub jay with other congeners indicates that several aspects of mobbing behaviour may be related to the social system of the birds.

TI SEX-DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL-DEVELOPMENT DURING THE 1ST 4 YEARS IN A
   FREE-RANGING GROUP OF JAPANESE MONKEYS, MACACA-FUSCATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavioural development of a birth cohort (14 males, six females) during the first 4 years of life in the Awajishima free-ranging group of Japanese monkeys is described. The study focused on maturational changes in the relationships of immature males and females with their mothers and with other group members. Males tended to interact with their mothers less frequently than did females. Certain individuals interacted with their mothers more frequently than others during the first 4 years of life. Individuals were also consistent in their social interactions with group members other than their mothers. Males maintained close relationships with males of similar age, primarily through social play, from approximately the second year onward. This indicates that the males'' preference for association with males of similar age precedes peripheralization and that peripheralization does not bring about essential changes in their social relationships with group members. Females preferred relationships with female group members of various age, and also relationships with infants and fully adult males. This may explain why females remain in the central part of the group throughout their lives. The results of the study suggest that the preparation for adult male/female social roles starts as early as the second year of age.

TI HABITAT SELECTION IN A PATCHY ENVIRONMENT - INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES IN
   COMMON SHREWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individual common shrews, Sorex araneus, were allowed to forage for several weeks on an arena divided into two habitats (sides of the arena) with five food patches each (computer-controlled feeders). The patches in the ''variable'' habitat alternated stochastically and independently between a low and a high reward probability, while the patches in the ''constant'' habitat were fixed to an intermediate reward probability that was increased in five steps over a period of 2 weeks. Individuals  differed significantly in their average food intake per visit in the variable habitat. As expected, in the course of gradually increasing reward probability in the constant habitat, individuals with high average food intake in the variable habitat switched their preference later than the others to the constant habitat. However, the individuals that showed the best performance in the variable habitat continued to prefer it even when the constant habitat would have given a substantially (up to 50%) higher average food intake. This suggests that these individuals did not base their habitat selection exclusively on average-rate maximization but they preferred the habitat with the very best food patches even if locating them required much sampling.

TI THE INTERACTION OF INCUBATION AND FEEDING IN BROODY JUNGLEFOWL HENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Broody hens, Gallus gallus spadiceus, were studied under laboratory conditions to see how varying the causal factors for feeding affected their incubation behaviour. Incubating hens normally sit on their eggs continuously except for one or two 10-min bouts of the nest each day. In experiment 1,24 h of food deprivation resulted in hens leaving the nest about 1.cntdot.5 h earlier than usual. When food was available, deprived hens spent more time off the nest and ate more food than non-deprived hens.  These results suggest that the incubation system and the feeding system are competing with each other, and are not time-sharing. In experiment 2, hens that were deprived of food had food returned at 1400, 1600 or 1700 hours. The later the food was returned, the less likely it was that the hen would leave her eggs. When food was returned in the late afternoon, most hens tolerated 48-72 h of deprivation before leaving the nest. These results suggest that the tendency to incubate fluctuates during  the day. A descriptive model that can account for these results is proposed which includes a circadian timing mechanism.

TI FEMALE MATE PREFERENCES AND MALE ATTRIBUTES IN MALLARD DUCKS
   ANAS-PLATYRHYNCHOS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Courtship behaviour of mallard ducks breeding in a large pond was studied for 3 successive years. Five male attributes (body weight, sternum length, age, plumage status and social display activity) were measured. In addition, variation in male body condition was induced experimentally by providing males with either an unlimited or a restricted food supply for 5 weeks before observing courtship behaviour. A covariance analysis suggests that variation in all measured characters except body weight  significantly affected female mate choice, accounting for 57% of the variance in the number of females to court each male. Females exclusively courted males in the group fed ad libitum and among them preferred individuals with a high social display activity, a high plumage status, a small body size and of intermediate age.

TI PAIRING AND ADOPTION OF OFFSPRING BY REPLACEMENT MALE WILLOW PTARMIGAN -
   BEHAVIOR, COSTS AND CONSEQUENCES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In northen Manitoba, 18% of the 329 resident willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus, males were unpaired at the onset of breeding. When paired males were removed at the onset of incubation, about 50% of the previously unpaired resident males and 5% of paired males joined the widows. The time to replacement and the number of days through incubation spent with the widow did not vary between males that were paired or unpaired previously, but unpaired males were observed more frequently at the nest  sites of windows than were paired males. After hatch, over 25% of widows (lone hens) with broods were joined by replacement males. Direct or indirect infanticide of eggs or chicks by replacement males was not observed. Instead, replacement females adopted (provided apparent parental care) and defended the dependent offspring of their new mates. Despite strong natal philopatry of males, males did not replace at the nests of their kin (father, mother, brother or sister). Over half of the first nests failed, but most widows produced replacement clutches. Males replaced more frequently at the first nests than at re-nests, and 20% of the males replacing at first nests of widows produced chicks from re-nests. This reproductive success was achieved in addition to the offspring these males may have produced from pair or extra-pair matings earlier in the season. Previously unpaired males that replaced were more successful breeders in the next season than the unpaired resident males that did not replace. The improved success may have been due to the breeding experience obtained by replacing, but males that replaced could also have been of superior quality.

TI AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR IN BARNACLE GOOSE FLOCKS - ASSESSMENT, INVESTMENT AND
   REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Within barnacle goose, Branta leucopsis, flocks dominance rank was ordered according to the number of individuals within social units. The order was as follows: large families beat small families, small families beat paired adults, and paired adults beat single birds. Unit size was the best predictor of dominance relationships; the effect of individuals'' size and age was less apparent. Females and goslings increased their success when males joined their encounters. Intensity of agonistic behaviour was altered according to the rank of the opponent so that the minimal effort was used to win. Investment in aggressive behaviour was related to the amount of energetic payoff (food and time saved) that could be won by a particular group. Spatial distribution within foraging flocks was related to dominance rank; larger groups used leading edges, where they had first choice of plants, and spent more time in areas of higher grass biomass. Families spent more time being aggressive than  all other classes. Before young pairs entered the breeding contingent of the population they increased their rate of aggressiveness. Parents also increased their rate of aggressive efforts with successive years of reproductive success. Rank order was correlated with rates of aggression.

TI SONG LEARNING AND MATE CHOICE IN ESTRILDID FINCHES RAISED BY 2 SPECIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, and Bengalese finches, Lonchura striata, were raised normally or cross-fostered to the other species until 35 days of age and then housed until 70 days old with two song tutors, one from each species. Males raised normally based their song on that of the conspecific tutor whereas cross-fostered males also learned from the other tutor, reflecting both own-species bias and a tendency to learn from the tutor whose song was similar to the father''s. Males  raised by one bird from each species learned from the father as well as the tutor(s) but were more likely to learn from the tutor whose song was similar to the father''s if the father was a conspecific. Comparing these song learning results with those from mate choice tests suggests there is no direct link between song learning and sexual imprinting.

TI THE SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF JAPANESE MACAQUE COO SOUNDS - A
   PSYCHOPHYSICAL STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, were trained with a positive reinforcement operant procedure to discriminate smooth early high and smooth late high coo sounds recorded during Green''s (1975) field study of the species'' vocal repertoire. Subjects labelled the various tokens by maintaining contact with a response device for calls from one category and by breaking contact for those of the second call type. After the completion of discrimination training, the generalization of the operant  behavior to novel natural and synthetic vocalizations was measured. Initial generalization tests established that macaques would respond appropriately both to natural vocalizations and to computer-synthesized prototypes representing the smooth early high-smooth late high contrast. In subsequent tests, individual acoustic features were removed from the synthetic prototypes to determine the minimal elements of functional coo sounds. These tests suggested that those sounds are distinguished by the  predominant direction of their frequency change which, in turn, is determined by the temporal position of their highest frequency.

TI PHEROMONES EXCHANGED DURING MATING - A MECHANISM FOR MATE ASSESSMENT IN
   DROSOPHILA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many insect species are sexually dimorphic for volatile compounds associated with the cuticle. In these species, females may acquire volatile compounds from males through direct contact with males during mating. In some cases, these compounds function as antiaphrodisiacs, which inhibit subsequent male precopulatory behavior. During mating, males may also acquire female compounds, which normally stimulate males to court. Contact during mating thus results in a mutual exchange of compounds  usually found primarily, or exclusively, on one or the other sex. Drosophila melanogaster is a sexually dimorphic dipteran species in which predominant male and female cuticular hydrocarbons are mutually exchanged during mating. Using synthetic compounds, the effect of this exchange on the post-mating sexual attractiveness of both males and females was tested. The sex-predominant hydrocarbons acquired during mating decreased the attractiveness of both males and females to members of the other sex. Mated females are courted less actively than virgins, and are usually unwilling to re-mate. Similarly, recently mated males are less attractive to females than virgin males are, and may be less fertile. Thus, cuticular hydrocarbons acquired by the other sex during mating could allow both males and females to assess the immediate reproductive potential of prospective mates.

TI CREVICE OCCUPATION BY MUSK TURTLES - TAXONOMIC DISTRIBUTION AND CREVICE
   ATTRIBUTES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Musk turtles, Sternotherus, of all taxa preferentially used crevices as resting sites in laboratory pools. Crevice use was greater during the day. Larger, darker crevices that were low enough to touch the carapace were preferred. Positional preferences within crevices were for full coverage of the shell despite the head being exposed, for the low half of crevices, and for axial orientation that maximized contact between the carapace and crevice ceiling. Light but touchable portions of crevices  were preferred over dark but untouchable portions, so the possibiity of establishing carapacial contact with the ceiling is the definitive attribute of a satisfactory crevice. The behavioural tendency to use the lowest possible crevice may have an anti-predator function, and it is one necessary condition for existence of a selective regime in favour of depressed shells.

TI AGGRESSION VERSUS COURTSHIP IN THREESPINE STICKLEBACKS AND THE ROLE OF
   HABITUATION TO NEIGHBORS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Interaction of courtship and territorial aggression in male threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, was investigated by presenting dummy females to subjects nesting alone (solitary situation) and in view of males nesting in adjacent tanks (rival situation). During dummy presentation subjects engaged in more courtship and nest activity when solitary than when in the rival situation. Behaviour of subjects in the latter situation was dominated by threats and attempts to bite rivals during dummy presentation. Thus, rivals can interfere with another male''s courtship by competing for the time during which he could court a female or by eliciting in him an aggressive state that is incompatible with sexual behaviour. Subjects in the rival situation gradually decreased the time spent with rivals but increased the time spent courting the dummy and tending the nest during presentations. This decrease in aggression towards neighbouring males is presumed to result from habituation.  Thus, habituation can play an important role in mitigating the aggressive response to familiar rivals, allowing males to devote more time and energy to courtship and nest activities while still forming breeding aggregations in which members may mutually benefit.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The dispersion pattern of 360 juvenile white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, from 158 matings was monitored to determine whether dispersal was sufficient to prevent close inbreeding. Dispersal was male-biased with 20% of the daughters remaining in their natal home ranges. Dispersal of sons was not ''forced'' by adult males, but may have been influenced by the presence of their mothers. One mother-son and five father-daughter pairs had overlapping home ranges during the breeding season, but the maximum number of matings among close relatives was three of 135 (2.2%). Dispersal of juvenile males was sufficient to keep close inbreeding at a minimum. Dispersal did not result from reproductive competition. Pregnant and post-lactating females frequently moved to new home ranges. The reproductive success of immigrants was the same as that of natal residents.

TI TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF FACULTATIVE SOCIAL PARASITISM IN BUMBLE BEES
   (HYMENOPTERA, APIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Parasitical behaviour is thought to play an important, yet so far largely unknown role in the evolution and maintenance of insect sociality. In this study, the influence of interspecific, facultative social parasitism upon bumble bee, Bombus, nesting biology was explored. Queens of B. affinis were introduced into 38 various-sized laboratory colonies of B. terricola. Foreign queens were very successful at killing the resident queen and usurping pre-worker nests (77% wins), although usurpation success decreased to 30% in colonies that contained workers. In addition, B. affinis queens were unable to suppress ovarian development in B. terricola workers that emerged prior to nest usurpation, resulting in the eventual death or expulsion of the foreign queen. In contrast, ovarian development was suppressed in workers that eclosed in the presence of a foreign queen, and in workers that were less than 5 h old when confined in small experimental boxes with a B. affinis queen. Foreign queens that usurped a nest prior to worker emergence were assisted by B. terricola workers, and achieved similar reproductive success when compared to a cohort of 22 B. affinis queens that initiated their own nests in the laboratory. These results suggest that there are periods in the ontogeny of Bombus nest defence, recognition and dominance during which bees are sensitive to the effects of nest parasitism. In bumble bees, and in other social insects, individuals of some species may exploit these weaknesses for their own reproductive benefit.

TI A COMPARISON OF ASSOCIATION INDEXES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Indices used to measure the frequency of association between individuals in fission/fusion societies are frequently borrowed from ecological studies of species association without adequate justification. In this paper several such indices, under specific conditions likely to be encountered in field studies of animal behavior, are examined. Each of three indices commonly found in the literature is shown through simulations to be accurate over only a narrow range of possible sampling biases. As an alternative approach, examples are given of the derivation of a maximum-likelihood estimator based on two simple models. Both models assume that a constant proportion of existing subgroups is located. In the first model all combinations of subgroups are equally likely to be located, while in the second model the probability of locating one subgroup is allowed to differ from that of the others. The maximum-likelihood estimators are shown to be less biased and to have lower variance than the other three indices under the assumptions of the models.

TI OWNERS, FLOATERS AND COMPETITIVE ASYMMETRIES AMONG TERRITORIAL
   RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In an eastern Ontario[Canada] population of red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, some males were unsuccessful in obtained a breeding territory and consequently existed as ''floaters''. However, not all floaters were inferior to territory owners with respect to two morphological correlates of social dominance status: wing length and epaulette length. Floaters who replaced experimentally removed owners were not smaller and did not have smaller epaulettes than owners. Ownership changed on  26.8% of 71 territories that were closely monitored and on 64.0% of 25 spot-checked territories. A considerable proportion of these changes in ownership appeared to be territory take-overs by intruding males. However, owners involved in these turnovers were not smaller and did not have smaller epaulettes than either the incoming males who succeeded them or the other territory owners who were not involved in turnovers. Overall, the data did not support the hypothesis that owner/floater status is determined by asymmetries in morphological features associated with competitive ability among males competing for a limited number of territories.

TI THE FUNCTIONS OF URINE MARKING IN A FREE-LIVING POPULATION OF HOUSE
   MICE, MUS-DOMESTICUS RUTTY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The urine-marking behaviour of free-living house mice, Mus domesticus Rutty, was investigated in a poultry house where mice defended small territories and where evidence of previous marking behaviour was extensive. Thin smears of urine were found spread over most surfaces and concentrated posts of urine were located at topographical edges. Marking behaviour was measured on plates of clean acetate sheet which were smeared with urine when exposed to the mice overnight. The marking response of resident mice to marks from neighbouring and distant territories was then investigated by transferring plates between 30 separate sites. Plates were marked primarily as a response to clean surfaces and the presence of native or imported smears inhibited further marking. Clean surfaces adjacent to native or imported smears were marked to the same extent, though marking increased with the density of the adjacent smears. Infrared video recording revealed that resident adults paid little attention  to either native or imported smears after their initial investigation, but juveniles were very cautious in their approach to imported smears. The responses of resident adults argue against a territorial function for urine smearing, though juveniles may use smears to stay safely within the parental territory. It is proposed that urine smears may provide cues for orientation and may enhance the rapid detection of novel (i.e. unmarked) objects, directing attention towards new resources or hazards. The possibility that urine smears and posts constitute a dual marking system is discussed.

TI AUDITORY REGULATION OF WOODRAT (NEOTOMA-LEPIDA) SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male desert woodrats, Neotoma lepida, produce an audible rasping vocalization during copulation. In a normative experiment, it was shown that the call was associated with behaviour patterns that generally occur shortly before intromission: hop-darting and lordosis in the female, and trailing and mounting in the male. Two complementary experiments were done to determine whether the male''s call affected female sexual behaviour: in one the female was temporarily deafened, and in the other, the  male was temporarily devocalized. In both experiments, the female displayed fewer lordosis responses to male mounting when communication of the rasping call was prevented. In a subsequent experiment, taped male vocalizations were played at the time calling would usually occur, to pairs consisting of an intact female and a devocalized male. Playback restored female lordosis behaviour to levels seen in intact controls. The male, however, was unable to obtain intromissions when mounting the  female. Finally, micro-analysis of videotapes of copulating pairs confirmed that females exhibited fewer lordosis responses when the male was devocalized. Those that did occur were of poorer quality in terms of head elevation and onset latency. Playback restored these behaviours to control levels. Males gave similar amounts of flank and perineal stimulation to the female in each condition. The results of the study suggest that the male''s call facilitates receptive behaviour such as lordosis in  the female woodrat.

TI HUMAN NAVIGATION AND MAGNETORECEPTION - THE MANCHESTER EXPERIMENTS DO
   REPLICATE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experiments at Manchester University have led to two major claims: (1) in solving problems of orientation and navigation, humans have access to some non-visual ability; and (2) at least in part, this non-visual ability involves magnetoreception. This paper reviews all experiments on human navigation and magnetoreception since 1980 by authors other than myself. These experiments have produced results with a conservative probability of occurring by chance that is less than 0.001 with respect to non-visual orientation and less than 0.005 with respect to magnetoreception. As evidence for the existence of a non-visual ability to orient and navigate based, at least in part, on magnetoreception, the results obtained by other workers now rival those obtained at Manchester. Despite this, other authors continue not to offer support for the view that humans possess magnetoreception ability. This stark contrast between positive results and negative interpretations remains an unexplained feature of the literature on human magnetoreception.

TI HOUSE SPARROW, PASSER-DOMESTICUS, COMMUNAL DISPLAYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Communal displays involving a single female and several male house sparrows took place in the fertile period of the female, especially early in the morning, and during the first brood. Display rates closely paralleled copulation activity and mate guarding (males chasing away other males from the vicinity of the female mates). Male mates and dominant males in particular participated in displays, which were directed particularly towards female mates of dominant males. Cloaca-pecking during  displays performed by non-mate male sparrows was common in the fertile period of the female. Male mates gave alarm-calls and/or defended their female mates, remaining at the site until the display ceased. Female house sparrows reacted aggressively to non-mate males during displays. Three extra-pair copulations were recorded during communal displays, and one attempt was seen elsewhere. Dominant male sparrows and their mates experienced high costs of participating in communal displays because of  predation risk, but dominant males simultaneously obtained large benefits because they were able to guard their mates and to engage in extra-pair copulations and unguarded females.

TI ARE FEMALE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS TERRITORIAL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Spacing behaviour of female red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) was observed to determine whether resident females within a harem divide their mate''s territory into sub-territories. Some results accorded with defence of sub-territories: (1) females were more aggressive (towards decoys and mounts) close to their own nests than further away; and (2) there was little overlap in the use of space between residents on a male''s territory. Other results did not accord with defence of  sub-territories: (1) when the nest site was eliminated from the analysis, spatial overlaps were large; (2) areas defended through aggression by different females overlapped greatly; and (3) areas defended through advertisement by different females overlapped greatly. I conclude that the spacing behaviour of female red-winged blackbirds does not meet a strict definition of territoriality.

TI ON THE LEARNING OF DEGRADED AND UNDEGRADED SONGS IN THE CAROLINA WREN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Adult male Carolina wrens (Thryothorus ludovicianus) are known to use degradation in the songs they hear to estimate their distance from a singing conspecific. They also sing songs that are structured to prevent degradation owing to acoustic features particular to specific habits. Here we ask if acoustically isolated, naive young wrens use sound degradation as a cue in choosing songs to learn. All four isolated birds learned significantly more undegraded than degraded songs, showing that song degradation is perceived and used by naive birds. We suggest that the attention given to song degradation by young birds learning songs produces a proximate mechanism to explain the common occurrence of song sharing by territorial neighbours and supports the ranging hypothesis (Morton 1982). Sufficient evidence now exists to suggest that sound degradation, and the ability of birds to use it, should be taken into account in studies using responses to playback of bird song.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Drosophila melanogaster populations derived from pupae collected from four microhabitats (on and under fruit, on and in soil) differed in their proportion of rover and sitter larval forager morphs, a second chromosome based genetic polymorphism (Sokolowski 1980). ''On-fruit'' populations had shorter foraging trails and lower pupal heights (sitters) than ''off-fruit'' populations (rovers). In a field assay, sitters pupated significantly more on fruit than rovers. When soil water content was increased, the proportion of larvae pupating on fruit decreased. At 0% soil water content, on-fruit pupae (sitters) showed a higher percentage of adults emerging than off-fruit pupae (rovers). The reverse was true at 100% soil water content. The rover/sitter polymorphism may be maintained in an environment where the soil water content fluctuates. In this study, we demonstrate a direct relationship between laboratory and field phenotypes, thereby linking the ecology, behaviour and genetics of D. melanogaster.

Mated females on the other hand avoid being detected in male  territories.

TI PATTERNS OF COURTSHIP BETWEEN COWBIRD SUBSPECIES - EVIDENCE FOR POSITIVE
   ASSORTMENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The courtship and mating behavior of captive individuals from allopatric populations of 2 cowbird subspecies (Molothrus ater ater and M. a. obscurus) were observed in a large indoor-outdoor aviary, using a multiple-choice design to assess whether they would selectively pair with members of their own subspecies. Of the 42 consortships observed, 29 were between consubspecifics, and 10 of the 15 copulating pairs were homogamic. Individuals tended to pair with consubspecifics whether or not they had had prior breeding experience with consubspecifics or winter contact with heterosubspecifics. This demonstration of selective courtship between individuals of widely separated populations is one of the first quantified examples of the development of assortative pairing in allopatry for a passerine species. These data place in perspective previous findings on the female cowbird''s preferential response to playback of her own subspecies'' song, thereby suggesting that song may be an important cue for selective mating between passerine populations.

TI SONG SWITCHING AND AGONISTIC STIMULATION IN THE SONG SPARROW
   (MELOSPIZA-MELODIA) - 5 TESTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male song sparrows in southeastern Ontario [Canada] have repertoires of 5-11 distinct song types. The singer repeats each song type a variable number of times before switching to another type. Analysis of territorial singing suggested that rate of switching song types is positively correlated with intensity of agonistic stimulation, where agonistic signifies conflict-related. The song-switching hypothesis was tested with playback experiments which varied stimulus intensity in 5 different ways; presence or absence of song stimuli; addition of visual to auditory stimuli; location of the song stimulus 20 m inside or outside territory; nesting phases of the subjects; and switching rate and rate of novel song type production of the playback (i.e., stimulus versatility). The subjects'' switching rates and flight rates consistently increased with greater stimulation, although song rate tended to remain unaffected. The signaling of response intensity through adjustments in switching rate exemplifies how song repertories function in agonistic communication.

TI OPTIMAL DECISION RULES FOR HERRING-GULLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A measure of fitness applicable to herring gull (L. argentatus) life histories is introduced and related to short-term risks which depend on behavior. This allows calculations of the relationship between fitness and behavior if one can measure the risks an animal takes behaving in particular ways in specified situations. This method is used to evaluate the fitness of herring gulls during the incubation period at Walney Island, UK. Two causes of egg mortality are considered, death by predation and death by exposure, and the latter is shown to be less important than the former. The chances of death by predation depend on the number of adults present on the territory and are estimated to be approximately 0.045 eggs/h if no parents are present on territory, 3.5 .times. 10-4 eggs/h if 1 parent is present and 6.7 .times. 10-4 eggs/h if 2 parents are present. Adult death by starvation is assumed to occur when energy reserves are exhausted; however a fitness cost is incurred if an animal maintains excess energy reserves. To restrict the number of behavior sequences examined to manageable proportions, attention is restricted to the behavior sequences that result from decision rules in which feeding occurs when energy reserves fall below a set point. Then optimal behavior is characterized by (1) energy reserves maintained between 500 and 1200 kcal; (2) complementarity of mates'' feeding preferences such that at least one of the pair feeds at a refuse tip; (3) parental desertion of offspring if energy reserves fall below 200 kcal; (4) parents spending the minimum possible time together on territory. These results are shown by sensitivity analysis to be insensitive to parameter errors in the model. Treating these characteristics of optimal behavior as predictions about actual behavior reveals that predictions 1 and 2 are correct, and prediction 4 is wrong. An experiment was designed to test prediction 3 by estimating the fat reserves of live birds and measuring how long each would continue incubation in the absence of its mate. Fatter birds did continue incubation for longer though the quantitative detail did not match prediction 3 exactly. Thus 2 aspects of behavior are optimal, but 1 is not.

TI MALE DISPLAYS AND FEMALE PREFERENCES IN THE COURTSHIP OF A GREGARIOUS
   CRICKET
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The courtship of males of the gregarious cricket A. maya involves a variety of signals. The quantitative aspects of both successful and unsuccessful courtship sequences were examined to determine whether certain aspects of male displays were correlated with female mating preferences regardless of which male performed them. Although variability among males was high for most courtship components measured, no evidence of female choice with respect to the courtship variables studied was found.  About 35% of the duration of each male courtship sequence is devoted to chirping, but there were no differences in either the likelihood of copulation or the latency to copulation between normal males and experimentally silenced males. The possibility that intrinsic differences in male quality explained the variability in courtship duration was examined with a 2-way analysis of variance. The variance in courtship duration was attributable to variance among females, not to variance among males.  Thus the courtship behavior of male A. maya is variable enough to allow females to exert stabilizing or disruptive selection on displays, but there is no evidence that females use the available information.

TI SOCIAL RANK AND HABITAT USE IN WILLOW TIT GROUPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Dominance and subordination have been depicted as roles with equal fitness played as parts of a mixed behavioral strategy, but subordination can also be maintained as a transient strategy of hopeful dominants. Resource access in groups of non-kin willow tits, P. montanus, was related to social rank. Dominants excluded subordinates from the preferred microhabitat. Fitness in terms of survival was correlated with access to the preferred foraging sites, indicating that a mixed-strategy explanation is inadequate. Social rank was linked to age and 1st year subordinates behaved as predicted for hopeful dominants. They were not herded by dominant group mates because subordinates actively maintained contact with dominants. One possible reason for subordinates joining winter groups might be the opportunity to reduce dominants'' pay-off from aggression.

TI FOOD STORAGE BY BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEES - MEMORY FOR THE LOCATION AND
   CONTENTS OF CACHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Black-capped chickadees (P. atricapillus) store food in a scattered distribution in their winter home range. Several hundred food items may be stored in a day, each in a separate cache site. Previous studies of marsh tits (P. palustris) and nutcrackers (Nucifraga spp.) showed that spatial memory is used to relocate caches. Memory for storage sites, if used by black-capped chickadees, is predicted to have 4 properties. Birds should be able to: accurately relocate cache sites, recall which caches they have previously emptied, recall which sites they have discovered empty (as a result of loss to other animals) and recall what type of food is stored at a cache site. Laboratory experiments show that chickadees do incorporate these kinds of information in memory for cache sites.

TI ASSORTATIVE MATING BY WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS AT SONG DIALECT BOUNDARIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The hypothesis that female Nuttail''s white-crowned sparrows (Z. l. nuttalli) mate assortatively with males from the same dialect population was tested. Young birds of both sexes learn their natal dialect during an early sensitive period and for females this early experience may be the basis of future mate choice. A total of 32 female sparrows were mist-netted for 3 experiments at or near dialect boundaries just inside the Limantour, Drake and Clear dialect populations in Marin County, California [USA]. The mates of all captured females sang the home dialect. All females were implanted with testosterone and maintained in captivity. Of the females which began to sing, 25 sang recognizable white-crowned sparrow songs. Of those 25 females, 24 had mated assortatively, thus supporting the assortative mating hypothesis.

TI FEMALE AND MALE INTERACTIONS DURING COURTSHIP IN CALOPTERYX-MACULATA AND
   CALOPTERYX-DIMIDIATA (ODONATA, CALOPTERYGIDAE) - INFLUENCE OF
   OVIPOSITION BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB C. maculata and C. dimidiata damselfly females respond to male courtship with specific displays which signal differences in their receptivity. These include a rejection (wing spreading), an invitation (wing-flipping) display and a neutral (sit still) response. There are interspecific differences in the likelihood of each female display and in male responses to these displays. C. maculata males persist in courtship irrespective of female response; C. dimidiata males generally stop courting when the female''s response is rejection or neutrality. These differences may result from interspecific differences in oviposition behavior. Female C. maculata oviposit at the water surface, which exposes them to disturbance by males attempting to mate. Femaels are therefore likely to remate to secure postcopulatory guarding when changing oviposition sites and males are expected to be persistent in courtship. Female C. dimidiata submerge to oviposit, which frees them from male disturbance and means that males have less control over female access to oviposition sites. Males therefore have less influence on mating by females and are expected not to persist in courtship of non-receptive females.

TI MATERNAL-CARE AND BEHAVIORAL-DEVELOPMENT IN PIKAS OCHOTONA-PRINCEPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A laboratory study on the pika, O. princeps, an alpine lagomorph, was conducted to examine the ontogeny of social organization in this species. Wild-caught adult females (36) and their laboratory-born litters were observed for 1182 h from birth of the young to 3 mo. of age. The first quantitative results and description of maternal care and the development of behavior in young pikas is presented. Analysis of maternal behavior showed that pikas exhibit an absentee maternal care system, characteristic of the order Lagomorpha. Females visited the nest once every 2 h, nursing for an average of 10 min each visit. All maternally-initiated nursing behaviors declined to 0 by the the 6th week. Retrieval of neonates was not observed. Young pikas are born altrical and slightly haired, with eyes closed and teeth fully erupted. Pikas were weaned by the end of the 6th wk, at an average weight of 75 g. The 1st adult behaviors observed were scent-marking, alarm-calling and aggression;  sexual behavior was not well-developed by the end of the 3-mo. observation period. During the period of weaning conflict, maternal agression peaked, as nursing attempts by the young increased. During this time, young males made more nursing attempts than did sibling females and adult females were more aggressive toward young males than toward females. After weaning, mothers became non-interactive with young, but the aggression of young toward littermates and the mother increased until the 8th wk, when overall aggression levelled off. Vocalizations and scent-marking behavior increased over time and they were positively correlated with interaction rates. By the end of 3 mo., the young had reached adult weight and were extremely territorial and aggressive toward conspecifics.

TI TERRITORIAL DEFENSE AND ITS SEASONAL DECLINE IN THE SPECKLED WOOD
   BUTTERFLY (PARARGE-AEGERIA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male P. aegeria butterflies fight aggressively over ownership of sunspot territories in the ground layer of woodland. The duration of these encounters decreases from a mean of 50 s and 85 s in the first 2 days to a mean of 10 s after a week''s activity. This decline is best correlated with the progression of the season but also with the daily maximum temperature and the density of males, measured as number of encounters/h. Releases of virgin females suggest that the sunspots are used as mating rendezvous sites. Sunspots might be more attractive to both males and females when ambient temperatures are low, so that the importance of sunspots as mating rendezvous sites (and concomitantly, the benefit of territory ownership) decreases as the ambient temperatures increase with the progression of the season. Results are largely consonant with those of Davies (1978b). Prior ownership of sunspots does not function as a cue for settling territorial conflicts. Instances (17) in which the original territory owner regained ownership after a few minutes'' absence, during which time a newcomer had landed in the sunspot territory were observed. Possible explanations for the discrepancy between Davies'' and the present results are discussed.

TI GROUP MATING AMONG NORWAY RATS .1. SEX-DIFFERENCES IN THE PATTERN AND
   NEUROENDOCRINE CONSEQUENCES OF COPULATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The copulatory pattern of groups of rats (R. norvegicus) was studied in the laboratory in a seminatural environment. In a given mating session, every estrous female copulated with each male; likewise, every male copulated with each estrous female. While individual males and females experienced similar amounts of copulation, there were dramatic sex differences in sequence and temporal pattern. Males mated in a multiple intromission pattern and had more ejaculatory series when several females were in estrus. In contrast, females received intromissions and ejaculations in a random order, not in the sequence of a male ejaculatory series. Males copulated at shorter intervals than females did, a temporal sex difference that was determined by the pattern of female solicitations and male approaches. These sex differences are used to discuss the different units of analysis that are appropriate for male and female sexual behavior in this species. The sex differences in the temporal pattern of copulation which emerged during group mating parallel the known sex differences in the temporal parameters of the neuroendocrine reflexes which mediate successful reproduction in the domestic strain.

AB Winter feeding territories were more profitable to owners than intruders. Even when intruders landed on a territory undetected they failed to achieve a profitable feeding rate because they fed in areas recently depleted by the owner. For intruders, ownership was a sign of unprofitability. Intruders called ''chis-ick'' to find out if a territory was occupied. Owners replied ''chee-wee'' and this was sufficient to cause the intruder to retreat. Only owners called ''chee-wee''. Owners reacted more aggressively to tape-recorded broadcasts of the ''chee-wee'' call played on their territory than to broadcasts of ''chis-ick''.

AB The crayfish, C. d. diogenes Girard (1852), spends most of its life cycle in individually constructed undergrown burrows. The architectural behavioral patterns and sequences with which adult C. d. diogenes excavate an underground chamber were evaluated. Two motor patterns (pushing and carrying) and 3 burrow stages (shallow depression, angular pit and burrow with 2 openings) were identified. During the development of burrowing behavior in juveniles, a 3rd motor pattern (fanning) occurred. While the 3 motor patterns are functional soon after hatching, crayfish may learn to orient the carrying motor pattern for the most efficient excavation of a stage-3 burrow with 2 openings. The ground-water level determined the final structure of a burrow.

TI AVOIDING PREDATION BY ARMY ANTS - DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS OF 3 ANT SPECIES
   OF THE GENUS CAMPONOTUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Antipredation behaviors of 3 ant species of the genus Camponotus were investigated in field and laboratory studies. Contact with the army ant Neivamyrmex nigrescens was shown to produce nest evacuation and removal of brood by colonies of C. festinatus. Colonies of C. ocreatus and C. vicinus defended their nests through recruitment of the major caste. The initiation of evacuation or aggressive recruitment was dependent upon tactile contacts between Camponotus nestmates. Other sorts of disturbance which did not involve army ant contact did not produce evacuation or recruitment, indicating a high degree of enemy specification by Camponotus. The comparison of worker morphology revealed a close relationship between each species'' strategy for nest defense and the degree of worker polymorphism exhibited. These findings suggest that interspecific ant predation has been a significant factor in the evolution of colony defense systems and caste polymorphism.

TI THERMAL-DEPENDENCE OF BEHAVIORAL PERFORMANCE OF ANURAN AMPHIBIANS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The thermal dependence of performance capacity was assessed in 2 anuran amphibians, Bufo boreas (western toad) and Rana pipiens (leopard frog). Quantitative measurements of performance showed that Bufo could sustain slow rates of walking for 10 min and cover greater distances than Rana, which initially jumped more vigorously but fatigued within 5 min. Changes in performance with changes in body temperature were virtually instantaneous, and performance exhibited no acclimation over 7 days. Within the range of temperatures studied, performance capacity increased with increasing body temperature and reached a maximum at 28.degree. C in Bufo and 20.degree.-29.degree. C in Rana. Performance capacity and the underlying metabolic processes had a similar thermal dependence within a species. The behavioral capacity for activity is apparently maximal for both species at body temperatures normally encountered in the field. Anuran behaviors requiring sustained activity (migration to breeding sites, mating, foraging) must be markedly temperature-sensitive.

TI PAIR AND GROUP BREEDING-BEHAVIOR OF A COMMUNAL GALLINULE, THE PUKEKO,
   PORPHYRIO PORPHYRIO-MELANOTUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pukeko, P. p. melanotus, breed as pairs or groups and the breeding behavior of individuals in all units is described and compared. Courtship, including copulation, occurred between all adult members in a territory although male-female copulations were most frequent. Low ranking yearlings were excluded from copulation. Participation in copulation by more than 2 birds was common and along with homosexual behavior may help to synchronize sexual cycles allowing several females to lay in the same nest at the same time. Only adults incubated, while all birds in a territory assisted with chick care, the degree of participation varying with status. In pair territories, older chicks helped feed younger chicks. Stable kin groups were more coordinated and showed less competitive aggression among members than non-kin groups of unstable membership. In a situation where an adult group is necessary for the defense of a breeding territory, it may be in the interests of all these individuals to participate in all breeding activities.

TI PRIMING OF AGGRESSIVE MOTIVATION IN BETTA-SPLENDENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Swimming speed in a runway for a view of a conspecific was positively correlated with vigor of aggressive display prior to the experiment. A priming procedure (pre-exposure to a conspecific), and decreasing the time between trials, increased swimming speed. Priming also increased the choice for a conspecific over food, but only in the presence of particular external stimuli. The level of aggressive motivation may be determined by a complex interaction of internal and external factors, and there may be a high degree of similarity between aggression and other motivations such as hunger and thirst.

TI INFLUENCE OF MALE NUPTIAL PLUMAGE ON MATE SELECTION IN THE FEMALE
   MALLARD (ANAS-PLATYRHYNCHOS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The basis of mate selection in the mallard was investigated, with special reference to the role of the female. Females were reared under more or less restricted social conditions during ontogeny. When sexually mature they were offered a choice between males of different color categories. The females used were raised under 3 conditions: with natural mother and siblings (control females), with experience of other conspecific females but no males, or with no experience of ducks at all (Kaspar Hauser). The total number of females used was 227. The females could discriminate between normal mallards and differently colored mallards to a large extent, irrespective of their own early experience. The females'' initial mate selection is dependent on male plumage characteristics.

LA English
DT Article
AB Grooming and related behaviors among adult females in 3 groups of vervet monkeys were studied for 14 mo. In all groups, high rates of grooming were significantly correlated with high rates of alliance formation and/or proximity. Females of all ranks competed more for the opportunity to groom high-ranking, as opposed to low-ranking, individuals. High-ranking females received more grooming than others and, at least partly as a result of competition, 16 of 23 females gave more grooming than expected to those of adjacent rank. Changes in grooming distributions during the 8 wk after birth were accurately predicted in 4 cases studied by a model based on the attractiveness of females with infants, the attractiveness of high rank and competition.

DT Article
AB P. cinerea is a member of one of the most primitive families of tube-case-building caddisflies. Its basic case-building behavior is recorded together with the species'' adaptability when exposed to manipulation of features of its environment, building materials and limb complement. Silk is used for various purposes during construction and forms 3 concentric layers on the inside of the finished case. Animals deprived of any one pair of legs make functional cases, although in the intact animal, each pair appears to have a specific function. The species is highly adaptable in its ability to use substitute case-building materials.

AB Urine preferences of wild (C. aperea), domestic (C. porcellus) and F1 adult male guinea pigs were investigated. Males of all 3 types preferred female urine to male urine regardless of donor type. When given a choice between female urine of each type, males preferred conspecific urine. In choices between male urine of the 3 types, a conspecific preference was evident for wild and domestic but not F1 subjects. A loss of distinctive male and female odors has not occurred as a result of domestication. The urine odors of wild and domestic types have diverged. The possible effects of previous individual experience on the preferential response are discussed.

TI TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF FEEDING IN THE DOMESTIC CHICK - AD-LIBITUM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB One problem in developing models that may adequately describe the temporal patterns of feeding behavior is to describe and understand the range of individual variation present in such patterns. Data from 50 chicks [Gallus gallus domesticus] showing such variation is analyzed. Both meals and gaps often have a constant probability of ending. Meals are likely to correlate positively with the gap after in individuals that feed relatively infrequently but tend to correlate positively with the gap before in other individuals feeding more often than usual. This probably represents one aspect of alternative feeding strategies that may be found. Some aspects of current models of feeding are discussed.

TI COMPETITIVE MATE SEARCHING IN MALE COMMON TOADS, BUFO-BUFO
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The reproductive behavior of a population of individually marked toads B. bufo was studied at a pond where males outnumbered females by between 4 and 5 to 1. There was intense competition between the males for mates and only 20.5% of them bred successfully. Of the successful males, 38.5% got mates by fighting and displacing other males from the backs of females (takeovers). Larger males had greater reproductive success because they were stronger and better able to achieve takeovers. When competing for females, some males searched at the spawn site while others searched away from spawn. The numbers searching in the 2 areas can be predicted by a model which assumes that unpaired males distribute themselves so that there is a spatial ESS [evolutionarily stable strategy], where individuals have equal expectations of finding a female both at and away from the spawning ground.

AB Socially reared chickens (1, 3, 6, 9 or 12 days posthatch) received 3.0 mA, sham or no shock immediately before restraint-induced tonic immobility. Immobility durations of unshocked groups were relatively brief and did not change significantly at 1, 3 and 6 days posthatch, increased significantly at 9 days and did not change from 9-12 days posthatch. Shock significantly increased immobility duration at each posthatch age. Immobility durations for shock groups did not differ significantly from each other at 1, 3 or 6 days posthatch, increased significantly at 9 days and declined significantly from 9-12 days posthatch. A 2nd experiment replicated the shock-related increase, peak and decline in immobility duration using lower shock intensities.

AB The phototactic responses of anuran amphibians to narrow-band monochromatic stimuli of equal quantum intensity were measured. The unimodal spectral response, obtained from dark- adapted American toads (Bufo americanus), peaks near 626 T[tera]Hz of frequency (480 nm wavelength). The bimodal, U-shaped spectral response, obtained from dark-adapted tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei), has the anti-mode at about 589 THz (510 nm) and is not merely the spectral mirror-image of the unimodal response. Absolute level of the spectral stimuli of equal quantum intensity did not affect the spectral response of dark-adapted toads, but light-adaptation enhanced a component that has the same spectral peak as the visual pigment absorption spectrum of principal and single cones of the frog''s retina.

TI PATERNAL CARE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Review
AB This review presents a systematic compilation of species in which only the male cares for the offspring. Such species occur rarely in the polychaetes, Hemiptera, Amphibia and birds and more often in pycnogonids and fish. The facts are interpreted in the light of sexual selection theories. Care by only the male is more likely to occur if fertilization is external and might often be selected for as a consequence of site-attached behavior by males. An explanation is suggested for the evolution of total role-reversal: it might result from the breakdown of a state of secondary equality of parental investment by the 2 sexes.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Gerbils reared in tunnel systems responded to a visual stimulus by fleeing, foot-thumping and remaining concealed, whereas many gerbils reared in laboratory cages responded in the same situation by approaching the stimulus. The critical factor in tunnel-rearing was the opportunity to flee to shelter during maturation. Neither isolation from illumination nor isolation from stimuli associated with human handlers produced the observed effect. Gerbils reared in laboratory cages exhibit the pattern of flight and concealment in response to stimulation following 24 h experience in a tunnel system. The data are discussed in terms of their implications for models of the ontogeny of the behavior characteristic of domesticated, as compared with wild strains.

AB The entire behavior of selection of web-site by A. aurantia is briefly described. Data on the following characteristics of the location of webs are provided: height in the vegetation, orientation of lean of web, use of different types of vegetation within a habitat, and abundance of insects at the site. In the laboratory, araneid spiders tested prefer higher light intensity and low humidity. The choice of height by immature A. aurantia is experimentally related to the height at which the spider begins its search for a web-site (point of release in cage), and to the covering of the cage (reduction of wind). Differences of these animals with A. trifasciata Forskal and with adult A. aurantia released in cages are reported and related to differential use of microhabitats. The behavior of selection of web-site is discussed with regard to avilability of prey and predation pressure, comparisons being made to other groups of animals.

TI SIGNIFICANCE OF SONG REPERTOIRES - BEAU GESTE HYPOTHESIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The major current hypotheses to explain the apparently redundant song repertoires of many oscine birds (individual recognition, sexual selection, matched countersinging, habituation) are discussed. An alternative idea is proposed that song repertoires in some species have evolved in the context of density assessment. In the great tit, non-territorial birds use the song of residents as a cue in assessing density. Repertoires may be used by resident birds to increase the apparent density of singing residents, and decrease the apparent suitability of the area to new birds. Some implications of the idea are explored and some predictions are listed.

AB Two-act sequence analysis was used to analyze the intraspecific agonistic behavior of the stone crab, M. mercenaria. Eight acts observed were displays with communicatory value because the behavior of the recipient crab was altered following their performance. In 96% of the trials, one individual established dominance, usually by means of visual or low-intensity tactile displays. Fights with extensive bilateral aggression were infrequent. These results indicate a relatively high degree of ritualization. Dominance was correlated with larger size, the male sex and prior possession of a burrow. Interactions between animals of different sizes or of different sexes were characterized by a lower frequency of fights than encounters between animals of similar size or of the same sex.

TI HOSTILE ENCOUNTERS AMONG SPRUCE-WOODS WARBLERS (DENDROICA-PARULIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Intraspecific interactions were initiated with high frequency by 4 spp. of sympatric warblers (Dendroica: Parulidae) early in the breeding season. They declined during the incubation and nestling stages and then increased during the fledging stage in 2 spp., the black-throated green (Dendroica virens) and yellow-rumped (D. coronata) warblers. Interspecific interactions occurred infrequently early in the season, but increased during the incubatin and nestling stages in the black-throated green and blackburnian (D. fusca) warblers and during the fledging stage in the magnolia warbler (D. magnolia). Fights and chases predominated over supplanting attacks in both intraspecific and interspecific encounters. Male black-throated green and yellow-rumped warblers initiated hostile encounters more frequently than did their females, but male and female blackburnian and magnolia warblers did not differ in this regard. A somewhat equivocal interspecific social dominance hierarchy occurred: magnolia > black-throated green > yellow-rumped > blackburnian. Reversals to this trend were frequent and may have resulted from the strong defenses initiated by these species in certain parts of their territories, particularly about their nests.

TI SURPLUS KILLING AND CACHING BY AMERICAN KESTRELS (FALCO-SPARVERIUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB On all 8 trials while free in the laboratory, a male American kestrel (F. sparverius) killed and deposited more than 1 prey (surplus killing), which were presented 1 at a time. When confined in a smaller enclosure surplus killing occurred only once in 5 trials. Two wild female F. sparverius displayed surplus killing of white mice thrown sequentially from a moving car. Some mice were cached, as defined by a pushing movement. The male consistently ate the surplus prey; 1 female ate white mice on subsequent days and at least 1 prey deposited by the 2nd female was absent the next day. Since the kestrels utilized some of the prey, it is suggested that surplus killing with caching might be adaptive.

AB Four changes in the adult female dominance hierarchy of a confined social group of rhesus monkeys were induced by either the introduction of a strange adult male when the 2nd ranking female was in estrus or by removal and reintroduction of the currently top-ranking female. Mothers and offspring ranked in a new hierarchy following each rank change. Offspring directly reflected the rise or fall or the rank of the mother, and not only were influenced by the rank changes but contributed to them.

AB For the purpose of compar-ing the behavioral development of looptail (Lp/+) mice and normal (+/+) mice, 28 components performed by single males were screened by direct observation on days 3, 8, 10, 14, 17, and 31 after birth. The data on the behavior of normal mice confirmed earlier findings. Apart from wobbly head movements, mutants showed at specific ages decreased frequencies of twitching, pivoting, 3 grooming activities, leaning postures, rearing, climbing and vibrating with the forelegs. These results are related to previous findings in older looptails and discussed in terms of the abnormal development of certain brain structures.

TI INFANTILE STIMULATION AND ADULT EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOUR IN RAT - EFFECTS
   OF HANDLING UPON VISUAL VARIATION SEEKING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experimental rats were handled daily between birth and weaning; controls were not disturbed during this interval. In adulthood 2 experiments were run to test for visual exploratory behavior. In experiment 1, 3 degrees of visual stimulus variation were created in a Greek-cross apparatus by having walls painted flat black; flat white; or black, white, and gray. Thirty handled and 30 nonhandled subjects were tested. As the degree of stimulus variation increased, the exploratory behavior of handled rats increased while the exploratory behavior of the controls was depressed. In addition, handled animals spent significantly more time in the gray and white compartments than did controls. In experiment 2, the Greek cross was painted flat white and 2 degrees of visual stimulus variation was prepared by varying the illumination in each compartment. Twenty handled and 20 nonhandled rats were tested. As the degree of stim ulus variation increased, the exploratory behavior of handled subjects increased while the exploratory behavior of controls was depressed. In addition, handled rats spent significantly more time in the brightly illuminated compartment than did nonhandled controls.

TI RAIDING AND RELATED BEHAVIOUR IN 2 SURFACE-ADAPTED SPECIES OF OLD WORLD
   DORYLINE ANT AENICTUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A 3-year investigation centered on surveys of colony behavior in 2 surface-adapted species of Aenictus indigenous to the Philippines. Several of the colonies were studied over long periods. Nomadic-phase bivouacs of colonies in these species are chiefly simple surface clusters formed under light cover; statary-phase bivouacs are formed in well-sheltered sites usually in underground cavities. Colonies of these species of Aenictus begin their raids both by day and by night, with secondary differences in the daily schedule early and late in the phase, when raids are most frequent in late afternoon and early evening. In these respects Aenictus differs sharply from surface-adapted species of Eciton and Neivamrymex, the daily colony schedules of which are keyed to the 24 hr. march of environmental events. In the 2 species studied, the statary phase begins with 4 or 5 days of light raiding, after which surface raids are nearly always absent until the last few days of the phase in A. laeviceps and the end of the phase in A. gracilis. These species, the principal surface-adapted dorylines in the area of study and undoubtedly competitive, are strikingly similar in their bivouacking and raiding behavior and in their range of booty (in which other ants and their brood predominate). The raids of these 2 species are of the branched-column type, operating on chemical trails. At high colony excitation, complex patterns develop with large systems of branching trails ending in column networks and large foraging groups. Nomadic-phase raids vary in duration from less than an hour to more than 12 hr, without reliable differences through the phase. The average distance of raids from the bivouac is near 20 m, the range roughly 10-80 m. Colony variations in the vigor of raiding are indicated by features other than distance. In Aenictus, in contrast to Eciton and other dorylines studied, the patterns of colony behavior in raiding and bivouacking may be characterized as simple. These aspects, together with the functional implications of small, virtually monomorphic colony populations (and relatively uncomplicated organization in mass behavior), seem basic to features regarded as primitive among the doryline ants. The raids and bivouac-changes of colonies of Aenictus evidently occur rather directly under the domination of intra-colony excitatory processes[long dash]as compared with an indirect, complex role indicated for the latter in Eciton.

TI CONTROL THEORY APPLIED TO CONTROL OF DRINKING IN BARBARY DOVE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A preliminary hypothesis about the system controlling drinking in the Barbary dove is derived from experimental data of a behavioral rather than a physiological kind. The model which results from this process is capable of predicting the course of water intake during recovery from water deprivation, but is unable to account for the observed bodyweight changes. By analysing the model according to the rules outlined in the appendix, a more complex model is arrived at, which accounts for both water intake and bodyweight changes during recovery from water deprivation. This complex model also accounts for the course of food intake during water deprivation, and the extent to which water intake falls during food deprivation. The model shows a close parallel to the known physiological facts and successfully predicts the daily evaporative water loss in the Barbary dove, and the extent to which Barbary doves can tolerate water rationing, without loss of bodyweight.

TI A POSSIBLE ENDOCRINE BASIS FOR MIGRATORY BEHAVIOUR IN WHITE-CROWNED
   SPARROW ZONOTRICHIA LEUCOPHRYS GAMBELII
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB By using hormone preparations, a simulated migratory behavior was induced in caged Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii, a nocturnal migrant. Daily injections of prolactin increase nocturnal restlessness in photosensitive birds under outdoor conditions prior to spring migration and also initiate nocturnal loco-motor activity in photorefractory birds held indoors on a long daily photoperiod. These effects are augmented by adrenocortical hormones which, however, are ineffective when administered alone. In addition, metapirone, an inhibitor of adrenocortical synthesis, suppresses nocturnal activity. Simultaneous injections of cortlcosterone eliminate the metapirone-induced suppression of nocturnal activity. In prolactin- treated birds, there is a reduction of locomotor activity during the last 2 hr. of light that is strikingly similar to the late afternoon reduction in activity as natural Zugunruhe develops. The dual role of prolactin in promoting fattening and nocturnal locomotor activity, and the augmentation of nocturnal activity by adrenocortical hormones were discussed in regard to their possible involvement in the physiologic events of migration. Assays of pituitary prolactin at several times during the annual cycle appear to be compatible with a hypothesis involving prolactin in the development and maintenance of migratory behavior.

AB Quanitative data of king crab pods were obtained by scuba divers interested in studying the early life history of this valuable commercial crustacean. From Dec. through Sept. spherical aggregates called "pods" composed of either 1-or 2-year-old juveniles occur throughout the coastal waters of Alaska. The behavior and structure of these widely separated pods appear to be identical, suggesting a genetic origin. Individual pods are composed of both male and female crabs of similar age. Younger post-larval crabs live solitarily among the protective niches of the bottom substrate before emerging to form aggregations. Groups of 4-year-old and older crabs lose their spherical identity when they form large nomadic aggregates of various sizes and shapes.

The prosimians oriented rewarded mainpulations to cues of general direction, not to detail of unfamiliar objects. They developed strong position habits in the discrimination and delayed response tests. Adult prosimians and infant higher primates make similar errors in manipulating objects. The observed data are in accord with the behavioral theories of Hebb and of Piaget.

   INBRED LINES TO VARIOUS AMOUNTS OF CYANIDE-KILLED BROOD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Colonies of 2 inbred lines of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were tested to learn how quickly they would remove known numbers of cyanide-killed brood from combs in their broodnests. A disease-resistant line usually required a day or 2 to remove all dead brood, whereas the disease-susceptible line required several times as long. In a series of 3 experiments involving different numbers of dead individuals, a colony of the resistant line required about 50 hours in each case to remove 119 dead individuals, 985, or 2033. In 228 hours the susceptible colony had not finished removing 167 in one case, nor 1000, nor 2011 in 2 others. Numbers of dead larvae within these limits does not alter time required for removal by a normal colony.

DT Article
AB In southern Michigan the ant Formica obscuriventris Mayr constructs superficial nests under logs and piled-up leaves. Covered runways connect widely spread chambers. In 1962 one colony released approximately 3000 winged ants in 16 flight days between July 27 and August 24. An estimated 2587 males flew, and the first 9 flights were exclusively male. Females took part in 6 flights, but most (362 of the 422) flew on one day. The best flights occurred when bright sun warmed the ground after cold nights. Males could move out of the nest at 57[degree]F. and could begin flying at 63[degree]F. They flew best at about 68[degree]F. and seemed unable to fly at temperatures above 72[degree]F. Females began flying at 66[degree]F. and flew best at 69[degree]F. or 70[degree]F. Dim light delayed or stopped flights even though temperatures might be favorable. Flights were prevented by overcast sky, rain or soaked ground.

AB Mixed-species bird flocks are dynamic associations that exhibit compositional turnover over relatively small timescales. Morphological similarity and foraging behaviour of species in flocks influence the relative benefits and costs of flock participation. In addition, acoustic signals serve many critical life- history functions in birds, including within flocks. However, the role of acoustic signals in flock assembly remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the relationship between acoustic and morphological trait spaces of bird flocks in Peninsular India, using a phylogenetically informed framework. We found that participant species were generally more similar in body mass than expected by chance, and flocks in general were dominated by smaller-sized species. Conversely, we found that flock participants did not exhibit this pattern of similarity for acoustic frequency traits. Thus, in spite of the correlation of vocal frequency with traits such as body size and bill size, body mass and spectral signal space were decoupled at the community scale. This may enable species to derive distinct sets of benefits from both sets of traits and provides valuable insight into the dynamic processes driving flock assembly.

AB Many animals, including humans, nonhuman primates, birds and honey bees, show associations between space and quantity. This association can manifest as a left-to-right mental number line (MNL), which is the preference to spatially order smaller quantities on the left and larger quantities on the right. However, the nature and mechanisms underlying this association between space and quantity are inconsistent among species, and they remain poorly understood, particularly in invertebrates. In this study, the link between magnitude and space in honey bees, Apis mellifera, was investigated to improve our understanding of the evolution of space and quantity associations in diverse taxa. First, we tested whether free-flying honey bees have an innate left-to-right or right-to-left bias for associations between quantity and space similar to the MNL and whether bees showed any evidence of a vertical preference. Along the horizontal orientation, bees only showed a preference for larger quantities on the right, indicating a leftto-right magnitude bias interacting with a weak right spatial bias. No evidence of a vertical magnitude preference was observed as bees had an overall ventral preference. Whether honey bees could be conditioned to order quantities along the left-to-right or right-to-left dimensions of quantity and space was also determined. Although honey bees could learn either a left-to-right or right-to-left quantity and space association during conditioning trials, in subsequent unconditioned tests, they only demonstrated a significant preference for arranging larger quantities on the right when trained to a left-to-right quantity association. Results indicate that bees have an innate left-to-right quantity bias interacting with a right spatial bias. The results of this study improve our understanding of the evolution of quantity processing and the complexities that exist in spatial-magnitude associations. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB An important function of parental care is to ensure the survival of offspring against pathogens. In insects, it was long believed that this function was limited in scope and time and consisted mainly of parental behaviours reducing contact between offspring and pathogens. However, recent data show that insect parents can also improve offspring's defence against pathogens by transferring their acquired immune experience to the eggs during oogenesis. Here, we investigated whether this parental protection could be extended to include postoviposition care. We addressed this question in the European earwig, Forficula auricularia, an insect in which mothers provide extensive forms of care to their eggs and juveniles. We immune-challenged mothers with dead bacterium Serratia marcescens or control solutions while they were caring for their eggs and then monitored the survival rate of these mothers and their resulting adult offspring after a new infection by the same live pathogen. In line with our prediction, we found that both the mothers that were immune-challenged after oviposition and the adult offspring reared by these immune-challenged mothers had the highest survival after infection. However, what triggered this higher survival rate was the wounding of the mothers and not their previous exposure to dead bacteria. Our data also show that these higher survival rates were not associated with changes in the expression of maternal egg care or offspring quality. Overall, our findings shed light on a novel benefit of postoviposition parental care in insects. More generally, they support the recent claim that access to social immunity by offspring may play a key role in the early emergence and maintenance of family life in animals.

TI Within-cavity nest preferences: honey bees favour the entrance rather
   than the ceiling when initiating their nest
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

   site selection
ID SITE SELECTION; TRADE-OFFS; AFRICAN
AB Cavity-nesting animals are limited by the options available in the environment and thus may have to adapt their nest structure to optimize its function. After choosing a cavity, honey bee colonies must decide where to initiate their comb nest within the empty cavity. Within-cavity location preferences remain untested, but previous studies suggest proximity to the ceiling, entrance and east side may be important. To distinguish potential preferences for nest initiation sites, we designed 'infinity nest' hive boxes that were extremely elongated (2.4 m), with target features at opposite ends, thus forcing colonies to choose between the entrance, the east side and the ceiling. Not only did colonies show a clear preference for nesting near the entrance (89%; N 1/4 9), but when the entrance was far from the ceiling, colonies modified their nest by building combs from vertical walls. Combs that were attached to walls were more vertically elongated than combs attached to horizontal ceilings, which likely reduces the straining forces from gravity and shows that bees can alter their entire nest structure to accommodate different attachment angles and initiation site preferences. Therefore, honey bees are not constrained to attaching their comb to the cavity's ceiling and instead pursue other important initiation site features, like proximity to the cavity entrance, which may reduce commute time. Given that colonies reuse their nest for multiple worker generations, the decision of where to initiate the nest within a cavity likely has long-term impacts for colony function. This work demonstrates the importance of plasticity in built structures and the extended phenotype. (c) 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Individuals experience changes in spatiotemporal group cohesion during social foraging, leading to groups splitting up and remerging as smaller subgroups. These temporal changes represent fission -fusion dynamics, which is hypothesized to adjust foraging group size to ecological and social settings. While available evidence supports the importance of ecological drivers, social factors and the joint effects of ecological and social conditions remain relatively less clear. In the present study, we address both components of context to examine whether the stability of foraging groups is driven by socioecological conditions. Specifically, we examined the extent to which stability in group membership by female and male foragers is enhanced by increasing predation risk, food abundance, group kinship and adult opposite-sex ratio. Additionally, we determined whether foraging group stability during mating and offspring rearing seasons was contingent on the sex of individuals. We tested these effects in the degu, Octodon degus, a diurnal and group-living rodent that forages socially and rears offspring communally. We found that degus foraged in small groups of mixed composition, where social stability increased with increasing abundance of high-quality food, increasing refuge density, decreasing interindividual distance and in the presence of predators, and was higher during spring than during winter. In addition, the stability of foraging groups was differentially sensitive to opposite-sex ratio in females and males. Together, these findings highlight how degus adjust social behaviour to socioecological conditions, potentially leading to fitness benefits of social foraging.

AB Jumping spiders display some of the richest visually mediated behaviours in nature. Vision is indeed the most important sensory modality in these spiders where motion detection and response to visual stimuli allow key behaviours such as hunting, escaping from predators and mating. These spiders have been used in various experiments demonstrating the existence of good associative learning and memory abilities, whose mechanism parallels that found in vertebrates. Here we focused on the habituation and dishabituation (H/DH) paradigm, indicating either a gradual decrease in responsiveness to repeated visual stimuli (H), or a recovery in response wherein the reaction towards a known stimulus is enhanced (DH). H is an elementary form of nonassociative learning and memory, which is expected to vary from individual to individual. The link between personality and H/DH has been shown in many vertebrates, but rarely in invertebrates. The jumping spider Menemerus semilimbatus was used in our study to address the question of whether boldness is related to H/DH. In our protocol, habituation was assessed by repeatedly presenting a visual stimulus on a screen to spiders tethered on a locomotor compensator. In the same individuals, boldness was assessed in a walking arena equipped with a shelter. We found that M. semilimbatus habituated and dishabituated to our visual stimulus and that they differed along a shy -bold axis. However, contrary to our expectations, boldness was not related to learning. In consideration of these results, we speculate that the nature (neutral value) of the stimulus might have played a role in making learning independent from boldness.

AB Extended maternal care, defined by protection, nursing and training of young, is a hallmark of mammalian reproduction. Prior maternal experience and maternal caregiving decisions during rearing may influence the success of offspring. Because most maternal caregiving behaviour, such as nursing and defence, requires contact or close proximity to the young, time spent with offspring may be a good proxy for maternal care provision when direct maternal behaviour is unobservable. Although different behavioural patterns can influence how carnivore mothers balance the competing energetic costs of brood raising and food acquisition, relatively little is known about the allocation of maternal care to neonates in solitary felids, such as cougars, Puma concolor. To evaluate how maternal behaviour and provisioning affect kitten survival, we remotely monitored 16 female cougars and their 49 neonate kittens using proximity-linked VHF collars on neonates and paired GPS collars on adults. We deployed collars on 5.5-week-old kittens and monitored their survival to 180 days postbirth. We derived several metrics to quantify maternal care behaviours and fitted Bayesian known-fate survival models to estimate the daily survival probability of kittens and to evaluate the influence of maternal behaviour on kitten survival. We found that kittens who received increased levels of maternal care, such as more time with their mother each day, had higher survival rates among both first-time and experienced mothers. However, experienced mothers exhibited higher kitten survival across all scenarios compared to firsttime mothers. Our results suggests that prior maternal experience is a strong driver of increased kitten survival rates and that kitten survival rates are increased when mothers provide more maternal care.

AB European Temnothorax albipennis and its American counterpart Temnothorax rugatulus build circular walls to limit their nest area within a rock crevice. To determine wall position, workers are thought to rely on a distance template (from the cluster of brood and nurses at the nest centre) and on indirect social (i.e. stigmergic) information found in the aggregations of already-deposited building material. Analytical and simulation models of this behaviour predict that the combination of these two mechanisms can produce the observed wall structure, but there is so far no empirical evidence of either mechanism. Here, we find statistical evidence in support of the stigmergic relationship between stone density and deposition behaviour. We apply hidden Markov models (HMMs) to analyse wallbuilding data from four colonies of T. rugatulus . We show that material deposition activity changes following a parabolic relationship with the density of building material at building sites, different from the linear relationship hypothesized previously. This parabolic curve is similar to behavioural response curves identi fied in the nest enlargement process of several ant species. In addition, HMM analysis indicates the existence of two distinct states in T. rugatulus building activity. These states are associated with different mean building rates (that is, the two states can be described as a high and a low activity state) and might be caused by changes in task priorities during the colony process of settling into a new nest. This study updates one of the earliest models of self-organized animal behaviour. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Like terrestrial animals, wild fish exhibit individual differences in daily activity patterns, known as chronotypes. However, monitoring free-living fish has posed challenges in studying chronotypes and their plasticity in response to the environment. To address this issue, we utilized high-throughput telemetry to measure daily activity in a large group of free-living pearly razorfish, Xyrichtys novacula, while also monitoring fine-scale environmental variables. Using hidden Markov models for behavioural segmentation, we quantified four circadian-related traits (awakening time, rest onset, activity duration relative to the daytime and rest midpoint relative to middle of the night) during two biological contexts (prespawning and spawning). We then used linear mixed-effects models to decompose the variation of these traits into individual, ecological (contextual environment) and population components. Our findings revealed the presence of chronotypes in both sexes, with greater between-individual variation in behaviour during spawning. Males exhibited longer activity duration due to an earlier awakening time than females, and temperature, waves and light significantly influenced daily activity behaviours. However, there was considerable individual variation in response to environmental changes, indicating the emergence of behavioural reaction norms (i.e. plasticity), with females showing greater plasticity in rest onset and relative rest midpoint. Our study also identified significant correlations among traits, suggesting that the activity duration continuum defines the pearly razorfish chronotype. Overall, our work represents the most comprehensive description of individual and ecological contextual variation in chronotypes within a wild marine fish population. It underscores the importance of environmental fluctuations in shaping the expression of internal clocks.

AB Many traits important for reproductive isolation are environmentally responsive. However, most studies examining reproductive isolation do not explicitly take into consideration environmental variation. Temperature can have a particularly large effect on reproductive behaviours, especially in ectotherms. Here, we tested whether temperature affects the degree of reproductive isolation between the upland chorus frog, Pseudacris feriarum, and its congener Pseudacris nigrita. These two species engage in costly hybridization in nature, leading to reinforcement of male signals and female preferences in sympatry. However, male advertisement calls vary with temperature such that the difference between the advertisement calls of the two species is narrower at cold temperatures than at warm temperatures. To examine the effect of temperature on reproductive isolation in this system, we performed six binary choice preference trials using sympatric female P. feriarum. In these experiments, we acclimated females to either warm (20 degrees C) or cool (10 degrees C) temperatures and gave them a choice between heterospecific and conspecific advertisement calls appropriate for the temperature. We also conducted experiments where we gave females a choice between more similar stimuli at warm temperatures to test whether females have narrower preferences at cold temperatures. We found that females always had a significant preference for the conspecific advertisement call, regardless of temperature or signal similarity. However, females took twice as long to make a choice in suboptimal conditions. This time delay may lead to increased risk of hybridization, despite females' ability to discriminate between calls. Our results highlight the importance of considering environmental context when examining traits involved in reproductive isolation. (c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Information cascades have been used to explain a variety of collective behaviours in nonhuman animals, including mate selection, antipredator responses and social foraging. A taxonomically widespread phenomenon, information cascades occur in many group-living animals from ant colonies to schools of fish and social mammals. Here we review the animal behaviour literature for examples of information cascades. We found that the literature on information cascades in animals is limited by inconsistent terminology that fails to adequately describe the differences between cascade types. We propose a classification framework, adapted from behavioural economics, to describe information cascades in behavioural ecology. Our framework consists of three types of information cascades derived from individual level fitness outcomes (adaptive, maladaptive or neutral) and a further two cascade types based on the transmission mechanism of cascading social information (signals or cues). We use a selection of past studies to illustrate the diversity of information cascades and we apply our framework to real world examples. We also discuss four mechanisms used by group-living animals to minimize the spread of maladaptive information cascades and propose avenues for future research. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Human activities have altered the availability of resources for wildlife. Landfill sites now provide abundant and predictable anthropogenic food subsidies worldwide, sustaining increasing numbers of opportunistic species and shaping their foraging behaviour. However, although individuals may differ in their ability to use these resources, the factors influencing this variability within species are still poorly known. Using GPS data from 68 adult and 67 juvenile white storks, Ciconia ciconia, tracked during their premigratory periods between 2018 and 2020, we investigated whether age determines landfill atten-dance and the ability to compete for space and food. Additionally, using video recordings of 165 adults and 124 juveniles obtained in the 2020 premigratory period, we investigated whether age influences landfill foraging proficiency and dominance over resources. Adult storks visited landfills on 57% of the days, while juveniles only visited landfills on 29% of the days. There was strong competition for food at landfills, with adults exerting dominance over juveniles, foraging predominantly in areas with higher food availability and outcompeting juveniles in food acquisition. Juveniles had significantly lower food intake rates in the best foraging areas and showed less aggressiveness, being forced to use adjacent lower quality areas. Overall, juveniles had limited access to landfill resources, suggesting that landfill diet specialization is mediated by age-related improvements in foraging expertise and increased competi-tiveness developed during maturation. Thus, landfill use is shaping foraging strategies and species behaviour from an early age, with potential consequences for population dynamics.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB State variables, such as body condition, are important predictors of behavioural traits. An individual's state could affect its average behavioural response, the costs and benefits associated with exhibiting the behaviour and the behavioural repeatability. However, how the state dependency of behavioural traits changes across life stages within the same individual is less well studied. Here, we manipulated the body condition, by starvation, in larvae and adults of a holometabolous insect, Athalia rosae. We assessed the effects of starvation on the behavioural traits of postcontact immobility (PCI) and activity levels and tested their repeatability. Our results show state dependency of behaviour, although the effect varied by life stage. Starved larvae exhibited shorter PCI duration and higher activity levels, whereas starved adults were less active than nonstarved individuals. Moreover, although most behavioural repeatability estimates were significant in both life stages, we did not find any significant effect of starvation on the estimates. Next, we calculated standardized effect sizes to compare starvation effects across life stages. We found that starvation had a larger and opposite effect in the larval stage than during the adult stage for all behavioural traits. Finally, we conducted microcosm and no-choice bioassay experiments to examine the benefits and costs, respectively, of the behaviour elicited by starvation in the larval stage. We observed that starved larvae located food faster than nonstarved larvae but were also attacked sooner by a predator, possibly due to their higher activity levels. Together, our results demonstrate that behavioural state dependence is a function of the life stage of an individual. Moreover, the behavioural strategy exhibited can be adaptive for a specific life stage with respect to certain functions, like foraging, but also carry costs, like higher risk of predation. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Familial conflict, including parent-offspring conflict (POC) and sibling competition (SC), occurs when an individual maximizes its access to a limiting resource at the expense of a related individual. The role of familial conflict for competition over space as a limited resource remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we examined how familial conflict affects natal dispersal and settlement decisions of a solitary mammal, the brown bear, Ursus arctos, and tested whether these settlement patterns covary with fitness. First, we tested whether the distance settled from the natal range was affected by aspects of POC (litter type: single versus multiple; mother's age; mother's living status) and SC (settled near versus far from the natal home range, body size). We then modelled how distance settled from the natal range influ-enced three measures of fitness: survival to reproduction, lifetime reproductive success and lifetime survival. In line with POC, we found that daughters settled twice as far from the natal range when their mother was alive than when she was dead. We found strong evidence for SC where in sibling pairs, the 'near' sister settled nearly three times closer to the natal range than her sibling. We found contradictory patterns in fitness outcomes based on settlement distance, such that females settling closer to the natal range had higher lifetime survival but were less likely to successfully wean at least one offspring. Despite survival advantages gained by settling closer to the natal range, there was no evidence that settlement distance influenced lifetime reproductive success. Fitness outcomes in this population may be influenced more by factors related to annual hunting than by familial conflict or proximity to the natal range. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Understanding the development of social relationships can provide insights into the processes by which social network structures emerge and vary across species. Here we extend a previous analysis (Vilette et al., 2022, Animal Behaviour, 194, 205-223) that tested Kohn's (2019, Animal Behaviour, 154,1-6) model of social relationship formation in three groups of wild juvenile vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus. This previous analysis showed that, although developmental patterns did not conform to the exploration, pruning and consolidation phases identified by Kohn (2019), juveniles formed a core of strong social ties (a social 'bubble') across development. Here, we use a novel approach to objectively extract strong ties and ask whether Kohn's (2019) phases are more appropriately evaluated with reference to the subset of strong ties that constitute social bubbles. We investigate social bubble formation and composition, as well as the role of maternal behaviour in the development of these bubbles. As before, spatial and grooming social bubbles did not develop according to Kohn's (2019) framework. On the one hand, spatial bubbles were composed mainly of juveniles and showed increased association rates for family members during the annual birth season. Juvenile grooming bubbles, on the other hand, were stable over time and restricted solely to their mothers. Resulting from this, we found that juveniles did not simply groom their closest spatial associates but distributed their grooming towards specific partners. Finally, we found that a mother's grooming ties and her offspring's grooming weak ties remained mostly different as juveniles developed. This finding supports a previous analysis on our population (Jarrett et al., 2018, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 285(1876), Article 20172668), where juveniles had to develop connections with nonmaternal associates in order to replicate the overall grooming network. These results indicate that the structure and composition of social bubbles in our sample reflect both the behaviour under consideration (grooming or spatial proximity) and group demography.Crown Copyright & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB All animals must face predation risks at some points in their lives and individuals may vary in how much risk they are willing to accept. While it is well recognized that sociality is a way to manage risks, and social group size effects are well studied, the specific ways in which different types of social relationships influence individual risk response, such as number of interaction partners or the centrality of an individual's position in their group, are not well understood. We examined how yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer, affiliative and agonistic social networks are associated with two repeatable measures of risk-related behaviour: boldness/risk taking, quantified from flight initiation distance to a simulated predator approach, and docility/risk aversion, quantified from response to human trapping and handling. We found that docile individuals were less socially integrated and that certain agonistic, but not affiliative, social network measures that quantified their positions in their networks were associated with individual docility. Animals in tighter agonistic networks were also those who were less docile after controlling for a number of other variables that could explain variation in these traits. We found that boldness was not correlated with an individual's agonistic or affiliative interactions. We conclude that some social network measures are part of a docility syndrome in yellow-bellied marmots. Similar studies in other systems are needed to better understand the importance of agonistic and affiliative relationships in selecting for behavioural syndromes.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Prey choice by predators may be based on the potential prey's condition, for example resulting in sub-standard individuals running a higher risk of being predated. Over 5 years, we studied young jackdaws, Corvus monedula, to determine whether size and innate baseline immune function may predict predation risk by goshawks, Accipiter gentilis, during the nestling and early fledging phases. We measured body mass, wing length, tarsus length and four innate immune indices two to four times when nestlings were 12-29 days old. To determine which individuals had been predated during the nestling phase and shortly after fledging, we searched for metal rings of the jackdaws in the only goshawk territory close to the jackdaw colony. Nestling mortality before 12 days of age was entirely due to starvation, whereas between 12 days of age and fledging, mortality was mainly due to predation. Nestlings with smaller size (mass, wing, tarsus) and low lysis titre and haptoglobin concentrations were at a higher risk of being predated before fledging. Directly after fledging, individuals with short wings were preferentially pre-dated, with no effects of body mass, tarsus length or any of the four immune indices measured at day 29 (i.e. shortly before fledging). That lower immune function and smaller size predict predation risk in nestlings may reflect that these individuals are of poor quality and/or lag behind in development. We hypothesize that hunger makes these nestlings sit closest to the entrance hole and hence become the first to be predated. For fledglings, our results suggest that poor flight ability makes individuals with short wings the easiest targets for avian predators.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB A variety of animals have been found to interact with and manipulate inanimate objects 'just for fun', that is, to play. Most clear examples of object play come from mammals and birds. However, whether insects interact with inanimate objects as a form of play has never been systematically examined. Here, we show that rolling of wooden balls by bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, fulfils behavioural criteria for animal play and is akin to play in other animals. We found that ball rolling (1) did not contribute to immediate survival strategies, (2) was intrinsically rewarding, (3) differed from functional behaviour in form, (4) was repeated but not stereotyped, and (5) was initiated under stress-free conditions. Through the design of the experiment and with the support of behavioural observations, we excluded the possibilities that ball rolling was driven by exploration for food, clutter clearing or mating. Similar to vertebrate play, we also found age and sex differences for ball rolling by bumble bees: younger bees rolled more balls than older bees and male bees rolled individual balls for longer durations than females. We explicitly show that ball rolling is itself a rewarding activity. After being trained to find freely movable balls in one of two differently coloured chambers, bees showed a preference for the colour of the chamber where they had rolled balls. Our results contribute to the question of sentience in insects and lend further support for the existence of positive affective states in these animals.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB In many species, individual animals often maintain relatively consistent individual differences in behaviour, indicative of temperament or personality. These stable individual differences are important for life history, survival and health consequences, and the field has seen exponential growth in temperament (e.g. boldness, exploration, sociability, aggression and activity) research. Quantification of animal temperament can be difficult because it requires (1) repeated behavioural measures from the same individual (to gauge within-individual consistency across time and contexts) and (2) identification of the most appropriate behaviour(s) to characterize temperament. In the current study, we took an atheoretical approach and conducted repeat, diverse behavioural tests in a low-variable environment to determine behaviours that were individually consistent over time and across conditions. To control environmental effects on behaviour, we conducted this work with individually housed outbred male SpragueeDawley rats in a laboratory. To determine individual consistency, we measured each rat's behavioural response to five different arenas (i.e. different contexts) and repeated the five tests at three time points. To identify potential composite, multibehaviour estimates of temperament, we used factor analyses to determine behaviours that covaried on each test arena, and calculated factor scores. To determine individual consistency of behaviours and factor scores across time and contexts, we used reliability and correlation analyses. Several behaviours consistently covaried on each test, and with a few notable exceptions, the resulting factors tended to align with five commonly studied temperament categories. Certain behaviours/factors were more consistent across time and contexts than others; distance travelled/activity were highly consistent, as were sociality- and boldness-related behaviours, whereas aggression and exploration were less consistent. We did not find strong evidence that multibehaviour estimates of temperament (factor scores) were more consistent over time or across conditions than single-behaviour metrics. Where possible, similar atheoretical approaches to cross-time and cross-context behaviour testing will be beneficial for initial temperament characterization.

AB How important are sampling and experimental design decisions in shaping test subject behaviour under laboratory conditions? We examined the effects of circatidal rhythm, time held in captivity, sampling location (open or covered areas of habitat), acclimation period and water depth on activity and emer-gence latency in hermit crabs (Pagurus bernhardus). We found that subjects held in captivity for 1 month and those collected from the open were faster to emerge from their shells after disturbance compared, respectively, to those tested after 1 day in captivity or collected from beneath cover. We also found that subjects tested after shorter acclimation periods were more active than those tested following longer acclimation periods. Our findings reveal that sampling and study design decisions can have pronounced influences on subject behaviour measured under otherwise common conditions, with potentially important implications for interpretation and reproducibility of findings. As researchers we should take care to explicitly consider how sampling biases and effects arising from our experimental protocols might affect the behavioural responses of test subjects. Doing so can help us make more reasonable generalizations beyond our subject pool, draw better-informed comparisons between studies and ach-ieve greater reproducibility of findings.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Sexual conflict is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom and often involves costly sexual harassment of females by males. An overlooked outcome of sexual conflict is its potential impact on social behaviour. Due to their seemingly harmful mode of copulation (traumatic insemination) and tendency to form aggregations, bed bugs are an ideal model for studying the social implications of sexual conflict. Repeated traumatic inseminations are known to reduce some aspects of female fitness, so we expected the benefits to males and the high costs for females of frequent mating to result in divergent social preferences between the sexes. To examine the impact of sexual harassment on social structure, we devised a novel experimental arena with either two shelters or 12 shelters and continuously tracked sexual and social interactions between individually marked bed bugs over 6 days. By constructing aggregation networks, we examined whether female bed bugs occupied more peripheral network positions compared to males as well as whether females preferentially associated with other females as a strategy to reap the benefits of group living while mitigating the costs of unsolicited sexual attention. We found no evidence that females shape their social environment to evade associating with males. However, when tested indi-vidually in a follow-up experiment, mated females showed a strong preference for social cues from females over social cues from males. Our results therefore suggest that males and females may be in conflict over the composition of social associations and highlight the importance of both examining behaviour at the individual level and tracking larger groups of freely interacting populations in more complex environments.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many species, males form aggregations in which they compete for access to mates. Such aggregations can consist of multiple species, such that hybridization or reproductive interference between species becomes a risk. To enhance mating success with conspecifics, males might preferentially aggregate with conspecifics to minimize the risks of mating or competing with heterospecifics, especially if females are attracted to groups of conspecific males or avoid heterospecific males. Here, we used spadefoot toads (genus Spea) to evaluate whether males respond to the same environmental cue that females use to facultatively alter their mate choice decisions for conspecific versus heterospecific males. We took advantage of a system in which females facultatively prefer to mate with heterospecifics when doing so is adaptive. We found that males preferentially aggregate with conspecific males when hybridization is disfavoured for females (so that females prefer conspecifics); however, males show no such preference for aggregating with conspecifics when hybridization is favoured (and females are more likely to prefer heterospecifics). We did not find this pattern in a different spadefoot species where females do not adaptively hybridize; males preferentially aggregated with conspecifics in one environment and did not alter their behaviour when the environmental cue was changed. Our results therefore suggest that males track the same environmental cues that females use during mate choice. These findings highlight the potential for males to facultatively adjust their behaviour in response to competitors, as well as the role that male-male interactions might play in the likelihood and consequences of hybridization between species.

AB Vision and olfaction are expensive to maintain, and in many taxa there appears to be a trade-off in investment between the two sensory systems. Previous work has suggested that guppies, Poecilia reticulata, and zebrafish, Danio rerio, may differ in the relative importance they place on these two senses in social interactions. In this study, we directly examined this issue by experimentally contrasting olfactory and visual information in social situations. In the first experiment, we found that guppies spent more time where conspecifics were visible than where they could smell them. In contrast, zebrafish spent significantly more time in an empty compartment containing the smell of conspecifics than in a compartment in which they only saw them. The difference was not large, suggesting that both species integrate various types of information to locate a nearby shoal. In two subsequent experiments, we studied the role of vision and smell in the discrimination of the quality of the social group, namely the number and the familiarity of its members. Zebrafish and guppies were confirmed to rely on different senses, olfaction and vision, respectively, to estimate the size of a social group, whereas they did not differ in the discrimination of familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics which appears to be based equally on the two senses. Similarly to what happens in other vertebrate clades, we suggest that, among teleosts, there are large differences in the relative importance of the different senses in the perception of the external world.

AB The ability to discriminate between conspecifics functions in mate choice, kin-selected cooperation and territory defence. In mammals, olfaction plays a key role in such social interactions. Olfactory cues may be particularly important for subterranean mammals, for which visual and acoustic cues are less effective. Damaraland mole-rats live in groups comprising a breeding pair and their nonbreeding offspring. They are xenophobic, obligate outbreeders and independent dispersal represents the usual route to reproduction for both sexes. As yet, little is known about how dispersing individuals locate mates. Using a series of behavioural experiments, we reveal that mole-rats can discriminate between unfamiliar breeding groups and solitary, nonbreeders of the opposite sex by using odour cues. Our experiments showed that subjects spent more time investigating sand taken from other mole-rat groups than control sand, indicating an ability to recognize substrate-borne conspecific odours. Mole-rats also spent more time digging and sweeping in sand taken from the tunnels of unfamiliar, solitary animals of the opposite sex than sand taken from unfamiliar breeding groups and removed a higher volume of this sand during the experiments. Together, these results suggest an olfactory preference in both sexes for solitary, opposite-sex animals over breeding groups. Our results are supported by observations from the field that immigration into breeding groups is rare, with dispersing females typically establishing new groups, where they are subsequently joined by unfamiliar males. This study supports olfaction as a potential recognition cue which may facilitate adaptive dispersal. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reproductive success can improve with experience, which increases with age in many long-lived species. Signals that provide reliable information about age are therefore of importance for mate choice and consequently are under sexual selection. In birds, these are often vocal signals as well as visual signals in the form of plumage coloration. King penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, are sexually monomorphically ornamented seabirds that perform a complex visual and acoustic courtship display. Coloured beak spots and ear patches contain information about the condition and physiological status of adult males and females, but their role as a signal of age has previously only been studied in young birds. Vocalizations have mainly been studied as signals of individuality and not in the context of courtship. We investigated two multicomponent signals in the context of mate choice by analysing beak spot, ear patch and call parameters of wild king penguins. We explored the relation between these signals and age as well as age classes (chicks, juveniles, adults). Ornament parameters were weakly correlated with in males, but not in females, while acoustic parameters were highly correlated with age in both sexes. The calls' fundamental frequency and energy parameters and all the beak spot parameters reliably classified individuals into their age class. Since age class was redundantly encoded in both acoustic and colour parameters, we hypothesize that calls and ornaments function as back-up signals that increase the chance of accurately conveying the age class of the sender to receivers. King penguins might sequentially analyse age class signals during courtship, where acoustic signals serve as long-range communication when sender and receiver are out of sight, and ornamentation signals become important at close range. We show the importance of considering bimodal, multicomponent signals when studying complex behaviour and discuss how signalling environment, the species' life history and mating system influence the evolution of communication signals.

AB Sensory and behavioural lateralization is thought to increase neural efficiency and facilitate coordinated behaviour across much of the animal kingdom. Complementary laterality, when tasks are lateralized to opposite sides, can increase the efficiency of multitasking, but predictable behaviour may increase predation risk. Laterality is, however, variable in its scale, existing at both the population and individual level. Population level lateralization is thought to facilitate coordination of social behaviours whereas individual level biases may promote behavioural efficiency. We studied behavioural lateralization in sympatric wild populations of two terrestrial frog species: the Ecuador poison frog, Ameerega bilinguis, and its Batesian mimic the sanguine poison frog, Allobates zaparo. We used a multivariate approach to study lateralization across four different behaviours: two social behaviours (interactions with conspecifics and heterospecifics) and two nonsocial behaviours (interactions with prey and a simulated predator). We investigated three questions: (1) at what scale is behaviour lateralized, (2) are behaviours lateralized in a complementary manner, and (3) are social and nonsocial behaviours lateralized at different scales? We found no evidence of population level lateralization nor complementary laterality, and limited evidence for individual level lateralization in Al. zaparo but not Am. bilinguis. We found only weak evidence for differences in lateralization between social and nonsocial behaviour and only in Al. zaparo, although counter to our prediction, social behaviour was not lateralized but nonsocial behaviour was weakly lateralized at the individual level. However, we did detect robust, species- and task-specific within-individual correlations. Specifically, Am. bilinguis showed shared side use in individuals for certain tasks between consecutive trials, while Al. zaparo showed alternating side use in individuals for certain tasks between consecutive trials. Our results suggest that lateralization may be more variable than previously thought and manifest in an episodic fashion under certain conditions.

AB For oviparous animals such as amphibians, the presence or absence of conspecifics can influence site selection, with each life history stage potentially influencing the decision-making process in a different manner. In the present study, we tested the effect of conspecific life history stage on oviposition site selection in the sandpaper frog, Lechriodus fletcheri. We quantified preferences for spawning in pools that were unused by conspecifics, as well as pools with conspecific spawn or tadpoles present, or both. The study included two ecological contexts: a system of naturally occurring breeding pools and a field experiment with 40 artificial pools that controlled for habitat variation. Mothers preferred to oviposit in pools that already contained conspecific spawn, despite the likelihood of intense resource competition upon offspring hatching. This could be due to the potential benefits obtained by providing offspring access to a significant nutrient supply upon hatching via cannibalism of conspecific tadpoles and might be an important adaptation for completing tadpole development in highly ephemeral and resourcelimited pools prior to desiccation. In contrast, mothers avoided ovipositing in pools with conspecific tadpoles, a probable adaptation to avoid their own offspring from becoming victims of cannibalism themselves prior to hatching. Such nuances in the effect of conspecific presence on offspring survival highlight the often complex decision-making process that amphibians need to make when selecting oviposition sites, as well as the influence cannibalism can have on the evolution of reproductive behaviour.

AB Social animals invest time and resources into adapting their social environment, which emerges not only from their own but also from the decisions of other group members. Thus, individuals have to monitor interactions between others and potentially decide when and how to interfere to prevent damage to their own investment. These interventions can be subtle, as in the case of affiliative interactions such as grooming, but they can inform us about how animals structure their world and influence other group members. Here, we used interventions into grooming bouts in female rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, to determine who intervened in which grooming bouts, and what determined intervention outcomes, based on kinship, dominance rank and affiliative relationships between groomers and (potential) interveners. We show that high dominance rank of groomers reduced the risk of intervention. Bystanders, particularly when high ranking, intervened in grooming of their kin, close affiliates and close-ranked competitors. Interveners gained access to their close affiliates for subsequent grooming. Reduced aggression risk facilitated grooming involving three individuals, which was more common when a strong affiliative relationship existed and when interveners were lower in rank than the groomers. Thus, interventions in this species involved the monitoring of grooming interactions, decision making based on several individual and dyadic characteristics, and potentially allowed individuals to broaden their access to grooming partners, protect their own relationships and influence their social niche.

AB The lateral line system of fishes is composed of neuromast mechanoreceptors that detect movement through vibration and changes in pressure gradients in the water. Although mechanosensory information has been shown to be important in the contexts of predator escape and foraging, little is known about the role of the lateral line system during intraspecific interactions, such as reproduction. However, many species of fish demonstrate complex courtship and aggressive repertoires that involve movement of the body and fins, resulting in local displacement of the surrounding water. This displacement has the potential to function as a signal that contains information about the sender. In this study, we conducted two behavioural experiments using fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, to test the hypothesis that the outcomes of male-male contests and male-female courtship interactions are influenced by hydrodynamic flows generated during conspecific interactions. In the first experiment, we pitted control males against those with an ablated lateral line system and assessed both overall aggression and the likelihood of territory acquisition. In the second experiment, we conducted dual-choice female mate choice experiments to determine whether control females and those without access to mechanosensory information (ablated females) differed in patterns of discrimination and the use of courtship as a criterion of choice. In experiment 1, control males won a significantly greater proportion of territorial contests than expected by chance and were more likely to use noncontact threat displays during aggressive interactions compared with ablated males. In experiment 2, females with access to the mechanosensory information channel showed enhanced mate discrimination compared to ablated females. These data are among the first to show that mechanosensory signals are an important criterion of territorial and reproductive success in fishes and are likely important contributors to multimodal communication in this group.

AB Collective decision making is essential for multicellular and self-organized society coordination, but how this occurs when most of the individuals have limited knowledge of the external environment remains elusive. Using empirical data to inform a neuroscience-based firing-rate model, we found that integration of negative feedback and network dynamics in a honeybee, Apis mellifera, hive demonstrates strong similarities to the neuronal interactions of the human brain, where very brief perturbations of feedback in the system result in more rapid and accurate decisions. We show that honey bees used an inhibitory 'stop' signal towards dancing honey bees that reduced both waggle dancing and waggle dance pheromone production. Stop signals were probably elicited by individuals with no individual knowledge of food quality change in the external environment. Therefore, we demonstrate that collective behaviour across different biological levels of organization exhibits a dynamic complex system that is self-organized, but is governed by simple feedback mechanisms, facilitating efficient group decision making by optimally aggregating individuals that have relatively limited cognitive capabilities within a society or cell in a multicellular organism. We discuss how despite being on two different levels of biological organization, both neurons in the brain and honeybee individuals, within the hive, can operate collectively, which is probably a result of convergent evolution.

AB Helping behaviour in some cooperative breeders is apparently maintained by a combination of coercion and reciprocity. In such pay-to-stay systems, alloparental brood care of subordinate group members functions as a service to dominants, which tolerate subordinates based on how much help they provide. Cooperative territory defence is a key task of cooperative breeders, but it is unknown how territory defence by subordinates is socially regulated. Diverse costs and benefits associated with defending the territory against different threats suggest that these defence behaviours may be maintained through divergent selection regimes, and they might be regulated through different social processes. In the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher, unrelated subordinates help defend the territory against egg predators even if they do not participate in reproduction and therefore do not suffer direct or indirect fitness costs through predators of eggs. This behaviour has therefore been interpreted as altruistic service to dominants. Subordinates also defend the group territory against predators of juveniles and adults, which might at least partly reflect their own direct fitness interests and could be maintained through mutualistic interactions among group members. Here, we directly compared the regulation of these two types of defence behaviours and tested whether they are enforced by breeders. We prevented subordinates from defending the territory against egg predators or predators of adults and observed whether they received more aggression in response to this treatment. We found that subordinates received more aggression from breeders after withholding defence against egg predators, but not after withholding defence against fish predators. This suggests that territory defence against egg predators by helpers is enforced by breeders and hence subject to negotiations and trading, whereas defence against fish predators is probably based on mutualistic fitness benefits.

AB Understanding the determinants of fighting ability (or resource-holding potential, RHP) is key to elucidating the evolution of aggressive behaviour, as current tests of contest theory rely on realistic proxies for overall RHP. Traditionally, RHP is considered equivalent to body size but it is increasingly clear that a wider range of morphological and physiological traits contribute to fighting ability. In situations analogous to contests, such as courtship displays in animals and competitive sport in humans, the role of skill has long been appreciated but this component has been neglected in analyses of animal fights. Here, we investigated two spatial components of skill, accuracy and precision, during shell fights in hermit crabs, where an attacker repeatedly strikes (raps) its shell against that of a defender. By analysing the points of impact of these strikes, we found that attackers that rapped with coarse-scale accuracy were more likely to win the fight, indicating that the ability to target a 'sweet spot' on the defender's shell is an important determinant of contest success. Furthermore, we found that this element of skill correlated with temporal performance (vigour). Taken together these results show that spatial skill is an RHP component. Moreover, in contrast to the traditional assumption that fighting ability is equivalent to body size, RHP is actually underpinned by a suite of interlinked traits including performance capacities, morphology and skill.

AB Animals may face trade-offs when several simultaneous functions or processes compete for limiting resources. In that context, allocation of resources to the most fitness-enhancing competing function can be prioritized. Immune response and locomotor performance are relevant fitness components, mainly due to their important roles as defence against pathogens and predators, respectively. However, both promote oxidative stress and consume energy and metabolites. Consistently, trade-offs between immune response and locomotion have been reported in some taxa. In this work, we examine whether an immune challenge hinders short-distance swimming speed of adult Iberian ribbed newts, Pleurodeles waltl. To that end, we inoculated Escherichia coli cell wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an innocuous antigen that triggers an immune response, in the sole pads of experimental newts, and phosphate buffer saline, with no physiological effect, in those of control newts. We estimated immune response as sole pad swelling and calculated swimming speed from videos of newts swimming towards a refuge nearby, 24 h and 7 days after inoculation. Sole pad swelling was greater in LPS-inoculated newts, but short-distance swimming speed was not affected by the immune challenge. These results could indicate priority allocation of resources to locomotion, which might be a consequence of compensatory mechanisms capable of avoiding locomotion impairment due to immune challenge. In any case, these findings could highlight the importance of short-distance escape as an antipredator strategy. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social information percolates through a variety of channels to influence animal decision making, with a notable effect on reproductive and feeding success. Colonial central place foragers can reduce time to locate ephemeral food patches and/or increase foraging rate by following their informed peers, parasitizing direction of returning successful foragers, or being intentionally informed on distant food locations at the colony (e.g. the waggle dance of the honey bee). Ceremonial behaviours may also deliver social foraging information between mates, which can spread inadvertently to neighbours. Here we tested for information display in Cape gannets, Morus capensis, a socially monogamous species, during the elaborate dance ceremony performed each time a partner returns to the nest during the breeding season. We tracked fine-scale foraging behaviour of gannets using bird-borne GPS recorders, and video-recorded their subsequent dance ceremony, which involved up to 14 different displays. As we hypothesized, dance characteristics were associated with foraging trip features. Notably, overall dance duration was negatively linked to foraging trip duration, which was highly positively correlated with foraging range, foraging path length and time spent foraging during the trip. Overall dance duration was also negatively linked with distance to the main foraging grounds. Additionally, the duration of preening behaviour was related to the bearing of the main feeding spot. The latter relationship was supported by a Bayesian model averaging analysis, allowing inferences robust to multiple comparisons. Overall, ceremonial behaviour may provide social foraging information on feeding locations, while evidence for further information transfer to the mate or neighbours was not tested here. Frequent updating on prey spatial distribution, inadvertently communicated or not, should be particularly valuable for predators tracking ephemeral prey patches, providing an additional advantage to colonial living. Our results may have strong implications for cultural evolution in animal societies. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ETHOLOGY
AB Niko Tinbergen characterized ethology as 'the biological study of behaviour' involving four kinds of question: causation, ontogeny, adaptive function and phyletic evolution (Tinbergen, 1963; Zeitschrift fur Tierpsychologie, 20, 410-433). He said the science should give equal attention to each and to their integration. This division was prefigured in his book The study of instinct (Tinbergen, 1951; Oxford University Press). The book offered a conception of instinct as a built-in motivational system analogous to a hydraulic mechanism. The assumption of innateness and the lack of physiological credibility of the instinct model met with adverse criticism, which Tinbergen conceded to a large extent. His later work concentrated on functional issues, which anticipated the direction dominating subsequent ethological studies. Nevertheless Tinbergen's four questions, and his insistence that they be given equal attention continue to present an agenda for ethological aspiration.

AB Breeding success should increase with prior knowledge of the surrounding environment, which is dependent upon an animal's ability to evaluate habitat. Prospecting for nesting locations and migratory stopover sites are well-established behaviours among bird species. We assessed whether three species of California dabbling ducks - mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, gadwall, Mareca strepera, and cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera - in Suisun Marsh, California, U.S.A., a brackish marsh, prospect for suitable wetlands in the week prior to brooding. K-means cluster analyses grouped 29 mallard and gadwall hens into three groups. One group (N = 13) demonstrated evidence of brood site prospecting, with the fewest and latest prebrooding wetland visits. Of these hens, seven visited their future brood pond an average of 1.14 times and only shortly before brooding (1.29 days), obtaining current information on habitat suitability. For the remaining six hens, we did not detect a brooding wetland visit, possibly due to data limitations or because these hens acquired sufficient familiarity with the wetland habitat during nest breaks in adjacent wetlands, obviating the need to prospect the specific brood pond. The second identified group of hens (N = 11) visited the brooding wetland most frequently (on 4.55 days), further in advance (5.27 days), with the fewest unique wetland visits and the earliest brooding date (26 May). The final group of hens (N = 5) were the latest to brood (21 June) and visited the most wetlands, possibly due to less water or more broods present across the landscape. Brood ponds were always farther from the nest than the nearest ponds, indicating that habitat suitability or presence of conspecifics is more important to brood site selection. Prospecting provides hens with knowledge about current habitat conditions and allows them to 'crowdsource' public information regarding use of that habitat by other brooding hens. Prospecting may, therefore, benefit ducks inhabiting ephemeral habitats like those within Suisun Marsh, where brood habitat is limited and water cover changes rapidly during the breeding season.

AB Carrion is a patchy, nutrient-rich and frequently bulky resource that hosts a complex community of competing organisms. Several insect species have specialized to use carrion for breeding, revealing a specific suite of behavioural adaptations. Larvae of carrion insects regularly aggregate while feeding, frequently forming spectacular larval masses. Here we analysed patterns and mechanisms of collective feeding by larvae of the communally breeding carrion beetle Necrodes littoralis. Using results of laboratory behavioural assays and findings from previous field experiments using pig carcasses we found that: (1) under field conditions N. littoralis larval aggregations were prevalent on large carcasses, during late decomposition stages; (2) under laboratory conditions larvae of all instars, when present on meat, formed stable aggregations; (3) larvae consistently responded to thermal characteristics of a feeding environment, aggregating in the hottest place and following changes in the heat source location, which suggests thermal cues are important for their aggregation; and (4) ground-deposited chemical cues elicited a minor response by the third-instar larvae, which indicates these cues are less important for the aggregation of larval N. littoralis. These findings highlight the prevalence of communal feeding among necrophagous insect larvae, revealing the interspecific and intraspecific diversity of patterns and mechanisms for larval aggregation on carrion.

AB Males frequently compete for access to mates, sometimes at a cost to parental behaviour and self-maintenance. Theory predicts that aggressive competition among females should be less common and intense due to a trade-off between competition and future reproductive investment. However, the consequences of female aggression across the reproductive cycle are unknown in many species. In this study, we addressed four questions about female intrasexual aggression in the house wren. (1) Does intrasexual aggression help females during periods of increased competition over breeding resources? (2) Do aggressive females have higher-quality mates? (3) Do aggressive females invest less in reproduction? (4) Does female aggression affect offspring size and survival? We experimentally increased competition over nestboxes in one year by evicting a subset of birds. Females that were more aggressive during previous simulated female intrusions protected more eggs from house wren ovicide, which increased following our manipulation. In two other years, we monitored the mating patterns and reproductive performance of females. Aggressive females had mates that provided more direct benefits in the form of nestling provisioning. They did not invest less in reproduction and, in fact, provisioned their nestlings more frequently. As a result, aggressive females had heavier offspring at multiple points during development. The offspring of more aggressive females were also more likely to fledge. Overall, female aggression appeared to have fitness benefits directly following an experimental increase in competition and throughout the reproductive cycle in nonexperimental years.

AB Historically, the differences in dispersal behaviour between individuals within a species has largely been ignored. Instead, we tend to assume all individuals within a population express similar phenotypes. However, evidence is growing for the importance of intraspecific variability in dispersal propensity and how this variability may influence population dynamics, as well as the role of environmental context in driving this behaviour. Individuals that are more likely to disperse can have other traits, such as being bolder or more aggressive, that collectively form behavioural syndromes. We tested for a behavioural syndrome in carp gudgeons (Hypseleotris spp.) species' complex, a type of small fish found in intermittent streams in southeastern Australia. Intermittent streams are an environment where selection may favour the evolution of different dispersal phenotypes, given the variable and unpredictable nature of flows. During dry periods, fish become isolated in refuge pools that vary in quality and persistence, and then can disperse when flow resumes. Dispersal can have costs (e.g. the risk of not finding another habitat) but also benefits (e.g. opportunity to find better habitat), meaning that different strategies (i.e. dispersing versus staying) may both be advantageous and thus evolve. Through a series of experiments that assessed these fish's latency to emergence into a novel environment and tendency to shoal, as well as movement behaviour in artificial streams, we found that (1) flow is not likely to be a movement cue, and (2) boldness, sociability and dispersal distance were repeatable, consistent with the notion that carp gudgeons exhibit personalities. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a behavioural syndrome in a freshwater fish that inhabits intermittent streams. This finding contributes to our understanding of how carp gudgeons move through intermittent streams and the potential dynamics that allow these fish to persist in such harsh, hydrologically variable habitats.

AB Early life stress can lead to long-term behavioural and physiological phenotypic alterations that impact fitness. Understanding effects of environmental stressors on wildlife is important to predict individual and population-level responses to stressors associated with climate change. Lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, are a regionally threatened fish species that experience high predation rates during larval stages. To investigate effects of a high temperature stressor, we exposed lake sturgeon eggs from four families to 10 degrees C (low-stress) or 18 degrees C (high-stress) rearing temperatures. At egg, free embryo and larval stages, we quantified stress levels for individuals from each treatment using whole-body cortisol analysis at baseline and after an acute stressor. At the larval stage, we video-recorded behaviour trials to quantify swimming activity, and we conducted predation trials to quantify survival outcomes for individuals from high-stress and low-stress temperature treatments. Free embryos reared at 18 degrees C had a significantly smaller cortisol response after exposure to an acute stressor, indicating that chronic high temperature stress may reduce stress reactivity in lake sturgeon. In addition, larvae reared at 18 degrees C had significantly higher activity levels during behaviour trials and significantly higher survival rates when exposed to crayfish predation, indicating that behavioural alterations induced by early life stress may be adaptive in high-stress contexts such as predation. These findings illustrate the need to experimentally evaluate fitness effects of stressors within ecologically relevant contexts in order to predict population- and community-level outcomes of climate change.

AB Social organization is characterized by its stability. Researchers consistently observe distinct social relationships (e.g. mated pairs, friendships and rivalries) and higher-order social network structures (e.g. subgroups, transitivity and dominance hierarchies) across time and space. Nevertheless, group change is also ubiquitous, and the social composition of groups fluctuates over time and across generations. Despite this, little is known about the processes underlying the stability of social organization, especially across generations. This paper proposes that understanding the development of social relationships, or socialization, provides key insights into the stability and flexibility of group social organization. I propose that stable patterns of social organization can be conceptualized as a feedback system, where the social organization of groups renews itself by guiding the socialization of resilient species-normative relationships in juveniles. I outline a general framework of socialization that includes exploring, pruning and consolidating early social connections to form stable relationships. During this socialization process, outside influences from the group guide how juveniles explore their social environment, which social connections are reinforced and which behavioural skills are used to consolidate connections. When the social relationships that define the group's organization directly or indirectly guide the socialization of juveniles to recreate those relationships, the result is stable patterns of social organization. This developmental perspective provides mechanistic insights into how social organization persists in an uncertain world and highlights how developmental processes may be a crucial, and overlooked, factor in shaping the stability and flexibility of social organization.

AB Gunnison's prairie dogs, Cynomys gunnisoni, frequently utter a repetitive series (a 'bout') of alarm calls (called 'barks') in response to a variety of terrestrial predators. Previous work has suggested that the structure of barks is finely tuned in ways that provide highly specific information about the identity of the predator. We re-evaluated these findings by presenting individually marked adult females with taxidermy mounts of three terrestrial predators of prairie dogs: a coyote, Canis latrans, a bobcat, Lynx rufus, and an American badger, Taxidea taxus, as well as one control stimulus (a cardboard box). Significant variation among individuals was evident from analyses of 10 measures associated with the general pattern of barking (e.g. latency to begin barking, bout duration, average number of barks/bout, overall bark rate, interbout interval) and also from eight structural features of individual barks (e.g. frequency and duration measures of the fundamental frequency band). When controlling for the identity of alarm callers, we found little evidence for differences in these same variables in response to different stimuli. We conclude that, like several other species of ground-dwelling squirrels, Gunnison's prairie dogs have an individually distinctive alarm call that does not differ for different predators. Our results conflict with earlier claims of extreme specificity in the alarm calls of Gunnison's prairie dogs. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Animal interactions such as competition are mediated by complex social strategies, which consist of behaviours and cognitive mechanisms that guide their production. As a result, behaviour is highly flexible. This poses a challenge to understanding how competition plays out in natural systems, because the course of a contest can essentially be rewritten by prior experience and/or changes in social context. Here we addressed this gap by studying how both of these factors interact to reconfigure competitive strategies used in territorial defence by a wild bird. After experimentally inducing the winner effect, a cognitive-behavioural phenomenon in which winning a contest increases the probability of winning again in the future, we found that male red-bellied woodpeckers, Melanerpes carolinus, adopted a new social strategy marked by more flexible transitions between different aggressive displays, as well as increasing overall aggressive output. However, this effect was mitigated by the arrival of the female social mate; in response to this momentary shift in social context, males decreased their use of territorial drum displays and became less likely to move around the territory or switch display modes during competition. In other words, the winner effect increased spatiotemporal diversity of territorial strategies, such that males frequently changed their location and display output. A female's arrival, however, reversed this effect. More specifically, males tended to revert to advertisement and social vocalizations on female arrival, which suggests that the need to attend to the social mate may supersede the threat of territorial intrusion. This is consistent with a model in which competitive outcomes are impacted by the interactive effects of an individual's past experiences and shifts in present-day social context, which may allow monogamous animals to effectively manage the competing demands of driving off intruders and attending to the social mate.

AB Frequently, individuals of one species respond to alarm calls produced by another species. This form of interspecies communication can be critical for survival. How animals recognize and respond to heterospecific alarm calls is, however, still poorly understood. This is especially true for bats, which are highly vocal and possess a specialized auditory system. We hypothesized that, among bat species, acoustic similarity between heterospecific and conspecific alarm calls is a key factor that underlies call recognition. However, this ability could also be acquired via associative learning from prior exposure or result from phylogenetic relatedness among caller and receiver species, as shown by others. Here we focused on distress calls of bats as representing a certain type of alarm call. To test our hypothesis, we recorded distress calls of 11 bat species from four families at five different sites. We broadcast the recorded calls to three of these species (Rhino lophus sinicus, Myotis badius and Myotis laniger). For all three species, neither prior exposure (familiarity) nor phylogenetic relatedness explained the variation in the response strength, as measured by echolocation vocalizations of receiver species in response to playback of heterospecific distress calls. In contrast, acoustic similarity, especially in peak frequency, between conspecific and heterospecific distress calls, was positively correlated with response strength in the receiver species. Thus, our findings emphasize that, at least among bats, acoustic similarity is a key factor allowing recognition of heterospecific alarm calls. It remains unclear whether evolutionary, genetic and/or neurophysiological mechanisms entrain an individual to respond selectively to a specific acoustic feature.

AB Most hosts of the parasitic brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater, demonstrate an astonishing lack of defences against parasitism, typically explained by evolutionary lag. We investigated antiparasite strategies of the dickcissel, Spiza americana, whose apparent acceptance of parasitism is unlikely to be explained by lag because its historic centre of abundance overlaps with that of the cowbird. Cowbirds parasitized almost half of dickcissel nests (343 of 767 nests), and dickcissels suffered significant costs when attempting to eject cowbird eggs. Our predicted responses indicated that acceptance of parasitism would lead to the loss of 0 hosts eggs, attempted ejections would lead to the loss of 1.2 host eggs and successful ejection of cowbird eggs would lead to the loss of 1.6 host eggs. There was no significant cost of raising a single cowbird nestling, but parasitized nests had 1.1 fewer host eggs due to removal by female cowbirds or when the thick-shelled cowbirds eggs struck the host eggs during laying. After accounting for damaged eggs that still hatched, acceptance of parasitism yielded a loss of 1.1 eggs/nestlings, those that attempted to eject the cowbird egg lost 1.8 eggs/nestlings and those that ejected the cowbird egg lost 2.0 eggs/nestlings. The prohibitive costs of egg ejection combined with the relatively low costs of raising a cowbird nestling may explain why most dickcissels (64%) accepted parasitism or stopped trying to eject cowbird eggs. However, some birds persisted in their ejection attempts, so there are likely additional carryover fitness effects on hosts of raising and sharing nests with cowbirds. Because of the difficulty in ejecting cowbird eggs, dickcissels would benefit from a strategy that emphasizes frontline defences to prevent parasitism from occurring in the first place.

AB The survival of an animal society depends on how individual interactions influence group coordination. Interactions within a group determine coordinated responses to environmental changes. Individuals that are especially influential affect the behavioural responses of other group members. This is exemplified by honey bee worker responses to increasing ambient temperatures by fanning their wings to circulate air through the hive. Groups of workers are more likely to fan than isolated workers, suggesting a coordinated group response. But are some individuals more influential than others in this response? This study tests the hypothesis that an individual influences other group members to perform thermoregulatory fanning behaviour in the western honey bee, Apis mellifera L. We show that groups of young nurse bees placed with fanners are more likely to initiate fanning compared to groups of nurses without fanners. Furthermore, we find that groups with young nurse bees have lower response thresholds than groups of just fanners. Our results suggest that individuals have the capability to influence other individuals to follow their fanning response as temperatures increase, and these social dynamics balance probability of fanning with thermal response thresholds. An influential individual may ultimately affect the ability for a society to efficiently respond to environmental fluctuations. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behaviour is an important way for animals to rapidly respond to changes in their current environment; however, over extended periods animals can also respond to environmental change via slower, developmental plasticity in other traits. This developmental plasticity could itself alter the animal's behaviour in two ways: it could change the state of the aspect of the animal's current environment that induces the behaviour (the cue), or it could change the physiology underlying production of that behaviour (the behavioural reaction norm). We tested these alternatives for two responses to temperature, colour plasticity and refuge-seeking behaviour, in pipevine swallowtail, Battus philenor, caterpillars. Prior research found that black caterpillars seek thermal refuges at lower ambient temperatures than red caterpillars in the field. Here, we found that the effect of colour on behaviour in the laboratory depended on how we heated the caterpillars. When warmed by radiant heat, black caterpillars sought refuge sooner than red caterpillars, as occurs in nature. In contrast, when warmed by conduction of heat, black caterpillars no longer sought refuges sooner than red caterpillars. Both colour morphs began seeking refuges at the same body temperature in both experiments, and the sensitivity of their metabolic rate to temperature was also the same. Taken together, our findings indicate that while colour does change the cue for refuge seeking, it does not change the behaviour's reaction norm. Similar cue-mediated interactions may often occur for thermoregulatory behaviour in other species. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Behavioural flexibility has been argued to be an evolutionarily favourable trait that helps invasive species to establish themselves in non-native environments. Few studies, however, have compared the level of flexibility (whether considered as an outcome or as a process) in mammalian invaders and related native species. Here, we tested whether flexibility differs between groups of free-ranging invasive eastern grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, and native Eurasian red squirrels, Sciurus vulgaris, in the U.K., using an easy and a difficult food extraction task. All individuals of both species showed flexibility, at the outcome level, in solving the easy task and solution time was comparable between species across a series of successes. A higher proportion of grey squirrels than red squirrels solved the difficult task. However, for those squirrels that did solve the task, solving efficiency was comparable between species on their first success, and a few red squirrels outperformed the grey squirrels in subsequent successes. Between-species analysis showed that instantaneous flexibility, flexibility at the process level that was measured as the rate of switching between tactics after a failed attempt, was higher in red squirrels than in grey squirrels. Within-species analysis also revealed that red squirrel problem solvers showed higher flexibility at the process level than their nonsolver counterparts. Nonsolvers also failed to make 'productive' switches (switching from ineffective to effective tactics). Together, the results suggest that problem-solving ability overlaps in the two species, but is less variable, and on average higher, in grey squirrels than in red squirrels. The superior behavioural flexibility of the grey squirrels, shown here by success at problem solving, may have facilitated their invasion success, but it may also have resulted from selective pressures during the invasion process.

AB Understanding both inter-and intraspecific variation in animals' cognitive abilities is one of the central goals of cognitive ecology. We developed a field system for testing spatial learning in wild chickadees using radio frequency identification (RFID)-enabled feeders that allowed us to track individuals across multiple years. Mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, inhabit a continuous montane gradient, and individuals inhabiting higher elevations experience harsher winters than those at lower elevations. Previous studies found that chickadees at higher elevations cached more food and demonstrated better spatial memory, but they performed worse during reversal learning than chickadees at lower elevations. Here, we employed spatial learning, reversal learning and memory retention tasks to compare elevation-related performance of first-year juvenile birds with that of adults that had survived at least 1 year. Chickadees from high elevation performed better in the initial learning task but worse in the reversal task than birds from low elevation. There were no differences between first-year birds and adults in the initial learning task, but adults performed significantly better in the reversal test. First-year birds also made more errors associated with the initial target, which suggests higher levels of proactive interference. There were no significant differences between elevations or between juvenile and adults in memory performance after a 16-day retention. After retention, chickadees did not discriminate between the feeders that provided food during the initial task or during the reversal task prior to retention. These results are also consistent with the effects of proactive interference, as birds should have only visited the most recently rewarding feeder. Our findings suggest that the ability to quickly learn changing information is critical for chickadees at both elevations as surviving adults did better in the reversal task than first-year birds. Our results also suggest that selection may favour better reversal learning abilities associated with lower levels of proactive interference.

AB In cooperatively breeding species, encounters with intruders may serve multiple functions, ranging from reaffirming group territory ranges to facilitating assessments for additional breeding opportunities. While these distinctive events offer the opportunity to investigate the delicate balance of these social dimensions within animal societies, their unpredictable occurrence makes witnessing and controlling these events in the wild particularly challenging. Here we used a field playback approach to simulate conspecific territorial incursions in cooperatively breeding common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, to distinguish between the three following nonmutually exclusive functions of intergroup encounters in this species of New World primate: territorial defence, mate defence and assessment of breeding opportunities. For these experiments, we systematically broadcast species-typical long-distance contact calls ('phees') commonly used in intergroup interactions from the core and periphery of three groups' territories using either male or female vocalizations. Consistent with a territorial defence hypothesis, a group's reaction was independent of the simulated intruder's sex and the response strength was greater when the playback stimulus was broadcast from the core area of a group's territory relative to the periphery. However, sex differences in some facets of the marmosets' responses suggest that this is not the only potential function for these encounters. Mated males and females started to move first in response to simulated intruders of the opposite sex, suggesting that these events offered opportunities to assess extrapair breeding opportunities. However, mated females also showed piloerection towards simulated female intruders, which is suggestive of mate guarding. These data provide unique experimental evidence for the theory that excursions by conspecific intruders may serve multiple functions in a cooperatively breeding vertebrate and are reflective of the known complexities of common marmoset sociobiology.

AB Ferrets, Mustela putorius furo, are increasingly used in infectious disease studies, particularly in influenza research. Which specific housing conditions and environmental enrichments are of particular importance for ferrets have not been part of a systematic evaluation. The motivation ferrets showed to reach different enrichments was assessed in multiple consumer demand study set-ups. To address the question whether these consumer demand set-ups give similar results, we assessed the effects of two ways of offering enrichments concurrently instead of consecutively. Six ovariectomized female ferrets were successively tested in a seven-chamber (7Ch), three-chamber (3Ch) and three-chamber 'all-butone' (ABO) set-up. We compared the maximum price paid, visit number, visit duration and interaction time with the enrichments in the 3Ch versus the 7Ch and ABO set-ups, respectively. Compared to the 3Ch set-up, the ferrets in the ABO and 7Ch set-up showed a lower motivation to access, paid fewer and shorter visits to and interacted less with the enrichments. In the 7Ch, the ferrets especially showed a lower motivation for the less preferred enrichments and the empty chamber. These findings indicate that testing all the enrichments concurrently in the 7Ch set-up forced the ferrets to make more economic decisions, thereby providing more valuable information on how different enrichments are valued relative to one other. Adding preferred enrichment items to the home chamber, as was done in the ABO set-up, might have reduced the motivation to access or look for additional enrichment items. However, this set-up might not have a closed economy, making the ABO set-up unsuitable. Based on these findings, we advise testing all the enrichment categories concurrently instead of consecutively and keeping the number of items in the home cage to a minimum when performing a consumer demand study, as this appears the most optimal set-up to determine motivational priorities for resources in ferrets.

AB Hatching asynchrony occurs primarily as a consequence of the timing of embryonic development. Despite over 50 years of study, it is unclear why, ultimately, most birds initiate embryonic development (incubation) before all eggs are laid. One hypothesis focuses on prehatching (embryo) survival and predicts that early incubation maximizes embryo survival by reducing exposure of unincubated eggs (egg viability hypothesis). Another set of hypotheses focuses on posthatching growth and survival and predicts that females time incubation to maximize the number or quality of hatched offspring that fledge (adaptive hatching pattern hypotheses). I experimentally manipulated when females could begin incubation to test how timing of embryonic development influences prehatching survival and posthatching growth and survival in the house sparrow, Passer domesticus. Despite high embryo survival in both naturally asynchronous and experimentally synchronized nests, early incubation appeared to maximize embryo survival in all but the earliest-laid eggs, suggesting that house sparrows begin incubation too late to maximize survival of all embryos. Early incubation had little effect on overall (i.e. mean) patterns of posthatching growth and survival. However, early incubation increased the initial variation in offspring size because last-hatched young were relatively small when all eggs had completed hatching. Nestlings that were small at hatch completion grew slowly and exhibited a reduced probability of survival, suggesting that house sparrows begin incubation too early to maximize growth and survival of hatched offspring. These results suggest that timing of incubation neither maximizes embryo survival nor maximizes posthatching growth and survival. Instead, early incubation appears to be a trade-off between maintaining both embryo survival and growth and survival of late-hatched offspring. Thus, house sparrow females likely time incubation as an adaptive strategy to maximize the number of embryos that survive the incubation and nestling periods to fledge.

AB Indicator models of sexual selection predict that sexually selected trait elaboration should covary positively with condition. However, nutrition might influence the expression of multiple traits, where high-quality diets may result in positive trait correlations and low-quality diets in trade-offs. Although previous studies have examined how diet quantity or single nutrients, such as protein, carbohydrate and phosphorus, influence sexual traits, few have examined how dietary nutrient balance affects sexual trait expression. We therefore investigated how dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio and percentage of phosphorus influence the relationship between investment in mate attraction signalling and aggression. We fought groups of six adult male Gryllus veletis crickets, each consuming a unique diet, while recording their prefight and postfight signalling parameters. We found no evidence that diet influenced aggression or prefight signalling, with the exception that high-phosphorus diets had a negative influence on several signalling effort parameters. Body size was an important predictor of aggressive behaviour and most signalling parameters, suggesting that developmental diet may have a greater influence on these sexual traits. Several prefight signalling parameters were weakly related to aggression, suggesting that signalling may advertise competitive abilities. Males consuming high-carbohydrate and equal protein: carbohydrate diets experienced changes in signalling parameters that represented an overall increase in signalling effort following aggressive contests compared to males consuming high-protein diets, suggesting that dietary effects on signalling may only become apparent following periods of highly energetic activity. Changes in signalling following aggressive contests were also related to aggression levels modulated by dietary phosphorus content, such that only males consuming low-phosphorus diets were able to invest heavily in signalling after investing heavily in aggression. Our findings highlight the importance of research on the interplay between multiple sexually selected traits, and how dietary nutrient balance influences these relationships.

AB The vocalizations of nonhuman animals are considered potential indicators of motivational or internal state. In many species, different call types, and structural variation within call types, encode information about physical characteristics such as age or sex, or about variable traits such as motivation. Domestic chickens, Gallus gallus, have an elaborate vocal repertoire, enabling investigation into whether reward-related arousal is encoded within their call type and structure. Twelve hens were given a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm using sound cues to signal the availability of two food rewards (mealworms, normal food), one nonfood reward (a container of substrate suitable for dustbathing), and a sound-neutral event (sound cue, no reward). A muted-neutral treatment (no sound cue, no reward) provided a baseline for vocal behaviour. Sound cues preceded a 15 s anticipation period during which vocalizations were recorded. Hens produced a 'Food call' (previously defined in other studies) in anticipation of all rewards, including the nonfood reward. 'Food calls' and 'Fast clucks' were more prevalent in anticipation of rewards, and most prevalent following the cue signalling the dustbathing substrate, suggesting that this reward induced the most arousal in hens. The peak frequency of 'Food calls' made in anticipation of the dustbathing substrate was significantly lower than those made in anticipation of food rewards, potentially reflecting differences in arousal. Vocalizations that reliably indicate hens' motivational state could be used as measures of welfare in on-farm assessment situations. Our study is the first to reveal variation in the frequency-related parameters of the 'Food call' in different contexts, and to show the prevalence of different call types in reward and nonreward contexts, which may have implications for welfare assessments.

AB Most studies of aposematism focus on the effect of warning signals on vertebrate predators, especially birds. In our experiments, we used jumping spiders, Evarcha arcuata (Araneae: Salticidae) as predators, and larvae of three colour forms (red, white, yellow) of an unpalatable firebug, Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera: Pyrrhocoridae) as prey. The experiments were divided into four successive steps, focusing on different aspects of predatoreprey interaction. (1) When presented with a firebug for the first time, the spiders captured the white, least conspicuous colour form more often than the other two. No differences in the attack latencies were observed between the colour forms. (2) In the avoidance-learning test, the spiders were offered in succession five firebugs of one of the three colour forms. The attack and capture rate decreased in all colour forms, more notably in the red, most conspicuous form. (3) After five presentations of the same prey, the spiders were presented with a different firebug colour form. The results of the generalization process were asymmetric: spiders' attack rate increased when the red prey was followed by the yellow or white one, but decreased when the red form was presented after the other colour forms. (4) Spiders attacked the same prey more often the next day, but the attacks were seldom fatal. Similarly to the initial reaction, spiders captured the white firebugs more often. Our results show that for E. arcuata, the red coloration can represent an effective aposematic signal. Red prey coloration decreased the attack rate during the avoidance-learning process and favoured the prey in generalization between different colour forms. Yellow coloration was moderately effective against E. arcuata, whereas white coloration was the least effective because of low innate bias against this signal.

AB The use of prey-attracting allomones is likely to be an effective foraging strategy for sit-and-wait predators. Despite this, the production and efficacy of such allomones have rarely been documented. Previous investigations into the chemical composition of spider silk have revealed the presence of a number of potential allomone chemicals such as the amide putrescine, a foul-smelling organic compound. Putrescine is attractive to several terrestrial invertebrates, many of which are also typical prey species of spiders, but whether prey attraction is an underlying mechanism promoting its inclusion in web silk is currently untested. Here, we artificially increased the amount of putrescine in the web silk of female Argiope keyserlingi and assessed the resulting variation in prey interception of normal versus putrescine augmented webs under seminatural field conditions. We demonstrated that webs misted with a putrescine solution captured significantly more prey than webs misted with a control solution and also found differences in prey capture rates between individuals from different populations. This not only suggests that web-bound putrescine acts as a prey attracting allomone, but also that there is population level variation in the web-based foraging strategies of these spiders.

AB Long-term fidelity to foraging areas may have fitness benefits to individuals, particularly in unpredictable environments. However, such strategies may result in short-term energetic losses and delay responses to fast environmental changes. We used satellite tracking data and associated diving data to record the habitat use of nine individual southern elephant seals over 34 winter migrations. By assessing overlap in two-and three-dimensional home ranges we illustrate strong long-term (up to 7-year) fidelity to foraging habitat. Furthermore, a repeatability statistic and hierarchical clustering exercise provided evidence for individual specialization of foraging migration strategies. We discuss the possible influences of stable long-term foraging migration strategies on the adaptability of individual elephant seals to rapid environmental change. Our results further illustrate the need for more long-term longitudinal studies to quantify the influence of individual-level site familiarity, fidelity and specialization on population-level resource selection and population dynamics.

AB Many animals differ consistently in the way they behave across time and context. This animal personality has been linked to traits such as life history strategies or dispersal. However, few studies have addressed the relationship between consistent behavioural differences and migration. This is of particular interest with respect to partial migration, in which only part of a population migrates while the other remains resident. We investigated whether two behavioural traits (activity and stress response) are consistent across time in individuals of two partially migratory hoverfly species, Episyrphus balteatus and Scaeva selenitica. We also investigated whether there were consistent behavioural differences between migratory and resident flies within species. Individual activity was consistent across time in both species. Additionally, activity of female E. balteatus differed between the phenotypes, with summer insects being more active than migrating and overwintering individuals in our assays. Furthermore, females of S. selenitica were more active and less easily stressed than E. balteatus. The results not only highlight that hoverflies behave consistently across time, but also that behavioural differences also occur between migratory and resident flies. They also provide evidence for the possible role of behavioural differences in influencing partial migration decisions within populations. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Males often compete intensely against rival males because access to females is a major factor contributing to their reproductive success. However, there is controversy over whether male-male competition is weakened when rival males are related, with reduced aggressiveness leading to inclusive fitness benefits. Furthermore, same-sex sexual behaviour is also expected to mitigate male-male contests. Here, I examined how relatedness, developmental familiarity (i.e. males reared in the same container or not) and same sex sexual behaviour affect the intensity of male-male competition in wild-caught field crickets, Teleogryllus occipitalis. Relatedness and familiarity had no significant effect on the intensity of male-male contest behaviour. However, same-sex sexual behaviour did weaken maleemale competition. In conclusion, my results indicate that same-sex sexual behaviour in this cricket has adaptive significance by mitigating risky maleemale contest behaviour.

AB Common cuckoos, Cuculus canorus, are brood parasites: they lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species, and let these hosts incubate their eggs and feed and rear the nestlings. Although cuckoos do not show parental care, they demonstrate complex social interactions, including territorial behaviours and male-male aggression. Cuckoos have a well-known and simple two-phrase call ('cu' and 'coo'), uttered by males during their breeding season. Previous studies suggested that the 'cu-coo' call of males is individually unique, potentially allowing discrimination between different classes of males. Using playback experiments in a dense population of radiotagged cuckoos, we tested whether neighbouring males are tolerated more than unfamiliar intruders: the classic 'dear enemy' phenomenon. Focal birds responded more aggressively to the calls of unfamiliar simulated intruders (strangers) than to the calls of conspecifics with whom they shared territorial boundaries (familiar neighbours). Cuckoos responded quickly, within, on average, less than half a minute; they often approached the loudspeaker to within 5 - 10 m, even from up to 80 m away, and used their 'cu-coo' calls in response. Our results showed that cuckoos used their simple call for the discrimination of familiar versus unfamiliar individuals, and did so specifically to defend their own territories. In turn, cuckoos showed tolerance to nearby conspecifics, for example neighbours with overlapping territories, and did not respond to control playbacks. Finally, as typically more than one cuckoo was interested in the playbacks, this study confirmed the opportunity for brood-parasitic birds to socialize during the breeding season.

AB Habitat characteristics influence the efficacy of animal communication, and population differences in signal structure due to habitat variation are well known for sound and colour signals. However, this variation in signal structure has not been reported for motion-based signals. Here we tested the motion-based signalling displays of two populations of an Australian agamid lizard, Amphibolurus muricatus, in the context of their respective habitats. We employed a novel approach that calculates the distribution of motion speeds of lizard signals and environmental noise independently, before computing the difference in these distributions to obtain a measure of signalenoise contrast. Our results revealed variation in signal structure between the two populations and support the hypothesis that this variation can be explained by differences in the signalling environment. Signals from both populations showed similar contrast values at their respective habitats, but differed significantly when considered in the habitats of the allopatric population. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that habitat structure affects signal efficacy and causes population differences in motion signalling behaviour as a consequence of adaptations to enhance efficacy.

AB The existence of play, a form of behaviour without obvious benefits to survival or reproduction, is a long-standing ethological mystery. Experiments in which socially deprived juvenile male mammals develop into sexually incompetent adults, along with widespread sexual dimorphism in rough-and-tumble play (R&T), suggest that R&T may prepare juvenile males for adult sexual behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a longitudinal study of American mink, Neovison vison, on two farms, with two cohorts each. For males (N = 121), we predicted that individuals with the highest frequencies of rough-and-tumble play as juveniles (10-20 weeks old) would, as adults, show shorter latencies to bite females' necks and to begin copulating, and copulate for longer durations. On one farm, we conducted a pilot study of females (N = 10) as a preliminary test of the hypothesis that R&T also prepares females for adult sexual behaviour. Here, our predictions were the opposite of those for males, since abilities to limit the number or duration of copulations could allow females to exercise pre- or postcopulatory mate choice. In total, we observed 1669 maleefemale encounters and 1004 separate copulations. As predicted, frequent juvenile R&T predicted long-lasting copulations in adult males and longer latencies to copulate in adult females. This was true specifically of rough-and-tumble play itself, independently of general activity levels and, among a subset of 32 males reared in environmentally enriched housing, also independently of solitary object play. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that juvenile rough-and-tumble play predicts adult sexual behaviour in any species. Further research is required to test whether our results for females can be replicated, and, importantly, to determine whether play truly has a causal role in either of these correlational relationships.

AB Personality traits and behavioural syndromes are often assumed to relate to life history strategies and lifetime fitness variation and hence may be generally under selection. Key in this regard is the, often untested, assumption that individual differences in (correlated) behaviours are maintained across contexts and over an individual's lifetime. Here, we tested this assumption, using a population of 30 captive male starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, a highly gregarious avian species. We repeatedly assayed novel environment exploration and different aspects of sociability towards a female conspecific, across seasonal contexts (spring and autumn) and across a 2-year period, which represents a substantial portion of a starling's life span. We found that, regardless of plasticity at the population level, both exploration behaviour and sociability traits investigated were moderately repeatable across seasons and years, with no significant differences between repeatability estimates over different timescales. However, no evidence was found for significant between-individual correlations between the investigated traits, including different aspects of sociability. Taken together, our results provide empirical evidence that exploration and sociability are personality traits that are stable across seasons and in the long term but do not form behavioural syndromes. Given the recent evidence that personality traits are often heritable, the traits assessed in our study might have the potential to evolve independently under selection. This long-term consistency in exploration and sociability might have important implications for the social organization within complex social environments and influence a wide variety of ecologically relevant processes.

AB Recognition of the ubiquity of female multiple mating has caused an important shift in sexual selection research, emphasizing the adaptive nature of female mating strategies. While phenotypic changes in female mating traits have been previously studied, little is known about the genetic basis of female mating behaviour and its potential to respond to selection at different stages throughout an individual's life. Using a large quantitative genetic breeding design, we observed lifetime female mating behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster to examine the effect of female age and mating history on three key mating traits: courtship latency, mating latency and copula duration. Courtship latency (time until males initiate courtship) decreased with the cumulative number of females' previous matings. Mating latency (defined here as the time between the beginning of courtship and the start of copulation) increased with female age, and copula duration was found to decrease as females aged. We calculated quantitative genetic estimates for mating traits in virgin females and at the females' third mating to examine changes in the evolutionary potential of mating traits. We found considerable additive genetic variation in courtship latency and mating latency measured in virgin females. Copula duration displayed no heritable variation among females across sire families, but male effects were consistent with the idea that this trait is under male control. Heritability estimates differed significantly from zero in virgin females for courtship latency and mating latency but not when females were mating for the third time. However, overlapping 84% confidence intervals between heritability estimates obtained from virgin and mated females suggest that female mating strategies may have the potential to respond to selection at these different life stages.

AB Termite inquilines specialize on living in and feeding on a host termite nest. However, the mechanisms allowing survival of two mutually hostile populations confined to a single nest are not understood. Here we report on inquiline termites that respond to their host's alarm cues. Upon detecting these cues, the inquilines do not join in with the host's nest defence, but use this information for their own benefit, to escape danger. Using behavioural bioassays under laboratory conditions, we show that the obligatory inquiline Inquilinitermes microcerus (Termitidae: Termitinae) responds both to its own alarm signal and to alarm cues from its host, Constrictotermes cyphergaster (Termitidae: Nasutitermitinae). Conversely, this host responded only to its own alarm signal. Despite perceiving their host's alarm cues, inquilines were never observed sharing nest defence with their host in experimentally damaged nests in the field. We argue that this allows inquilines not only to minimize encounters and hence conflict with their hosts, but also to use their host alarm information to escape the host's enemies, which are also likely to be enemies of the inquilines. Our results show a new benefit that inquilines gain from the host, and we discuss the inquiline way-of-life from an evolutionary perspective, as the outcome of constraints and benefits imposed by living in host nests.

AB Given that birds discriminate heterospecific songs from conspecific ones, bird songs have a function in species recognition. Even in the same species, local populations often have somewhat different songs (i.e. dialects). Birds might discriminate nonlocal dialects from local dialects due to the differences in acoustic characteristics between them. Discrimination of nonlocal dialects from individuals' own dialects has the potential to promote reproductive isolation. Individuals in populations with sympatric related species that sing similar songs might discriminate not only heterospecific songs but also the nonlocal dialects of conspecifics. In populations without sympatric related species, individuals may not need to distinguish local conspecific songs from similar types of songs and may not discriminate nonlocal dialects from their own dialect. I investigated this hypothesis using Japanese tits, Parus minor, and varied tits, Poecile varius, in the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. I performed playback experiments to simulate territorial intrusions by forming pairs of two populations: one lived with, and the other without, the related tit species. The results from two and three paired populations of Japanese and varied tits, respectively, showed that males living with other sympatric species responded strongly to their own dialects but weakly to foreign dialects of conspecifics. Additionally, males living without a related species did not respond differently to the dialects. This asymmetric response pattern indicates that sympatric related species have important effects on response to conspecific song dialects, which may have implications for gene flow and reproductive isolation among populations with differing dialects.

AB Interest in how parasites shape host behaviour has increased dramatically in recent years. The main focus of behavioural ecologists has been on the negative effects of parasites on host behaviour. However, there are instances in which infected hosts express more adaptive behavioural phenotypes and have higher fitness relative to uninfected hosts, suggesting that it is sometimes beneficial to be parasitized. For example, hosts can exhibit evolved dependence, wherein the host coevolves with and comes to depend on parasites for the expression of adaptive host behaviours. Additionally, 'conditionally helpful parasites' modify the host phenotype in ways that benefit the host under particular conditions. These scenarios have been explored in the context of bacterial or fungal symbionts, but have been relatively unstudied with regard to metazoan parasites (e.g. trematodes, acanthocephalans, nematodes and cestodes). We explore how these scenarios apply to hosts infected by metazoan parasites, and consider implications for research in behavioural ecology. We examine conditions under which infection should result in more adaptive host behavioural phenotypes, and the implications for host fitness and evolution. We then discuss the implications of conditionally helpful parasites and parasites for which hosts have evolved dependence for laboratory studies of host behaviour and for conservation and reintroduction programmes.

AB We use network analysis of co-herding and nearest-neighbour data for harems from several study populations to examine the natural grouping patterns of gelada baboons, Theropithecus gelada, a molecular fission-fusion primate species. We show that the association patterns of the harems reflect grouping levels of ca. two, ca. four, ca. seven and ca. 14 harems (equivalent to ca. 30, ca. 50, ca. 100 and ca. 200 individuals). These patterns are stable across both time and space. Analysis of the distribution of harem sizes across four study populations suggests that these grouping levels reflect the processes that influence harem fission, combined with a viscosity reflecting time since fission. We suggest that the natural social grouping for this species is a set of two to three harems that are the product of recent harem fission, in line with predictions from the social brain hypothesis, and that successive fission events over time cumulatively give rise to the other grouping layers. While the grouping of ca. 100 animals has previously been identified as the 'band', the ca. 50 layer was previously unidentified. We do not know what its function is, although it closely resembles typical Papio troops in size. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Insect societies display a remarkable level of cooperation, but their colonies also represent a valuable resource that can be taken advantage of by genetically unrelated individuals. Indeed, several recent studies have documented cases of intraspecific reproductive parasitism, whereby workers penetrate and lay eggs in unrelated colonies in order to have their brood raised by the host workers. Previously, it has been predicted that queenless colonies should be a prime target of such intraspecific worker parasitism, as in such colonies the parasite workers would be able to reproduce without interference from either the queen or other workers. So far, this prediction has been supported with data from the honeybee, but evidence from other social insect groups is currently lacking. Here we present the first such test in the common wasp, Vespula vulgaris. In particular, workers from queenright colonies left the natal nest at a higher rate than those from queenless colonies. However, contrary to our predictions, drifter workers targeted queenless and queenright colonies equally. Chemical data suggest that this lack of discrimination may be linked to recognition constraints and the lack of volatile signals that reliably indicate the presence or absence of the queen. In addition, in queenright colonies, drifters activated their ovaries at a rate that was ca. five times higher than the natal workers. Overall, our results suggest that also in wasps, workers can gain inclusive fitness by drifting to unrelated nests, even if the chances of successfully reproducing there may be very slim.

AB Infochemicals play an important role in structuring intra-and interspecific interactions. Many parasitoid wasp species rely on herbivory or oviposition-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs/OIPVs) to locate their herbivorous hosts, and must cope with variation in the volatile blends due to factors such as plant/host species, herbivore density or attack by several herbivores. However, little is known about how dual herbivory or changes in herbivore density affect multiple parasitoid species, each attacking a different herbivore, in the same system. In a natural system, we investigated the effect of dual attack on the ability of three parasitoid species to differentiate between volatiles induced by hosts and those induced by a combination of hosts and nonhosts. Black mustard, Brassica nigra, plants were infested with eggs or caterpillars of Pieris brassicae, alone or in combination with different densities of Brevicoryne brassicae aphids. We determined the ability of three different parasitoid species that parasitize either P. brassicae eggs (Trichogramma brassicae), caterpillars (Cotesia glomerata) or B. brassicae aphids (Diaeretiella rapae) to discriminate between the induced volatiles, and analysed the plant volatile blends. Dual infestation did not affect the parasitoid species equally and aphid infestation altered, in a density-dependent manner, the volatile-mediated foraging of all three parasitoid species. Chemical analyses of the volatile blends revealed nonlinear emission patterns in relation to aphid density in both plants attacked by aphids alone and in plants attacked by a combination of aphids and caterpillars. Simple correlations between behaviour and volatile emissions in pairwise comparisons suggest the importance of certain volatiles explaining attraction, whereas dose-response type analyses reveal that these simple correlation analyses provide an incomplete picture.

AB Strong social relationships confer health and fitness benefits in a number of species, motivating the need to understand the processes through which they arise. In female cercopithecine primates, both kinship and dominance rank are thought to influence rates of affiliative behaviour and social partner preference. Teasing apart the relative importance of these factors has been challenging, however, as female kin often occupy similar positions in the dominance hierarchy. Here, we isolated the specific effects of rank on social relationships in female rhesus macaques by analysing grooming patterns in 18 social groups that did not contain close relatives, and in which dominance ranks were experimentally randomized. We found that grooming was asymmetrically directed towards higher-ranking females and that grooming bouts temporarily decreased the likelihood of aggression between grooming partners, supporting the idea that grooming is associated with social tolerance. Even in the absence of kin, females formed the strongest grooming relationships with females adjacent to them in rank, a pattern that was strongest for the highest-ranking females. Using simulations, we show that three rules for allocating grooming based on dominance rank recapitulated most of the relationships we observed. Finally, we evaluated whether a female's tendency to engage in grooming behaviour was stable across time and social setting. We found that one measure, the rate of grooming females provided to others (but not the rate of grooming females received), exhibited modest stability after accounting for the primary effect of dominance rank. Together, our findings indicate that dominance rank has strong effects on social relationships in the absence of kin, suggesting the importance of considering social status and social connectedness jointly when investigating their health and fitness consequences.

AB Many animals gather information about predators with a variety of cues, such as visual, acoustic, and olfactory. Several species of birds, including chickadees, are good at discriminating between species of raptors using visual cues, and they can encode information about the threat level in their alarm calls. Much less is known about how birds discriminate between the calls of different species of predators. We played back the calls of three species of raptors to black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, and chestnut-backed chickadees, Poecile rufescens, to determine whether they can discriminate between them using acoustic cues. We played the calls of two species of small, high-threat raptors, northern pygmy-owl, Glaucidium gnoma, and sharp-shinned hawk, Accipiter striatus, which have very different hunting strategies (mainly sit-and-wait ambush predator versus very fast surprise attack flights). We also played a larger, lower-threat northern goshawk, Accipiter gentilis. Black-capped and mountain chickadees responded much more to the calls of the two small, more dangerous raptors than to the northern goshawk; they also responded very differently to the calls of the two small raptors. Chestnut-backed chickadees did not respond differently to the calls of the three raptors. These results indicate that black-capped and mountain chickadees can make specific discriminations between the calls of these three raptors and that they encode information in their alarm calls in sophisticated ways.

AB Vocal exchanges are predicted to serve a social bonding function by allowing conspecifics to 'groom-at-a-distance'. If vocalizations play a role in bonding, then they should be mainly exchanged between the socially bonded group members, and thus display high social selectivity that characterizes other affiliative behaviours such as grooming. However, whether or not vocal exchanges are driven by social bonds remains unclear. We investigated vocal selectivity by studying the relationships between contact-calling networks and grooming networks in multiple free-ranging groups of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta. Lemur grooming interactions were socially selective and were directed towards only some of their group members. However, their vocal exchanges displayed even higher levels of social selectivity. Instead of exchanging vocalizations with each group member they groomed, lemurs reserved their vocal responses mainly for the group members whom they had frequently groomed. We tested this vocal selectivity through a playback experiment in which we presented lemurs' calls to their group. Lemurs responded only to the playbacks of the conspecifics whose calls they had responded to while free-ranging, confirming that selective vocal responses do not depend on proximal (i.e. visual or olfactory) cues from the vocalizing lemur. These robust relationships between grooming and contact-calling networks in lemurs, a species that lives in small groups where grooming frequency reflects bond strength, demonstrates that vocal exchanges indicate the strong social bonds between conspecifics. Contact calls may serve a bonding function in social species by allowing the strongly bonded group members to groom-at-a-distance when they are separated from each other.

AB A variety of hypotheses have been suggested to explain the evolution of same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) in male insects. Males may be poor at discriminating other males from females, inexperienced, or may need to learn how to distinguish females. Alternatively SSB could be a by-product of a plastic reproductive strategy to succeed in scramble competition. Such a strategy could be adaptive if the cost of missing the chance to mate with available females exceeds the cost of mounting single males instead (i.e. SSB). We tested predictions derived from these hypotheses by experimentally varying the sex ratio and thus the intensity of scramble competition in the water strider Tenagogerris euphrosyne. We allowed males to experience female-biased or male-biased sex ratio treatments for a week, and then compared their expression of SSB under standard conditions. We also measured daily mating success of males during the treatment and related this to SSB frequency under assay conditions. Males kept in male-biased sex ratio conditions exhibited more SSB, mounting males and females equally often under assay conditions. Males kept under female-biased conditions only mounted males one-quarter as often as they mounted females in the assay. Male mating experience under treatment conditions did not influence the expression of SSB in the assay. In a second experiment we found that males that were more likely to exhibit SSB enjoyed higher initial mating success in a subsequent mating assay in a male-biased sex ratio. Our results indicate that plasticity in reproductive strategy not only increases mating opportunity but also confers a reproductive benefit. Taken together, SSB in T. euphrosyne is a highly labile trait responsive to sex ratio that delivers increased mating success under intense scramble competition.

AB Spatial scale-invariant Levy walk (power-law) patterns seem common among animals that move continually during searching. Scaling laws also describe well the spontaneous patterns of waiting times of sit-and-wait ambush predators, which show random 'burstiness' that appears scale-invariant across a broad set of scales. The occurrence of these scaling laws has been attributed to stochastic decision-based queuing processes. Taken together these various studies suggest that stochastic decision-based queuing processes may apply more generally across taxa with divergent foraging strategies, ranging from highly mobile pursuit predators to the less mobile ambush predators. Here we provide support for this proposition by demonstrating that simple stochastic priority processes capture accurately the timings of dives made by little penguins, Eudyptula minor, in their natural habitat, whose use of space and time falls between that of sit-and-wait predators and Levy walkers.

AB Despite extensive research on social learning in humans and animals, the mechanisms of social learning and the causes of its success or failure are still being debated. In the case of social foraging, there is conflicting evidence as to whether scrounging on conspecifics' food finding facilitates social learning or, rather, inhibits learning of food-related cues. In house sparrows, Passer domesticus, social learning has previously been shown to be inhibited during scrounging. In the present study, we found that hand-reared fledgling house sparrows that were imprinted on a mother model and scrounged on the food that she found readily learned the colour chosen by the mother as a food-related cue. However, our experiment also demonstrated that this social learning may indeed be less effective when it is not mediated by active search: fledglings following a mother model that pointed at the location of the seeds, forcing them to dig actively in the sand, developed a stronger preference for the target colour than fledglings whose mother had exposed the seeds for them. The latter were much more sensitive to information that they had acquired from independent search, which may explain a wide spectrum of variable results in social learning and highlight the potential importance of mechanistic details in its evolution.

AB Animals usually benefit from joining groups, but joining a group can also come at a cost when members expose themselves to competition and the risk of contracting a contagious disease. Therefore, individuals are expected to adjust grouping behaviour to the ecological circumstances, their own competitiveness and the composition of the group. Here, we used experimental infections and classic binary choice tests to test whether the monogenean flatworm Gyrodactylus spp. has the potential to influence shoaling behaviour in the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a model organism in behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology. Gyrodactylus spp. is a genus of widespread and rather inconspicuous, small(<0.5 mm) ectoparasites on fishes with the ability to cause severe damage to its host. Gyrodactylus species infecting sticklebacks have short generation times and those species typically residing on the skin or fins of their hosts are easily spread via body contact. In our experiments uninfected sticklebacks significantly preferred a group of uninfected fish over a group of Gyrodactylus-infected fish, while Gyrodactylus-infected sticklebacks did not discriminate between the two stimulus shoals with regard to their Gyrodactylus infection status. As infected fish were in poorer condition, were less likely to shoal and had a relatively heavy spleen, we suggest a generally reduced health state caused by the infection as a possible indirect mechanism of the altered shoaling preference. Although parasitism has been shown to play an important role in group formation, only a few studies have used experimental infections to directly test its influence on shoaling decisions. Our results show that Gyrodactylus spp. can influence shoaling decisions in three-spined sticklebacks and affirm the suitability of the Gyrodactyluse-stickleback system for studying the role of parasitic infections on host group dynamics.

AB Animals are attacked by pathogens, predators and competitors, sometimes simultaneously. For example, male crickets fight each other for access to females and such challenges may occur when one or both males are also defending themselves against a pathogen. We tested whether males altered their aggressive motivation when faced with both a competitor and a pathogen simultaneously. We found that immune-challenged male crickets (Gryllus texensis) were more likely to defeat male competitors when the reproductive payoff (i.e. a female) was nearby. However, when females were not present, males showed a decrease in their aggressive behaviour, and were less likely to win encounters with control males. This plasticity of aggressive motivation did not occur when males were chronically immune challenged. Chronically immune-challenged males were more likely to be defeated by control males regardless of the presence of a female. These results suggest that the costs associated with a chronic immune challenge may prevent terminal reproductive investment. We show that males can benefit from terminal reproductive investment because acutely immune-challenged males were still capable of mating and females did not appear to discriminate against them. Male crickets appear to engage in a context-dependent trade-off between the ability to defeat pathogens and the ability to defeat competitors. This trade-off is mediated, in part, by changes in male aggressive motivation (i.e. the critical threshold for the decision to flee). (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A major advantage of group living is increased decision accuracy. In animal groups information is often transmitted via movement. For example, an individual quickly moving away from its group may indicate approaching predators. However, individuals also make mistakes which can initiate information cascades. How responsive should individuals then be to escaping group members? Increasing responsiveness increases true positives (i.e. escape when a predator is present) but at the cost of increased false positives (i.e. escape when a predator is absent). Conversely, reducing responsiveness decreases not only false positives but also true positives, resulting in a fundamental trade-off in decision accuracy. Here we investigated how socially responsive individuals are to information transmission via movement. We performed a simulated predator detection task using human groups in which humans stepped forward if they wanted to escape. We confirm that this simple movement mechanism allows individuals in groups to simultaneously increase true positives and decrease false positives. The increase in the number of escapees over time during collective decisions depended on the personal information of the group members. Individual predator detection by only a few group members rarely resulted in anyone stepping forward. Individual predator detection by a quarter of the group often resulted in the entire group escaping. Finally, individual predator detection by at least half of the group led to a rapid escape of the whole group. Overall, the increase in the number of escapees over time followed a linear response. Since information transmission via movement is widespread in animal groups, this mechanism is expected to be relevant for many animal groups to improve decision accuracy.

AB Despite a rising interest in behavioural syndromes (correlations between different behaviours across context and time), the development of these syndromes is not well understood. Using the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus, we looked at the effects of maternal investment and social environment during development on the formation of a behavioural syndrome. A previous study demonstrated that the diet on which mothers were reared, controlling for their size, influenced the growth rate and size of their sons: females reared on high-quality diets had sons that grew faster and were larger at sexual maturity. In addition, males that were exposed to an adult male during development grew faster. We examined the behaviours of these same males across two contexts: aggression towards a mirror image and boldness under threat of predation. We detected an influence of maternal investment but not of social environment on the formation of a behavioural syndrome. The sons of mothers reared on high-quality diets exhibited a positive correlation between boldness and aggression, while there was no correlation among the sons of mothers reared on low-quality diets. Maternal investment influenced the formation of the syndrome by producing changes in only one of the behaviours, the behaviour most closely linked to energy acquisition (boldness under risk of predation) rather than energy expenditure (aggression). Our results suggest that energy balances could help predict the circumstances that would favour the formation of behavioural syndromes. Our results also support the hypothesis that behaviours involved in energy acquisition as compared to energy use will be more sensitive to fluctuations in variation in resources.

AB Long-term pair bonds occur in diverse animal taxa, but they are most common in birds, and can last from a few years to a lifetime. In many of these species, after the reproductive season, birds migrate to distant nonbreeding grounds where they remain for several months, and until recently, little was known about whether partners maintain contact during migration. This gap in knowledge was primarily due to past methodological difficulties in tracking long-term, large-scale movements of individuals. However, the development of new animal-borne geolocation devices has enabled researchers to track movements of individuals for a year or more. We tracked the annual migrations of both members of breeding pairs of Scopoli's shearwaters, Calonectris diomedea, breeding on Linosa Island (Italy) and found that although they did not migrate together, they did spend a similar number of days travelling to and from similar terminal nonbreeding areas. Although migration destinations were alike, they were not identical. That partners did not appear to travel or spend time together in the nonbreeding season suggests that similarities were not due to behavioural coordination. We performed additional analyses to uncover alternative, potential proximate mechanisms. First, we found that body mass of breeding adults during the chick-rearing period correlated positively with the decision to migrate further south, so conceivably pair members may migrate to similar areas because of shared reproductive costs; however, partners were not of similar body mass. Distances between nonbreeding areas for individuals that nested closer together were smaller than for individuals that nested far apart. As neighbours tend to be more closely related due to high natal philopatry, this suggests that similarities within pairs in migration behaviour may reflect the influence of shared genes on migration strategy.

AB Macro-ecological comparisons have repeatedly demonstrated that the taxonomic distribution of foraging innovations coincides with the ability to adjust to novel and changing environments. We sought to obtain experimental support for the link between innovative foraging and opportunism by measuring the innovation abilities of two highly successful passerines on the east coast of Australia with very different success strategies. The ecological success of the introduced Indian myna, Acridotheres tristis, has been linked to its ability to occupy opportunistically an ecological niche that most natives cannot, whereas the native noisy miner, Manorina melanocephala, owes its success to its ability to aggressively outcompete other avian species. Indian mynas were significantly more neophobic than noisy miners. Yet, when tested on a range of innovative foraging tasks, Indian mynas consistently outperformed noisy miners. The ability to use the beak in a greater range of ways, and more flexibly, was highly repeatable in Indian mynas, and underpinned their superior problem-solving performance. We discuss the results in the light of potential methodological influences, but also the idea that necessity may facilitate innovation not only in less competitive individuals, as is documented in the literature, but also in species with less competitive lifestyles.

AB How a colony regulates the division of labour to forage for nutritional resources while accommodating for size and demographic composition is a fundamental question in the sociobiology of social insects. In honeybees, Apis mellifera, young and old larvae produce pheromones that differ in composition. Nurses differentially regulate larval nutrition, feeding young worker larvae a surplus diet that parallels queen larvae in protein composition and food availability, while old larvae are restrictively fed a diet with similar sugar content as queens. The presence of larvae affects division of labour, but it is unknown whether foragers regulate resource collection based on larval age or pheromone production in the nest. We studied how larval age demography and the larval pheromone e-beta ocimene affect foraging activity and foraging load. Our results suggest that workers recognize larval age, probably by detecting changes in the pheromones emitted by larvae as they mature, and adjust the foraging division of labour (pollen versus nectar) to meet the nutritional needs of the colony's brood. For younger larvae, this results in a bias towards pollen collection. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In resource defence polygyny, where males defend resources that females use for reproduction, the resource characteristics preferred by the two sexes are expected to match. We tested this expectation by comparing the shell characteristics preferred by males and females in the shell- brooding cichlid fish Lamprologus callipterus. In this species, males attract females by collecting and defending shells within which females breed. We added shells to males' nests and found that females were more likely to occupy large shells but made no distinction between new, smooth shells and old shells coated with mineral deposits. In contrast, when we placed additional shells adjacent to males' nests, males were more likely to retrieve shells covered in mineral deposits but showed no significant preference for large shells over small shells. Furthermore, many shells in males' nests were smaller than the smallest shell that females used for breeding. The discrepancy between male and female preferences suggests that empty shells in L. callipterus nests may have additional functions, beyond serving as breeding substrate. We discuss the possibility that shells may also be extended phenotype signals analogous to the decorations of a bower. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Cannibalism of young is a common yet seemingly paradoxical phenomenon observed across a wide variety of taxa. Understanding this behaviour in the context of parental care remains a challenge for evolutionary biologists. A common adaptive explanation for the consumption of offspring is that it serves to increase the current or future reproductive success or survival of the cannibalistic parent by replenishing energy stores and facilitating continued care for any remaining young. Another explanation is that cannibalism may be a competitive response to cuckoldry or lowered certainty of parentage. We tested these ideas using the plainfin midshipman fish, Porichthys notatus, a species with an extended period of male-only parental care and documented offspring cannibalism. We found that the occurrence of cannibalism was not linked to the deterioration of body condition, but instead was most frequent during periods of high intrasexual competition and nest take-overs. Our results suggest that cannibalism is not driven by the energetic demands of parental care, but instead by competition among males for nests and females, and the resulting low paternity stemming from both nest take-overs and cuckoldry.

AB In humans, sleep duration and sleep timing have been identified as interesting facets of individual differences and of personality. Sleep duration and sleep timing are different constructs. For example, compare two individuals both sleeping for 6 h: one may sleep from 2300 to 0500 hours and the other from 0100 to 0700 hours. One can assess the midpoint of sleep in these two subjects which is the midpoint in clock time between sleep onset and awakening. These ideas have already been picked up in a handful of studies. Sex differences have been found in birds in the same direction as in humans with males sleeping for less time. Contrasting effects have been found in relation to mating: in humans, late chronotype men have the highest mating success, whereas in birds, earlier chronotypes gain higher mating success. Many sleep parameters are related to assortative mating in humans and similar but weaker relationships have been found in birds. Ontogenetic studies show that sleep-wake behaviour changes during adolescence in humans. Such changes have also been found in other mammals ranging from primates to rodents. Factors determining sleep-wake patterns could be environmental, such as temperature, sunrise or sunset or even artificial light at night. Artificial lighting at night leads to an earlier wake up and singing time in blackbirds, Turdus merula, whereas light at night makes humans wake up later. As a conclusion, I show some parallels and differences in the study of sleep timing between animals and humans and encourage further studies, in both field and laboratory settings.

AB Anthropogenic noise affects species relying on acoustic communication. Signals used in acoustic communication are important for reproduction as females are often attracted by signalling males and base their mate choice on male song. Previous studies on the impact of anthropogenic noise on behaviour have focused on the sender and mostly on vertebrates. However, we have little understanding of how potential receivers, e.g. females, are affected by noise. Using playback experiments, we investigated the response of female field crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, to male song in the presence and absence of anthropogenic noise. We found that anthropogenic noise resulted in less effective phonotaxis towards signalling males. Thus, our study provides experimental evidence that anthropogenic noise affects females by limiting their ability to locate potential mates. Since male songs were not energetically masked by anthropogenic noise, signal masking cannot explain the difference in response. The reduced ability to locate singing males may be explained by distraction caused by the broad stimulus filtering of G. bimaculatus. The behavioural adjustments at the individual level may be passed to higher ecosystem processes, owing to invertebrates' fundamental role as part of a functioning ecosystem.

AB There is growing evidence that many organisms adjust their physiology and behaviour during sexual encounters according to changes in their sociosexual situation. Selection tends to favour plasticity in males that can strategically ejaculate and females that can alter their resistance or remating behaviour adaptively. We investigated plasticity both in the ejaculate transfer patterns of males and in the pericopulatory kicking behaviour of female seed beetles, Callosobruchus maculatus. We altered the sociosexual environment of the beetles by (1) manipulating male mating history, (2) preventing females from kicking and (3) altering the risk of sperm competition. Males mating for the second time transferred half the weight of ejaculate of virgin males, but at the same rate. Males mating in the presence of rivals did not alter the weight of ejaculate, as might have been expected; however, the transfer of ejaculate began sooner. By looking at the effect of female kicking on male ejaculate transfer, we found that when females have their hindlegs ablated to prevent kicking, the rate of ejaculate transfer slows, but the weight remains the same. From the female perspective we found that the probability of females kicking was positively related to both copula duration and ejaculate weight, but also to male mating history; females were less likely to kick males that had mated more times previously even after controlling for copula duration and ejaculate weight. Finally, we found that removing a female's hindlegs increased the probability that females (attempted to) kick. Our results show that males are, to some extent, plastic in their ejaculatory responses to the sociosexual environment. More striking, however, and not previously documented, is that female kicking is affected by environmental variables, including male mating history.

AB Greater predator body size is often associated with greater predation risk. According to the threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis, prey should display graded responses to increasing predator body size; in turn, these differences in behaviour should also cause differing indirect effects. Yet, in aquatic systems, where prey often use chemical cues to judge predator threats, the role of chemically mediated perception of predator body size and the propagation of indirect effects are still unclear. To differentiate intraspecific predator size via chemical cues, prey must judge predator threat quantitatively (i.e. via concentration) or qualitatively (i.e. via differing cues and/or diets). We investigated the role of individual and aggregate predator body size (i.e. biomass, cue concentration) and qualitative diet cues in antipredator behaviour and indirect interactions by examining the behavioural responses of the mud crab Panopeus herbstii and the survival of oyster prey (Crassostrea virginica) in response to various blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, biomass and diet treatments. Mud crabs increased their refuge use and decreased foraging in response to chemical cues from large, but not small, individual blue crabs. The perception of predator size appeared to be related to predator biomass as multiple small blue crabs and large crabs elicited similar foraging responses in mud crabs. However, multiple small blue crabs failed to affect mud crab refuge use, indicating that some measures of behaviour may not always be predictive of indirect effects. Predator diet also influenced mud crab behaviour and foraging: predators fed mud crabs elicited a greater antipredator response than crushed conspecifics or predators fed oyster diets, suggesting that qualitative cues also influence intraspecific threat perception and indirect interactions. These experiments demonstrate that we cannot successfully predict indirect interactions without considering predator population size structure and measuring indirect effects.

AB Many animals adapt to rapidly changing social environments by using social information to modulate their hormone titres. Modulation of hormone titres, as proposed by the challenge hypothesis, provides a mechanism by which individuals can match their behaviour to their current social environment and thereby avoid costs associated with prolonged high hormone titres. Thus far, most work on social responsiveness of hormone titres has focused on androgens in vertebrates. However, there is mounting evidence that insect hormones, especially juvenile hormone, may respond to social stimuli in ways that parallel androgens in vertebrates. This review will integrate work on social modulation of hormone titres in vertebrates and insects. First we review how the hormone-mediated trade-off between fecundity and life span may be a key selective force favouring socially responsive hormone titres in both systems. Then we review theoretical and empirical work in vertebrates and insects that address how factors such as social instability, dominance rank and mating system influence hormone titre responsiveness. These studies illustrate that (1) juvenile hormone (JH) is responsive to social stimuli in a range of insect taxa and (2) JH responses match key predictions of the challenge hypothesis. We conclude that there are strong similarities in endocrine responsiveness across vertebrate and insect taxa. The challenge hypothesis provides a useful conceptual framework for hypothesis-driven research in insect endocrinology. In addition, exploring areas of convergence and divergence across vertebrates and insects may help clarify how selection has shaped patterns of endocrine responsiveness.

AB Studies on aposematism have generally focused on the benefits of red or yellow coloration, occasionally in contrast with green or brown, but rarely blue or orange. Furthermore, almost no studies have explicitly studied the utility of iridescent coloration in aposematism. To evaluate the survival benefit of iridescent coloration, we tested the ability of the natural colour extremes of Tectocoris diophthalmus jewelbugs to induce initial avoidance, learned avoidance, discrimination from palatable alternatives and broad generalization against avian predators: naive hand-reared and experienced wild-caught great tits, Parus major. Artificial baits were created by hollowing out bugs and inserting pieces of mealworm. Preference tests presented iridescent and orange baits simultaneously, then birds were divided into training groups and sequentially exposed to palatable black baits alternated with iridescent or orange baits made unpalatable by soaking mealworms in quinine solution. This was followed by simultaneous black/coloured discrimination tests, then a generalization test with both previously experienced and novel baits (all palatable). All groups showed a preference for orange baits over ones with iridescent patches. For wild-caught birds, attack latencies of iridescent and orange training groups were statistically indistinguishable, although only orange caused increased attack latency over the sequence. Hand-reared birds showed no change in attack rate/latency towards iridescent bugs over the sequence. In postlearning discrimination tests, all groups showed equally strong preference for palatable black baits and their unpalatable training baits. In generalization tests, hand-reared birds were most averse towards trained baits, but increased avoidance of iridescent-and-black baits suggests iridescence alone can contribute to aposematism. Wild-caught birds showed strong aversion to iridescent and novel orange-and-black baits regardless of training, suggesting birds may be broadly generalizing experience from local red-and-black aposematic bugs. Results suggest iridescent coloration and patterning can be an effective aposematic signal, especially in the presence of alternative palatable prey and/or other aposematic species.

AB The concept of keystone individuals offers a unifying framework to study the evolution and persistence of individuals that have a disproportionately large, irreplaceable effect on group dynamics. Although the literature is teeming with examples of these individuals, disparate terminologies have impeded a major synthesis of this topic across fields. To allow a strict classification of potential keystone individuals, we offer herein some general terminology, outline practical methodological approaches to distinguish between keystone individuals and generic individuals that only occupy a keystone role, and propose ways to measure the effect of keystones on group dynamics. In particular, we suggest that keystone individuals should be classified as 'fixed' or 'episodic' according to the duration of time over which they impact their group. We then venture into the existing literature to identify distinctive keystone roles that generic and/or keystone individuals can occupy in a group (e.g. dominant individual, leader or superspreader), and describe traits that can give rise to keystone individuals. To highlight the ecological implications, we briefly review some of the effects that keystone individuals can have on their group and how this could affect other levels of organization such as populations and communities. In looking at their diverse evolutionary origins, we discuss key mechanisms that could explain the presence of keystone individuals. These mechanisms include traditional Darwinian selection on keystone-conferring genotypes, experience and state- .or context-dependent effects. We close our review by discussing various opportunities for empirical and theoretical advancement and outline concepts that will aid future studies on keystone individuals.

AB Effective foraging behaviour is essential for animals to survive and reproduce, and depends on many intrinsic and environmental factors. There is increasing evidence that man-made (anthropogenic) factors can affect the behaviour of a wide range of taxa. However, few experimental studies have investigated how foraging behaviour is affected by exposure to increased noise levels, an issue of growing global concern. In our laboratory study, we examined how exposure to playback of noise originally recorded from ships, a prevalent source of human-generated underwater noise, affects the feeding behaviour of two sympatric fish species: the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and the European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus. Both species consumed significantly fewer live Daphnia magna, and showed startle responses significantly more often during playback of additional noise than during control conditions. However, whereas minnows showed a qualitative shift in activity away from foraging behaviour (greater inactivity, more social behaviour) under increased noise conditions, consistent with a classic stress-or fear-related defence cascade, sticklebacks maintained foraging effort but made more mistakes, which may result from an impact of noise on cognition. These findings indicate that additional noise in the environment can lead to reduced food consumption, but that the effects of elevated noise are species specific. It remains to be tested whether these interspecific differences translate into different ultimate impacts, but differential disruptions to foraging may have potential consequences for relative individual fitness and community structure.

AB Personality traits are important because they can affect individual survival as well as how a population may respond to environmental change. How these traits arise, whether they are maintained throughout ontogeny, and how environmental factors differentially affect them throughout life is poorly understood. Understanding these pathways is important for determining the function and evolution of animal personality. We examined the development of two commonly studied personality traits, boldness and docility, in a long-term study of yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris. Using data collected between 2002 and 2011, we quantified the repeatability within three age groups (juveniles, yearlings and adults), the correlation between age classes, and the behavioural syndromes of these two traits within the three life stages. We quantified boldness through flight initiation distance (FID) tests, and we quantified docility through marmots' response to being trapped. We found that boldness was repeatable only in yearlings, but docility was repeatable in all age classes. We also found that juvenile docility predicted later docility. We also found no behavioural syndrome between boldness and docility in any life stage. This suggests an adaptive hypothesis: that these personality traits develop independently and at potentially age-appropriate times. Thus, the development of personality traits may facilitate animal's coping with age-dependent requirements and constraints. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Maynard Smith & Parker (1976, Animal Behaviour, 24, 159-175) offered animal behaviourists and behavioural ecologists a theoretical framework/guide to understanding animal behaviour in competitive contexts. In this essay I trace the influence of this 'contest rule book' from the factors that led the two researchers to develop a treatise on the logic of the asymmetric game to empirical tests of the contest rules and theoretical additions made to the basic model and its underlying assumptions. Over a thousand studies cite this paper directly and thousands more cite work spurred by the original paper. The vast majority of these studies confirm the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) predictions made by Maynard Smith & Parker. Theoretical and empirical deviations from EES can largely be explained by the need for further structuring of the analyses into subgames and investigation of less obvious asymmetries than apparent size and resource value. To date, much progress has been made in three areas of interest to behaviourists: (1) understanding of the strategic nature of contests between conspecifics over limited resources; (2) modelling developments that deal with how information about potential asymmetries is gained; and (3) evaluation of the question of honest signalling with specific reference to threat displays. Here, I propose suggestions for future work, much of which will either require collaboration with mathematicians, or require that students interested in animal behaviour obtain a strong foundation in biomathematics. My preference is for the latter strategy.

AB Parental investment theory predicts that natural selection will favour a parental ability to bias the offspring sex ratio in favour of that which will yield the highest benefit-cost payoff. The local resource enhancement hypothesis posits that in cooperative breeders, parents may favour offspring that will mitigate parental effort by helping to raise younger siblings. Conversely, the fragile male hypothesis suggests that parents will adjust the sex ratio in favour of the sex that experiences higher mortality. We examined international studbook data of two cooperatively breeding primate species with differing reproductive strategies: golden lion tamarins, Leontopithecus rosalia, which typically give birth to twins, and callimicos, Callimico goeldii, which almost always give birth to singletons. The tamarins showed a stronger secondary sex-ratio bias in favour of males than did the callimicos, as predicted by the local resource enhancement hypothesis, because tamarins sustain higher per-parturition costs and because sons may invest more effort in caring for their younger siblings than do daughters. However, a generalized linear regression failed to reveal factors that may influence this variation. There was no significant predictor of male bias based on mother's age, mother's number of previous parturitions or group size. Contrary to predictions of the fragile male hypothesis, sons were no less likely to survive the postnatal period of parental investment than were daughters. A greater understanding of this phenomenon is needed because the adult sex-ratio bias in favour of males has become so pronounced, especially in golden lion tamarins, as to cause management difficulties for the conservation of these endangered species.

AB Behavioural phenotypes are invariably plastic to some degree and are among the most labile of phenotypes. Some are acquired over the course of development in a particular environment (developmental plasticity), but most are elicited by an environmental trigger and are expressed only briefly, but often repeatedly, in the life of an organism (activational plasticity). Thus, individuals can possess the ability to perform a behaviour, but in the absence of the appropriate environmental stimulus, can fail to do so over the course of a lifetime. Rarely is the evolution of behavioural phenotypes explored in the larger context of the evolution of phenotypically plastic traits. Here I argue that the evolution of behavioural phenotypes, regardless of the nature of the plasticity expressed, can be examined in the same way as the evolution of other plastic traits. I first provide a conceptual review of the factors that can influence the evolution of plastic phenotypes and of the ways in which behavioural plasticity can influence the evolution of other aspects of phenotype. Many of the most compelling questions involve contrasting ancestral patterns of plasticity with those in derived populations or species, a particularly challenging problem in the case of phenotypic plasticity. I therefore provide an overview of the ways in which the influence of plasticity upon evolution can be addressed and then provide a review of examples from the literature that offer initial insights into the role of behavioural plasticity in evolution. The questions are exciting, the data limited, and, as I argue in closing, we need creative insights into the ways in which behavioural plasticity has evolved and has in turn influenced the evolution of other aspects of phenotype.

AB Sperm competition imposes strong selection on males to gain fertilizations and maximize paternity. Males have been shown to adapt to sperm competition by modifying their behaviour and/or reproductive physiology. We investigated the fitness effects of male responses to sperm competition in house mice, Mus domesticus. Males that had been evolving with (polygamy) and without (monogamy) sperm competition for 18 generations were subject to different frequencies of social encounters with conspecific males to generate a sperm competition 'risk' treatment and a 'no risk' treatment. After manipulation of their social environment for 15-22 days, males were forced to compete for fertilizations against a male with the same selection history that experienced no manipulation. We genotyped embryos at 16 days gestation to quantify paternity success, and thus the competitive ability, of the experimental males. While there was no treatment effect on mating behaviour and paternity success, males from polygamous lines had significantly increased mating duration and paternity success when positioned in the disfavoured role of the second male to mate. Thus, males that had evolved with sperm competition showed greater mating effort and fitness compared to males that had evolved without sperm competition. Whether this is due to a genetic divergence between the lines or a differential capacity of males with different selection histories to respond plastically to current levels of sperm competition remains to be tested.

AB In songbirds, both song production and song preferences may be influenced by early-life experience. Early-life stress impairs development of the song-control brain regions and permanently affects male song production. However, few studies have examined the effects of early-life stress on female song preferences or the brains of female songbirds. We exposed female song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, to stressors (food restriction or exogenous corticosterone treatment) early in development. When birds were adults, we determined the effects of the stressors on: (1) the behavioural response to high-complexity versus low complexity-songs as well as to conspecific versus heterospecific songs; (2) the volume of song-control brain regions; and (3) the immediate early gene (Zenk) response in auditory forebrain regions following exposure to either conspecific or heterospecific song. We found no significant effect of developmental stress on the strength of the behavioural response to high-versus low-complexity song, but control females showed more selectivity in their behavioural response to conspecific versus heterospecific song when compared with food-restricted or corticosterone-treated birds. We observed no effect of either stressor on volume of the song-control nuclei. Control females exposed to conspecific song had more Zenk-immunoreactive cells in the auditory brain regions than control females exposed to heterospecific song. In contrast, food-restricted and corticosterone-treated females did not have more Zenk-immunoreactive cells after exposure to conspecific song. These results show that stressors known to affect male song production might also affect neural processing of song by females, and their subsequent behavioural response to song.

AB Many animals use low frequency and harsh sounds in aggressive contexts. Low frequencies are correlated with body size in some species, and thus can provide an indication of fighting ability. Because of this, low frequencies and harsh sounds may also indicate aggressive intent and motivation to attack. We tested for facultative adjustment of vocal behaviour in canyon wrens, Catherpes mexicanus, by using playbacks to simulate territorial intrusions. Thirteen territory-holding wrens were exposed to playback of typical conspecific songs which did not include harsh elements. Territory holders increased song rate in response to simulated intrusions, altered song type usage and altered some song sound frequency parameters. Birds singing in response to playbacks did not adjust the highest frequencies or the frequencies with maximum power in their songs, but they significantly lowered the lowest song frequencies and were more likely to append harsh notes to the ends of their songs. Results match predictions of the motivation-structural hypothesis, and suggest that canyon wrens alter their songs in multiple ways when faced with conspecific territorial intrusion.

AB The mechanisms by which self-organized systems like an ant colony reach collective decisions are poorly understood. Models explaining how trail-laying ants select the best food source and adapt to changes in their foraging conditions are often based on mechanisms that are either unrealistic or overly simplified. We studied the individual-level behaviour of the mass-recruiting Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, to determine the mechanisms that underlie the colony's ability to choose collectively the better of two food sources of different quality. Ants returning from a high-quality food source were more likely to U-turn back to it than ants returning from a lower quality food source. Those U-turning ants were also more likely to lay pheromone, and deposited pheromone at a higher rate than nonturning ants. We show that U-turning is pivotal to the rapid establishment of a strong pheromone trail to high-quality food sources, and that the trail is constructed from food to nest, not from nest to food. The pheromone-boosting U-turns were performed only during the initial period when the trail was being established. Once a trail was established, the trail was maintained by nonturning ants. U-turners appear vital in allowing a mass-recruiting colony to allocate workers rapidly to the food source of highest quality. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many species possess multiple sexual signals that are produced in different modalities. Signals from different modalities may convey different or similar (redundant) information, or be intended for different receivers. We studied sexual selection on two such signals (plumage and song) in the common yellowthroat, Geothlypis trichas. We measured the coloration and size of both a carotenoid-based and a melanin-based plumage ornament and defined singing consistency as the lack of variability between repeated renditions of the same song. Overall, we found that plumage ornaments predicted within-pair mating success, while song consistency predicted extrapair success. Only plumage was related to male condition but, among experienced males, consistent singers had higher survival rates. Singing consistency was more variable than plumage, as performance varied across observations of the same male in relation to social context and date. Our results suggest that visual and acoustic signals in this species are most important in different sexual selection contexts. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Black-fronted titi monkeys, Callicebus nigrifrons, produce acoustically distinct vocalizations in response to several predator species. Compared to other primates, the calls are remarkably quiet, high-pitched and structurally simple, suggesting that they may not function uniquely as predator-specific warning calls. To address this, we investigated whether conspecifics were able to respond to these calls in adaptive ways, by playing back call series originally given to a perched raptor (caracara) and terrestrial predatory mammals (oncilla and tayra). Monkeys responded strongly and in predator-specific ways. Specifically, listeners preferentially looked upwards when hearing raptor-related calls, and towards the presumed caller when hearing terrestrial predator-related calls. Locomotor responses were generally uncommon, but if they occurred then they were always in the expected direction. We concluded that black-fronted titi monkeys discriminated between calls given to different predators on the basis of their acoustic features and were able to make inferences about the type or likely location of the predator.

AB Altered predation risk in urban environments may contribute to animals becoming successfully urbanized by individuals from rural habitats. Escape behaviour has evolved to allow an individual to escape once captured by a predator. We tested whether altered predation risk in urban environments is associated with colonization of such habitats by comparing escape behaviour of 1132 individual birds belonging to 15 species from nearby rural and urban populations when captured by a human. Raptors (of which the Eurasian sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, was one of the most common species) were more common in rural than in urban habitats, whereas cats, Felis catus, showed the opposite pattern. There were consistent differences in escape behaviour between habitats, showing divergence in behaviour from the ancestral rural state. Urban birds wriggled less, showed higher tonic immobility, more often lost feathers, were less aggressive by biting less often, and emitted fear screams and alarm calls more often than rural birds. Furthermore, differences in escape behaviour between habitats were related to susceptibility to predation by sparrowhawks, as expected if differences in behaviour were due to differences in predation risk. Finally, an analysis of differences in escape behaviour between rural and urban birds revealed a significant relationship with time since urbanization, suggesting that escape behaviour has changed in urban environments over time. These findings suggest that release from predation and change in predator community associated with urbanization has altered the antipredator behaviour of birds colonizing towns and cities.

AB Although previously disputed, it is now clear that the demands from avian incubation put parents under considerable energetic stress, sometimes to an extent where the costs of incubation constrain clutch size evolution. However, the behavioural mechanisms involved in manifesting such costs remain largely unknown. We manipulated the demands of incubation by enlarging and reducing clutch size during 2 years in a pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, population in southern Sweden, and measured the resulting effects on incubation temperature and incubation behaviour. In addition, we assessed possible effects on later reproductive stages by restoring clutch size prior to hatching and subsequently monitoring female nest provisioning and nestling growth rate. The length of both attentive and inattentive bouts, as well as the total time spent incubating, was longer for females incubating enlarged clutches. These females also maintained eggs at lower temperatures, but only at the beginning of incubation. Thus, increased incubation demands were met by investing more time in incubation, but females were still not able to maintain incubation temperature at the same level as control females. Furthermore, females paid costs of increased incubation demands in terms of a longer incubation period in both years, and reduced nestling production in one, but did not appear to transfer any additional costs to their nestlings. We conclude that costs of incubation are context dependent, and suggest that the demands from incubation may be important in brood size determination in this species, at least in deteriorating ambient conditions.

AB Scent marking entails significant energetic and opportunity costs that demand efficiency. Signal detection theory offers a theoretical framework that generates testable hypotheses regarding where animals should place scent signals in the environment in a way that maximizes their probability of detection by target receivers while minimizing costs of production and distribution. Solitary and reliant on chemical communication, the giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, offers an interesting model to test these ideas. We studied scent-marking patterns in wild giant pandas in the Foping Nature Reserve by surveying areas containing a high density of scent posts. Pandas did not deploy scent marks randomly in this environment, but targeted trees with specific characteristics that promoted signal persistence, range and/or likelihood of detection. Variables affecting selection of scent-marking sites included bark roughnesss, presence of moss on the tree trunk, tree diameter and distance to the trail. That pandas should be efficient with their use of chemosignals comes as no surprise, as mounting evidence is suggesting that many aspects of giant panda life history are constrained by their energetically poor diet. We also found seasonal and sex differences in marking patterns, indicating a role for scent marking in reproduction and competition. Males scent-marked throughout the year, whereas females scent-marked predominantly during the mating season, suggesting functional differences in scent marking between the sexes.

AB Inbreeding depression can lead to the evolution of inbreeding avoidance before or after mating. However, despite widespread evidence of inbreeding depression, studies of inbreeding avoidance have generated different results across populations or species. These differences could potentially reflect the confounding effects of factors such as magnitude of inbreeding depression, sex, social familiarity, state of primary sexual receptivity and mating history. We examined the influence of these proximate factors on precopulatory inbreeding avoidance in a laboratory-adapted, outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster. We found a significant but low coefficient of inbreeding depression based on egg-adult viability measures. Controlling for sex-specific responses, familiarity, sexual receptivity and mating history, we found no evidence of precopulatory inbreeding avoidance. Mate choice of virgins was random with respect to relatedness and measurements of courtship frequency, mating latency and mating duration did not indicate any preference for unrelated partners. In fact, the only evidence for differential sexual behaviour in response to relatedness was that males first mated to unrelated females were significantly faster to remate with related females than with unrelated females. These results suggest that inbreeding avoidance may be limited in outbred populations of D. melanogaster, and fit theoretical predictions that inbreeding is not selected against in either sex when the coefficient of inbreeding depression is relatively low.

AB Signal honesty may be compromised when heightened competition provides incentive for signal exaggeration. Some degree of honesty might be maintained by intrinsic handicap costs on signalling or through imposition of extrinsic costs, such as social punishment of low-quality cheaters. Thus, theory predicts a delicate balance between signal enhancement and signal reliability that varies with degree of social competition, handicap cost and social cost. We investigated whether male sexual signals of the electric fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio become less reliable predictors of body length when competition provides incentives for males to boost electric signal amplitude. As expected, social competition under natural field conditions and in controlled laboratory experiments drove males to enhance their signals. However, signal enhancement improved the reliability of the information conveyed by the signal, as revealed in the tightening of the relationship between signal amplitude and body length. Signal augmentation in male B. gauderio was independent of body length, and thus appeared not to be curtailed through punishment of low-quality (small) individuals. Rather, all individuals boosted their signals under high competition, but those whose signals were farthest from the predicted value under low competition boosted signal amplitude the most. By elimination, intrinsic handicap cost of signal production, rather than extrinsic social cost, appears to be the basis for the unexpected reinforcement of electric signal honesty under social competition. Signal modulation may provide its greatest advantage to the signaller as a mechanism for handicap disposal under low competition rather than as a mechanism for exaggeration of quality under high competition.

AB Animals in urban environments often must adjust their vocalizations to be heard over the din of anthropogenic ambient noise. Most studies of this process use current comparisons of environments that vary in ambient noise; here, we evaluate over time the effects of the urban environment on signal structure and salience. We show that white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys, song increased in minimum frequency between 1969 and 2005 in San Francisco, California, U.S.A., coincident with rising levels of traffic noise. A higher minimum frequency is less likely to be masked by low-frequency ambient noise and thus is more likely to be effective as a communication signal. To test whether this change in song affects receiver response, we presented territorial males current (2005) and historical (1969) local songs. Males responded more strongly to current than to historical songs, suggesting that current songs communicate more effectively in the current local environment. The results suggest that behavioural adjustment to anthropogenic ambient noise over time can affect cultural evolution and communication. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal populations are often limited by food and rearing offspring is energetically demanding. Life history theory predicts that parents of altricial bird species will often reduce their current reproductive effort when given supplementary food. Previous food supplementation studies have mainly focused on effects on female parents, while the importance of paternal behaviour has largely been neglected. We addressed the effects of natural and experimentally increased food abundance on male ranging behaviour and provisioning rate, female and fledgling condition, and final reproductive success, in the Tengmalm's owl, Aegolius funereus, a species with obligatory biparental care. We found that males adjusted their parental effort by reducing provisioning rate at food-supplemented nests. Food supplementation induced an increase in body mass of females, and in body mass and haematocrit levels of fledglings. This suggests that the amount of extra food provided was enough for females to increase body condition sufficiently to start allocating extra resources to enhance the quality of current offspring. While the home range size of radiomarked males was not affected by food supplementation, it decreased with cover of spruce forest, which is a habitat that is denser in structure and richer in prey than pine forest and especially clear-cut areas. This suggests that habitat-specific prey abundance and/or cover may be strong determinants of home range size for males. Overall, the results provide novel insights into how habitat quality and food supply affect male hunting behaviour and biparental care, and how this in turn is reflected in fledgling condition.

AB Females of various animal taxa benefit from mating with large males, and size is often communicated through different signal modalities. In male house crickets, Acheta domesticus, size is positively correlated with heritable immunocompetence and the proportion of three-pulse chirps in the male's calling song. Although females can use these acoustic signals to choose desirable males, little is known about how these acoustic signals interact with other signal modalities. We investigated whether females prefer large males in the absence of acoustic signals. In tournament style two-choice tests, wing-clipped males that were mounted first on consecutive trials had a significantly larger mass on average than wing-clipped males that were not mounted first in both trials. We also used 100 two-choice tests to verify female acoustic preferences. Female house crickets spent significantly more time near speakers playing the calling song of a large male than the calling song of a small male. Finally, we pre-exposed females to a calling song recording from a small or large male and then presented the female with a small or large wing-clipped male to determine whether calling song or nonacoustic signals were weighed more heavily by females. Females had a lower latency to mount when presented with a large male, regardless of the quality of the calling song to which females had been pre-exposed. However, a high-quality calling song still decreased females' latency to mount small males. These results suggest that females assess size using long-range acoustic signals, but also reassess size using more proximate nonacoustic signals.

AB Seasonal patterns in territorial behaviour are common in many species, and are often attributed to the adaptive benefits of increased defence or the provision of information to potential competitors or mates during the breeding season. However, because defence behaviour is likely to be costly in terms of time and energy, an alternative possibility is that decreases in the nonbreeding season are a consequence of reduced food availability. We studied territoriality in the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding bird species that defends permanent territories. Groups interacted with rivals less and responded less strongly to an experimentally simulated intrusion of neighbours in nonbreeding periods compared to the breeding season. Foraging efficiency and biomass intake were significantly lower in the nonbreeding season, which resulted in birds being significantly lighter at this time of year. Finally, a feeding experiment in the nonbreeding season showed that groups given supplementary food significantly increased their response to a simulated territorial intrusion. These results indicate that the reduction in territorial behaviour during the nonbreeding season may be attributed, at least in part, to a reduction in food availability. We suggest that future studies on seasonal variation in territorial behaviour, especially those investigating species in which two or more individuals combine their defence, should take this potential constraint into account. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals constantly need to cope with changes in their environment. Coping with changes in cues that are associated with the location and abundance of food is essential for being able to adjust behaviourally to a variable environment. The use of cues in decision making requires appropriate levels of attention and learning ability, which may be affected by the personality of an individual. The relationship between personality, attention and learning as essential mechanisms for behavioural adaptation, however, is not well understood. We studied the relationship between attention to environmental cues, behavioural flexibility in learning and exploratory behaviour, a proxy for personality, in great tits, Parus major. We used a dimensional shift learning paradigm; a learning task involving several stages differing in complexity and requiring attention to changes in relevant cues. The results show personality differences in performance in learning flexibility in only the apparently most difficult stage, yet in opposite directions for males and females. Fast-exploring males showed more flexible learning abilities than slow males, whereas in females slow explorers outperformed fast explorers. These context-dependent and sex-specific personality effects reveal behavioural and cognitive mechanisms that may underlie observed sex-and personality-dependent fitness differences in natural populations.

AB Darwin's sexual selection theory predicts that males should compete to gain access to females, while females should choose the best possible male. However, males can also be choosy, especially in monogamous mating systems with female-biased sex ratios and biparental care. A few studies show that in systems in which males are highly selective, chemical cues can lead to mating of individuals with high reproductive success. Using Dendroctonus valens, a monogamous bark beetle with typical biparental care, and Y-tube olfactometers, we provided males with a choice between two females and found strong evidence of odour-based male mate preference. We then tested whether this preference led to successful matings and if it had consequences for courtship displays and offspring fitness. Male and preferred female pairs had less aggressive courtship interactions, longer copulation times, constructed galleries faster, and had cleaner galleries. Preferred females had faster oviposition rates and larval development. Our study shows that, in D. valens, males choose females based on chemical cues and that the resulting maleefemale pairs have superior reproductive success. Crown Copyright (C) 2011.

AB As most long-distance migrants leave their breeding ranges in Western Europe towards the southwest, they must change their migratory directions somewhere to reach their nonbreeding areas in Africa. Laboratory experiments have been the basis to suggest an endogenously controlled, abrupt directional shift in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, the so-called 'Zugknick'. We compared own radar data gathered in Europe and the Western Sahara with this established theory. Radar tracks were filtered according to the wing beat pattern and migratory passage of garden warblers, Sylvia borin, and pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, the species used in the former experiments. The flight directions were highly concentrated and the mean direction in the Western Sahara was only slightly more south than the southwesterly directions in central and southwestern Europe. At observation sites close to the southern edge of the Sahara, mean directions were south to east-southeast. We therefore conclude that an endogenously predetermined directional shift occurs towards the end of the Sahara crossing according to physiological or environmental triggers leading the birds towards their wintering ranges in the southeast.

AB Much of our understanding of female mating behaviour in insects comes from studies performed under controlled laboratory conditions, with Drosophila as the most commonly used model system. Laboratory studies of Drosophila have demonstrated a strong genetic basis to female remating rate. Because behaviour is strongly influenced by the environment, the heritability of remating rate in laboratory cultures does not necessarily reflect variation that is relevant to field conditions. In this study, we investigated the strength of the link between the behaviour of flies in laboratory and field. Wild-caught female Drosophila pseudoobscura that produced broods sired by multiple males had daughters that remated more rapidly in the laboratory. This suggests that laboratory experiments can successfully reflect differences between females' mating behaviour in nature. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Interspecific mutualisms are an essential feature of life on earth, yet we know little about their evolution and stability. In many mutualisms several species are available as partners, raising questions about the similarity in function and behavioural repertoire depending on the partner species. Furthermore, variation between species in the quantity and quality of interactions resulting in variation in payoffs may allow us to infer the potential evolutionary origin of a multispecies mutualism complex. We addressed these issues in the marine cleaning mutualism, in which so-called 'cleaners' remove ectoparasites from so-called 'client' reef fish. We measured several parameters concerning the quantity and quality of cleaning interactions in six sympatric cleaner wrasse species. We found significant variation between cleaner species with respect to client diversity, the number of interactions with predatory clients, the duration of interactions, the frequency of client jolts as a correlate of 'cheating' by cleaners, and behaviours used for manipulation of client decisions. Exploratory correlations between cleaner species' dependency and our variables of interest suggest that cleaning originated as a conflict-free by-product mutualism and evolved towards more sophisticated behaviours, including strategic behaviours for interactions with predators, cheating and manipulation specifically adapted to the client type.

AB Environmental conditions during development can have long-lasting effects on morphology, physiology and behaviour. In contrast to human personality, our understanding of how the early environment influences the development of animal personality is limited. In bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, a male's mating behaviour is highly repeatable through time and across interactions. To examine whether these stable behavioural types are influenced by early nutritional and social conditions, we reared individuals on either high-or low-food levels in combination with either one adult male, one adult female or no adult. Individuals reared on high food were larger at the earliest measurements and remained so as adults. The high-food treatment also had the highest mortality, particularly if individuals were reared with an adult male. Despite these growth and survival consequences, the food and social treatments did not affect whether males were preferred by females or became dominant as adults. While the outcome of social interactions was not influenced by the early food and social environment, particular mating behaviours were; males reared on low food were more aggressive to females and showed more courtship, and males reared without an adult were more aggressive to females than those reared with either an adult female or male. Our results suggest that some of the behaviours that contribute to a male's behavioural type within the mating context and that influence mating success in this species are sensitive to aspects of the early environment.

AB Although variations in the rate of reconciliation have been the subject of extensive studies, variations in conciliatory patterns and their differential use have barely been investigated. In this study, we analysed the postconflict behaviour of a captive group of mandrills, Mandrillus sphinx, and observed a differential use of contact and noncontact postconflict affiliation between former opponents. Mandrills used contact affiliation to reconcile with related opponents and when the original aggressor was lower ranking than the victim, and used noncontact affiliation to reconcile with opponents that had a high probability of renewing aggression. Both contact and noncontact affiliation reduced the probability of renewed aggression. These results suggest accessibility and danger modulated the use of conciliatory patterns and call for further studies of flexible conciliatory strategies.

   AVERSIONS; INSECT PREY; WILD BIRDS
AB Toxic prey often advertise their defences to predators using conspicuous colours, such as red and yellow; and predators exhibit unlearned biases against warningly coloured food. These biases are particularly evident when other components of warning displays, such as sounds and odours, are present. Predators are thought to use additional signal components to reduce their attack rates on warningly coloured prey when the risk of them being defended is perceived to be high. If this is the case, any cue that allows predators to predict the presence of defended prey reliably should incite biases against warningly coloured food. Using domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, as predators and coloured crumbs for prey, I tested whether observing a conspecific's distaste response caused predators to bias their foraging decisions away from warningly coloured prey. Chicks observed a conspecific that had been given either a drop of water or a drop of Bitrex (a bitter-tasting solution). They were then offered a choice of either red and green, or yellow and green crumbs. Chicks that observed a conspecific's reaction to Bitrex attacked fewer red and yellow crumbs, and more green crumbs, than chicks that observed a conspecific's reaction to water. Observing conspecifics' disgust responses therefore caused birds to bias their foraging preference away from warningly coloured food and towards food of a more neutral colour. This suggests that predators' social systems may play a more important role than previously thought in the evolution of prey defences. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sperm competition theory predicts that males should be sensitive to socio-sexual cues that provide information about the risk of sperm competition at any mating and correspondingly adjust their mating tactics in a manner that maximizes their reproductive success. Here, we investigated male mating preferences in response to socio-sexual cues as predictors of sperm competition risk (SCR) in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, as a model study species. In a natural Trinidadian population, we observed that free-ranging females were most commonly pursued sexually by only one male at a time, which presumably represents a SCR associated with that female from the vantage of a nearby male observer. We tested whether wild-caught male guppies would modify their initial mating preference for either of two stimulus females presented by experimentally increasing the male's apparent SCR. This was done by allowing focal males to observe a rival male either placed near (but not physically interacting nor copulating with) or sexually interacting with their initially preferred female. In the absence of any apparent increase in SCR, the preference of focal males for either of the two stimulus females presented remained consistent. However, males significantly reduced their preference for their initially preferred female after having observed her either sexually interact with or merely in the vicinity of a rival male. Our results indicate that male guppies are sensitive to perceived SCR and adjust their mate choice behaviour in an apparently adaptive manner, as predicted by sperm competition theory.

AB Many social species show some form of task specialization among group members. In cooperative vertebrates, this usually does not coincide with morphological differentiation. In species with indeterminate growth, however, size differences between subordinates may promote task specialization in the performance of helping behaviours, depending on size-specific capabilities, opportunities and cost/benefit ratios. In the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher, helpers perform different helping tasks. To examine the effects of helper size, which reflects age, on cooperative behaviour in the field, we experimentally presented egg predators that do not threaten helper survival. In the egg predator treatment, large and small helpers increased defence and all helpers roamed further from the breeding shelter, presumably to keep potential egg predators at a safe distance from the brood. Additionally, small helpers defended more against egg predators presented close to the breeding shelter than large helpers, whereas the latter put more effort into digging experimentally added sand out of the breeding shelter. Our results show size(age)-specific task specialization of helpers in a cooperatively breeding vertebrate, which is reminiscent of eusocial insects.

AB Social insects use cuticular lipids for nestmate recognition. These lipids are chiefly hydrocarbons that can be endogenously produced or acquired from the environment. Although these compounds are already described as coming from different sources for different groups of social insects, nothing is known about the source of cuticular hydrocarbons in stingless bees. We used behavioural recognition tests and cuticle chemical investigation to elucidate the role of endogenous and environmentally based cues for nestmate recognition in the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia. We found that although newly emerged workers present specific cuticle patterns according to their nest origin, these compounds are not used for nestmate recognition, since newly emerged workers are broadly accepted in different colonies. The cerumen used in nest construction played an important role in recognition behaviour. Twenty minutes of contact with foreign cerumen was sufficient to increase the rejection rates of nestmates and separate the groups of workers according to their chemical profile. On the other hand, tests of feeding on a common diet showed no effect on chemical cuticle pattern or recognition behaviour. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB During mate selection, females of most species encounter males sequentially and may use a variety of decision rules whereby the attractiveness of a current potential mate is affected by sampling of previous individuals. The perceived distribution of male quality might therefore affect female mate choice. Mate choice among closely related taxa may additionally be affected by a perceived rarity of conspecifics. Here we tested whether female mate choice in the field crickets Gryllus rubens and G. texensis is affected by prior experience with either conspecific or heterospecific males. Specifically, we tested whether female acceptance of conspecific or heterospecific males is influenced by prior exposure to a conspecific or heterospecific male. Our results indicate that there is a clear previous-male effect, but that it differs across species. When 'high-quality' (i.e. conspecific) males are common, females are predicted to prefer them. Gryllus texensis females matched this prediction by showing clear preferences for conspecific males after prior experience with them, but G. rubens females showed the opposite effect: they preferred heterospecific males after prior experience with conspecific males. When prior experience is manipulated such that 'low-quality' (i.e. heterospecific) males are encountered first, female choosiness should be relaxed. Females of both species fit this prediction and showed no preference for conspecific or heterospecific males after prior experience with a heterospecific male.

AB For years, individual recognition has been the subject of many studies but, owing to the intrinsic complexity of the phenomenon, it has also been the source of much controversy. The sensory channel(s) used for recognition has also been much discussed. In aquatic invertebrates, vision has been one of the least understood media. We carried out two laboratory experiments using 49 pairs of adult male American lobsters. The first experiment was aimed at investigating the sensory channel/s (smell, sight or the two combined) used by lobsters to get information about the opponent, whereas in the second experiment we tested whether visual experience might allow lobsters to recognize the familiar opponent. Previous exposure to the sight of a conspecific induced lobsters either to avoid the opponent or to skip preliminaries (approaches and threats) and escalate the interaction. However, such changes in the dynamics of fighting were shown only when the opponent was the individual that the experimental lobster had previously seen rather than a generic lobster. This is the first study to provide evidence that lobsters can identify familiar conspecifics by sight, although this does not necessarily mean that they recognize them as individuals. Further studies are needed to clarify this issue. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The classical paradigm of sexual selection is that of advertising males and choosy females; however, male mate choice may be more common than previously thought. Unlike visual and acoustic cues, females rather than males usually emit long-distance chemical signals for mate attraction, thus providing an excellent opportunity to examine male mate choice further. Here, I used the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata to determine the effect of female body condition on male mate choice via chemical cues in a natural scenario. Female body condition is positively correlated with fecundity and negatively correlated with the propensity to cannibalize in this system, so I predicted strong male mate choice for good-condition females to maximize male reproductive fitness. Results of field-based choice tests showed differential male attraction to good-condition females: all males were found on the cages of good-condition females and none on those of poor-condition females. In a second series of choice tests conducted in large field enclosures, I found that some poor-condition females attracted males in the absence of good-condition females, and that these females had significantly more eggs in their ovaries than the unattractive poor-condition females. Furthermore, when egg number was controlled but female body condition varied, males no longer had a significant preference for good-condition females. I therefore propose that the male preference for fecund females is a result of egg-bearing females producing a greater quantity/quality of pheromone than egg-free females, and that chemical cues are likely to be an honest indicator of female fecundity in this system.

AB In anurans, females generally remain silent during mating or only produce calls of very low intensity before mating. Consequently the functions of female calls are not as well understood as those produced by males. We investigated a novel female call produced during mating in the Emei music frog. The functions of the female call during reproductive behaviours were evaluated by field and seminatural playback experiments. During mating, low-intensity female calls (approximately 3.2 s in duration) alternated with male sexual movements (approximately 1.34 s in duration). Female calling was sometimes prolonged when we interrupted male movements, which is consistent with the idea that female calls may stimulate male sexual activity and perhaps facilitate ovulation. In their natural environment, Babina males vocalize and mate in well-hidden underground nests. Field playback experiments showed that female calls significantly increased the rate of male advertisement calling which may help females locate males. Males also showed significant positive phonotactic responses to playback of female calls, and increased aggressive call production and other aggressive behaviours which females may use as cues for mate selection.

AB It is generally thought that females preferentially mate with novel males rather than with males with which they have recently mated and polyandry can lead to greater reproductive success. We first examined female mate preference and then compared mating duration and female fitness between monogamy and polyandry in the cabbage beetle, Colaphellus bowringi Baly. In a simultaneous choice test, the majority of females remated with familiar males rather than novel males. Mating also lasted longer with familiar males. In a second experiment, monogamous females lived longer than polyandrous females. Although there was no significant difference in egg production between monogamous and polyandrous females, the former produced more viable eggs, with a higher hatching rate. These results suggest that monogamy is more advantageous for female fitness than polyandry in C. bowringi. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ability to discriminate among signallers and to respond to them on an individual basis provides receivers with substantial benefits. For example, discriminating among signallers allows receivers to ignore unreliable individuals or to focus their territorial defence on unfamiliar intruders. Such discrimination requires signals to be individually distinctive; that is, signals must vary more among than within individuals. Furthermore, receivers must be able to discriminate among the signals of different individuals. In this study, we used fine structural analysis to show that the simple songs of male black-capped chickadees are individually distinctive, but that substantial variation exists both within and among recordings of the same individual. This finding emphasizes the need for multiple recordings of each individual in studies of individual distinctiveness, since failing to measure variation across recordings of the same individual can make it difficult to determine whether signals vary among individuals or whether they simply vary among different recording sessions. To test whether chickadees discriminate among the signals of different individuals, we used a playback experiment in which we broadcast priming and discrimination stimuli to 45 territorial males. When individuals heard the playback of two different males, they produced more songs and remained near the loudspeaker for a longer period than when they heard two different exemplars from the same male. Chickadees can therefore discriminate among singers based exclusively on their songs, which may help to explain how chickadees eavesdrop on singing contests and subsequently select extrapair mates on the basis of song contest performance.

AB Our goal in this essay is to review the hypothesis that females choose mates by the evaluation of male motor performance. We define motor performance as vigour, the ability to perform energetically expensive acts repeatedly, or as skill, the ability to perform difficult motor tasks well. Motor performance reflects most aspects of whole-organism performance that relate to survival, and thus should indicate, more reliably than ornaments do, individual male genetic quality and/or developmental history. Male sexual displays in many animal taxa contain elements of vigour and/or skill, and accumulating evidence suggests that females choose mates in nature based upon their evaluations of male motor performance. We note that male ornaments in many species are accompanied by conspicuous motor display, and we propose that ornaments often arise secondarily as a way to enhance the apparent skill or vigour of male motor performance. More and better methods to measure male vigour and skill are needed, as well as additional studies on the abilities of females to make discriminations of this type.

AB Males of many insect species engage in ritualized behaviours during courtship that include the donation of a food gift to their partner. Although there is extensive diversity in nuptial gift form, a gift provided before mating typically serves to facilitate copulation, thereby increasing a male's mating success. Unlike other insects, the Hawaiian swordtail cricket Laupala shows protracted courtship that includes the serial donation of nuptial gifts prior to mating. Males transfer multiple spermless 'micro' spermatophores over several hours before the transfer of a single sperm containing a 'macro' spermatophore. By experimental manipulation of male courtship, we tested several hypotheses pertaining to the adaptive significance of protracted courtship involving nuptial gift donation in this system. We found that extensive courtship interactions improve insemination by causing the female reproductive tract to take in more sperm. This suggests that the enhancement of sperm transfer is due to the serial donation of microspermatophores, which would represent a relatively novel function for nuptial gifts provided before mating and highlights the importance of examining cryptic processes of sexual selection.

AB Optimal balance between energy usage and feeding is crucial to an animal's fitness, and thus is a driving force in the evolution of species. Animals show varieties of different foraging strategies, each adapted to particular ecological and physical constraints. For example, while both the paddlefish and the zooplankton Daphnia filter-feed on patchy food sources, they differ greatly in size and in their methods of propulsion, affecting the degrees of influence of the viscous and inertial forces on these swimmers. To examine the effects of these physical constraints on the evolution of foraging strategies, we modified a recent evolution simulation designed for Daphnia by adding an energy penalty proportional to each turning angle used by modelled foraging agents. This modification accounts for the loss of linear momentum of larger swimmers as they change directions, directly contrasting with Daphnia, which, as smaller, rowing organisms, never build an appreciable momentum since they are halted by the surrounding medium after each forward stroke. While realistic random-walk-like trajectories were predicted by the simulation for Daphnia, distinct circling trajectories and nonzero peaks in the turning angle distributions were predicted for larger species, such as paddlefish. These results are strikingly similar to experimental data also reported here: the circling patterns and bimodal turning angle distributions observed in juvenile paddlefish.

AB Wild bearded capuchins, Cebus libidinosus, in Fazenda Boa Vista, Brazil crack tough palm nuts using hammer stones. We analysed the contribution of intrinsic factors (body weight, behaviour), size of the nuts and the anvil surface (flat or pit) to the efficiency of cracking. We provided capuchins with local palm nuts and a single hammer stone at an anvil. From video we scored the capuchins' position and actions with the nut prior to each strike, and outcomes of each strike. The most efficient capuchin opened 15 nuts per 100 strikes (6.6 strikes per nut). The least efficient capuchin that succeeded in opening a nut opened 1.32 nuts per 100 strikes (more than 75 strikes per nut). Body weight and diameter of the nut best predicted whether a capuchin would crack a nut on a given strike. All the capuchins consistently placed nuts into pits. To provide an independent analysis of the effect of placing the nut into a pit, we filmed an adult human cracking nuts on the same anvil using the same stone. The human displaced the nut on proportionally fewer strikes when he placed it into a pit rather than on a flat surface. Thus the capuchins placed the nut in a more effective location on the anvil to crack it. Nut cracking as practised by bearded capuchins is a striking example of a plastic behaviour where costs and benefits vary enormously across individuals, and where efficiency requires years to attain.

AB Acoustic signals are usually very effective in long-distance communication. However, in many habitats animals suffer more and more from signal interference caused by traffic-generated low-frequency noise. Recent observations suggest that birds are able to change the pitch of their song to reduce masking interference, but we still lack experimental evidence. Theoretically, some bird species, when confronted with increased noise levels, may be able to switch to song types in their repertoire with higher frequencies. We tested this hypothesis in the great tit, Parus major, by exposing singing males to low-frequency 'city' noise in their natural territories and comparing frequency characteristics of songs before and after song type switching. We also exposed birds to high-frequency, 'inverse' city noise, as well as to white noise as a control. Great tits adjusted temporal switching behaviour in response to noise exposure. Song types that were less masked by the noise treatment were sung for longer durations. As a result, all five birds that switched during the low-frequency noise treatment switched to song types with a higher minimum frequency. Similarly, seven of nine birds that switched while exposed to high-frequency noise switched to song types with lower maximum frequencies. These results provide experimental evidence for a short-term behavioural mechanism explaining noise-dependent frequency use in birdsong. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In songbirds, sensory and social learning processes in juveniles contribute to variation in male song and female preferences. The developmental stress hypothesis proposes that suboptimal early development affects the costly brain structures involved in male song learning and, as a consequence, song quality. As an extension of this hypothesis we tested in this study whether developmental conditions also modulate female song preference acquisition. We tested song preferences in adult female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, originating from a brood size manipulation experiment that had induced differences in mass, condition, immune response and levels of plasma testosterone at the early nestling stage. During the song-learning phase, juvenile birds were housed in small mixed-treatment groups with unrelated adult male song tutors. Adult females' song preferences were tested in an operant set-up where females could trigger different song playbacks by pecking different response keys. When females could choose between their own and an unfamiliar tutor's song they preferred their tutors' songs independent of experimental brood size. However, when females chose between two unfamiliar songs there was a significant effect of experimental brood size on preference strength: females from small broods showed significantly stronger preferences than those from medium and large broods. Hence, both females' rearing environment and sensory learning processes appear to contribute to variation in the direction and strength of female preference for male mating signals.

AB Gastropods subjected to predation from asteroids have a number of different defensive mechanisms to prevent and defend against attacks. I investigated the production and function of mucus in the lamellose ormer in response to attacks by the spiny starfish, Marthasterias glacialis (Asteriidae, Asteroidea). Production of mucus from respiratory pores on the shell helped obscure the direction of escape of the gastropod from the starfish. The mucus also had repellent properties against this predator and there was some evidence of it being an intraspecific alarm. The results suggest that mucus secretion is part of a larger stereotyped escape response, in which the mucus has an olfactory interference role.

AB A growing body of evidence shows that female birds use male plumage coloration as an important criterion in mate choice. In the field, however, males with brighter coloration may both compete better for high-quality territories and be the object of female choice. Positive associations between territory quality, male-male competitive ability and female preferences can make it difficult to determine whether females actively choose the most ornamented males. Male eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, display brilliant ultraviolet (UV)-blue plumage coloration on their heads, backs, wings and tails and chestnut coloration on their breasts, which is positively correlated with condition, reproductive effort and reproductive success. We tested the hypothesis that female bluebirds prefer males that display brighter and more chromatic coloration by experimentally widowing males in the field and allowing replacement females to choose partners. We controlled for the influence of territory quality on female choice by widowing dyads of males with adjacent territories. We found no evidence that UV-blue or chestnut plumage coloration, body size or body condition predicted the male with which a female would pair. We found no support for the hypothesis that the coloration of male eastern bluebirds functions as a criterion in female mate choice. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Patterns of social learning in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) may help explain behavioural variants and selection pressures favouring cultural evolution, but evidence for social transmission derived from field observations is controversial. The dolphins of Shark Bay, Australia are known for diverse, individually specific foraging behaviours, including tool use with marine sponges. We examined the relative contributions of habitat, maternal foraging and foraging behaviours of associates to the use of seven foraging tactics by bottlenose dolphin calves (Tursiops sp.). Three tactics were predicted by maternal foraging, one was predicted by water depth, one was weakly predicted by several factors, and two tactics were not predicted by any variable. Our findings provide support for the social learning of foraging behaviours in wild dolphins, illustrate the diverse pathways of foraging development, and offer insight into conditions that are likely to favour reliance on social information The evidence for vertical social learning (mother-to-offspring) indicates the dominance of a 'do what mother does' strategy, rather than copying the foraging behaviour of associates. However, since not all foraging behaviours were predicted by whether a calf's mother used them, dolphins may only use social information in some contexts, perhaps for more difficult tactics. This study provides unprecedented support for socially learned foraging tactics in wild dolphins by simultaneously addressing multiple factors during behavioural development, and thus illustrates the benefits of using multivariable techniques on ontogenetic data to identify social learning in wild animals.

AB Progesterone has a ubiquitous role in reproduction and fitness and may influence cognitive performance. We examined the effects of administration of progesterone (a regimen that facilitates sexual behaviour) on consolidation of complex information in Long-Evans rats, Rattus norvegicus, that may be relevant for social engagement. We also examined the effects of subcutaneous progesterone administration (4 mg/kg versus oil vehicle placebo) on memory of ovariectomized rats during various cognitive tasks. Ovariectomized rats that received progesterone, versus the vehicle, immediately post-training were better able to find a hidden platform in the water maze. In a recognition task, rats that received progesterone spent more time in the novel arm of the Y-maze task than rats that received the vehicle. Ovariectomized rats that received progesterone immediately after training spent significantly more time exploring a novel object (compared to a familiar object) than did vehicle-administered rats. When socially relevant stimuli (i.e. objects with the scent of familiar or novel conspecifics) were used in the social cognition task, ovariectomized rats that received progesterone spent more time exploring the object with the novel conspecifics' scent than did vehicle-administered rats. Pairing of progesterone, but not the vehicle, conditioned a place preference to the originally nonpreferred side of the conditioning chamber. We found no significant differences in motor activity measures in these tasks due to progesterone treatment. These results suggest that progesterone's effects to improve cognitive processes with nonsocial and socially relevant stimuli, as well as have reinforcing effects, may underlie some of its salient effects on reproduction-related behaviours.

AB We analysed 38 years of data on 46 lion prides in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, and found that territorial competition directly affected critical components of female fitness and that larger prides gained and maintained access to the highest-quality habitat. Neighbours had a significant negative effect on female reproductive success and survival, and larger prides were significantly more likely to maintain control of disputed areas and to improve the quality of their territories. Adult females were significantly less likely to be alone when a pride had more neighbours, suggesting sensitivity to risk of encounter. In most cases, the effects of intergroup territorial competition were associated only with prides that had not recently split (i.e. that were not closely related). Overall, males were more important in group-territorial competition than expected, and female mortality and wounding rates were significantly associated with male neighbours, suggesting that males may use lethal aggression to tip the balance of power in favour of their prides. Within the Felidae, only lions are consistently gregarious, and our research illustrates that numerical advantage in territorial competition is a primary benefit of group living in lions and may have been important in the evolution of lion sociality.

AB Theory for the evolution of social interactions based on continuous strategies often assumes for simplicity that expressed behaviours are independent of previous encounters. In reality, however, such dependencies are likely to be widespread and often strong, generating complex behavioural dynamics. To model this process and illustrate potential consequences for the evolution of behavioural interactions, we consider the behavioural dynamics of the interaction between caring parents and their demanding offspring, a prime example of long series of interdependent and highly dynamic interactions. These dynamics can be modelled using functions describing mechanisms for how parents and their offspring respond to each other in the interaction. We establish the general conditions under which the behavioural dynamics converge towards a proximate equilibrium and refer to such converging interactions as behaviourally stable strategies (BSSs). We further demonstrate that there is scope for behavioural instability under realistic conditions; that is, whenever parents and/or offspring 'overreact' beyond some threshold. By applying the derived condition for behavioural stability to evolutionary models of parent-offspring conflict resolution, we show by numerical simulations that evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) of current models are not necessarily behaviourally stable. Because behavioural instability implies that expressed levels of behaviours deviate from the ESS, behavioural stability is required for strict evolutionary stability in repeated behavioural interactions.

AB It is not well understood how primates combine olfactory and visual cues in their natural behaviour, especially during feeding. In this study we conducted field observations of a group of wild, frugivorous black-handed spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi (Platyrrhini), consisting of both dichromats (N = 11) and trichromats (N = 9) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. We focused on the fruit foraging behaviour, for which involvement of vision has been well studied. We examined how often the monkeys inspected fruits by sniffing them during their fruit feeding attempts (i.e. sniffing index). We found that both dichromats and trichromats sniffed the visually cryptic fruit species more often than the conspicuous species, with the sniffing index being negatively correlated with the luminance and blue-yellow contrasts of fruits to background leaves. Furthermore, the sniffing index was negatively correlated with the proportion of fruits eaten (versus rejected) following a foraging attempt in both dichromats and trichromats. These results suggest that monkeys use olfaction for discrimination between edible and inedible fruits when vision alone is insufficient to evaluate the quality of fruits, showing the first documentation of interplay between vision and olfaction in primate feeding behaviour under natural conditions.

AB The proximate controls of a behaviour in extant species can inform us about the evolutionary route towards that behavioural phenotype. In social insects, different behavioural phenotypes often correlate with divergent hormone levels, and, in honeybees (Apis mellifera), this insight has lead to the hypothesis that behavioural biases, or division of labour, emerged via co-option of endocrine regulatory systems that paced behavioural change during the reproductive cycle of solitary ancestors. Founding queens of the California harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus show discrete behavioural changes during colony founding, with a dichotomy between nest-biased behaviour and field-biased behaviour. Additionally, a division of labour can develop if queens found nests together, with one queen being nest-biased and another being field-biased. To determine whether behavioural diphenism can be associated with reproductive endocrine regulators in an ant, we measured ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone (JH) content in (1) single-founding queens showing normal behavioural progression and (2) cofounding queens showing a division of labour. We found that ecdysteroid levels did not correlate with behaviour. JH titres, on the other hand, were elevated during the foraging life stage of single-founding queens as well as in the cofounding queens with a behavioural bias towards foraging. Our results suggest that JH affects the propensity for foraging task replication in P. californicus, and provide evidence for a common evolutionary route towards social behaviour in ants and bees.

AB Animals commonly form groups and most sexually dimorphic ungulates form sex-specific groups outside the breeding season. Differences in diet, in vulnerability to predation, and in behaviour between the sexes are hypothesized to drive sexual segregation; however, low-density conditions sometimes favour aggregation. This may occur because larger groups provide greater antipredator benefits that overcome the cost of association between the sexes. In this study we sought to determine whether bighorn rams and ewes (Ovis canadensis) aggregate during winter as an antipredator strategy and whether they alter their behaviour to maintain mixed-sex groups. We compared the occurrence of mixed-sex groups during winter against the population size and sex ratio, and assessed vigilance as an indication of predation risk. We also analysed activity budgets to determine whether group cohesion required departure from sex-specific time budgets. We observed a low proportion of mixed-sex groups in all years of our study except one, in which the population size was very small and the proportion of females was the smallest on record. Mixed-sex groups were larger than single-sex groups, and vigilance was lower in larger groups, indicating that mixed-sex groups provided greater antipredator benefits. However, there was evidence of the oddity effect for older females, which displayed greater vigilance in groups composed primarily of males. Females modified their activity budgets in mixed-sex groups by spending less time foraging and travelling and more time bedding, providing support for the activity budget hypothesis. The costs of mixed-sex group formation limit the circumstances under which aggregation of the sexes is favourable. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal populations are increasingly challenged by anthropogenic environmental changes. Species, populations and individuals vary in their ability to cope with exposure to human proximity. However, little is known about what drives habituation or sensitization in wild populations. Via behavioural observations and heart rate telemetry during experimental disturbance, we determined the habituation potential of yellow-eyed penguins, Megadyptes antipodes, a key species for nature-based tourism in southern New Zealand. Individual birds differed significantly in both their initial stress response and habituation potential. While some birds did not habituate, or even appeared to be sensitized by frequent disturbance, others habituated. Individual variation in habituation potential depended on previous experience with humans, sex and character (i.e. timid, calm or aggressive). Birds that were exposed to research that involved frequent interactions at the nest site, including blood sampling, several years prior to our experiments were less likely to habituate. Overall, females were more flexible than males in their stress response pattern, and calm individuals appeared to adapt more readily than aggressive birds. Character, classified during penguin-researcher interactions at the nest site, was independent of sex, age or previous experience, and was consistent over two seasons. Initial heart rate response to human approach, also similar between seasons, varied with sex and character of an individual. Yellow-eyed penguins may habituate to short and consistent approaches, but appear unsuitable for unregulated tourist visits at nest sites. Individual differences in habituation potential to human disturbance can have fitness consequences and may lead to contemporary evolutionary change in the composition of breeding populations.

AB The aim of the present study was to explore changes in immobility during the forced-swim test (FST) and in the. ring rate of the lateral septal nucleus (LSN) during gestation (G) in the Wistar rat, Rattus norvegicus. In the latter test we also measured changes in plasma progesterone levels. In the FST we considered total time of immobility and also the angle formed by the longitudinal axis of the rat's body and the water surface during immobility. Total time of immobility progressively diminished along gestation at the expense of a decrease in immobility at the 0-30 degrees angle. Immobility at 45 to 90 degrees paralleled body weight gain, but locomotion in the open-field test did not change along gestation. The LSN. ring rate increased progressively from day G1 to day G7, peaking significantly on G14 and decreasing to dioestrus levels by G19 and postpartum. Finally, plasma progesterone peaked significantly on G14 and G19, compared with dioestrus, G1, G7 and postpartum. Because clinically effective antidepressants as well as progesterone reduce immobility in FST and increase. ring rate in the LSN, and both effects were observed during gestation but with different timing, we conclude that the smooth increase in plasma progesterone and the LSN. ring rate peak at G14 may lead to additional changes that allow rats to cope with the stress represented by FST during the second third of gestation and postpartum.

AB Social behaviour is extremely widespread in the animal kingdom and has a heritable component in many species. However, the degree to which social behaviour is phenotypically plastic and influenced by conditions individuals experience during early ontogeny is less well understood. Using the guppy as a model species, we examined the importance of early social environment upon the development of a number of social behaviours. We reared guppies at relatively low and high conspecific densities to investigate how early experience impacted shoaling behaviour and social learning ability in this species. Guppies reared at low densities had a significantly higher shoaling tendency than guppies reared at higher densities. Furthermore, individuals reared at low densities located a food resource more often and quicker than individuals reared at high densities in a foraging maze trial with trained demonstrators. After 8 consecutive days of maze trials we removed the demonstrators to investigate social learning skills. Guppies reared at low densities located food faster alone than guppies reared at high densities, implying that they were more adept at socially learning foraging information. This intriguing relationship between early social environment and the development of shoaling behaviour and social learning skills may have considerable implications for captive breeding programs in conservation and aquaculture.

AB Like many captive animals, hens, Gallus gallus, used for agricultural production perform abnormal behaviours. They are particularly prone to feather pecking, the severest form of which involves the pecking at and removal of feathers, which can cause bleeding and even stimulate cannibalism. The two main hypothesized explanations for feather pecking concern frustrated motivations to forage or, alternatively, to dust-bathe, leading to redirected behaviour in the form of pecks at plumage. Previous work on pigeons has shown that the detailed morphology of pecks involved in drinking and feeding, or in working for food or water, involves motivationally distinct fixed action patterns. We therefore used methods similar to these fixed action pattern studies to quantify the motor patterns involved in foraging and in dustbathing pecks, for comparison to feather pecking. We videoed 60 chickens pecking at a variety of forages and dustbaths, along with novel objects, water and bird models that could be feather pecked. We recorded the durations of the head fixation before the peck, between the head fixation to beak contact with each stimulus and of the whole peck sequence. We used mixed models to assess whether the motivation underlying a peck affected its morphology and whether severe feather pecks resembled or differed from either dustbath or foraging pecks (or even novel-object pecking or drinking). The motor patterns involved in pecks at forages, dustbaths, novel objects and water all varied significantly; importantly, the motor patterns involved in pecking during dustbathing and foraging differed ( P < 0.0001 for all measures). Severe feather pecks proved similar to foraging pecks (NSD: power > 0.95) but different from all other pecks, including dustbathing (P < 0.0001 for all measures). These results indicate that severe feather pecking derives from frustrated motivations to forage, not to dustbathe. More broadly, they suggest that finely analysing fixed action pattern morphology can help elucidate the motivational bases of puzzling abnormal behaviours in captive animals.

AB Most cricket species have two types of acoustic signals used in mating: the calling song, which attracts females from a distance, and the courtship song, which is given only when a female has come in contact with a male. We propose that the calling song is used mainly for species recognition, while the courtship song may contain information about an individual male's quality. Calling song is therefore expected to be more stereotyped and less variable than courtship song. A comparison of coefficients of variation in the two types of song in Teleogryllus oceanicus supported this prediction, with five of eight song elements significantly more variable in courtship than in calling song. The remaining song elements did not differ in variability between courtship and calling song. The difference did not depend on the response of the female being courted, as similar results were obtained when males courted dead females.

AB The use of a moon compass in the sandhopper, Talitrus saltator, is well known, but the mechanism that allows compensation for the changes in moon position during single nights and from night to night is still poorly understood. In a moon phase shift experiment, we exposed sandhoppers to a dim nocturnal light simulating the moon. The false moon was kept in phase with the true moon for controls and gradually shifted for experimental animals so that, at the time of the test, the false moon calendar was set up to coincide with the first quarter for one experimental group and with the last quarter for the other. During the test under the full moon, the experimental groups behaved as expected on the basis of the moon phase shift, whereas controls showed an intermediate orientation. In a daily clock shift experiment, the sandhoppers were subjected to an artificial light: dark treatment, which was coincident with the natural 24 h light: dark cycle for controls, but was slow or fast shifted by 3 h for the experimental groups. When tested under the full moon, the slow- and fast-shifted experimental groups oriented in a direction that was appropriate to the position of the moon some hours later and before the test, respectively. We conclude that the sun and moon compasses are not ruled by independent rhythms and propose that three interacting rhythms (a circadian, a circalunidian and a circalunar one) are involved in the functioning of the moon compass.

AB In socially monogamous species with a resource-based mating system, mate choice and territory choice cannot easily be separated. We studied the occurrence and consequences of postbreeding dispersal and divorce in a population of blue tits breeding in nestboxes. Dispersal was defined relative to the spatial position of territories estimated as Dirichlet tiles. Although more than 80% of males and females changed nestbox between breeding seasons, only 3% of males and 25% of females moved to a new territory. Settlement following postbreeding dispersal was driven by habitat quality: dispersing females ended up in territories with higher clutch size expectancy. Dispersed females (both widowed and divorced) reared more fledglings than resident ones, suggesting that dispersal is adaptive. Our results suggest that even at relatively small spatial scales and in continuous habitats, postbreeding dispersal may be driven by habitat quality gradients. Across all years, 53% of surviving pairs divorced. We assessed the effects of mate change independently of territory quality, by restricting analyses to resident individuals that, after divorce, shared a part of their former territory or settled in its close vicinity. Reproductive success increased for males after divorce, but decreased for females. It did not change for reunited pairs in subsequent seasons. Paternity loss or gain through extrapair copulations, and hence overall siring success, did not differ between divorced and reunited males, either before divorce or pair re-formation, or in the year after. After divorce, males but not females paired with larger, presumably higher-quality partners. The results support the better option hypothesis and suggest that males, but not females, may benefit from divorce. However, our results are also compatible with the alternative hypothesis that divorce is driven by female-female competition, whereby a dominant female evicts the former mate.

AB After about 50 years of research on fluctuating asymmetry ( FA) as a reliable indicator of both individual quality and environmental stress, the enthusiasm is beginning to decline. The findings of many studies are inconsistent and the relationship between FA and stress appears both weaker and more complex than first thought. To provide clarification of the debate, new studies should use more efficient and unified statistical protocols, large sample sizes and joint analysis of several related traits. In addition, fitness-FA associations should be tested at the individual level, in different populations and under different environmental conditions. To achieve these criteria, we describe a 9-year study in which we measured six antler traits of 3 000 Iberian red deer, Cervus elaphus hispanicus, from three study areas in southwest Spain. Males were harvested during hunting activities and measured, weighed and aged post mortem. We found evidence of correlations between traits in FA, an association between asymmetry and stress conditions and a weak but significant negative relationship between FA and fitness surrogates (body mass and antler size), thus supporting some assumptions of the FA hypothesis. As also predicted by theory, antler traits of less functional importance were more asymmetric and more sensitive to stress than those directly used in fighting behaviour. The relationship between age and antler asymmetry was U-shaped, suggesting an effect of sexual selection on antler development in favour of larger and more symmetrical antlers during prime age.

AB Maternal care is the most significant measure of successful adaptation among female mammals. Understanding the predictors of individual differences in offspring care is a major objective of mammalian reproductive biology. Recent studies suggest that differences in caregiving motivation may be associated with variation in glucocorticoid (GC) hormones in new mothers. Despite these intriguing reports, questions remain about the stability of this association during a period of rapid change in both behaviour and physiology, about whether this relationship is dependent on other nonhormonal variables and about the generality of this pattern across species and in wild populations. Glucocorticoids modulate animals' responses to ongoing stressors and may also prepare animals for predictable future challenges. We evaluated evidence for both actions of GCs on maternal responsiveness towards infant cries during the first 2 months of infancy in 34 wild baboon mother-infant dyads in Amboseli, Kenya. We found that stable individual differences in faecal GCs during late pregnancy predicted stable individual differences in maternal responsiveness after birth, even after controlling for maternal rank and parity, and infant sex and distress rate. This study is among the first to provide evidence of preparative actions of GCs in wild animals and to show stability of behavioural and hormonal traits during a period of rapid changes in both hormones and behaviour. Because elevations in GCs during late pregnancy are probably primarily of fetal rather than maternal origin, our results raise the intriguing possibility that parent-offspring conflict may underlie the preparative actions of GCs on maternal responsiveness to infant distress.

AB Cues received from mothers may have important effects on early development in mammals. We examined the behavioural development of genetically wild-type mice, Mus musculus, offspring born to wild-type or mutant Peg3(+/-) (paternally expressed gene 3) mothers who are impaired in various aspects of maternal care during both the pre- and the postnatal periods. We demonstrate that impaired maternal care leads to offspring exhibiting increased neophobia and decreased exploratory behaviour. However, these effects were limited to female offspring only, with male offspring being indistinguishable from wild types in both the open-field and the novel object tests. Due to the breeding design of this study we were able to show that this was due not to the inheritance of a genetic mutation but to an epigenetic inheritance. Consistent with this, we also observed a nongenomic inheritance of impairments in maternal care. Wild-type daughters born to mutant mothers were impaired in their ability to retrieve pups to a nest in a retrieval test. Furthermore, the reduced exploration and neophobic phenotypes were transmitted to a third generation, with the granddaughters of mutant females exhibiting increased neophobia even though they had genetically wild-type mothers. We therefore demonstrate a nongenomic transmission of behavioural traits across successive generations operating via the matriline.

AB Females are often considered responsible for hybridization between two species because usually they are the choosier sex and their cooperation is needed for successful copulation. However, males can also be responsible for hybridization, for example in species in which males are able to force copulation. We studied the pattern of hybridization in two congeneric damselfy species, Calopteryx splendens and Calopteryx virgo, and provide evidence that F-1 hybrids between the two damselfly species occur in the wild. According to mitochondrial DNA analysis, hybridization is reciprocal: five of seven hybrids were sired by C. splendens and two by C. virgo males. We conducted an experiment that revealed that males of both species have surprisingly poor premating reproductive isolation in that they accept heterospecific females, but C. splendens males were less discriminating against con- and heterospecific females than were C. virgo males. Moreover, our data on the number of hybrids sired by either species in the wild are congruent with the results of the discrimination experiment, supporting the conclusion that males may be responsible for the hybridization. Our results suggest that the males' role in hybridization studies should no longer be neglected. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The audience effect has been shown in numerous group-living vertebrates but whether it is present in facultatively social species is unknown. We investigated the antipredator responses of the yellow mongoose, a mammal that dens in groups but primarily forages alone. To examine the effect that the social environment has on their communication, we performed a combination of field observations and experiments with live and model predators on a habituated population of mongooses. Social context affected both the communicative and the flight behaviour of yellow mongooses. Alarm vocalizations were used almost exclusively when individuals were in a group rather than solitary. The visual alarm signal, a raised tail, was predominantly used by solitary individuals when predators were outside attack range. This study apparently is the first to show an audience effect in a facultatively social mammal, suggesting that even rare social interactions lead to the ability to respond flexibly to predators depending on the presence or absence of conspecifics.

AB Exposure to aggressive or courtship displays of conspecifics has been shown to alter the physiology and behaviour of observers. However, these effects are dependent on the information content of signals. Separate courtship signals that convey redundant information may be expected to have similar effects on female reproductive physiology or behaviour, while those that contain nonredundant information are expected to have differing effects. Using a mechanized model lizard painted to resemble a male sagebrush lizard, Sceloporus graciosus, we presented female sagebrush lizards with either a stationary model or one of two male display types: push-ups, a signal used in both aggressive and courtship displays, and shudders, a display used exclusively during courtship. Females exposed to push-ups showed more rejection behaviour when later paired with a live male lizard and produced less femoral pore secretions on the first day of stimulus presentation than females exposed to shudders. However, females exposed to either display were found in closer proximity to the live male than females exposed to the stationary model. These results suggest that both components of the courtship display (push-ups and shudders) cause lasting but distinctive changes in female behaviour, supporting a 'multiple messages' scenario for the evolution of the two signals.

AB Reciprocal altruism has been proposed as a possible mechanism for the evolution of cooperative behaviour. However, very few investigations have tested predictions of reciprocity in wild animal populations. In the current investigation we simulated defection during predator inspection in a wild population of guppies, Poecilia reticulata. Two experiments were run: the first simulating defection during a single exposure to a predator and the second during multiple exposures to a predator. We then compared subsequent social and cooperative interactions with those observed prior to the treatments. From theory and previous experiments on cooperation and reciprocity, we predicted that defection would result in a reduction in social and cooperative interactions during subsequent predator inspections. However, our experiments did not find any effect of simulated defection(s) on the subsequent social structure, or on patterns of predator inspection behaviour. We discuss the potential reasons for the observed results and suggest future directions for research to address mechanisms underpinning the nature of cooperative interactions during predator inspection. 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Both theoretical and empirical studies of vigilance assume that the duration of scanning bouts or head-down bouts of searching for food represents adaptations to predation risk. We found no differences in chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs, peck rates or vigilance patterns (number of scans per unit time, duration of head-up scans and duration of head-down periods) before and after exposure to four models: a ground predator (domestic cat), a control ground object (plastic box), an aerial predator (sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus) and a control aerial model (wood pigeon, Columba palumbus). However, chaffinches increased their rate of head turning after seeing a cat compared to other models. Our results suggest that vigilance is more than simply a pattern of head-up and head-down movements, but that different head movements when vigilant might optimize detection or monitoring of different types of predator and that predation risk can be inferred by vigilance type (e.g. head turning) and not just duration. These results imply that different head movements in birds may be important in predator detection and recognition. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male Columbian ground squirrels, Spermophilus columbianus, give a repetitive vocalization after copulation. This 'mating call' sounds similar to certain alarm calls that are given during attacks by terrestrial predators. During 2005-2006, we investigated (1) the acoustic structure and similarity of mating calls and alarm calls; (2) the environmental context when mating calls occur; (3) whether males that are likely to benefit from mate guarding (viz., males that have sperm precedence because they are the first to copulate in a female's series of matings) give mating calls to guard oestrous females; and (4) whether mating calls advertise the caller to females that have not yet mated. Our approach was to observe mating behaviour in the field and quantify reactions of squirrels to mating calls and alarm calls, both in and out of their normal context, with playback experiments. Males that were the first to copulate with an oestrous female called during mate guarding, and guarded females experienced delays before subsequent copulations. Although sound characteristics of mating calls and alarm calls did not differ, squirrels became vigilant and sought protection upon hearing alarm calls, but continued feeding during mating calls. However, when we played recorded mating calls to squirrels after breeding season, they usually reacted as if an alarm call had been given. We conclude that (1) the male mating call is an intrasexual or intersexual signal that announces postcopulatory mate guarding, and (2) contextual information is important for assessing the message of mating calls.

AB Sibling and parente-offspring conflicts arise mainly over the amount and distribution of parental care, especially food. In altricial bird species where the young depend on parents for obtaining food, parents may control sibling competition by the choice of their respective provisioning locations. In great tits, the parents use fixed provisioning positions on the nest rim that are determined early in the breeding cycle and maintained until. edging. The two parents may choose positions that are close to each other, or far apart, and thereby increase or relax the pressure for optimal feeding positioning among nestlings. As an inspiration to this study we previously found that the two parents provide food from closer positions if the nest is infested by ectoparasites. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the parental choice of relative provisioning locations could be strategically used to control nestling competition. We forced parents to feed from either one or two provisioning locations and assessed the induced change in nestling movement, weight gain, and food distribution among siblings. We show that the angular distance between male and female locations influences the level of behavioural competition and affects nestling weight gain and food distribution. It is the first evidence for hole-nesting birds, where it was assumed that the nestling closest to the entrance hole was fed first, that the apparent choice of feeding positions by parents could be a way of controlling sibling competition and thereby also taking partial control over the outcome of parente-offspring conflict.

AB Many antipredator adaptations are induced by the prey's ability to recognize chemical cues from predators and to act according to the threat level posed by that predator. However, predator recognition often requires learning by prey individuals. We tested the ability of Iberian green frog, Rana perezi, tadpoles to assess the magnitude of predation risk and adjust their behaviour by using perceived cues from a predatory snake, when this stimulus was found alone or associated with chemical alarm cues from conspecific tadpoles. Tadpoles exposed to alarm cues and the predatory snake scent together reduced their movement rates to a greater extent than when the snake scent was found alone, and reduced movement even more in the subsequent exposure to the predator snake scent alone. We also tested whether tadpoles were able to associate novel chemical cues ( i. e. from an exotic nonpredatory fish) with predation risk after a simultaneous exposure with conspecific alarm cues. Tadpoles exposed to nonpredatory fish cues and alarm cues together reduced their activity levels, and reduced activity in the subsequent exposure to the fish cue alone, in a similar way as they reduced movement in the presence of predatory snake cues. Therefore, tadpoles learnt to perceive the fish cues as risky when these were previously associated with alarm cues. Predator recognition learning ability may be particularly advantageous for organisms whose environment may have a wide range of types of predators, even new exotic introduced species of predators that can affect the survival of prey.

AB Predation plays a key role in shaping mammalian communities through prey killed and through the decisions and choices of both predators and prey. We used an extensive data set from observed hunts of a diurnal large African carnivore, the cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, in combination with analysis techniques originally developed in the field of economics (discrete choice models) to examine predation decisions within the context of the immediate environment and the reproductive and hunger status of individuals. This is one of the first attempts at an integrated understanding of the suite of ecological and behavioural factors that influence hunting decisions in a large carnivore. The decision of a cheetah to hunt or not was influenced by the abundance of their main prey, the reproductive status of the cheetah and the presence of competitors and predators, but not by the hunger level of the cheetah. Given that the decision to hunt is taken, prey choice is then driven by the time of year, the sex of the predator, the abundance of prey and the presence of competitors. We believe that discrete choice models may provide a new step forward in our ability to understand the decisions that animals make in their natural environment.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID TRUNCATUS; FIREFLIES; PATTERNS; WHALES; SP.
AB Here we report that synchronous surfacing in male bottlenose dolphins is associated with alliance membership and that synchrony between members of cooperating alliances is more common during social behaviour than during nonsocial behaviour, especially during bouts of 'intense' social behaviour (e.g. mounting, displays, chasing) with female consorts. Alliances of three males varied in the degree to which all members participated in synchrony, possibly reflecting differences in alliance unity and the extent to which alliances consort with females. The lack of a discontinuity between the elaborate displays that males perform around females and the synchronous surfacing of alliance members reported here suggest that synchrony is an adaptive signal. If so, we have a remarkable convergence in the use of synchrony as an alliance signal in humans and bottlenose dolphins. However, whether an adaptive signal or a correlate of proximity, synchrony will be a useful tool in the study of delphinid social relationships.

AB New Caledonian crows, Corvus moneduloides, are the most advanced avian tool makers and tool users. We previously reported that captive-bred isolated New Caledonian crows spontaneously use twig tools and cut tools out of Pandanus spp. tree leaves, an activity possibly under cultural influence in the wild. However, what aspects of these behaviours are inherited and how they interact with individual and social experience remained unknown. To examine the interaction between inherited traits, individual learning and social transmission, we observed the ontogeny of twig tool use in hand-reared juveniles. Successful food retrieval was preceded by stereotyped object manipulation action patterns that resembled components of the mature behaviour, demonstrating that tool-oriented behaviours in this species are an evolved specialization. However, there was also an effect of social learning: juveniles that had received demonstrations of twig tool use by their human foster parent showed higher levels of handling and insertion of twigs than did their naive counterparts; a choice experiment showed that they preferred to handle objects that they had seen being manipulated by their human foster parent. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that individual learning, cultural transmission and creative problem solving all contribute to the acquisition of the tool-oriented behaviours in the wild, but inherited species-typical action patterns have a greater role than has been recognized.

AB Sexually selected traits have been intensively studied in the recent past, but there is comparatively little information about the signalling value of the extended phenotype, despite its unique potential in mate choice and intersexual competition. Individuals manipulating their environment to create a nonbodily ornament may reveal their immediate quality more reliably than by using conventional signals. Nonbodily ornaments may also integrate a bearer's behaviour over a recent interval, which would save the potential receiver repeated or prolonged sampling of the signaller's behaviour. We investigated factors involved in the production of a nonbodily ornament and assessed its potential as a signal in the reproductive context. The crater-building behaviour of the Lake Tanganyika cichlid Cyathopharynx furcifer was observed and manipulated in the field and laboratory. Craters were maintained for prolonged Periods, and crater size correlated with male body size, building behaviour and crater location in the lek. Larger craters had a higher 'neatness index', and this index correlated negatively with a male condition factor. Behaviour of cichlids after a storm and our manipulations of crater size showed that crater size is a repeatable, individual character; destroyed craters were rebuilt to their original sizes roughly within I day and both, experimentally enlarged and diminished craters were immediately reconstructed to their original sizes. We conclude that mating craters are an individually characteristic, extended phenotype of the building males and potentially a suitable signal for conspecifics, providing information about the owner's size, capability and condition.

AB The acoustic signals of insects are examples of sexually selected traits predominantly used by females to identify, locate and choose between potential mates. In addition to the conspicuous calling songs found in many groups, many male Orthopterans also produce a distinct courtship song when in close proximity to a female. It has been suggested that these courtship songs are indicators of male quality and may be used by females to discriminate between potential mates, but little evidence is available. We measured temporal characteristics of courtship song in the cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus and three different aspects of the immune response of the same males. The relations between courtship song structure and immunity appeared to be too weak to be biologically important and hence it seems unlikely that females could use only the song parameters we measured to discriminate in favour of mates with higher immunity. However, when we compared the propensity of males to sing and the structure of their courtship songs before and after they were forced to mount an immune response, we found strong effects of our immune challenge procedure. When females were played songs manipulated to sound like those produced by males with high or low encapsulation abilities (a measure of immunity), they responded more rapidly to the songs corresponding to a high immune response.

AB Southern elephant seals are highly gregarious during the breeding season, and both sexes show fidelity to the colony. We used microsatellite DNA analysis to assess kinship among seals in the main colony on the Falkland Islands. Specifically, we investigated whether females tend to cluster with close kin and avoid mating with male kin. We also tested expectations for kinship patterns based on sex differences in site fidelity and philopatry. Relatedness within a harem was significantly greater than between harems for only two of seven harems and was not related to harem size. Some long-term associations of female kin were found within harems, including associations of up to 5 years, but kinship among these females was not significantly higher on average than among dyads of other returning females. There was no pattern suggesting that females tended to choose harems with harem holders that were either more or less related to them than alternative harem holders. Overall, pairwise comparisons of females showed significantly greater kinship than pairwise comparisons of males, consistent with previous studies suggesting greater male dispersal.

However, countersinging interactions between females and duetting birds have received considerably less attention. We compared patterns of song type matching in male and female eastern whipbirds, Psophodes olivaceus, using playback experiments to simulate intrusion by solo singing and duetting intruders. Eastern whipbirds sing a repertoire of sex-specific solo song types, which they combine nonrandomly to form specific duet types, initiated exclusively by the male. During playbacks, individuals could sing either a song type that matched the song type of a same-sex rival or one that fitted the song type of their partner. We found markedly different patterns of song type matching between the sexes. Both male and female eastern whipbirds matched the songs of same-sex intruders during solo singing song duels. However, when forming a duet, females selected a song type that fitted the song of their partner in preference to matching the song type of a female rival, whereas males preferentially matched a rival. We suggest that these sex differences in song type matching behaviour are the result of different strategies of mate and territory defence. Rather than being a purely cooperative signal, duets may be the result of sexual conflicts, with females forced to defend their position within the partnership, either by showing commitment to their partner or by deterring female rivals through display of their pair bond status.

   BEHAVIOR
AB Asynchronous hatching is believed to result from incubation starting before laying is completed and leads to a hierarchy in chick size, with detrimental effects on the small, last-hatching chick. If chicks have some control over the timing of hatching, however, they might be able to compensate at least partly for the hatching spread. In this study on lesser black-backed gulls, Larus fuscus, we examined whether the timing of hatching varied with laying order. To separate their effects, we manipulated the hatching order relative to the laying order within broods of three chicks. We exchanged eggs between nests, so that chicks from first-laid eggs hatched last, and chicks from last-laid eggs hatched first. When hatching last, chicks from last-laid eggs took significantly less time to hatch than chicks from first-laid eggs. However, hatching duration did not differ between chicks from first- and last-laid eggs when hatching first. Hence, only offspring from last-laid eggs had the ability to accelerate hatching, and they did this only when their siblings had already hatched. Accelerated hatching might benefit the last-laid offspring by reducing hatching intervals, but it also resulted in low hatchling mass. As this ability to accelerate hatching was not found in first-laid offspring, differences in intrinsic egg quality may be responsible for hatching duration. Differences in egg quality, however, arise from differential allocation of resources across the laying sequence by the parent and may hence suggest a parental strategy to alleviate the detrimental effects of within-brood hierarchies on the last-hatching chick.

AB Sexual selection predicts that males should signal their viability and health and this is often achieved with elaborate ornaments. However, females' phenotypic and genotypic quality may also be related to ornamental expression. We investigated the association between a female ornamental trait (white wing plumage) and female quality in the common eider, Somateria mollissima. Only females incubate and care for young, so male parental effort did not influence the females' condition, and the ornament is expressed only in females, so it is not a neutral correlated response to selection of the same ornament in males. We recorded the expression of this ornament in relation to the number of eggs laid and to mass loss and immunological status during incubation. Females that experienced a large mass loss and/or a reduction in immune cell levels (immunosuppression) had less white in the new wing bands produced after breeding. These results are the first to show a correlation between tolerance of reproductive costs and the expression of a strictly female ornament in a species with conventional sex roles.

AB Variation in male reproductive performance and success was studied over 2 years in a population of individually marked European treefrogs, Hyla arborea, a hylid frog with prolonged breeding season and a lek mating system. Reproductive success in males was not related to body size, age or growth rate, and there was no evidence for size- or age-assortative mating. Male mating success was significantly correlated with chorus attendance, that is, the number of nights spent calling at the breeding site. There were no significant differences with regard to body size, age or growth rate between males surviving to the next breeding season and those not surviving. However, surviving males showed a significantly higher chorus attendance than nonsurviving males, which is a novel finding for lekking anurans. Furthermore, males that survived from the previous breeding season spent significantly more nights calling at the breeding site than males that were observed for the first time. Since calling in frogs is costly, these results suggest that chorus attendance reflects male quality. The distribution of male mating success did not differ from a Poisson distribution, indicating a random mating pattern. Since male quality is related to chorus attendance, females that mate randomly are likely to mate with high-quality males and thereby gain indirect genetic benefits without incurring costs of extended mate searching and mate assessment. We suggest that a similar mating pattern is found in many lek-breeding hylid frogs in which male mating success is mainly determined by chorus attendance.

AB Social recognition is important for the formation and maintenance of dominance hierarchies that are based on conspecific assessment. Pigs are assumed to recognize individuals because they react aggressively towards unfamiliar conspecifics, but we know little about the extent of their discriminatory abilities or the influential variables. We investigated the ability of 6-week-old female pigs to discriminate between pairs of female conspecifics in a Y-maze. Members of the pair were either unrelated or littermates and were either familiar or unfamiliar to the test pig. Olfactory, auditory and visual cues from both stimulus pigs were available to the test pig. We rewarded approaches to a predetermined correct stimulus pig with food in a series of sessions, each of 10 consecutive trials. Stimulus pigs also received a food reward to avert frustration. Each pig completed 6-12 sessions. At least one-third of the pigs successfully discriminated between stimulus pigs in each of three consecutive sessions, showing rapid task acquisition. Our findings indicate that pigs' ability to discriminate conspecifics is not reliant on familiarity or differences in familiarity. Furthermore, closely related animals are distinguishable. We also found a significant effect of reward procedure on learning. Test subjects learned faster when stimulus pigs were rewarded after each correct choice (i.e. at the same time as the test pig) than when the stimuli were rewarded after each incorrect choice, indicating subtle effects of experimental procedure on subject performance and live stimulus behaviour.

AB The ability to recognize a conspecific signal is essential to communication. In addition to recognizing the type of call, receivers extract a range of information from the signal about the producer, including identity, sex and dialect. Despite the apparent ease with which this is accomplished, few available data address the computational processes underlying recognition. While it is possible that recognition of the signal and its information content Occur in a single stage of processing, different components of the signal may be processed separately. Here we present a series of experiments designed to examine this issue in the cottontop tamarin, Saguinus oedipus. Using the tamarins' natural vocal response to hearing their species-specific combination long call (CLC), antiphonal calling, we presented tamarins with manipulated and unmanipulated CLCs and measured both the number of antiphonal responses' and the latency to produce an antiphonal call. Results indicated that recognition of the call type and recognition of the caller occur in separate computational stages of signal processing. These data provide insights into how sensory information is organized by a call recognition system. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID ACOUSTIC RECOGNITION; DELPHINIDAE; SARASOTA
AB Prior work on the signature whistles of bottlenose dolphins has focused on captive or temporarily restrained wild dolphins. Here we examine whistle production by free-ranging adult bottlenose dolphins. Whistles were recorded from each of 13 dolphins while they were restrained and free-swimming. Eleven of the 13 animals produced whistles while free-swimming that matched whistles produced while restrained. On average, 51% of the whistles an animal produced while free-swimming. matched whistles recorded while that animal was gently restrained. Of those free-swimming whistles that matched restrained whistles, 76% matched signature whistles. A further analysis was conducted to determine the social contexts in which free-swimming dolphins produced signature whistles. An adult, allied male was most likely to produce signature whistles when voluntarily separated from his partner, and least likely to when together with his partner. These results suggest that wild bottlenose dolphins use signature whistles as contact calls, similar to captive dolphins. The majority of whistles produced by a pair of allied males in a consortship with a female were variant whistles. A final analysis showed that signature whistles appear individually distinctive, consistent with their use as contact calls, while variant whistles do not.

AB In chacma baboons, Papio hamadryas ursinus, young adult males often rise to the top of the dominance hierarchy shortly after immigrating to a new group. Such events are potentially disruptive for pregnant and lactating females because high-ranking immigrant males often commit infanticide. In this preliminary study, we assessed the effects of upheavals in the male hierarchy on the physiology of 18 females in a baboon group living in the Moremi Game Reserve, Botswana. We collected behavioural and hormonal data to examine the effects of two separate events, a natal male take-over and an immigrant male take-over, on female faecal glucocorticoids (fGC). While few females had elevated fGC concentrations in response to the natal male take-over, following the immigrant male take-over there was a significant rise in fGCs, but only among lactating and pregnant females. Analysis of behavioural data indicated that elevated fGC concentrations were unrelated to male aggression towards females, female-female aggression, or rates of female-female grooming. Furthermore, lactating females with a male 'friend' during the immigrant male take-over period had a less marked increase in fGCs and lower fGC concentrations overall than females without a male friend. Taken together, these results suggest that male social instability itself does not necessarily elicit a stress response from females. Rather, it is the specific male that rises to the alpha position that prompts a stress response, and only from the females at risk for infanticide. Finally, females with a male friend may perceive themselves to be at a reduced risk of infanticide. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Honeybee workers (foragers) are risk averse to variability in volume of reward when measured by conditioning of the proboscis extension response, and the level of risk aversion depends on the coefficient of variation of the variable distribution. Since drones do not forage on flowers, they may not have been under selection for risk-sensitive choice behaviour. We compared risk sensitivity of workers and drones and their ability to discriminate between the reward volumes used in the risk sensitivity experiments. Both castes discriminated better between 0 and 0.4 mu l than between 0.4 and 1.2 mu l, consistent with Weber's law of relative discrimination. Workers discriminated between both volume pairs better than drones, and workers showed greater risk aversion than drones. This is the first demonstration of caste-specific differences in risk sensitivity. These differences do not appear to be the result of differences in energy budgets, since both castes were on positive energy budgets. Levels of risk aversion were consistent with the coefficient of variation model. We calculated the relative associative strengths of subjects to the reward volumes from their choice proportions in the discrimination tests. The relative associative strengths of workers were greater than those of drones, and in both castes the relative associative strength of 0.4 mu l relative to 0 mu l was greater than that of 1.2 mu l relative to 0.4 mu l. Owing to Jensen's inequality, the decreasing functions of differences in relative associative strengths could explain differences in degree of risk aversion between the castes. Our findings are consistent with both mechanistic and functional explanations. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bottlenose dolphins possess a sophisticated echolocation system, but evidence suggests that they use this sensory modality sparingly in the wild. Several authors have noted that soniferous fish are prevalent in the diet of bottlenose dolphins, leading to the hypothesis that these predators detect their prey by passive listening. We tested this hypothesis by performing controlled acoustic playback experiments with free-ranging dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida. We used recorded calls of prey fish and sounds of snapping shrimp as experimental and control treatments, respectively, and measured the dolphins' direction of travel and rate of echolocation as response variables. Dolphins changed their direction of travel significantly, turning towards the sound source when fish sounds were played. In addition, dolphins significantly increased their rate of echolocation immediately following playbacks of fish sounds. The sounds of snapping shrimp elicited neither directional nor echolocation responses. The occurrence of echolocation sounds was low, except following playback of fish sounds. We conclude that bottlenose dolphins use passive listening extensively during the search phase of the foraging process. By listening passively, dolphins may obtain useful information on the identity number, size and location of soniferous prey. Once dolphins discover prey by passive means, they then appear to use echolocation to track the prey during the pursuit and capture phases. Such judicious use of echolocation suggests that this sensory modality incurs significant energetic or ecological costs. These findings have implications for coevolution of dolphins and their prey with regard to sound production and detection. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   STRATEGIES; MODELS
AB The foraging behaviour of any animal is intricately linked to ecological constraints. Extrinsic factors, such as daylength, may limit the time available for foraging. Intrinsic factors, such as the coordination of mates at a nest site, may exacerbate this limitation. Using activity loggers, we examined the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic limitations on the foraging behaviour of the sympatric red-footed booby, Sula sida, and brown booby, Sula leucogaster, during incubation, and tested the prediction that individuals would work harder when time available for foraging was limiting. Both species share incubation duties and forage by day. Brown boobies made significantly shorter foraging trips than red-footed boobies, and thus, both parents could forage during the same day. Therefore, departure time and time available for foraging will also be influenced by when the partner returns to the colony. Overall foraging trip duration decreased linearly, with respect to departure time. Our study suggests that the time available for foraging is limited by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic processes in both species. Crucially, the rate of flying and diving, indicators of prey search and pursuit, respectively, increased with decreasing time available for foraging, whereas time spent inactive on the sea surface decreased, as did the time between departure and diving. Our data therefore suggest that boobies adjust their foraging behaviour according to extrinsic constraints. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Inbreeding occurs infrequently in most natural populations, with the level of relatedness between mates potentially being influenced by behavioural mechanisms of mate choice and spatial genetic structure of the population. We studied mate relatedness in a Hawaiian population of great frigatebirds with the expectation, based on frigatebird ecology, that mated pairs were unlikely to be more genetically similar than a random draw of adults from the breeding population. We used a paired analysis to compare the DNA fingerprint similarity of a female and her mate versus the same female and a random male that was breeding elsewhere on the same island. Overall, band-sharing scores between mates were higher than band-sharing scores between nonmates, and the mean coefficient of relatedness between mates was 0.082. Relatedness between mates was not a consequence of strong natal philopatry coupled with random mate choice: historical data revealed several recent between-island shifts in the location of the breeding colony, and the degree of genetic similarity between nonmates was not well predicted by the physical distance between their nest sites on Tern Island. Instead, females may deliberately choose related individuals as mates. Tests for a relationship between the genetic similarity of mates and the size and ectoparasite load of their 1-week-old chick were equivocal. The question of how and why females may be choosing genetically similar mates is unresolved, but it appears to be a consequence of active choice rather than spatial genetic structure or limited availability of unrelated mates.

AB Males with elaborate secondary sexual traits can enhance their mating success both by choosing to display at a site that increases the efficacy of their signal and by displaying at a site where the population is structured to provide inclusive fitness benefits via kin selection. Theoretical models and field studies reveal that, across a range of species and especially those with nonresource-based mating systems, males do display with kin. Bowerbirds use a nonresource-based mating system where males show spatial site fidelity and females visit the sites for the purpose of mate choice. However, neighbours can interfere with bower display by marauding (destroying and decoration stealing). Models suggest that local nonaggression pacts provide the best conditional strategy for males, a situation that may be facilitated by kin-mediated inclusive fitness benefits if males displayed together. We used a novel method of calculating relatedness, based on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), in a population of spotted bowerbirds, Chlamydera maculata, and found no evidence of fine-scale genetic structuring of display sites. Furthermore, males did not display next to kin, but instead an owner's neighbours were those most likely to maraud his bower. Marauders did not discriminate between kin and nonkin as their victims. Such theft and destruction may affect the mating success of the targeted bower owner. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the pattern of song variation in the rufous-collared sparrow, Zonotrichia capensis, in the 1987 and 2000 breeding seasons in a 7-km(2) area covering open and closed habitats. We measured 14 14 quantitative song variables over a total of 390 individuals and found consistent differences between habitats in both years. In particular, songs of individuals from closed habitat sites had trills with longer trill intervals and lower frequencies than those of individuals from open habitats. This pattern of variation is interpreted as a song cline that correlates with the environmental gradient. Although this cline was stable in location and shape, it also showed several differences between years. The songs recorded during 2000 had trills with longer trill intervals and lower minimum frequencies than those recorded during 1987. Thus, this study is the first to directly document temporal changes in song variables in a Z. capensis population. This change would be expected if all the habitats studied were more closed in 2000 than in 1987, but we did not find obvious differences in habitat features between seasons. However, this modification of song structure is compatible with alternative explanations, such as subtle differences in habitat characteristics, changes in climatic variables, a delayed effect of a past modification of the environment and neutrality of the change.

AB We determined individual nest placement patterns for female leatherbacks nesting at Awa:la-Ya:lima:po, French Guiana, by measuring distance from the nest to several landscape features, such as the highest spring tide line (HSTL) and the vegetation line. Distance from the nest to the HSTL differed significantly between females, indicating the existence of individual nesting patterns. There was a significant repeatability of nest site choice relative to the HSTL, indicating that females showed within-individual consistency in their nest placement. Despite individual preferences, there was much within-individual variation and a lack of predictability in the nesting patterns; that is, the locations of subsequent nests could not be predicted based on knowledge of previous nest choices, indicating a certain degree of scatter. The significant repeatability suggests that nest choice behaviour in female leatherbacks is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. We tested sea-finding ability of hatchlings, a potential consequence of nest site choice, in Matapica, Suriname, by using orientation arenas to quantify the strength and direction of travel after emergence. The orientation tests showed that hatchlings were unable to move seaward in vegetated arenas, providing evidence that vegetation acts as a strong selective pressure driving nest placement seaward. It appears that leatherbacks have adopted a regional rather than a local optimum for nest placement patterns, possibly resulting from their weak beach fidelity and the frequent erosion and destruction of their nesting beaches. We discuss the evolutionary and conservation implications for this species in the context of current environmental changes. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Broiler chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, have been selected for rapid weight gain and appear to be continously hungry. If this is so, then energy that broilers invest in obtaining food should be insensitive to their level of feed restriction. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the maximum price (i.e. maximum number of key pecks) broilers with different body weights would pay for a food reward Under conditions of varying feed restriction. Two groups of 20 broilers were fed on 50 or 75% of the amount of feed a broiler would eat when fed ad libitum. Broilers were able to learn an operant task and were willing to work for food. Birds of the 50%-group paid a higher maximum price for a food reward and responded more quickly to food presentation. than the birds of the 75%-group in the first test week and showed a nonsignificant tendency to pay, a higher price and to respond more quickly in the second test week. Different levels of long-term feed restriction had an influence on their body weight and on their motivation to work for food. No short-term effect of changing feed. restriction was found. Birds showed frustration behaviour after the last food reward had been obtained, indicating that they were still hungry. The results indicate that broilers are still sensitive to different levels of feed restriction and that they can balance their investments and profits to a certain extent.

   PATTERNS
AB Extrapair copulations (EPCs) and fertilizations (EPFs) occur in many socially monogamous bird species, including raptors. In this group of species, males invest heavily in reproduction through the feeding of female and young, so the cost of cuckoldry is particularly high. The feeding of females by males, characteristic of most species, conflicts with mate guarding, so raptors are expected to use frequent within-pair copulations (WPCs) for paternity assurance. In this study, I reviewed information on copulation behaviour of diurnal raptors, and used regression analyses and phylogenetic comparative analyses to investigate relations between density, EPC frequency and WPC behaviour. EPCs occurred in most raptor species studied (68%, N = 19), mostly during the presumed fertile period of females. EPC frequency, measured as the percentage of females engaging in EPC but not the percentage of extrapair copulations, was positively related to breeding density. The rate and relative duration of WPCs were also positively related to breeding density, but only WPC rate was positively related to EPC frequency (percentage of females). Frequently copulating species had relatively larger testes, underlying higher sperm production capacities. The results support the hypotheses that sperm competition intensity increases with breeding density, and that male raptors rely on frequent copulations to ensure paternity. Despite the risk, EPFs rarely occurred in raptors, suggesting efficient paternity guards. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SPERM COMPETITION SELECTS; MATE CHOICE; GOOD GENES; OLD-AGE; ORTHOPTERA;
   BENEFITS; INVESTMENT; EVOLUTION; SUCCESS; ORIGIN
AB Female mate choice occurs in many animals, and in some species females prefer older males. Because older males have demonstrated their survival ability, they may be of higher genetic quality, providing genetic benefits to the offspring of their mates. However, in species where females receive direct benefits of matings, younger males maybe more likely to provide more fertile or more nutritious ejaculates, so females may discriminate against older males. Males of the bushcricket Ephippiger ephippiger (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) produce large spermatophores at mating (>30% of body weight, circa 10% protein content). Female E. ephippiger discriminate against the song of older males. We examined the effects of male age and mating history on male reproductive investment (spermatophore size, sperm number, nitrogen content). Males produced spermatophores with significantly fewer sperm and of lower nitrogen content on their fourth mating, despite free access to food and a 1-week interval between matings, indicating that there is a cost of mating to males. There was no indication that older virgin males produced lower-quality spermatophores. Rather, older males produced bigger spermatophores of higher nutritional value and containing more sperm. Male age and mating history seem likely to be strongly correlated in the field. We conclude that female E. ephippiger probably prefer the songs of younger males, because in the field, this preference correlates with male mating history and therefore resources provided at mating. Thus, female preference for younger males could reflect discrimination against low-quality nuptial gifts. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Previous work has shown that blue petrels need olfaction to home. We investigated whether they also recognize an olfactory signature of their own nest. We performed T-maze experiments in which maze arms were connected with the subject bird's burrow and with the burrow of a conspecific neighbour. Of 23 birds, 16 were able to recognize the arm leading to their own burrow. In a second experiment, we positioned the maze in front of the subject's burrow but the maze arms were closed and did not enter the burrow. Consequently, no burrow odours could be sensed by the bird. In this case, 85% of birds (17 of 20) failed to choose, suggesting that petrels were not motivated to choose by positional cues in the absence of odour cues. We explored this idea further by performing a homing experiment whereby homing birds had to relocate an artificially displaced burrow entrance. Blue petrels homed, ignoring the natural burrow entrance and using the new artificial one.

AB Nest repair is a vital element in the cooperative brood care that is a distinctive feature of eusocial animals. We investigated the repair role of individuals of the social aphid Pemphigus spyrothecae by prematurely opening their gall by cutting a hole of the same size and position as a natural opening. This resulted in increased mortality from predation. No subsequent responsive shift towards increased investment in soldiers was detected. However, repair of the holes by compensatory regrowth from undamaged adjoining areas of the gall was observed in 97.5% of the experimental galls that were protected from predation. Subsequent experiments confirmed that the aphids were responsible for this repair, with soldiers likely to be the major agents. Active maintenance of the integrity of the gall represents another altruistic task for which soldiers are predominantly responsible and indicates that social complexity in the order Hemiptera is greater than previously assumed.

AB Conspecific brood parasitism (CBP) is a common reproductive tactic in several animal taxa, especially in precocial birds. It has been suggested that host-parasite relatedness can facilitate the evolution of CBP. A recent model showed that the existence and accuracy of the kin recognition system is crucial for this to occur. I used field data to parameterize the model for the common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula, a precocial species in which CBP frequently occurs and in which a recent finding of nonrandom host-parasite relatedness has been interpreted to support the idea that relatedness and kin selection influence CBP. It turned out that possibilities to detect brood parasitism and accurately discriminate between kin and nonkin parasites are negligible in the species. The empirically parameterized model exercise revealed that relatedness and kin selection are unlikely explanations of CBP in the species. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The parcelling model of reciprocity predicts that grooming partners will alternate between giving and receiving grooming within grooming bouts, and that each partner will perform approximately as much grooming as it receives within each bout ('time matching'). Models of allogrooming based on biological markets theory predict that individuals of lower dominance rank will exchange grooming for tolerance from high-rankers, and therefore an inverse relation will be found between grooming partners' dominance rank distance and how closely they match each other's grooming contributions within each bout. We used weighted logistic regression and weighted least-squares regression to test these predictions using data from female white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus, and bonnet macaques, Macaca radiata. Only 5-7% of macaque grooming bouts, and 12-27% of capuchin grooming bouts, were reciprocated. However, (1) the duration of grooming by the first groomer significantly predicted whether the groomee would reciprocate at all, and (2) when bouts were reciprocated, the duration of grooming by the first groomer significantly predicted the duration of grooming by the second groomer. Grooming was most balanced among females of similar dominance ranks. Both the time-matching and rank-related effects were weak, although significant. These results indicate that although some form of time matching may be a general characteristic of grooming in female-bonded primate species, time matching accounts for relatively little of the variation in the distribution of grooming within bouts. We also draw attention to weighted regression as a technique that avoids pseudoreplication while using all available data. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sperm competition is a strong force on the evolution of mating behaviour of animals, particularly birds. In monogamous birds extrapair behaviour is one main source of variation in the reproductive success of males, which has caused the evolution of paternity guards as well as strategies by females to increase the genetic quality of their descendants. We investigated the importance of sperm competition in the reproductive behaviour of serins, Serinus serinus. Male serins guarded their mates and also copulated frequently, indicating that sperm competition has been an important selective force affecting their mating behaviour. Females were frequently approached and chased by extrapair males that attempted extrapair copulations. However, females refused almost every attempt by extrapair males. No extrapair paternity was detected in the population, in spite of the intense extrapair behaviour of males. This supports the view that females keep strong control over paternity, and that in this population they do not seem to obtain genetic benefits from extrapair copulations. We discuss why the presence of high levels of sexual competition may not be reflected in extrapair paternity. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Social learning of antipredator behaviour in a marsupial
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID ACQUIRED RECOGNITION; TRANSMISSION; LIFE; PIKE
AB Socially acquired predator recognition has been demonstrated in a range of taxa, but there is no experimental evidence for this phenomenon in marsupials. We have previously shown that tammar wallabies, Macropus eugenii, can be individually trained to avoid a model fox, Vulpes vulpes. Here, we examined whether such acquired responses can be socially transmitted to predator-naive companions. Tammars were given training trials in which they observed the response of a demonstrator wallaby that was either fearful of the fox (experimental group), or indifferent to it (control group). Tammars in the experimental group subsequently responded to the fox model with significantly higher vigilance levels than controls. To examine the specificity of this acquired antipredator behaviour, we measured responses to an array of other visual stimuli after training and compared these with the results of identical pretraining tests. There was a small difference between the two groups in responses to a model cat, Felis catus, but not to a model nonpredator (goat, Capra hircus). There were also no differences between experimental and control groups during blank trials, in which no stimulus was presented, showing that the elevated vigilance response to the fox did not simply reflect a general increase in arousal. The effect of training was hence to inculcate a relatively specific response to the fox, with only limited generalization to another predator stimulus. These findings provide the first evidence for social learning in a marsupial and suggest that this group has cognitive characteristics convergent with those of eutherian mammals.

AB Many birds display carotenoid-based ornaments, which are typically considered to be honest indicators of individual health and condition. Experimental work on male red-shouldered widowbirds, Euplectes axillaris, has demonstrated a function of the carotenoid-based epaulettes in male contests and territory acquisition. Using two experiments, we investigated whether the natural variation in this colour signal reveals male competitive ability. Males with larger and redder (more longwave) epaulettes established territories to the exclusion of males with smaller and less red signals, which formed a large population of 'floaters'. In an experiment in which we removed 42 resident males, these floaters rapidly filled up vacant territories. Among removed birds held in captivity, residents strongly dominated floaters in dyadic contests over access to an easily monopolized feeder (i.e. outside the context of territory defence). Only epaulette size predicted the outcome of these male contests. In addition, when competitors were experimentally given similar epaulette signals (removed or painted red to the average population size), the males were involved in more aggressive interactions than during unmanipulated contests, but residents continued to outcompete floaters. On release (after 8 days) to the breeding grounds, most residents (88%) rapidly reclaimed their territories from replacements. Combined, these results suggest that some intrinsic 'resource-holding potential', associated with the variation in epaulette signal, is primarily responsible for residents dominating nonresidents.

ID BUDGERIGARS MELOPSITTACUS-UNDULATUS; AUDITORY-PERCEPTION; DISTANCE

AB In speciation events, species-distinct vocal signals can diverge acoustically in many ways. Signal receivers have to be able to distinguish conspecific from allospecific vocalizations, and the perceptual salience of acoustic features is therefore expected to be an important factor in the evolution of such vocalizations. We tested how dissimilar the species-identifying perch-coos of 12 closely related turtle-dove species (genus Streptopelia) are, as perceived by one of its members, S. roseogrisea. With operant, psychoacoustic methods we trained six doves to respond only to their conspecific coo. Responses to the perch-coos of the 12 other dove species were used as a measure of their perceptual similarity to conspecific perch-coos. Turtle-doves differentiated between the allospecific coos: some were perceived as more similar to their own species' coo than others. With multiple regression analysis we identified three acoustic features that correlated with these differences in perceptual similarity:coo duration, minimum frequency and Wiener entropy. In contrast to findings in other bird species, duration was by far the most important feature in the discrimination between conspecific and allospecific vocalizations for S. roseogrisea. The results suggest that this is due not only to the coos of the various species differing in duration but also to a comparatively high perceptibility of the differences in duration.

AB Time perception is critical to animal behaviours requiring anticipation of future events based on present information about the environment. Most models of animal foraging assume that animals are capable of measuring absolute time despite evidence that animals measure time with predictable biases in mean and variance. We incorporate the evidence for a rate-biased subjective time perception into a classic model of optimal foraging, the marginal value theorem. If acceleration of the clock rate is proportional to food intake rate and time is perceived similarly when in transit between patches as it is while waiting in a patch following eating, organisms are predicted to follow the predictions of the marginal value theorem exactly. However, a nonlinear relationship between clock rate and food intake rate, unequal wait and transit time perception, or any lag in the clock predicts characteristic suboptimal behaviour. We discuss how this mechanism for suboptimal behaviour compares with others in the literature and how it can be recognized in experiments. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Several alternative decision rules have been proposed for how individuals assess and choose options, such as mates and territories. Three of these rules are the threshold rule, where individuals choose the first option that exceeds a preset level of quality, the best-of-n rule, where individuals assess a fixed number of options and then choose the best of those options, and the comparative Bayes rule, where individuals use estimates of options to selectively assess and choose options. It has been previously concluded that the threshold rule produces higher average fitness than the best-of-n rule when assessment costs are not trivial. However, previous comparisons assumed that time and options are infinite, individuals can estimate the distribution of option quality without uncertainty or mistakes, and individuals receive perfect information about the quality of assessed options. I found that the best-of-n rule produces higher average fitness than the threshold rule despite significant assessment costs, when time for choosing an option is limited, when individuals are choosing from a small pool of options, when estimates of the distribution of option quality are error-prone, and when there is uncertainty about the distribution of option quality. I also found that the comparative Bayes rule produces higher average fitness than the threshold and best-of-n rules when time or options are limited and when individuals receive imperfect information about the quality of assessed options. Therefore, the optimality of alternative decision rules depends on more than the size of assessment costs and the previous conclusions of empirical studies that have assumed such need to be re-examined.

A manifestation of cognitive behaviour is tool use and tool manufacture. Fly switching with branches is a type of tool use previously shown in captive Asian elephants to be effective in repelling flies and to vary in frequency with the intensity of flies, In the first part of the present study we report on observations of one juvenile and 33 adult wild elephants comprising 26.7 h of cumulative observations in Nagarhole National Park, Karnataka, India. Eight of these elephants were observed using branches presumably to repel flies. In the second part of the study, conducted also in Nagarhole Park, we presented to 13 captive elephants, maintained under a naturalistic system, branches that were too long or bushy to be effectively used as switches. The long branches were presented in two trials to each elephant and they were given 5 min to either attempt switching with the long branch, or modify the branch and switch with the altered branch. Eight of these elephants modified the branch on at least one trial to a smaller branch and switched with the altered branch. There were different styles of modification of the branches, the most common of which was holding the main stem with the front foot and pulling off a side branch or distal end with the trunk. We propose that fly switching with branches is a common form of tool use in wild Asian elephants when fly intensity is high. Our documentation of the manufacture of a tool by elephants, together with the fact that these animals have a volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing that exceeds that of any primate species, would appear to place this animal in the category of great apes in terms of cognitive abilities for tool use and tool manufacture.

AB Animals living in groups are thought to gain fitness through decreased predation risk, while often paying a cost in terms of increased competition in foraging. Thus, the balance struck between predator avoidance and foraging should be affected by group membership. For animals that avoid predation by withdrawing into a refuge (i.e. 'hiding'), such as the northern rock barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, that balance should be particularly important since predator avoidance excludes foraging altogether. We tested the hypothesis that barnacles living in groups should spend less time hiding when faced with a perceived threat than should solitary barnacles. We presented group-living and solitary barnacles with a simulated threat and measured hiding time with the prediction that barnacles in groups would return to foraging more quickly than solitary barnacles. Hiding time for group-living barnacles was significantly less than for solitary barnacles. We then manipulated barnacle group size with the prediction that an individual barnacle's behaviour would change based on group membership alone. We tested individual barnacles three times in an A-B-A design in which barnacles were tested in one of two sequences, solitary-group-solitary, or group-solitary-group. We found that group membership had a significant effect on barnacle foraging behaviour in that individuals emerged from hiding sooner when tested in a group than when tested alone. We conclude that, as predicted by optimality theory, group membership strongly affects foraging decisions by this refuge-using animal. We argue that the proximate mechanism for such behaviour may involve a simple binary reaction to living in a group. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To assess the potential success of a brood parasite with a novel host, we tested whether three species of African estrildid finches provide foster parental care only to young with normal conspecific appearance and behaviour or also to other young in their nests. One (red-billed firefinch, Lagonosticta senegala) has a mimetic brood parasite in the field, one (goldbreast, Amandava subflava) has a nonmimetic brood parasite and one (blue-capped cordon-bleu, Uraeginthus cyanocephalus) has no brood parasite. All three species sometimes reared nestlings of other species to fledging, and all three reared the brood parasite of the firefinch, the village indigobird, Vidua chalybeata. Finches were more successful in rearing young of their own than young of other species, however, firefinches were as likely to rear young indigobirds as to rear their own young. Nestling mimicry gives young Vidua brood parasites a survival advantage in receiving care from firefinch foster parents. Firefinches were more likely to rear their own young in a mixed-species brood if the other species matched the appearance of their own young. There was no difference in reproductive success between novice and experienced pairs of finches rearing a brood of their own or the other species. Because these nesting species reared alien young, which were vicariant experimental stand-ins of young brood parasites, and these nesting species also reared the young indigobird, we conclude that the nestling appearance and behaviour does not completely prevent the colonization of a new host species by a brood parasite. The experimental results are consistent with molecular genetic estimates of colonization histories of estrildid hosts by Vidua brood parasites.

AB Lactating female chacma baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, maintain close associations, or 'friendships', with particular males that may protect infants from sexually selected infanticide by a newly immigrated alpha male. In a a-year study, we sought evidence of female-female competition for male friends in cases where two mothers maintained friendships with the same male simultaneously. In this context, relative competitive abilities of the rival females influenced social access to the shared male friend: dominant females maintained higher levels of close proximity and allogrooming with the male than their subordinate counterparts. This disparity was greatest when younger dominant females and older subordinate females shared a male friend. This pattern resulted from social displacement: subordinate females experienced a significant decrease in time spent near the male friend immediately after a dominant female began associating with him (but the converse was not true). Changes in time male-female friends spent near one another were due primarily to changes in the behaviour of the females. Females may compete for friends based on male rank and probability of paternity of their current infants. Evidence that lactating females may pursue alternative anti-infanticide strategies besides friendship formation came from two sources. First, subordinate females displaced from a friendship made compensatory changes in their relationships with the potentially infanticidal alpha male: spatial proximity and the rate of contact with him fell significantly in the period immediately following displacement. Second, across the entire sample of friendships, female social behaviour and age were significantly correlated. Compared to younger mothers, older females showed: (1) a smaller relative contribution to maintaining close proximity to the male friend; (2) less close proximity to the male friend; and (3) greater proximity to relatives (this association applied to higher-ranking females). Thus, avoidance of infanticidal threat and protective association with maternal kin may constitute two alternative counterstrategies for some lactating females.

AB Temporary polygyny (the presence of multiple queens) occurs in honeybee colonies when virgin queens (VQs) are reared for reproductive swarming or queen replacement. During these events, workers perform vibration signals on queen cells and emerged queens, and these signals may influence which VQ becomes the new laying queen of a colony. We examined the role of vibration signals during queen competition in two African and six European honeybee colonies. There was pronounced variability in vibration activity between colonies and among queens reared within the same colony. Despite this variation, all colonies showed similar trends in the relationships between the vibration signal and queen replacement. Vibration signals performed on queen cells were not associated with emergence success. Likewise, the signal was not associated with queen emergence order. Early emerging and late-emerging queens were vibrated at similar rates, and there was no clear relationship between emergence order and VQ survival. However, the signals performed on VQs after they emerged were associated with their behaviour and success during the queen elimination period. Emerged VQs that were vibrated at higher rates survived longer, performed more bouts of piping (a characteristic sound produced by queens), eliminated more rivals and were more likely to become the new queens of the colonies. The vibration signal may therefore allow workers a degree of control over the behaviour of emerged VQs, and may influence the outcome of queen competition-in honeybees. Differences in vibration activity within and among colonies may reflect differences in the extent to which workers and queens conflict over the timing and outcome of polygyny reduction.

AB Wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, frequently hunt and share meat. Despite widespread interest and considerable study, continued controversy exists regarding the factors that influence chimpanzee hunting decisions and meat sharing. Three hypotheses invoke the importance of ecological, reproductive and social factors. A nutritional shortfall hypothesis suggests that chimpanzees hunt to compensate for seasonal shortages in food availability. A second hypothesis argues that male chimpanzees hunt to obtain meat that they swap for matings. A third hypothesis proposes that males use meat as a social-tool to develop and maintain alliances with other males. We tested these hypotheses using observations of an unusually large community of chimpanzees at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Results did not support the nutritional shortfall or meat-for-sex hypotheses. The Ngogo chimpanzees hunted primarily during times of food abundance rather than scarcity. The presence of oestrous females did not predict the tendency of chimpanzees to hunt. Furthermore, meat-for-sex exchanges occurred infrequently, and males did not gain a mating advantage through sharing meat. Additional observations were consistent with the male social bonding hypothesis. At Ngogo, male chimpanzees were likely to hunt when accompanied by other males. Males shared meat nonrandomly and reciprocally among themselves, and males exchanged meat for agonistic support. Although several factors are likely to affect chimpanzee hunting decisions and meat sharing, these results indicate that primary causes will not be found through invoking simple energetic or reproductive considerations.

AB We examined the responses of individual crayfish (O. propinquus) to cues associated with predation risk in the laboratory. We presented visual and tactile cues either alone or in combination with conspecific alarm odour. The addition of alarm odour resulted in crayfish responding to a visual cue at a greater distance and with a stronger response in terms of distance retreated. Similarly, the frequency of response and the magnitude of the responses shown to a tactile cue were higher when alarm odour was added, but only at night. During the day, the addition of alarm odour did not affect the responses shown to tactile input. We then presented a dilution series of alarm odour solutions (100, 50, 10 and 1% strength) in combination with the visual stimulus. There were no differences in response parameters with chemical cues of different strength. We discuss the response patterns observed with regard to the ecology of O. propinguus compared with related species of crayfish. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Prey that spend a large proportion of their time foraging must trade-off between predator defence and feeding. Because predation risk can be a cost in desert granivores, we predicted that kangaroo rats (Dipodomys) should weigh the risk of predation when deciding which behavioural option to pursue. We manipulated apparent predation risk of the giant kangaroo rat, D. ingens, and the desert kangaroo rat, D. deserti, and predicted they should be more vigilant and show greater defensive behaviour to the more dangerous stimulus of a real snake than to an artificial snake decoy. Results showed that kangaroo rats decreased foraging with increased vigilance when the snake and decoy were present. The largest decrease in foraging was in response to the live snake, and both species oriented towards, approached and footdrummed more in the presence of the live snake than the decoy. The species also differed in their antipredator behaviour: D. ingens footdrummed more and spent more time within striking distance of the snake than the decoy. Dipodomys deserti spent more time within Im of the snake than the decoy and kicked sand at the snake. Sand kicking was never observed in D. ingens. We conclude that kangaroo rats are able to discriminate predation risk. They decrease foraging and increase vigilance in the presence of live snakes to assess risk and may approach and footdrum as a pursuit deterrent to communicate to the snake its chances of ambush are no longer available to cause the snake to leave. Sand kicking may function to harass the snake to cause it to leave. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Previous work has shown that predator inspection in mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, is more likely to occur when a mirror image of the test fish is visible on its left rather than on its right side. We investigated whether this is due to a preference for using the right eye when fixating the predator or the left eye when fixating the mirror image, or a combination of both eye preferences. We found that mosquitofish preferentially used the left eye during sustained scrutiny of their mirror image when tested in the absence of any predator. On the other hand, when tested in a swimway for predator inspection responses in the absence of any mirror image (or other social stimuli), mosquitofish explored the environment with the left eye when at a distance and the right eye when near the predator.

   FEEDING FREQUENCY
AB How do different levels of sibling competition affect nestling growth strategies? We investigated this through the effect of different levels of per capita feeding rate on the average growth rate of nestlings and on individual growth strategies within broods. To manipulate sibling competition, we transferred marsh tit nestlings between nests creating broods with fewer (reduced) or more (enlarged) nestlings than originally. Mean mass decreased as brood size, and thus sibling competition, increased. This was due to a large difference in mass between the smallest young in each brood. The mass of the largest young did not differ significantly between the broods. In reduced broods, the largest and smallest nestlings had equal mass, whereas in enlarged broods the difference was large. In contrast, wing length close to fledging did not differ between the experimental broods. We conclude that the growth of the wing has priority over general increase in size. This depends on the risk of starving for nestlings unable to leave the nest when their most dominant sibling leaves. Thus, low intake rates induce a trade-off in the growth of different structures, leading subdominant nestlings to divert proportionally more resources to wing length growth at the expense of general size. Subdominant nestlings are thus facing both a food constraint, depending on parental feeding rate and number of dominant siblings, and a time constraint, depending on the growth rate of the largest sibling. Hence, to fledge successfully, subdominant nestlings will leave the nest at suboptimal masses with a likely increase in postfledging mortality.

AB Because primate males usually invest very little in offspring, male reproductive success will mainly be determined by access to fertile females with differences in access leading to differential male reproductive success. To determine the outcome of alternative male reproductive routes, we investigated a wild population of Hanuman langurs at Ramnagar, South Nepal, where groups were either one-male or multimale. Paternity was established by DNA analysis from faeces for 42 infants in five groups. In one-male groups all infants were sired by the only resident male in the group. In multimale groups the alpha male fathered significantly more infants (57%) than all other resident males. Nonresident males sired at least 21% of all infants born into multimale groups. Because of the lower mean number of infants sired by alpha males during their whole tenure as alpha compared with males in one-male groups (2.3 versus 6.8) and the higher maximum value (8.9 versus 6.0), the alpha male route is considered the riskier option. Based on demographic data we suggest that the considerable variance in short-term reproductive success might not translate to the same degree into differences in long-term reproductive success.

AB Females of the shield bug Parastrachia japonensis Scott progressively provision nymph-containing nests with drupes of the host tree, Schoepfia jasminodora (Olicaceae: Rosidae: Santales). The majority of nests are 5-15 m from the host tree, a distance thought to have been a major impetus for the occurrence of provisioning in this species. However, the function of provisioning is not well understood. We carried out two field experiments to determine whether provisioning is nutritionally important and whether it affords protection against predation. Development of nymphs was significantly delayed and their survival was low in the absence of provisioning, even when nests were within the area of ground on to which the drupes fell, apparently because of the poor quality of the majority of the drupes. Selective provisioning of good-quality drupes by female P. japonensis, a semelparous species, was thus necessary for young nymphs to obtain enough food for their development. Furthermore, even without a female in attendance, having drupes in the nest significantly reduced early mortality in the presence of a predator.

AB We used a cooperative pulling task to examine proximate aspects of cooperation in captive brown capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella. Specifically, our goal was to determine whether capuchins can learn the contingency between their partner's participation in a task and its successful completion. We examined whether the monkeys visually monitored their partners and adjusted pulling behaviour according to their partner's presence. Results on five same-sex pairs of adults indicate that (1) elimination of visual contact between partners significantly decreased success, (2) subjects glanced at their partners significantly more in cooperative tests than in control tests in which no partner-assistance was needed, and (3) they pulled at significantly higher rates when their partner was present rather than absent. Therefore, in contrast to a previous report by Chalmeau et al. (1997, Animal Behaviour, 54, 1215-1225), cooperating capuchins do seem able to take the role of their partner into account. However, the type of task used may be an important factor affecting the level of coordination achieved. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examined the inheritance of the sea migration pattern of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, in a crossing and tagging experiment in the Baltic Sea. individuals from the parental stocks, Neva and Iijoki, and their reciprocal hybrids were released as 2-year-old smolts, into the same estuary of the Bothnian Sea in 1994. Two thousand smolts from each of the four groups were marked with Carlin tags. The recapture rate of the tags was nearly 10%. We used log-linear models to analyse the marine distribution of the salmon groups from the tag recovery data. The pure stocks and their pooled hybrid groups all showed statistically significant differences between each other in spatial and temporal sea distribution. The Iijoki salmon were more frequently (9%) caught outside the Bothnian Sea than were the Neva salmon (2%). The majority of the Iijoki salmon (55%), but fewer Neva salmon (40%), were caught in the second sea year. In spatial distribution, the hybrids seemed to be intermediate between the parental stocks, with no differences between reciprocal female and male lines. In duration of sea migration and age at maturity, however, the hybrids were very similar to their maternal line, the effect of which was thus clearly stronger than that of the paternal line.

AB Social rank can influence lifetime reproductive success and therefore fitness. We examined the effects of morphology, age, previous social experience and aggressiveness on social rank in all-female flocks of red junglefowl. None of the morphological characters measured (mass, tarsus length, comb height or comb length) appeared to play a role in determining rank. Older females were not more likely to be dominant, while previous social Experience and aggression levels were both important in dominance determination. Flock-experienced hens were more likely to be dominant as were more aggressive individuals. Red junglefowl females most likely use a combination of characters to establish social order in a newly formed flock. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   BASIS
AB Tick removal grooming may be centrally regulated by an internal timing mechanism operating to remove ticks before they attach and engorge (programmed grooming model) and/or evoked by cutaneous stimulation from tick bites (stimulus-driven model). The programmed grooming model predicts that organismic and environmental factors that impact the cost-benefit ratio of grooming (e.g. body size and habitat) will influence the rate of tick removal grooming. The body size principle predicts that smaller-sized animals, because of their greater surface-to-mass ratio, should engage in more frequent tick removal grooming than larger-bodied animals in order to compensate for higher costs of tick infestation. The body size principle may be tested intraspecifically between young and adult animals, or interspecifically among species of contrasting body sizes. To rigorously test the interspecific body size prediction, we observed the programmed grooming (oral and scratch grooming) of 25 species (or subspecies) of bovids at a tick-free zoological park in which stimulus-driven grooming was ruled out. Multiple correlation analysis revealed highly significant negative correlations between species-typical mass and mean species grooming rates when habitat was controlled for in the model. Species-typical habitat type (classified along a gradient from mast open to most closed) was positively correlated with mean oral grooming rate, indicating that species tended to groom at a higher rate in woodland and forest habitats (where typical tick density would be high) compared with more open environments. Species mass accounted for up to two-thirds of the variation in grooming rate across species, whereas habitat accounted for ca. 20% of variation in oral grooming. Similar results were obtained when the analysis was expanded to include 36 species/subspecies of six different families. The body size principle can therefore account for a large proportion of species-typical differences in programmed grooming rate among ungulates. However, to understand the tick defence adaptations of very large mammals that rarely or never engage in oral or scratch grooming (e.g. elephants, giraffes, rhinoceros), alternative tick defence strategies must be considered, such as thick skin, wallowing, rubbing and tolerance of oxpeckers and other tick-eating birds.

AB Stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) models are widely used to predict optimal behavioural and life history strategies. We discuss a diversity of ways to test SDP models empirically, taking as our main illustration a model of the daily singing routine of birds. One approach to verification is to quantify model parameters, but most SDP models are schematic. Because predictions are therefore qualitative, testing several predictions is desirable. How state determines behaviour (the policy) is a central prediction that should be examined directly if both state and behaviour are measurable. Complementary predictions concern how behaviour and state change through time, but information is discarded by considering behaviour rather than state, by looking only at average state rather than its distribution, and by not following individuals. We identify the various circumstances in which an individual's state/behaviour at one time is correlated with its state/behaviour at a later time. When there are several state variables,the relationships between them may be informative. Often model parameters represent environmental conditions that can also be viewed as state variables. Experimental manipulation of the environment has several advantages as a test, but a problem is uncertainty over how much the organism's policy will adjust. As an example we allow birds to use different assumptions about how well past weather predicts future weather. We advocate mirroring planned empirical investigations oh the computer to investigate which manipulations and predictions will best test a model.

AB For six green turtles, Chelonia mydas, that had nested on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, we used time-depth recorders to examine their diving behaviour during the subsequent internesting interval (10-12 days). All the turtles performed dives where they remained at a fixed depth for a long period, surfaced briefly and then dived to the same depth again. It is generally believed these dive profiles are caused by the turtles resting on the sea bed. The maximum depth that turtles routinely reached on these resting dives was between 18 and 20 m, with resting dives deeper than 20 m being extremely rare. Resting dive duration increased significantly with deeper dives. From this relationship, and assuming that turtles with fully inflated lungs at the surface need to dive to 19 m to achieve negative buoyancy, we estimated for two turtles that the oxygen consumption during resting dives was 0.016 and 0.020 litres O-2/kg per h, respectively. This is similar to the value predicted from the allometric scaling relationship for the minimal oxygen consumption of turtles. We calculated that the energy conserved by resting during the internesting period may appreciably increase the reproductive output of females.

AB In common gull colonies on islands of the Vistula River, Poland, adoption of chicks is common. In 1997, we observed 81 chicks from 35 nests. Of these, 19 (23.4%) left their natal broods and were adopted by other pairs. Another 11 (31.4%) were driven from the foreign territory by the owners. Foreign chicks were adopted by 15 pairs (42.9%). Eleven pairs (31.4%) drove foreign chicks from the territory. To test if the frequent adoptions in these colonies could be explained by kin selection or the occurrence of kin groups, we calculated band-sharing coefficients and genetic relatedness (r) between interacting birds (neighbours and : non-neighbours). Adults that adopted were most often:neighbours of the biological parents of adopted:chicks, whereas spatially segregated birds, nesting further away, usually drove off the chicks. Band-sharing coefficients between males, but not females, were higher with decreasing internest distances. The band-sharing coefficients for adopted chicks and foster parents were significantly higher than for adopted chicks and randomly selected, spatially segregated pairs from the same and another colony. Band-sharing coefficients of adopted chicks and adopting neighbours (males: r=0.20; females: r=0.16) also tended to be higher than those of rejected chicks and rejecting neighbours (both sexes: r=0.08). Our results suggest that kin groups of neighbours do occur in common gull colonies. Such social structure might lead to indirect inclusive fitness benefits of adopting pairs. Differences in genetic similarity between chicks and adopting or rejecting neighbours show that at least in common gulls we should consider kin altruism as a factor in adoptions.

AB We tested the effect of rearing conditions on the behaviour of jumping spiders, Phidippus audax. Spiders were assigned randomly to either small or large cages that either were empty or contained a painted dowel. Laboratory-reared spiders were raised from second instar to adult in these environments. Field-caught adults also were randomly assigned to these containers and were held for approximately 4 months prior to testing. We presented spiders with three tests designed to examine a range of behaviours. Field-caught spiders were more likely than laboratory-reared spiders to (1) react to videotaped prey, (2) progress further on a detour test, and (3) be less stereotactic and more active in an open field. Larger cage size and the presence of the dowel also improved performance in several tests. Our results suggest that the rearing conditions we used, which are commonly employed by behavioural researchers, may profoundly influence the behaviour of adult spiders.

AB Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), small directionally random deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry, is thought to reflect individual quality. Furthermore, it has been suggested that FA in secondary sexual characters can be used to assess mate or opponent quality during inter- or intrasexual competition. Studies on fallow deer, Dama dama, have suggested that FA in antlers reflects individual dominance, or the existence of a directional asymmetry (DA) with right antlers being consistently more developed than left antlers. To test these conflicting hypotheses, we analysed relationships between age, dominance and asymmetry in the number of antler points on mature fallow deer males during four rutting seasons in a single population. Age and dominance were only weakly correlated. The number of antler points displayed a pattern of DA (more points on the right than on the left side) that increased with age. Although dominance tended to increase with the total number of antler points, there was no relationship between the level of DA and dominance. These results failed to support the hypothesis that antler asymmetry visually reveals individual quality in fallow deer. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Honeybee, Apis mellifera, colonies replace their queens by constructing many queen cells and then eliminating supernumerary queens until only one remains. The ages of the queens and the variation in their reproductive potential are important factors in the outcome of such events. Selection would favour colonies that requeen as quickly as possible to minimize the brood hiatus, therefore selecting for queens reared from older larvae. Conversely, reproductive potential (queen 'quality') is maximized by rearing queens from younger larvae. This potential trade-off was tested during two phases of queen replacement, namely queen rearing and polygyny reduction. Our results suggest that queen age is a significant element during both queen rearing and polygyny reduction, whereas queen quality, at least to the magnitude tested in this experiment, has little impact on the outcome of either process. The rate of queen replacement therefore appears to be an important factor in the honeybee life cycle, and further mechanisms of potential importance during this life history transition are discussed.

AB We examined meal-ending decisions by rats feeding in depleting patches (where the rate of return decreased during a meal) and nondepleting patches (where the rate of return was constant) in a closed-economy, laboratory setting that allowed the precise measurement of feeding rates and meal patterns. The rats were free living in an environment where costs were imposed with bar-press requirements for (1) travelling to a patch to begin a meal and (2) earning prey during the ensuing meal in that patch. The prey in each patch were large or small, and dense or sparse. In both depleting and nondepleting patches, meals were larger as travel price increased. In nondepleting patches, meal size (in grams) was unaffected by the rate of return within the patch, but in depleting patches, meals were larger where the rate of return was higher. In depleting patches, the rats ate the same number of small and large prey per meal, suggesting that meals end when the rate of return reaches some level relative to a comparison value; however, the end-of-meal rate tvas lower than the average rate (calculated over foraging and feeding time), and thus meals were too large to maximize rate or minimize cost. No obvious rule of thumb explained meal size in both depleting and nondepleting patches. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB An important question in state-dependent behaviour is how multiple influences on state are integrated to determine current behaviour. Aggressive behaviour is known to be affected by a prior contest experience. Nevertheless, whether and how multiple prior fighting experiences are integrated into a fighting decision remain unexplored. In this study, individuals of Rivulus marmoratus (Cyprinodontidae), a hermaphroditic fish, were given different combinations of two prior fighting experiences to investigate: (1) the effect of penultimate experiences on the probability of winning a subsequent contest; (2) the relative effect of a recent win and loss; and (3) whether the effect of a winning experience was as short lived as observed in other species. Penultimate and recent fighting experiences were given to the test fish approximately 48 and 24 h prior to the dyadic contests, respectively. From the results of the Sive types df Contests staged, we conclude that: (1) penultimate fighting experiences had a significant effect on the probability of winning a subsequent contest; (2) a more recent experience had a more pronounced effect: than an earlier experience, which Suggested that the effect of a fighting experience would decay and/or the effect of a recent experience would interfere with the effect of an earlier experience; (3) no asymmetric effect between winning experience and a losing experience was detected; and (4) the effect of both a;winning and a losing experience lasted for at least 48 h in R. marmoratus which was the maximum time tested in these experiments. The possible reasons for the differences in results among studies of experience effects on contest outcomes are discussed. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examined temporal variation in food delivery to nestling Gory's shearwaters, Calonectris diomedea, by repeated periodic weighings during the night. We tested whether the magnitude and frequency of meals were influenced by the rendition of chicks. In contrast to previous studies of chick provisioning in petrels and shearwaters, the evidence of feeding derived from chick weight gains was complemented by data provided by an electronic system, which logged the entry of each parent to the nest. Estimates of feed size and visiting frequency obtained from chick weighing alone differed from similar estimates obtained using the automatic logging equipment. The;data obtained with the logging system combined with chick weighing also showed that, to some extent, food provisioning was regulated, chicks left in poorer condition being more likely to receive food the next night than those left in better condition. The methods based on chick weight gains alone did not detect this regulation effect. Our findings suggest that resolving parental visits to the nest is crucial to obtain accurate parameter estimates, and to address the problem of regulation of provisioning rates in Procellariiformes. Our results do not support the hypothesis that accumulation of fat is just a by-product of chronic overfeeding arising from stochastic variation in foraging success at sea.

AB The energetic consequences of fighting, which may depend on environmental conditions, can be an important factor shaping contest strategy and duration. Energy expenditure may be costly to fitness because it depletes reserves that could otherwise have been allocated to reproduction, and metabolites are produced that may constrain subsequent activities. We examined the variation in the metabolic consequences of fighting in relation to hypoxia. Contests were staged between pairs of size-matched male shore crabs, Carcinus maenas L., under a range of water oxygen tensions (between 10 and 100% oxygen saturation) which crabs experience in their natural habitat. Fighting under normoxic and hypoxic conditions resulted in significantly elevated concentrations of haemolymph metabolites (L-lactate an. glucose) compared with crabs at rest. However, these concentrations were much lower than in crabs that had been walking on a treadmill. Glycogen concentrations differed only under hypoxic conditions: glycogen stores were reduced in crabs after fighting and this reduction was similar to that after exercise on a treadmill. Contests were shorter when they were staged below a water Po-2 of 6.7 kPa (similar to 30% normoxia). As water oxygen tensions were reduced, fighting crabs had greater concentrations Of L-lactate and glucose in their blood and tissues whilst glycogen stores were reduced. Fights became shorter when crabs were exposed to severe hypoxia (Po-2=2 kPa) for increasing lengths of time, and blood L-lactate concentrations increased. The results suggest that as fights progressed, crabs experienced an increasing metabolic debt, in the form of accumulation of L-lactate and a reduction in energy stores, which was amplified by hypoxic conditions.

AB I observed free-ranging oribi, Ourebia ourebi, in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, to determine whether group formation by males provides evidence for cooperative territory defence, a behaviour that is rare among male vertebrates. Socially dominant males that shared territories with subordinate auxiliary males were replaced by rivals less often than males that defended territories without auxiliary males. Auxiliary males marked territories with preorbital glands, dung and urine, and territories defended by male groups were marked more thoroughly than those defended by single males. Fifteen of 24 (62.5%) auxiliary males whose histories were known were born on territories defended by males that probably were their fathers. But 37.5% of auxiliary males probably were unrelated to dominant males, because male groups also formed when territory owners accepted adult male immigrants as subordinates, and when owners allowed young males to remain philopatric after evicting a male likely to have been the young male's father. All males in groups probably had some mating access to females, but dominant males may have minimized matings of auxiliary males by guarding fertile females. These results suggest that auxiliary male oribi aided dominant males in territory defence, and that dominants traded off the risks of losing matings to auxiliaries, or being overthrown by them, in exchange for a reduction in their chance of being evicted by rival neighbours or immigrants.

AB Spatial learning is critical to most animals for many behaviours necessary to survival. In vertebrates, most studies on spatial learning and memory have been conducted in mammalian and avian species with few studies on reptiles. We examined spatial learning in the corn snake Elaphe guttata guttata by training 17 young snakes to find the one open shelter in an eight-hole arena, where the entrance was not visible from the arena surface. Over a 16-trial, 4-day training period, snakes showed (1) a significant decrease in the mean latency to the goal, (2) a significant decrease in the mean total distance travelled, (3) a significant increase in the percentage of the total distance travelled in the quadrant containing the goal, and (4) a significant increase in movement in the goal quadrant above chance. Although no differences were found in the number of errors made over the training period, snakes made fewer errors on all days than expected by chance. This study shows that snakes can learn rapidly a spatial-escape task that is relevant behaviourally and suggests that entering a shelter reinforces this learning. Mechanisms of orientation for the task described are discussed. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Prey often avoid predator chemical cues, and in aquatic systems, prey may even appraise predation risk via cues associated with the predator's diet. However, this relationship has not been shown for terrestrial predator-prey systems, where the proximity of predators and prey, and the intensity of predator chemical cues in the environment, may be less than in aquatic systems. In the laboratory, we tested behavioural responses (avoidance, habituation and activity) of terrestrial red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, to chemical cues from garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis, fed either red-backed salamanders or earthworms (Lumbricus spp.). We placed salamanders in arenas lined with paper towels pretreated with snake chemicals, and monitored salamander movements during 120 min. Salamanders avoided substrates preconditioned by earthworm-fed (avoidance, (X) over bar +/- SE=91.1 +/- 2.5%, N=25) and salamander-fed (95.2 +/- 2.5%, N=25) snakes, when tested against untreated substrate (control). Salamanders avoided cues from salamander-fed snakes more strongly (75.2 +/- 5.5%, N=25) than earthworm-fed snakes when subjected to both treatments simultaneously, implying that salamanders were sensitive to predator diet. Salamanders tended to avoid snake substrate more strongly during the last 60 min of a trial,; but activity patterns were similar between salamanders exposed exclusively to control substrate versus those subject to snake cues. In another experiment, salamanders failed to avoid cues from dead conspecifics, suggesting that the stronger avoidance of salamander-fed snakes in the previous experiment was not directly due to chemical cues emitted by predator-killed salamanders. Salamanders also did not discriminate between cues from a salamander-fed snake versus a salamander-fed snake that was recently switched (i.e. <14 days) to an earthworm diet. Our results imply that terrestrial salamanders are sensitive to perceived predation risk via by-products of predator diet, and that snake predators rather than dead salamanders may be largely responsible for the release of such chemicals.

AB In the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, females prefer higher chirp rates and longer chirp durations in male calling song. Higher chirp rates are energetically more expensive to produce, but the energetic cost of calling does not vary with chirp duration. We tested the hypothesis that nutrition affects male chirp rate and chirp duration. Full-sibling brothers of similar age were placed on high- and low-nutrition feeding regimes. There was no effect of feeding regime on male weight; neither group showed a significant change in weight, and the two groups did not differ from each other in weight change. However, males on the high-nutrition feeding regime both called more frequently and called at higher chirp rates when they did call. The two groups did not differ in chirp duration, the duration of pulses within chirps or chirp dominant frequency. These results suggest that females select mates based on one nutrition-dependent call character (chirp rate) and one nutrition-independent call character (chirp duration). In addition, because males in the two groups did not show significant differences in weight change, and because males on the high-nutrition feeding regime engaged in energetically more expensive calling, these results suggest that males invest any excess energy above their basic maintenance requirements in the production of call types that increase their attractiveness to females. The absence of a relationship between body condition and calling song structure for males in the field may be a consequence of this pattern of energy allocation.

AB We quantified parental behaviour of eastern kingbirds during the incubation and nestling periods to determine parental roles, and to examine the impact of previous breeding experience (defined as having bred on the territory in the past) on behaviour and reproductive success. Females performed all incubation, while males spent more than 60% of their time in vigilant or nest guarding behaviour during incubation. Parental roles were not defined as sharply during the nestling period. Females spent more time vigilant, but males provisioned young at only 54% of the rate of females. Vigilance and nest watching were still primarily male duties. Male and female behaviour did not vary with the pair's combination of experience (e.g. experienced-experienced versus inexperienced-inexperienced in previous-current breeding season, respectively) during either phase of reproduction, but experienced males were more vigilant during incubation and fed young relatively more than inexperienced males. Experienced females were also more efficient foragers. Although behaviour did not differ among the four combinations of pair experience, inexperienced pairs none the less lost the most young to starvation and predation. Consequently, inexperienced pairs fledged one less nestling per nesting attempt than did pairs with at least one experienced breeder. Our results suggest that having at least one experienced breeder substantially improved a pair's reproductive success. We propose that female site fidelity is a safeguard to avoid the lower breeding success a female would incur if she were to move to a new territory and breed with an inexperienced male.

AB How individual competitive ability varies with competitor density in systems where interference competition occurs has been studied in few systems, despite its importance in determining the fundamental predictions of influential phenotype-limited ideal free distribution models. I measured individual variation in competitive ability in wild wintering blackbirds, Turdus merula. Variation in feeding rate of single birds, and the decline in their feeding rate in the presence of competitors, were measured in experimental patches. Individuals varied significantly both in their feeding rate when alone and in the decline in that feeding rate in the presence of competitors. Individuals that had high absolute feeding rates did not tend to have smaller declines in feeding rate in the presence of competitors. The relative ranking among birds in their feeding rate was strongly dependent on competitor density. This result has important implications for the expected distributions of competitors between patches. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Elaborated male sexual displays commonly involve multiple elements that may differ greatly among closely related species, but there have been few studies of the causes of this divergence. Male spotted bowerbirds, Chlamydera maculata, have unusually intense, aggressive courtship displays and highly divergent bowers. Male and female courtship positions differ from related species in that males court females separated by a modified see-through bower wall. Here we experimentally tested hypotheses that could explain the unique features of spotted bowerbird display relative to other Chlamynera species. Our results support the threat reduction hypothesis, which suggests that accessory traits evolve because they mitigate the threat associated with intense, aggressive male displays that are most effective in causing females to become sexually receptive. In spotted bowerbird males, the highly modified and unique see-through bower walls allow females to view intense displays while reducing threat that would otherwise be, associated with these same displays. We found that (1) females preferred males with the most intense displays, (2) males and females at experimentally manipulated bowers consistently moved to courtship positions so that the standing bower wall separated them and (3) males reduced display intensity when not separated from the female by an intact bower wall. Comparisons with other Chlamydera species suggest that bower architecture coevolves with other display elements to allow maximally effective male displays. Such coordinated adaptive changes of display elements suggest an alternative to the runaway divergence of arbitrary traits as the cause of rapid divergence in multifaceted male display traits among closely related species.

AB Reproductive activities often increase the susceptibility of individuals to predators. Individuals may be able to reduce this risk of predation, however, by their choice of breeding habitat, as the structural complexity of habitats is known to affect predator foraging success. Here we show that the presence of predators induces a preference for structurally complex nest sites over open ones in male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. To investigate whether this predator-induced nest site preference can decrease the known negative effect of predators on courtship activity, we recorded the reduction in courtship activity during predator presentations for males in vegetated and open nest sites. Habitat structure affected the response to a predator when males were in competition. A male in a vegetated site reduced courtship activity less than a male in an open site. Habitat had no effect on courtship when males were solitary, however. This suggests that male-male competition and the possibility of losing mating opportunities to other males affect risk taking. Females, who were unaware of the predator, preferred the male in the vegetated site, which showed less reduction in courtship, when the males were exposed to a predator, but chose randomly between the males when the predator was absent. Thus, a preference for vegetated nest sites under predation risk may be beneficial not only by increasing the probability of survival, but also by reducing the negative impact of predators on courtship activity and mating probability.

AB Availability of suitable roost sites may limit bat distribution and abundance. We compared nine internal and 26 external features of 21 known roost buildings with those of 17 random buildings in northeast Scotland, U.K. (57 degrees N) to assess whether pipistrelle bats, Pipistrellus pipistrellus (55-kHz phonotype) are selective in their use of roosts. Bats did not select roosts with specific structural attributes. Compared with random buildings, roosts were closer to a tree over 10 m tall and had a greater percentage cover (of trees over 10 m tall) within a radius of 50 m. Trees may provide benefits by providing shelter and thus ameliorating the microclimate of the roost. Cover may also provide protection from predators so that bats are able to emerge earlier, thus increasing foraging time. Bats in the present study emerged 11 min earlier from roosts with 29% cover than from roosts with 3% cover, potentially gaining as much as 10% of their daily energy requirements in this extra time. Roosts were also more likely to have linear vegetation elements leading away from them. These features may be important for navigation, foraging or predator avoidance. Compared with random buildings roosts were closer to and surrounded by a greater area of deciduous woodland within a radius of 0.5 km, had a greater area of coniferous woodland within a radius of 0.5 km, and were more likely to be found within 0.5 km of a major river. All these factors are likely to be beneficial for foraging. A logistic regression model indicated that percentage cover within 50 m of the building was the best predictor of the presence or absence of bats roosting in a building.

   BUDGERIGARS; BROODS; MODELS; NEED; FOOD
AB The begging behaviour of nestling birds appears to be the main signal telling parents how much food is needed by the brood. Not only may the accuracy of that information be reduced through exaggeration due to competition, but it may also vary with the age of the nestling. Younger nestlings map vary more in how frequently they call than older nestlings because they cannot discriminate stimuli as well. Thus even if 'honest', begging from younger nestlings could be a less reliable hunger signal. than;that from older nestlings. We tested the prediction that parents should respond less to the increased frequency of begging from very young versus older nestlings by playing back begging calls at the nests of both younger (less than or equal to 5 day) and older (greater than or equal to 6 days) red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus. In neither case did parents respond with consistent increases in feeding, nor did young gain more weight during playbacks. This lack of response is discussed in relation to two other recent studies of blackbirds that did demonstrate increased feeding with playbacks of begging; calls.

AB We examine two methods of allocating animals between sites of different resource input rate in the context of the ideal free distribution. The basic models are of individuals of two classes of competitive weight distributing themselves between two sites. The importance of arrival sequence and the subsequent movements of animals between sites are investigated. When all the good competitors arrive before the poor competitors, the distribution of each class conforms to the input matching rule. When competitors arrive in a random sequence, poor competitors switch between patches. Resulting distributions are compared with predictions from the ideal free distribution with unequal competitors and from statistical mechanics. The comparisons show fewer animals using the site with the highest resource than predicted by the input matching rule, that is, undermatching is found. The effect of each animal having a unique competitive ability is then examined. We discuss the application of ideal free;distribution models to areas of behavioural ecology other than foraging, together with alternative rules to the standard instantaneous intake rates rule.

ID RANK; SIZE; HIERARCHIES; LINEARITY; ACCESS; SYSTEM
AB We present an approach based on generalized linear:models for analysing dominance data. First, dominance is defined as a parameter characterizing the relationship between two individuals, determining the expected number of successes of the first individual in disputes with the other. Second, models known from the literature of two different forms of transitivity are defined in terms of these parameters, and examples of different tests of these models are given. Third, a new model is developed where the traits of individuals involved in the dominance interactions are included as covariates. Finally, we show how two forms of intransitive models of dominance structures can be constructed by including a certain interaction term between the trait variables, and terms taking into account the effect of relatedness between the individuals in the group. We reanalyse several data sets in the literature, and also discuss Appleby's method (1983, Anim. Behav., 31, 600-608), which is frequently used in analysis of dominance data.

AB Ensatina eschscholtzii is a plethodontid salamander with several geographical races distributed in a ring-like series throughout the coastal mountains and inland Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Populations of these salamanders show genetic and morphological divergence, and in this study, we examined divergence in overt aggressive, passive aggressive/exploratory, avoidance and sensory behaviours in four populations. Two of the populations represent a zone of secondary contact between coastal and inland lineages of Ensatina. We recorded behaviour of resident salamanders paired with same-sex intruders during the non-courtship season. The residents' behaviour was affected independently by the population of the resident and the population of the intruder but not by the interaction between the resident population and the intruder population. Levels of agonistic and sensory behaviour showed a high degree of constraint among the populations. These behaviours also showed divergence among coastal and inland populations, and the geographical. variation in behaviour is consistent with the phylogenetic history of Ensatina. Convergent evolution of behaviour appears to have occurred at the zone of secondary contact between the coastal and inland lineages. Variation in agonistic and sensory behaviour among the populations observed and between the sexes suggests that there may be geographical and sexual variation in territoriality or competition.

ID SEXUAL SELECTION; FEMALE CHOICE; COMPONENTS; VARIANCE; FITNESS
AB We compared repeatability and heritability estimates for courtship traits in the housefly Musca domestica L., to test the expectation that the repeatability of a behaviour is an upper-bound estimate of its heritability. The repeatabilities across and within mating partners for two courtship traits, male wing buzzing (Buzz) and female wing extension (Wing-out), were compared to heritabilities calculated from the divergence among subpopulations due to founder-flush events or artificial selection. The male's Buzz showed highly significant repeatabilities within and across female partners, but the values ranged widely (0.3-0.5). The intensity of Buzz decreased significantly with successive courtship attempts to the same female, apparently as a male strategy to optimize his efforts to gain copulation by modulating behaviour for specific females. Repeatabilities for female Wing-out within and across male partners were not significant, but this trait yielded significant heritabilities in two assessments (based on successful courtships). We attribute this contradiction to biased sampling because only the subset of reluctant females met the necessary restriction to refuse copulation throughout four successive courtships. These results demonstrate that repeatabilities are labile within individuals and may actually underestimate heritabilities when there is a genetic predisposition not to repeat performance. We concur with related studies that repeatabilities can identify evolutionary potential, but we advise caution in interpreting low values or comparing their absolute values.

AB Animals often make choices based on cues that provide uncertain information about the value of alternative options. To examine how this uncertainty affects sampling behaviour, western scrub-jays were studied in the field during selection of single food items to scatter-hoard. Nine habituated birds were videotaped at feeders during repeated presentations of pairs of unshelled peanuts that varied in size. Jays initially scanned the peanuts before picking one up and in 38% of trials handled both, often switching repeatedly between them before making a choice. The jays preferred heavier nuts, which contained a larger food reward, but made errors particularly when mass differences were small. In addition, when choosing which nut to pick up first the birds discriminated mass relatively less accurately when the peanuts were larger. When mass differences were small the birds were more likely to handle both nuts before choosing. Handling both nuts raised the probability of selecting the heavier one by 20%, but did not increase the rate of food acquisition above that obtainable by scanning because it also increased time spent choosing. These results confirm recent suggestions that animals facing difficult discriminations may increase the accuracy of choice by sampling additional cues.

AB Feather pecking resulting in feather damage, injuries and mortality causes severe welfare problems in laying hens. In the present study, we tested whether there is an inverse relationship between feather pecking and foraging behaviour (exploratory and manipulative behaviour away from the feeder). Forty-eight groups of 30 or 31 chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus? were reared in pens and provided with different types of foraging material. Feather pecking and foraging behaviour were quantified when the chicks were 4 and 5 weeks of age. In experiment 1, chicks with access to long-cut straw showed more foraging behaviour and less feather pecking than chicks that were provided with the same straw but in shredded form. On the other hand, there was no difference in foraging behaviour and feather pecking between chicks reared with access to long-cut straw and polystyrene blocks. In experiment 2, the importance of the form of the foraging material was confirmed. Chicks provided with polystyrene blocks performed more foraging behaviour and less feather pecking than chicks with access to polystyrene beads. The provision of an area with a layer of wood-shavings to promote scratching behaviour had no significant effect, however, on the incidence of feather pecking. In experiment 3, polystyrene blocks and beads were offered during the whole day or only in the morning. Both the qualify and the availability of the foraging materials had a significant effect on foraging behaviour and a significant but opposite effect on feather pecking. Focal animal observations showed that the chicks performed different types of foraging behaviour at polystyrene blocks and beads. This suggests that not only the quantity but also the quality of foraging behaviour elicited by a given material may be important to prevent the development of feather pecking. Feather pecking should thus be considered as redirected foraging behaviour. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social spiders are typically found only in the tropics. In laboratory tests and field observations, adult female A. studiosus in two populations in Tennessee, U.S.A., a temperate region, showed inter-attraction (grouping behaviour caused by the presence of conspecifics), greater tolerance towards conspecifics, and cooperation during prey capture and brood care. These are the three classical conditions considered typical of social spiders. The populations also had female-biased sex ratios and limited dispersal. Anelosimus studiosus can thus be regarded as a quasi-social or cooperative spider species. These populations of A. studiosus are the first social spiders to be described from typically temperate regions. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Nests of Argentine ants, L. humile, were exposed to pairs of foraging patches of varying quality. These patches varied from never having food to having food for 4 h every day. After 15 days, colonies were allowed an added access to a new patch. The new patch, however, never contained food. The sampling behaviour of nests towards the initial patches and the new patch suggested that the nests were using a sampling rule based on maximizing net benefits of finding food minus the cost of sampling. The behaviour of the nests towards the new patch was also significantly affected by what the foraging workers had previouisly encountered in the foraging patches. The behaviour of the L. humile colonies is similar in pattern to what would result by Bayesian updating of expectations for success in novel foraging opportunities. These data are the first suggestions of such an ability in an insect. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I examined how male competition and female choice influence the evolution of multiple male traits in the yellow-browed leaf warbler, Phylloscopus inornatus, by investigating the roles of colour patches, territory size, body weight and song rate in sexual selection. Comparison of 3 years of observational studies and 3 years of experimental studies, in which the colour patches on the wings of males were experimentally altered, suggest several mechanisms that may explain the evolution of multiple characters in males. First, females based their choice of mates on several male characters, not a single character. Second, the male characters preferred by females were different in observational and experimental studies. Females apparently preferred high-quality males as mates, and were able to vary the characters used in mate choice to distinguish these individuals under both experimental and observational conditions. Third, the characters important in male competition differed from those that formed the basis of female choice: the manipulation of colour patch size directly affected male territory size but was not associated with female choice. These results may provide an explanation for the diversity of sexual ornaments shown by males of many species. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I studied the timing and frequency of male copulatory behaviour in alpine accentors, Plunella collaris, in Japan, with respect to dominance status, age and development of the cloacal protuberance. Males used one of three mating tactics depending on their dominance status. Alpha males guarded several females in succession, but only during the females' fertile period, while gamma males copulated rarely and only with unguarded females. The tactics of beta males were flexible: with unguarded females they usually adopted a frequent-copulation tactic, but when two females had synchronous egg-laying periods, beta males associated closely with whichever female the alpha male left unguarded. When alpha males closely guarded a female, beta males guarded this same female for short periods before and after the guarding period of the alpha male. Subordinate rank restricted a male's opportunities for mating but males of all dominance ranks were sexually active and had fully developed cloacal protuberances. Frequent copulation plus part-time mate guarding (as found in beta males) and opportunistic copulation (as found in gamma males) appears to be a conditional strategy whereby young, subordinate males are 'making the best of a bad job'. A long-term study over 10 years showed that males moved up in social rank with increasing age but 78.9% of males remained subordinate because alpha males occupied the top rank for much of their lifetime.

AB Differential treatment of kin and non-kin has been well documented, but much remains unclear about how kin are recognized. If kin are recognized by a phenotype-matching mechanism, there must be a correlation between genetic relatedness and the similarity of cues used for recognition. A habituation technique was used with golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus, to investigate the relative similarity of the odour quality of flank gland secretions from siblings and unrelated individuals. Hamsters discriminated between the odours of their own, same-sex siblings but also treated these odours as similar compared to odours of non-siblings (experiment 1). They did not discriminate between the flank gland odours of unfamiliar siblings from another family (experiment 2). They also did not discriminate between the flank gland odours of unfamiliar, paternal half-siblings from another family (experiment 3). These results indicate that subjects perceived odours from genetically similar individuals as similar and provide evidence for kinship odour cues. The discrimination between the flank gland odours of subjects' own siblings, however, indicates that hamsters learn the subtle differences between the odours of their close kin, probably through experience with siblings in the nest. When only volatile components from flank gland secretions were available to subjects (experiment 4), they again discriminated between the odours of their own siblings, suggesting that the volatile components from the flank gland secretion were sufficient for recognition of individual litter-mates.

AB This study provided basic information about spatial memory in the domestic pig, Sus scrofa, and examined how susceptible it is to disruption by environmental stimuli. Eight male pigs were tested individually in a foraging arena. Each day, they entered the arena to search for food randomly located in one of 10 enclosed areas (search trial). After finding and eating the food, they were removed from the arena for a retention interval, and then allowed back in to relocate the food in the same area as previously (relocation trial). Once pigs had achieved a criterion level of performance in relocation trials, 'disturbances' (e.g. isolation, novel food source, novel spatial environment) were presented during the retention interval. Disturbance days were separated by control days on which no disturbance was presented. During search trials, pigs did not use food-related cues to locate food, but appeared to use memory to search systematically and avoid revisits to empty areas. During relocation trials, they found food using fewer area visits than expected by chance, indicating that they could remember the location of food across both 10-min and 2-h retention intervals. Disturbances administered during 10-min retention intervals resulted in more relocation errors than on corresponding control days, indicating that spatial memory in pigs is susceptible to interference by relatively mild environmental stimuli, in contrast to that in rats, Rattus norvegicus, and pigeons, Columba livia, which appears to be highly resistant to retroactive-interference even when potent stimuli are used. Analysis of error locations suggested that disturbances probably acted to increase the general area in which the pig remembered the food to be located, and so reduced accuracy of memory without eradicating it. There was no evidence that errors made during relocation trials represented sampling of areas not visited during the preceding search trial.

AB We investigated whether fifth instar African migratory locusts, Locusta migratoria, could learn to associate visual cues with the macronutrient content of synthetic foods. During a 48-h training period, the insects had ad libitum access to two synthetic foods which were identical in all respects except that one lacked protein and the other lacked digestible carbohydrate. One food was placed at the end of a transparent Perspex cylinder which had been tinted green, and the other at the end of a yellow-tinted cylinder which was similar in all other respects. To obtain a balanced diet, the insects were thus forced to ingest the two macronutrients in visually different environments. Following this training period, they were then made selectively deficient in either protein or carbohydrate, before being tested for their tendency to enter, and the depth of entry into, yellow-or green-tinted cylinders that did not contain food. Locusts entered significantly more frequently the colour of cylinder that had previously been paired with the deficient nutrient (henceforth termed the 'training colour'). This was true irrespective of whether the nutrient was protein or carbohydrate, and whether the training colour was green or yellow. There was no effect of training on the average depth of entry into the cylinders. However, protein-deprived locusts penetrated significantly more deeply than carbohydrate-deprived locusts into both green and yellow cylinders, irrespective of the training colour. A separate experiment demonstrated that naive locusts entered more frequently into the yellow than the green side-arm, but there was no influence of colour on the depth of entry by naive locusts.

AB The effect of spot asymmetry on female mate choice was investigated in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Spot asymmetry arises because whole pattern elements are missing from one side or are located in a different position on: either side. Pairs of males were selected that differed in melanic spot asymmetry. In other respects the pair of males were matched for body size, display rate and other aspects of colour pattern. Two experiments were carried out, one in which asymmetry was caused by missing spot elements, the other in which asymmetry was caused by misaligned spots. The latter experiment does not confound differences of pigment area with differences in asymmetry. In both cases females strongly preferred the symmetric male. This was not sensitivity to fluctuating asymmetry (small differences in the size of spot areas) but to asymmetry at the gross level of spot pattern.

AB Reversed sexual size dimorphism, with males smaller than females, is common in waders. The aerial display hypothesis suggests that sexual selection in males favours aerial agility, and hence small size, in species with male display flights. We tested this hypothesis in the dunlin, Calidris alpina. Display flights were uncommon in the early breeding season but increased markedly when females began laying. Male display areas were largely overlapping, and display flight seemed to be mainly an advertising signal to potential mates. Display rate, as well as proportion of time spent in aerial display, increased with decreasing male size. During aerial display, small males also performed costly hovering flights more often and for relatively longer than large males. These results support the aerial display hypothesis.

AB We observed 49 coyotes, Canis latrans, from five resident packs for 2456 h and five transient coyotes for 51 h from January 1991 to June 1993 in the Lamar River Valley, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, U.S.A. During these observations we recorded 3042 urinations, 451 defecations, 446 ground scratches and 743 double-marks. The rate of scent-marking (via urination) was influenced by the social organization (resident versus transient) to which the coyote belonged, the social class (alpha, beta or pup) of the animal and the time of the year. Transient coyotes scent-marked at a lower rate than did members of a resident pack. Within the resident packs, alpha coyotes scent-marked at a higher rate than beta coyotes (adults and yearlings subordinant to alphas, but dominant over pups) and pups. Alpha coyotes increased their rate of marking during the breeding season; beta and pup coyotes performed scent-marks at a relatively constant rate throughout the year. There was no influence of social class or time of year on the rate of defecation. The rate of double-marking was highest among alpha coyotes with a peak during the breeding season. Alpha coyotes ground-scratched at a higher rate than did beta and pup coyotes. Alpha and beta coyotes scent-marked more than expected along the periphery of the territory compared to the interior; pups marked in the interior and edge in proportion to expected frequencies. Double-marking and ground-scratching were higher than expected along the periphery of the territory. The distribution of defecations was not different from expected along the edge Versus the interior of the territory. Pack size did not influence the rate of scent-marking performed by individuals in the pack or by the alpha pair. We concluded that alpha coyotes were the primary members of the resident pack involved in scent-marking. The large coyote packs and the high rate of marking by the alpha pairs were parallel to the scent-marking behaviour displayed by wolves, C. lupus, to a greater extent than previously reported. Scent-marks appear to provide internal information to the members of the resident pack (internal map of territory, breeding condition, reproductive synchrony) and enhance demarcation of territorial boundaries.

AB Two sets of experiments were conducted to determine whether aggregation behaviour, commonly observed in tadpoles of the common toad, Bufo bufo, had a predator avoidance function. In the first set of experiments, the distribution of toad tadpoles, of tingle or mixed sibship, was monitored in large artificial pools, one with fish chemical cues and one without. Aggregation behaviour was determined on the basis of the distribution of the tadpoles under these treatments by using two indices of cohesion: variance/mean ratio and a newly developed swarming index. The two indices were highly correlated. Tadpole groups were more cohesive (1) in the presence of fish chemical cues and (2) with other individuals from a single sibship. In the second set of experiments, tadpoles in different densities and distributions were presented to fish predators in a floating arena which allowed strike rate to be monitored but prevented the fish from capturing any tadpoles. Total strike rate per group increased with increasing group size, but strike rate per individual decreased, implying individuals gain from being in a larger group through dilution, but the group as a whole loses. These results are discussed in terms of selfish herd or cooperative group theories on the behaviour of aggregations. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA; SIZE
AB Clutch desertion and re-nesting are important components of fitness when predation is frequent. In nestbox populations however, nest predation and desertion are rare but can be studied by experimental manipulations. We experimentally reduced clutches of pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, by removing one egg per day until desertion occurred. The size of the clutch at desertion and whether females re-nested or not were used as measures of the female response. Of the deserting females, 74% re-nested in our study area. Re-nesting frequency was correlated with date but not with the size of the clutch laid. The majority of the non-re-nesting females deserted empty nests, while the majority of re-nesting females deserted one egg. Clutch size at desertion was not correlated with the size of the clutch laid nor with laying date; it was smaller than the size predicted by an optimality analysis of the value of both the current (deserted) and the replacement clutch. For the re-nesting females, there was a negative correlation between fledging rate of the replacement clutch and the size of the clutch at desertion. Our predictions, made under the hypothesis that desertion and re-nesting are adaptive behaviours, were partly supported by the data; we explain the discrepancy by the constraint of searching for a new nest site or mate for re-nesting.

AB This study explored how baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, in a desert population trade off foraging and predation risk in patterns of habitat use. Four hypotheses were proposed and tested; that habitats are used on the basis of (1) availability, (2) foraging rewards (following the ideal free distribution), (3) foraging rewards modified by the constraints of nocturnal predation risk (partial trade-off) or (4) foraging rewards modified by the constraints of continuous predation risk (full trade-off). Food availability in each habitat was quantified through quadrat surveys describing stem density, plant part availability and nutrient availability (protein and energy) of key plant foods per unit area. Predation risk in each habitat was evaluated using measures describing the relative threat of attack and capture by both leopards, Panthera pardus, and lions, Panthera lee; attack risk was determined on the basis of habitat visibility and predator ambush distances, while capture risk was calculated using a simple model incorporating predator and prey velocities, habitat visibility and nearest refuge distance. Patterns of baboon behaviour were assessed for adult males and females in four groups through day-follows and instantaneous sampling. The baboons did not use habitats directly in proportion to their availability in the group's ranging area (in contrast to hypothesis 1). Nor did patterns of habitat use match those expected on the basis of the ideal free distribution, either during all activities (hypothesis 2) or during feeding (hypothesis 3). Instead, the baboons spent less time feeding in the high-risk food-rich habitat but more time feeding in the low-risk relatively food-poor habitat. Baboons also preferred low-risk habitats in other activities, where during resting and grooming all habitats were avoided except the safest (where key food species were absent). These results support hypothesis 4. Deviations from these patterns by a unimale group indicate that male reproductive strategies may also play a role in habitat selection.

AB This study tested whether female red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, acquire non-genetic, material benefits from copulating with multiple males. In this population, females solicit extra-pair copulations, primarily from males defending adjacent territories on the same breeding marsh. Results of a feeder experiment revealed that females that copulated with an extra-pair male were allowed to feed on his territory, but females that remained faithful to their social mates were actively excluded from foraging on neighbouring territories. Males discriminated between faithful and unfaithful social mates. Females that engaged in extra-pair copulations were prevented from foraging on their social mate's territory significantly more often than females that did not. Measurement of neighbouring male responses to a mounted nest predator, a black-billed magpie, Pica pica, revealed that males were also significantly more aggressive towards a predator at a nest on a neighbouring territory if they had copulated with the breeding female than if they had not. These findings provide a possible explanation for results of Gray (1997, Anim. Behav., 53, 605-623), which showed that fledging success was significantly higher for females that engaged in extra-pair copulations than for females that did not, because depredation rates were significantly lower in clutches laid by females that had engaged in extra-pair copulations, and starvation rates tended to be lower in broods containing extra-pair young. This study is the first to demonstrate that females can benefit materially as well as genetically by copulating outside their pair bond and illustrates the need for manipulative tests to understand fully the reproductive strategies of individuals in populations where social relationships often do not reflect genetic relationships.

AB Ovipositing parasitoid wasps deposit marking pheromones on the host that deter conspecifics from superparasitism. In addition to recognizing previously parasitized hosts, female wasps of some species discriminate between hosts parasitized by themselves and by conspecifics (self-host discrimination). The mechanism of self-host discrimination in the parasitic wasp Pimpla nipponica Uchida was examined. A series of experiments, however, failed to show that females of this species deposit chemical markers on a host during oviposition. Females failed to recognize hosts covered either with pieces of cocoon derived from, or plastic tubes used to conceal, hosts they had previously parasitized. They also recognized hosts that had been superparasitized by conspecifics. Two further experiments supported an alternative hypothesis, that females remember hosts they have parasitized before. Rejection of the first parasitized host decreased markedly after females had attacked two or three hosts, and females cooled to induce amnesia failed to recognize self-parasitized hosts. It is suggested that hosts could smell different enough for a female wasp to discriminate between self- and conspecifically parasitized hosts. The role of short-term memory in the foraging strategies of parasitoid wasps is discussed. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Theory suggests that a male strategy of reducing parental care in response to reduced parentage should evolve only under certain conditions. Expected paternity in subsequent matings is predicted to be primary in effect, because it determines whether there is a future benefit to compensate males for the cost of reduced care. This study, tested whether provisioning of nestlings by socially monogamous male yellow warblers, Dendroica petechia, varied with the males' parentage in the brood and how males' paternity varied in subsequent matings. Analysis included observations of parental care from 40 nests (31 of which had paternity determined by multi-locus DNA fingerprinting) and paternity results from 130 families over 3 years. Male care was variable but unrelated to parentage, and males were observed to provide typical amounts of parental care to broods in which they had no parentage. Individual males' within-pair parentage generally declined within a season (with re-nesting), varied inconsistently between years and was unrelated to age or breeding experience. Survival between breeding seasons was low (30%) and independent of within-pair parentage. These patterns collectively suggest that the benefit of facultatively reducing parental care when parentage is reduced rarely exceeds the costs. Thus, selection for parentage-dependent care is apparently absent or weak, which could explain the absence of parentage-dependent care in this population of yellow warblers.

AB Social, genetic and reproductive consequences of natal dispersal were investigated in female horses, Equus caballus, living in a herd with a natural social structure. Dispersal did not as a rule reduce the level of competition the young mares faced: they did not selectively join groups with fewer resident females than the groups they left, and they did not attain higher ranks; there was also no tendency for females to disperse to groups with the fewest resident females, and they suffered more aggression from the mares in their new groups than in their natal groups. These results therefore do not support the hypothesis that a function of natal dispersal is to reduce intra-sexual competition. The young mares nevertheless dispersed non-randomly, generally joining harems with one stallion and at least two subadult females; and they preferred to move to groups with familiar females but no familiar males. As a result, most were closely related to some females of their new groups, but distantly related or unrelated to the male(s). Since after dispersal the young mares bred only with a male of their new groups, inbreeding coefficients of most (85%) of their offspring were lower than from matings between half siblings. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a function of natal dispersal is to avoid close inbreeding. Dispersal did not appear to involve reproductive costs: the young mares suffered no delay in age at first reproduction, and the survival rates of their first foals tended to be higher if the females had emigrated, although not significantly so.

AB Parental effort by socially monogamous purple martins was measured to test the hypothesis that males reduce care in response to their risk of losing paternity through extra-pair copulations. Male martins occur in two age classes, with one-year-old males cuckolded in very high frequencies and older males achieving nearly complete paternity. This outcome is because females paired to young males pursue a mixed mating strategy of seeking extra-pair copulations, and females paired to old males avoid extra-pair copulations. Using multi-locus DNA fingerprinting to determine paternity, nb evidence was found that males reduced effort according to actual paternity or presumed confidence of paternity. Young and old males provisioned nestlings at similar rates in relative and absolute terms. There was also no relationship within the young age class, with young males provisioning similarly regardless of whether they were cuckolded. Young males achieving zero paternity provisioned similarly to young males achieving partial and complete paternity, suggesting that no threshold effect exists. Although several conditions have been proposed under which no relationship between paternity and male care is expected, these conditions did not exist for purple martins. Another condition under which males should not reduce care to unrelated offspring is proposed, namely, that performing poorly in the presence of potential future mates or extra-pair copulation partners can lower social status and thereby fitness. The 'status hypothesis' provides a perspective for viewing parental performance as a behavioural character on which sexual selection operates.

AB Reproductive conflicts that arise in multiple-queen (polygynous) social insect colonies often lead to behavioural dominance by one queen. No evidence of dominance was found in an intensive study of queen behaviour patterns in colonies of the facultatively polygynous ant Myrmica tahoensis. Colonies were monitored in artificial nests for 228 hours (432 queen-hours). Observations were divided between seven monogynous colonies, nine polygynous colonies, and seven colonies containing one native queen and an unrelated queen that had recently been transplanted into the colony. Aggression rarely occurred between queens in the polygynous colonies, virtually all queens laid eggs, and there was no sign of skew in egg-laying rates. Overall queen activity levels varied considerably between colonies in the three colony types. Queens in monogynous colonies spent more time antennating workers and were groomed more than polygynous queens, whereas polygynous queens laid eggs, handled brood and moved more often. Introduced queens were groomed at a higher rate than queens in naturally polygynous colonies, and queens from naturally polygynous colonies antennated workers, moved, laid eggs and antennated other queens more frequently. Within the introduced-queen colonies, native queens laid eggs and handled brood more frequently than introduced queens. Following the behavioural study, queen-queen relatedness was estimated within the polygynous colonies by means of microsatellite DNA polymorphisms. Queen behaviour patterns were similar regardless of whether queens were close or distant relatives-These results suggest that queens and workers of M. tahoensis behave differently towards newly introduced queens, but do not respond to queen-queen relatedness levels.

AB Because rodents behave cryptically and often have large home ranges, the role of social defence in determining their spatial dispersion in grassland remains an enigma. Individual dispersion and access to resources could be determined mainly by the aggressive exclusion of intruders from large territories by residents, or by the scattered distribution of resources and avoidance of dominant competitors occupying preferred sites. The ways in which predictions from these two hypotheses correspond to intra-sexual competitive behaviour within unfamiliar dyads of the mouse Mus spretus, recently captured from two grassland populations, were examined. A series of tests in enclosures examined (1) exploration by intruders given a choice between a resident's soiled sites versus clean sites, or between resident-soiled sites versus sites bearing their own odour, in the absence of the resident; (2) the response of an intruder on meeting either the resident or another mouse, in an adjacent clean tunnel; and (3) the response of a resident to an intruder compared with mice meeting in a clean enclosure. In both sexes, dyads quickly established dominance relationships through brief attacks and chases, and static defensive postures, rather than persistent pursuit and flight. Intruders were strongly attracted to a resident's nest and subsequently were more aggressive towards the resident than towards an opponent from an unfamiliar enclosure. There was less differentiation in competitive behaviour and more mutual fighting between residents and intruders than between mice in clean enclosures, with relative body weight being the most important factor determining competitive behaviour. The results were thus more consistent with competition for dominance over suitable sites than investment in fierce aggression to drive competitors away.

TI AN IMPROVED TEST OF LINEARITY IN DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES CONTAINING
   UNKNOWN OR TIED RELATIONSHIPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Appleby (1983, Anim. Behav., 31, 600-608) described a statistical test, based on the work of Kendall (1962, Rank Correlation Methods), for the significance of linearity in dominance hierarchies. He suggested that unknown relationships should be assigned the value 1/2 and that subsequently the same test procedure can be used. In this paper it is shown that incorrect results are obtained by this method whenever there are unknown relationships. Values of the linearity index are systematically too low. P-values can be too high (underestimating the significance) or too low (overestimating), and seem to differ by not much more than a factor two (respectively a half) from the correct P-value. An improved method is developed for testing linearity in a set of dominance relationships containing unknown relationships. Furthermore, it is argued that, if one admits the possibility of tied dominance relationships, which should indeed be assigned the value 1/2, Landau's linearity index is to be preferred to Kendall's index. A randomization test is developed for assessing the significance of linearity or non-linearity in a set of dominance relationships containing unknown or tied relationships. The test statistic employed in this testing procedure is based on Landau's linearity index, but takes the unknown and tied relationships into account.

AB Tenacious attachment to the mother's nipples by suckling pups has been observed in many rodent species, but appears to be absent in others. The natural history of this behaviour is reviewed, along with its possible adaptive value. Four hypotheses are extracted from the literature: the antipredator, anti-falling, anti-drowning, and infant-nipple contact hypotheses. These hypotheses are found to be ad hoc and supported by only anecdotal evidence. An alternative hypothesis is presented, that tenacious nipple attachment is an adaptation to sibling competition for maternal resources (nipples and milk). Morphological specialization, developmental time course, and patterns of pup mortality support the new model. The behaviour has been noted only in the Muridae. Quantitative interspecific comparisons within the Muridae demonstrate that tenacious nipple attachment is associated with reproductive tactics that promote sibling competition: breeding by means of litter overlap, low mammary number, and more offspring per mammary.

AB Increased energetic expenditure during lactation must be met either from metabolic stores or by increasing food intake. Additional behavioural costs and constraints may be imposed on those species that conceal their young in a fixed place. This study examines how wild cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus, alter their behaviour during lactation and whether denning involved extra costs or constraints. Females almost doubled their food intake when lactating, although only mothers with cubs in the lair increased the time they spent drinking. Higher levels of food intake were achieved by catching a greater proportion of larger prey items, hunting these at a higher rate and by increasing the success rate of hunts. Lactating females with emerged cubs increased the proportion of time they spent observing and hunting relative to time spent resting and moving. When lactating females had cubs in the lair they were on the move for longer each day, travelled further, had restricted ranging patterns and tended to make more kills in the heat of the day than when accompanied by their cubs. These latter results suggest that the need to find a safe place, near water, in which to conceal immobile and vulnerable cubs may impose additional behavioural constraints and costs on lactating females.

DT Article
ID CICHLASOMA-NIGROFASCIATUM PISCES; PARENTAL INVESTMENT; FISH; EXPERIENCE;
   SUNFISH
AB Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the increase in parental defensive behaviour with brood age: parent re-nesting potential, age-investment, predator revisitation and nest crypsis hypotheses. However, these hypotheses are difficult to separate experimentally because many variables covary with brood age and all hypotheses predict an increase in effort with brood age. In this study, an attempt was made to determine which of these variables convict cichlid, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, parents assess in determining their defence levels at each developmental stage: egg (embryo), wriggler (free-embryo) and fry (larvae). The type of offspring parents had at each stage was manipulated. The experimental group was repeatedly given eggs until the offspring in the control group reached the fry stage, at which time the experimental eggs were allowed to develop. At each stage, parental behaviour was observed to determine whether the groups differed in past investment. Subsequently, a model predator was presented to determine whether the groups differed in defensive behaviour. The results suggest that the increase in parental defence in this species is due to the increased vulnerability of their offspring at the fry stage (nest crypsis hypothesis).

AB In groups of white-winged trumpeters, dominant and subordinate males used different strategies to obtain copulations with the dominant, breeding female. The dominant male initiated copulation attempts slowly and often copulated when subordinate males were standing nearby; in contrast, subordinate males tended to copulate rapidly and surreptitiously, taking advantage of moments when the dominant male was relatively far from the female or engaged in an activity that made it difficult for him to watch the female. The dominant male usually interrupted subordinates' copulation attempts aggressively and always interrupted alone. Subordinate males, however, generally interrupted the dominant simply by approaching him, and collaborated in 19% of their interruptions. Although the dominant male obtained significantly more successful copulations than did subordinate males during the breeding female's fertile period, subordinate males still accounted for one-third of the successful copulations during this period. While relatively few birds or other vertebrates have been reported to breed polyandrously, it is suggested that the frequency with which multiple males sire offspring within a group may be underestimated because of the difficulty of observing copulations by subordinate males in many multi-male groups.

TI LIFETIME LEARNING BY FORAGING HONEY-BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; EVOLUTION; BENEFITS; MEMORY; CHOICE; COSTS
AB It is usually assumed that insects invest little in learning because of their short life span. However, the relative time and energy invested in learning should reflect the potential costs and benefits of learning regardless of absolute life span. As a first step in evaluating lifetime aspects of learning in insects, learning by individual honey bee, Apis mellifera, foragers was assessed based on their foraging success from inception of foraging until death. The net rate of forage uptake by new foragers was low and gradually increased to approximately twice the initial rate after a week of foraging. This period coincided with the median life span of the foragers. Hence, forager honey bees apparently spend a considerable portion of their life span learning and improving their foraging skills.

AB Long-term data on sexual behaviour in Barbary macaques revealed a strong mating inhibition between co-residing maternal relatives, and between those, mostly unrelated, males and females with a caretaking relationship during the female's infancy. Sexual interactions were observed in only 15 out of 371 possible maternal dyads. There was a bias towards distant kin and towards dyads in which the male was older than the female. Sexual interactions were recorded in only two out of 14 former caretaking dyads with a strong relationship but in 10 out of 17 dyads with a weak and/or temporary relationship. Unfamiliar maternal relatives and paternal relatives showed no mating avoidance. Three out of four of these maternal dyads, and 67 out of 133 possible paternal dyads became incestuous. Paternity was determined by DNA-fingerprinting. Almost all paternal dyads became incestuous after more than 2 years of co-residence. Owing to high sexual activities outside the period of conception and the inability of related and unrelated males to monopolize access to fertile females, only two out of 62 potentially inbred infants were actually inbred via the paternal line. Establishment of a mating inhibition but also its absence in some individuals indicated that only familiarity during early life, regardless of genetic relatedness, was responsible for mutual sexual indifference. This mental mechanism of inbreeding avoidance is regarded as an important trigger for male natal migration.

AB The post-breeding moult and fat deposition of adult male bluethroats, Luscinia svecica, were studied in captivity. One group (Control group) was held under light conditions simulating the natural light regime of their moulting grounds at 66 degrees N latitude. The light regime of another group (Shifted group) was similar to the Control group, but shifted 1 month forward, simulating light conditions further into autumn. All birds had food ad libitum. In addition, comparisons were made with free-living bluethroats. There were no differences in moult performance (start and speed) between the Control group and the Shifted group, and moult was similar to that of free-living birds. The start of moult may be endogenously controlled and set earlier in the season so the change in light regime for the Shifted group may have come too late to influence moult performance. The rate of moult may also be inflexible, in spite of the imposed time stress. In addition, bluethroats may moult so fast that further acceleration would hamper flight manoeuvrability and feeding efficiency. Whereas the Control group birds first started to deposit fat when moult was finished, as free-living birds do, the Shifted group birds started fat deposition in mid-moult. Also, the fat deposition rate following completion of moult was higher in the Shifted group. Thus, adult bluethroats can adjust the timing and speed of fat deposition in relation to moult and time of season. Such flexibility should be advantageous for migratory birds moulting at high latitudes where time available between breeding and migration is short.

AB Differences in the feeding behaviour of solitary and groups of three (flocks) adult male zebra finches were investigated. Neophobia (fear and avoidance of new things) was induced by presenting subjects with novel feeders and also adorning the feeders with different novel objects. The results showed that subjects in the flock entered the feeder and began feeding sooner than the solitary birds. The birds in the flock condition also entered the feeder sooner than solitary birds when novel objects adorned the feeder, although the magnitude of the difference depended on the specific object used. Because members of the flock could not directly observe the first member feeding, a 'social following' mechanism seems to describe best the behaviour of flock members, rather than local enhancement.

TI CORRELATES OF RANGE SIZE IN WINTERING WHITE-THROATED SPARROWS,
   ZONOTRICHIA-ALBICOLLIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A 400-m trapline along a hedgerow was used to calculate sizes of winter ranges in a migratory population of 328 white-throated sparrows during three winters. Although range size varied greatly among individuals, the ranges of most sparrows extended for 100 m or less along the trapline. Birds tended to return to the same location and to have ranges of similar sizes from year to year. A multivariate analysis of variables affecting range size revealed that dominant birds tended to have small  ranges, possibly because their dominating ability would decrease if they left familiar areas. Range size also decreased with age, an apparent indication that old and young individuals used space differently in attempting to survive a winter.

TI DENSITY-DEPENDENT MATE SEARCHING STRATEGIES OF MALE WOODFROGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individually marked male woodfrogs, Rana sylvatica, were monitored throughout the night in an unmanipulated aggregation and in an aggregation with artificially reduced density. Males were less active in the low density aggregation. Movement was modelled using a computer simulation that assumed that male movement patterns resulted from chance encounters between searching males. The model successfully predicted the results observed at the low density, but was unable to predict those observed at the high density. This suggests that males may assess density and actively respond to it. A second result was that males in the low density aggregation were more likely to search for mates at the oviposition site, but males in the high density aggregation were more likely to search at the aggregation periphery. This change in behaviour is predicted by a simple evolutionarily stable strategy model.

TI HOMING BEHAVIOR OF DISPLACED STREAM-DWELLING BROWN TROUT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Aspects of resident behaviour in native brown trout, Salmo trutta, were studied in two experiments. In the first experiment, 50% of trout caught by electrofishing were made anosmic by removal of the olfactory rosettes, and then all fish were displaced 200 m either up or downstream. Very few fish lacking the olfactory organ returned to their home area within 9 weeks, but more than 40% of the sham-operated control fish from both the up and downstream displacement groups returned. Sexually  maturing and immature fish returned at the same rate. In the second experiment, some fish from a small tributary brook were released in the main stream, 150 m above the junction with the tributary. Twenty-four per cent returned to their tributary within 9 weeks, demonstrating an ability among the fish to combine negative and positive rheotaxis in homing behaviour. This work shows that stream-dwelling brown trout can return home when displaced outside their normal range, and that olfaction is important for this behaviour.

TI RESOURCE DIVISIBILITY, PREDATION AND GROUP FORMATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A model for foraging groups as a function of physiological state and ecological conditions is developed. The model is motivated by experiments on avian flocks, but applies to other situations as well. The model is based on a dynamic, state variable approach in which a measure of Darwinian fitness is used to relate predation and starvation risks. The experiments concerned the changes of flock sizes when food is added or predators are present, and the observations of Elgar (1986, Anim Behav. 34, 169-174) that the divisibility of the resource affects whether birds call for conspecifics upon finding food. The dynamics of flock formation are briefly discussed.

TI ALARM CALL RESPONSIVITY OF MALLARD DUCKLINGS - MULTIPLE PATHWAYS IN
   BEHAVIORAL-DEVELOPMENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous experiments have demonstrated that mallard ducklings, Anas platyrhynchos, freeze upon initial exposure to the maternal alarm call and that the development of this behaviour depends on perinatal auditory experience, since embryonically devocalized, socially isolated ducklings exhibit significantly reduced levels of freezing. Moreover, exposing devocalized, isolated ducklings to recordings of duckling sounds reinstates the freezing response. In the present study, the authors'' prior  conclusion that auditory experience is necessary for the development of freezng was challenged by socially rearing and socially testing 20 groups of devocalized ducklings. These birds exhibited significantly greater levels of freezing (70%) than did 30 devocalized duckling that had been reared in isolation and tested individually (20%). In fact, their high level of freezing was comparable to that reported on nests in the field (79%) and in laboratory experiments with vocal duckling that had  been reared and tested socially (80%). Thus, altering the developmental and behavioural (or testing) contexts of devocal ducklings reinstates a behaviour that wanes significantly without auditory experience of vocalizations in other contexts. Such auditory experience is sufficient in some rearing and testing contexts (non-social) to promote freezing, but is clearly not necessary in other contexts (social). This exemplifies the concept of multiple pathways in behavioural development, according  to which different development trajectories lead to similar outcomes.

TI SONG PLAYBACK INITIATES NEST BUILDING DURING CLUTCH OVERLAP IN
   MOCKINGBIRDS, MIMUS-POLYGLOTTOS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mockingbirds commonly show clutch overlap, initiating work on a subsequent brood while older young remain dependent on parental care. Several days before the male begins to build a new nest, he resumes singing. The result is a cyclic pattern of singing in which song ceases during the nestling period and recurs each time the male builds a nest. To determine if song can stimulate renesting in the presence of dependent young, and thereby regulate the amount of clutch overlap, mated males were played song earlier in the breeding cycle than they would normally begin to sing. Experimental pairs were played 140 min of mockingbird song per day in their territories beginning at nestling day 6 and continuing through the onset of renesting. They began nest building sooner and built more before the older young fledged than either males that heard no song or two that heard brown thraser, Toxastoma rufum, song. In several pairs hearing mockingbird song, nest building continued after the  stimulus song ceased, and the female laid in the nest begun in response to song. The amount of nest building was positively correlated with the male''s initial aggressive reaction to the speaker playing song, but unrelated to the amount of his own song production. These data constitute the first demonstration in the field of the role of passerine song in re-initiating breeding in established pairs.

Dominant and subordinate males then each sired litters with females that were sisters to each other, not closely related to the males, and derived from an unselected population. Fathers never encountered their sons. A male from each resulting litter was chosen for testing in the enclosure. Through four generations, the sons of dominant males generally were dominant to the sons of subordinate males. These  effects do not appear attributable to differences in age or body mass or to maternal effects. Genetic influences are suggested.

TI THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE LIGHT CUE ON HOMING BEHAVIOR OF THE
   GOLDEN-HAMSTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus W., tend to return directly from a food source at the centre of an experimental arena to their peripheral nest. The subjects'' choice of a particular homing direction was tested in conditions where the animals could use simultaneously a weak light spot from outside the arena and self-generated signals derived from the outward journey to the food source. Conflicts between different categories of directional information were induced by shifting once or repeatedly the light cue from its standard angular position with respect to the nest entrance. While the subjects depended primarily on the light spot as a stable directional cue during minor conflicts, their homing behaviour became less homogeneous and was mainly controlled by self-generated signals when the conflict was increased. The light spot exerted its influence mainly during the phase of food collection, just before the subjects started to return to their nest; however, its impact remained  noticeable even when it was presented only briefly at the beginning of the hoarding excursion, i.e. well before the initiation of the return trip. The choice of a final return vector may therefore imply stepwise information processing, whereby stored and actual values of visual information are compared with cues generated during the preceding outward journey.

TI SOCIAL INFLUENCES ON BARN SWALLOW FORAGING IN THE ADIRONDACKS - A TEST
   OF COMPETING HYPOTHESES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three important predictions of the information-centre hypothesis were tested using a colony of barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, breeding in the Adironacks of central New York. Departures of foraging swallows are clumped in time as would be predicted if information about feeding sites was being obtained by foragers at the colony. Departure synchrony was probably increased by the tendency for foraging birds to follow their mates away from the colony. Two of the predictions of information transfer were not supported by the study: (1) birds leaving close together in time did not travel to the same foraging areas, and (2) previously unsuccessful foragers were not more likely to follow others away from the colonly on subsequent feeding trips than were previously successful foragers. Foraging swallows were approached more often by conspecifics than non-foraging swallows were, suggesting that barn swallows may cue in on successfully feeding conspecifics when searching for foraging areas. Swallows do not appear to benefit by increasing their prey capture rates in groups, suggesting that foraging groups of barn swallows may simply be aggregations of birds using insect patches in an ''ideal-free'' or opportunistic manner.

TI THE ENERGETIC COST OF DISPLAY IN MALE SAGE GROUSE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The energetic expenditure of displaying male sage grouse. Centrocercus urophasianus, was measured for 18 individuals in the field using the doubly labelled water technique. Daily energy expenditure increased significantly with increased display rate, increased time spent on the lek, and decreased ambient temperature. Daily energy expenditure for the most vigorously displaying males was two times higher than for a non-displaying male and four times higher than basal metabolic rate. Estimates of the instantaneous rate of energy expenditure during display ranged from 13.9 to 17.4 times basal metabolic rate. The effort devoted to display differed markedly among males and was correlated with certain other male characteristics. Males that attended leks were in better condition (higher body weight relative to size) than non-attenders, but among lek attenders condition was negatively correlated with increased display effort. Active displayers lost less weight per day and foraged further from the lek than less active males, suggesting that differences in foraging and food intake affect daily energy output. Neither blood parasites nor the potential effects of other diseases as determined by haematocrit levels were associated with display effort.

TI FRONTAL AND LATERAL VISUAL-FIELD USE BY CHICKS AFTER TREATMENT WITH
   TESTOSTERONE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Control and testosterone-treated chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, differentially used the frontal and lateral fields of vision in two tasks requiring search for food. In the first task the chicks had to peck at moving food sources. The tracking head movements made by the controls were much larger than those made by the testosterone-treated chicks, at all the speeds of movement of the food sources and after both 2 h and 6 h of food deprivation. Controls wearing hoods which obstructed lateral  vision showed head movements similar to those of testosterone-treated chicks, suggesting that the latter make less use of lateral vision. The larger tracking movements of the head could be elicited in testosterone-treated chicks by spacing the food dishes further apart. In the second task requiring search for grains of food concealed on a checkerboard background, the controls used the monocular, lateral field to sight the grain at a distance, whereas the treated chicks made much less use of the  lateral field and detected the grain at a shorter distance from its site, using a strategy acquired during training. Unlike the controls, the testosterone-treated chicks also returned to sites where they had previously gained a food reward, and often returned to the start. A number of additional measures were scored in each task. It is concluded that testosterone-treated chicks specify more stably their plans for search, and they are more fixed in their specification of the position in which food is to be expected. It is argued that it is this specification of position that leads testosterone-treated chicks to focus on use of the frontal field and so pay less attention to the stimuli in the lateral fields of vision.

TI ULTRAVIOLET VISUAL SENSITIVITY IN DESERT IGUANAS - IMPLICATIONS FOR
   PHEROMONE DETECTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behavioural tests comparing the responses of desert iguanas, Dipsosaurus dorsalis, to conspecific femoral gland secretions and to controls showed that the secretions are relatively non-volatile, but possess pheromonal activity at close range. Low volatility ensures that these secretions remain in the environment longer, but makes signal localization by airborne olfactory cues difficult. Spectroscopic analyses of desert iguana femoral gland secretions revealed that they strongly absorb  longwave ultraviolet light. Behavioural bioassays in which lizards were presented with secretion-marked and blank control tiles under both ultraviolet and incandescent light conditions demonstrated the importance of an ultraviolet light source for successful detection of femoral gland deposits. Further tests measuring the lizards'' success rate in localizing an ultraviolet-absorbing ink spot under ultraviolet and incandescent light conditions suggested desert iguanas have visual sensitivity in  the near ultraviolet part of the light spectrum. The existence of an ultraviolet visual marker provides a possible mechanism for locating these low volatility pheromones.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Song repertoire size, time to first territory acquisition, territory size, territory tenure and lifetime reproductive success were measured in males of known age in a wild, resident population of song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. One-year-old males had smaller repertoires than older males, but this apparent change in repertoire size was due to attrition of individuals with small repertoires rather than to an increase in the repertoire size of individuals with age. Males with large repertoires held territories longer and had greater annual and lifetime reproductive success than males with small repertoires. Half-hour repertoire size, which may represent an ecologically more relevant measure of repertoire size perceived by a transient listener, was also positively related to territory tenure and annual reproductive success. Thus listeners might be able to assess a singing male''s competitive ability without sampling the entire repertoire.

AB The impact of sex and age on the nature of dominance hierarchies in black-billed magpies, Pica pica, was investigated. Dominance hierarchies were looked for in 11 unisexual groups each with 10 captive magpies, and 32 mixed-sex groups each with five captive magpies. Strongly linear hierarchies were found in all nine unisexual groups of 10 males. Of the two groups of 10 females observed, one was not linear and the other only marginally so. The occurrence of dominance reversals was 25 times  greater in female than in male groups. The difference in dominance relationships between the sexes is discussed in relation to differences in the roles that the two sexes play in the breeding biology of magpies. In all 32 groups of five magpies of mixed sex and age, the most dominant bird was a male, in 23 cases a juvenile and in nine an adult. Possible asymmetries between adults and juveniles in foraging efficiency and familiarity with the environment, postulated to explain differences in dominance status of age cohorts, were experimentally excluded in the captive situation. Thus, such asymmetries cannot be invoked to explain the dominance of juveniles over adults in the captive situation. The apparent contradiction between the higher dominance status of juvenile males and their lower reproductive success is discussed.

TI SUDDEN REVERSAL OF PHOTOTAXIS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NESTLING BIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Starling, Sturnus vulgaris, nestlings from about 10 days of age moved away from light, i.e. they were negatively phototactic. However, several days before fledging, they changed to move towards light, probably a necessary prerequisite for fledging. The phototactic reversal was correlated with physical development and the ability to fly. In contrast to most studies of newly acquired behaviour, there was no change in response time associated with the reversal. However, hunger reduced the response time of hand-reared nestlings. It is suggested that a positive phototaxis for strong fliers or negative phototaxis for flightless young is an adaptive escape response. The reversal of phototaxis is probably a general feature of avian development.

TI THE TRANSMISSION OF YEASTS BY DROSOPHILA-BUZZATII DURING COURTSHIP AND
   MATING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The transmission of yeasts from generation to generation for Drosophila buzzatii was shown to occur vertically through the pupal stage and horizontally during mating. Males and females transmitted yeasts to the opposite sex most often during mating but also during courtship. Yeasts transferred from the male to the female were more often associated with the abdomens of the females, while yeasts transferred from the female to the male were associated with both the head and the abdomen of the  male. Mate choice was affected by the previous yeast diet of both males and females. Yeast transmission during courtship and mating represents the potential for parental care because mate choice is affected by previous yeast diet, and progeny development is a function of the yeasts inoculated onto the larval substrate by the adults.

TI MATING SEASON EFFECTS ON MOTHER INFANT CONFLICT IN JAPANESE MACAQUES,
   MACACA-FUSCATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The impact of seasonal mating on the mother-infant relationship during the first year of the infant''s life was documented in a confined troop of Japanese macaques. During the weeks in which the mothers were being mounted, negative behaviour directed towards the infants increased. As maternal rejections and punishments escalated, the infants displayed regressive behaviour (showing signs of distress more frequently). Infants also groomed their mothers at an increased rate at this time. Behaviour that indicated increased independence did not show increases during this time. Moreover, behaviour negatively associated with independence, such as ventral contact and proximity to the mother, remained stable throughout this time period. The mother-infant relationship undergoes a period of conflict during the mating season not because the mother is weaning her infant, but because it is to her reproductive advantage to regulate the times in which the infant is allowed to suckle.

TI AGGRESSION IN HARLEQUIN FROGS - MALE-MALE COMPETITION AND A POSSIBLE
   CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN THE SEXES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Long-term field observations and experimental manipulations were made on a population of harlequin frogs, Atelopus varius, in Costa Rica to document seasonality of intra- and intersexual aggression, determine the function of aggression, and identify the factors that influence success in aggressive encounters. Both males and females defended portions of their home range and exhibited site fidelity. Males were more aggressive towards other males during the pre-breeding and breeding seasons, whereas females were more aggressive towards other females during the post-breeding season. For up to several months prior to oviposition, males attempted to amplex (clasp) females without courtship behavior, while females chased males from their territories and attempted to dislodge males that amplexed them. In staged encounters the winner was usually the apparent resident, regardless of body size. Frogs from a high-density population were more aggressive than individuals from a low-density population. Subadult males were as aggressive and as likely to win encounters as a adult males. The function of aggression seemed to be related to the bizarre reproductive behavior observed in these frogs. There seemed to be male-male competition for mates, as the operational sex ratio strongly favored males, oviposition was asynchronous, and amplexus lasted for at least several weeks. Female-female aggression may have been related to defense of foraging or shelter sites, but aggression towards males was likely to be an attempt to thwart unwanted amplexus.

TI DO PINYON JAYS ALTER NEST PLACEMENT BASED ON PRIOR EXPERIENCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of prior experience in nest-site selection by a long-lived corvid, the pinyon jay, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus, was investigated. The major sources of nest failure were loss to avian predators (Corvus corax and Corvus brachyhynchos) and abandonment after cold and snowy spring weather. Cold weather favours exposed nesting because solar radiation reduces the energetic costs to nesting females and quickly melts snow in and around the nest. Predation favours cryptic nests. The relative  height at which individual jays nested (an index of nest exposure) was compared to their previous nest height and to the fate of that nesting attempt. For the following reasons jays appear to associate nest exposure with the fate of a particular nesting attempt: (1) after nesting in exposed sites, subsequent nests were 27.3% lower (more concealed) in the nest tree following predation, but only 9.7% lower when predation did not occur; (2) concealed nest sites were avoided only after failure due  to cold weather; and (3) nest placement following the successful fledging of young did not differ significantly from the previous nest placement. The frequency of nesting in exposed locations dropped from 80% to 55% after individuals suffered their third predatory experience when nesting in exposed locations. Experienced jays nested relatively low throughout the season, which enhances concealment, but nested farther out from the trunk early in the season, which reduces incubation costs. The use  of prior experience in nest-site selection is adaptive because sites can include properties associated with past success and exclude those associated with past failure.

TI THE EFFECTS OF SEXUAL SELECTION ON THE FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF THE
   GULF-COAST FIDDLER-CRAB, UCA-PANACEA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sexual selection has resulted in sexually dimorphic appendages in the Gulf Coast fiddler crab. Male crabs possess one enlarged major claw used for mate attraction and one normal-sized feeding claw, while females possess two functional feeding claws. The hypothesis that males modify their foraging relative to females to reduce the ''cost'' of this non-functional feeding appendage was tested. Behavioural (increased foraging time or rate, priority of access to areas of higher organic (food) content) and morphological (greater efficiency of extracting or processing food material) mechanisms were investigated. Increased foraging rates coupled with a larger functional feeding claw allowed male U. panacea to maintain an energy intake equivalent to that of females. Natural selection has produced behavioural and morphological mechanisms that restore the loss of foraging ability caused by sexual selection for increased major claw size.

TI CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN DOMINANCE RELATIONS AMONG FEMALE BABOONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female baboons, Papio cynocephalus, in Amboseli National Park establish linear dominance hierarchies in which maternal kin usually occupy adjacent ranks. Previous work had shown that few changes in the relative rank order of matrilines had occurred betweeen 1971 and 1981 (Hausfater et al. 1982). During a 9-month period beginning in December 1982, the rate and magnitude of changes in matrilineal rank order accelerated. Major changes in the relative ranks of members of a few matrilines resulted in changes in the absolute ranks of females of all but one matriline. However, the ordering between many pairs of matrilines did not change and genealogical structure of dominance relations was generally maintained. This brief period of rapid change was succeeded by a period of slow change and relative stability in dominance relations, lasting at least 27 months. Data from the 15-year period suggest that the rates of change in female dominance relations are variable: long periods of stability are sometimes punctuated by short periods of instability and change. No single explanation accounted for this variability.

TI EXPOSURE AND TIME USE IN WILLOW TIT FLOCKS - THE COST OF SUBORDINATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Time budgets of wintering willow tits, Parus montanus, differed between tree species (spruce and pine) and between different portions of trees. Habital use appeared to be governed by a trade-off between feeding and being vigilant. Time-economizing favoured flocking, since the improved predator protection in flocks allowed savings in vigilance time to be made; dominant status further gave a net benefit in less time spent being vigilant because dominants had access to protected sites. This  suggests that flock size is determined by the stable outcome to the dominant-subordinate conflict rather than by a solution that is optimal to all members. Subordinates are relegated to more exposed parts of the habitat and suffer a cost in spending more time being vigilant. Subordinates still make a net profit in joining flocks, however, and their participation can be viewed as a time-saving behaviour.

AB Sibling and neighbor recognition were examined using wild-caught juvenile muskrats, Ondatra zibethicus, of known sibship in dyadic encounters. Behavioral asymmetry between sibling and non-sibling dyads indicated the presence of sibling recognition. Recognition of neighbors was examined using indices of agonistic and amicable behavior calculated using exclusively non-sibling dyads. The distance between captures within non-sibling dayds was used to approximate familiarity. Amicable behavior decreased significantly with increasing distance between captures, and, therefore, with decreasing familiarity. Agonistic behavior was not correlated with distance between captures.

TI TERRITORY INHERITANCE AND THE EVOLUTION OF GROUP-LIVING IN CARNIVORES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The Territory Inheritance Hypothesis (TIH) on the evolution of group-living in carnivores considers (1) the increased fitness of the original territory holders when they ensure that the territory will be inherited by a carrier of their own genes, and (2) the increased fitness of a subadult that remains at home and survives in an otherwise saturated environment. A comparison of the fitness of both adults and subadults (at different rates of population growth and adult survival) who either do or  do not choose the strategy of building up a group, indicates that groups are favoured in decreasing to slightly increasing populations at moderate to high (> 0.5) annual rates of adult survival. Furthermore, an analysis of maximum group size under the TIH suggests that groups of five or more adults should split up. The TIH as an explanation for group-living in the red fox, Vulpes, vulpes L., and the badger, Meles meles L., is compared with the Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH, Macdonald 1983) and the Constant Territory Size Hypothesis (CTSH, von Schantz 1984a), which consider spatio-temporal fluctuations in food supply. The RDH is the best explanation of social organization in the badger; the RDH and the CTSH both explain red fox data under special conditions, but are not satisfactory as general explanations of group-living in this species; the TIH may explain why group-living, at least once it is established, is a stable strategy.

TI ORGANIZATION AND ONTOGENY OF ALTERNATIVE TACTICS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Review
AB This paper considers the ways in which substantial discontinuous variation in behaviour (called alternative tactics) arise during the course of the lives of individuals. First, it considers a scheme into which examples of alternative tactics can be placed. This scheme reveals specific assumptions that are frequently made about alternative tactics and the problems involved in their measurement. The paper then discusses the shortcomings of dichotomizing alternative tactics into discrete  categories, focusing particularly on the genes/environment distinction. Developmental phenomena that can give rise to discontinuous variation in behaviour are then related to specific examples from species that show alternative tactics. Several developmental phenomena are likely to be involved in the origins of any particular case of intraspecific variation in behaviour. Factors in development may have canalizing effects, facilitating effects, or they may maintain variation in behaviour. They may also enable alternative tactics to occur or initiate their appearance in either juveniles or adults. Three aspects of the processes involved in generating such variation in behaviour are also discussed. These are the interactions between genetic and environmental influences, alternative routes in development, and learning. However, in no case is a particular developmental phenomenon or process likely to be solely responsible for a particular example of discontinuous variation in behaviour; new  ontogenetic analyses are required to uncover the multiple influences.

DT Article
AB Experiments were performed to compare homospecific and heterospecific species choice in two closely related species of white-footed mice, Peromyscus californicus and P. eremicus. Both species significantly chose the homospecific stimulus animal. Significant homospecific choice was made by mice from sympatric but not from allopatric populations. Reciprocal cross-fostering between the two species resulted in significant choice for the heterospecific (foster) species by P. eremicus, and  random choice by cross-fostered P. californicus. Laboratory-reared controls chose significantly for the homospecific chamber. No significant difference in choice performance was demonstrated between males and females, even when the oestrus stages of the females (both stimulus and test animals) were statistically controlled. A comparison of different test durations and temporal regimes of data collection was performed and 90 min was found to be the most efficient experiment duration with our apparatus.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF KINSHIP AND SOCIALIZATION ON AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR IN
   RHESUS-MONKEYS (MACACA-MULATTA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Among the 100 rhesus monkeys living in a social group studied over a period of 17 months, group members showed disproportionately more aggression to kin than non-kin. Mothers were particularly likely to show aggression towards offspring. The more extreme forms of response involving contact aggression were most often directed towards kin, particularly younger kin. Aggression received from kin declined as animals matured; the decline was more rapid for males than females. By adolescence, males no longer received disproportionately more aggression from kin and, as adults, natal males received significantly less aggression from kin. The forms of agonistic expression directed toward kin did not include mobbing a defeated victim or joining the aggression of another group member against kin. Females of all ages directed their agonistic behaviour disproportionately more often toward kin, whereas the relative frequency of male agonistic involvement with kin decreased with age. These data support the hypothesis that aggression is used as one of the mechanisms in socialization and that matrilines are particularly active in the socialization of immature rhesus monkeys.

TI EXCHANGEABLE PRODUCER AND SCROUNGER ROLES IN A CAPTIVE FLOCK OF FERAL
   PIGEONS - A CASE FOR THE SKILL POOL EFFECT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB We investigated the foraging producer-scrounger system of a captive flock of feral pigeons (Columba livia) by monitoring the number of food patches each individual produced. In one experiment, three different patch types were tested on the whole flock while, in a second, flock composition was varied for one patch type. In all cases we found non-uniform distributions of the number of patches produced per individual, which suggests the existence of producer and scrounger roles. This result  could not be explained by either dominance or variability in individual learning ability. Individuals switched roles in response to changes both in food patch type and flock composition. These results are discussed in light of the skill pool hypothesis, which suggests that, in a group, different foraging specialists will profit by parasitizing each other''s food discoveries.

TI STIMULUS-CONTROL OF PREDATORY BEHAVIOR IN RED SPITTING COBRAS
   (NAJA-MOSSAMBICA-PALLIDA) AND PRAIRIE RATTLESNAKES (CROTALUS-V-VIRIDIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two experiments examined the responses of red splitting cobras (Naja mossambica pallida) to stimulus properties of rodent prey. In experiment 1 cobras exhibited elevated rates of tongue flicking (RTF) and trail-following behaviour after striking mice and after 15-s presentations of visual-chemical-thermal cues arising from mice held just out of striking range. Disturbance with a clean snake hook did not produce similar effects. In experiment 2 these cobras were compared with prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus v. viridis). All snakes were exposed to five stimulus conditions in their cages: (1) 3 s of disturbance (D) with a clean snake hook; (2) 15 s of D; (3) 3 s inspection of a live mouse held out of striking range (NS); (4) 15 s of NS; and (5) a presentation of a live mouse inside striking range (S). The snakes always struck in the latter condition, usually within 3 s. Rattlesnakes exhibited elevated RTF only after S, whereas cobras did so after 15 s of both NS and S. The  performance of rattlesnakes was consistent with the assumption that these animals are ambushers; that of cobras was consistent with the assumption that these animals are active hunters which will chase and catch visually detected prey.

TI ORB-WEB VISIBILITY - THE INFLUENCE OF INSECT FLIGHT BEHAVIOR AND VISUAL
   PHYSIOLOGY ON THE EVOLUTION OF WEB DESIGNS WITHIN THE ARANEOIDEA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Ecological differentiation among spiders that build orb-webs depends on the ability of webs both to absorb the kinetic energy of prey impact and to intercept prey (web visibility). Analyses of Diptera flying near webs show that Drosophila melanogaster Meigen avoids high-fibre-density orb-webs sooner than they avoid low-fibre-density webs. From analyses of the flight potential and visual capabilities of D. melanogaster, Trichoporosopon digitatum (Rondani) and Culex quinquesfasciatus Say,  it seems surprising that orb-webs capture any prey at all. The thin diameter and refractive properties of web silks give spider webs a translucent quality that greatly reduces visibility. Web suspension in low- and diffuse-light environments, as well as against visually confused backgrounds, decreases one of the most important visual cues for prey, contrast between the web and its background. Among spiders that capture prey which are characterized by specialized visual and flight capabilities,  oscillating webs and three-dimensional webs may enhance web capture effectiveness. Web oscillation and the static distortion of the plane of some orb-webs allow webs to escape from the range of visual resolution of potential prey.

TI FAMILIARITY AND FEMALE MATE CHOICE IN 2 SPECIES OF VOLES
   (MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER AND MICROTUS-MONTANUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of familiarity on female mate choice was examined in prarie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) and montane voles (M. montanus). In experiment I females were given simultaneous access to a male with which they had just mated and to a novel male. Prairie vole females mated preferentially and spent more time with familiar males; montane voles showed no preference. Experiment II consisted of two tests in which familiarity was established by housing a female across a wire mesh barrier from a male for 2 weeks. Female prairie voles showed no preference based on familiarity. Overriding any effect of adjacent housing was a preference in the second test for the male from which they received their first ejaculate in test 1. Montaine voles spent more time with the unfamiliar male. Therefore, in prairie but not montane voles, copulation and/or the receipt of an ejaculate appears to be responsible for the ''stamping in'' of a preference for a particular male. These results suggest that finely tuned differences in a female''s reproductive reponses to familiar and unfamiliar males may be proximate behaviour processes underlying species differences in mating systems.

TI RELATIONSHIP OF PLUMAGE VARIABILITY, SIZE AND SEX TO SOCIAL-DOMINANCE IN
   HARRIS SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a previous paper I suggested that the plumage variability associated with signalling properties might be of a two-state nature and reflect age-signalling in Harris'' sparrows (Zonotrichia querula). To test this idea, I investigated the degree to which the signal might be correlated with dominance status in captive flocks. Rohwer''s plumage index was estimated and 15 other variables were examined (seven morphological and eight plumage characteristics) to evaluate measures that could be associated with dominance rank. In general, dark-throated birds dominated light-throated birds as expected but, within these broad classes, throat colour was not a close predictor of dominance status in small groups of birds. In the large group (27 birds), dominance rank was correlated to the plumage rank of adult females. The best overall predictor of dominance was wing length. Analysis of quantitative measurement of plumage characteristics showed that blackness on the throat, forehead and lores were correlated and appear to be the basis of Rohwer''s index. In addition, a high degree of individual variability in pattern of breast spotting was documented and may function in individual recognition.

TI SUCROSE-STIMULATED SEARCHING BEHAVIOR OF DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER IN A
   UNIFORM HABITAT - MODULATION BY PERIOD OF DEPRIVATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The local searching behavior of sucrose-fed, apterous D. melanogaster was analyzed to quantify the effects of starvation on search parameters and to determine is a genetic dissection of local searching behavior was feasible. Three distinct ''searching state'' were observed: pre-feeding ranging prior to feeding, local seraching immediately following feeding, and post-feeding ranging after local searching was terminated. Differences between the 1st and 3rd states indicate that the searching behavior of D. melanogaster is not a simple alternation between ranging and local searching. Unfed D. melanogaster is not a simple alternation between ranging and local searching. Unfed D. melanogaster females walk relatively straight in the horizontal plane, a phase of searching referred to as pre-feeding ranging. Locomotory rate declines as the period of starvation increases from 0 to 48 h. Time actually spent moving increases to a maximum at 3-12 h of starvation and then declines. Satiated flies and flies starved for 48 h move very little. After a fly feeds on a drop of sucrose, its local searching is characterized by a decrease in locomotory rate and an increase in turning rate. These values then decay to post-feeding asymptotes. Flies starved longer than 24 h exhibit a somewhat different pattern of changes in the motor values. The duration of local searching increases with the period of starvation. ''Thoroughness'' values, a combination of path length and minimum circumscriptive circle, demonstrated that there were periodic bouts of searching, and a decline over time in the amplitude of area-restricted searching. The relative time spent ranging and searching and the rate of movement during these activities are discussed in terms of differing energy reserves resulting from a balance between the period of starvation and food intake.

TI THE EXCLUSION OF AVIAN PREDATORS FROM AGGREGATIONS OF NESTING LAPWINGS
   (VANELLUS-VANELLUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Territorial lapwings in Aberdeenshire, Scotland [UK], largely prevented carrion crows (Corvus corone), their main egg predators, from approaching close to nest-sites and from entering the area within an aggregation of 11 nests. Predation rates of artificial nests were significantly lower when placed within 10 m of active lapwing nests than when > 200 m from nest-sites, indicating that the presence of lapwings afforded protection from crow predation. Further artifical nest experiments showed that the amount of protection declined linearly with increasing distance from the nest-site, and some degree of protection occurred to at least 30-50 m from it. The size of this protected zone was apparently related to the number of lapwing nests present, and the survival time of eggs in artificial nests reflected the lapwings'' nesting density. The defended zones around each lapwing nest overlapped appreciably in dense or large nesting aggregations, leading to the observed protection by generally excluding crows from the nesting area.

TI DISTRESS CALL ALTERNATION IN HAND-REARED GOSLINGS (ANSER-INDICUS) -
   VOCAL CO-OPERATION BETWEEN SIBLINGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hand-reared bar-headed goslings (A. indicus) isolated in pairs tend to alternate their distress calling. This phenomenon has earlier been reported for ducklings by other authors, who suggested a co-operative function in attracting the parent(s). In this paper 6 possible functions are considered: co-operation between siblings; non-interference (not calling when other sounds interfere with the signal); orientation response (listening to other sounds); calm down response (reducing arousal when sounds are heard); approach response (approach instead of calling when parent calls); and fear response (inhibition of calling when fear-provoking stimuli are heard). Playback experiments showed that the goslings alternated more with some low-frequency sounds (electric buzzer, adult excitement calls) than with the much higher distress calls of siblings or other goslings, which were the most attractive for parent geese. When silent, the subjects increased locomotion and did not show listening behavior. The results seem most compatible with a fear response function, and it is suggested that alternation with siblings might be an artifact. Difficulties in measuring the alternation tendency are discussed.

TI EVIDENCE FOR SEARCH IMAGE IN BLACKBIRDS TURDUS-MERULA L - LONG-TERM
   LEARNING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The feeding behavior of free-flying and captive blackbirds Turdus merula L. was observed over a number of days to investigate their ability to see cryptic food. Sequences of eight tests which contained equal numbers of ''cryptic'' and ''conspicious'' tests were presented to the birds of the first two experiments. The blackbirds in experiment 1 increased their feeding rate for both cryptic and conspicuous food, which suggest that search images were not acquired but that the physical acts of  feeding were perfected (or that they altered their acceptance of green food). In contrast, the ''residual search time'' (the bird''s total search time minus handling and movement times) decreased over the series of four tests with cryptic green prey, but remained constant over the four tests with conspicuous prey (experiment 2). The blackbirds exploited the cryptic prey using their previous experience of searching for such food. This suggests that search images can be effective over eight feeding  sessions, spanning 4-30 days. Similar results were obtained over a 9-day period with four juvenile blackbirds in captivity (experiment 3). With experience they also became expert in their assessment of backgrounds set up without prey.

TI THE SOCIAL TRANSMISSION OF A FOOD-FINDING TECHNIQUE IN PIGEONS - WHAT IS

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experimentally-naive pigeons (Columbia livia) were exposed to varying amounts of socially transmitted information needed for solving a food-finding problem. Observer pigeons that saw a trained bird (model) piercing the paper covering a food box and eating were able to solve the problem faster and more efficiently than pigeons that only saw the model eating but not piercing. This result held whether observer performance was simultaneous or deferred with respect to model''s demonstration. Pigeons that saw the model pierwing but not eating showed almost no tendency to copy. Copying was dependent upon observer recognition of the fact that the model was getting a food reward, and that pigeons were capable of learning aspects of the piercing technique by observation rather than by trial and error.

   TERMINATION OF REPRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY IN THEIR UNTREATED MATES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Estradiol treatment of free-ranging female song sparrows delays the normal, late summer, termination of reproductive behavior not only in treated females, but also in their untreated mates. Males mated to estradiol-implanted females continued to respond to experimental playbacks of tape-recorded song after control males had ceased territorial defense. Experimental birds remained paired on their summer breeding territories for up to 3 mo. after the controls had terminated reproductive activity. Elevated levels of plasma testosterone were maintained well into the autumn in experimental males. The data suggest a major role for behavioral interactions in the temporal modulation of seasonal reproductive activity.

AB Patterns of spacing in the butterflyfish Chaetodon trifasciatus (Pisces, Chaetodontidae) were studied in two habitats on the southern Great Barrier Reef. Pairs of fish were found to defend territories at reef slope and lagoon study sites. Territories were 2.7-3.7 times larger in the lagoon than on the reef slope, where population density and food abundance were greater. No significant changes occurred in the sizes of territories in either habitat over one year, but patterns of spacing were generally more variable in the lagoon habitat. This was interpreted as a response to low population density and poor habitat quality.

TI TERRITORIAL DEFENSE AND MATING SUCCESS IN MALES OF THE SMALL HEATH
   BUTTERFLY, COENONYMPHA-PAMPHILUS L (LEPIDOPTERA, SATYRIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It has long been recognized that territorial defense in male butterflies must be some sort of mating strategy and that the territories are used as mating stations. However, so far, no systematic study has established the adaptive significance of territorial behavior. This study is an attempt to fill this gap. By comparing the distribution of territories with the distribution of locations where wild and released virgin females mated this study shows that, in the small heath butterfly  (Coenonympha pamphilus), males in territories have higher mating success than males outside territories. This supports the hypotheses that the function of territorial behavior is to secure more matings and the the territories are mating stations. Wing length measurements suggest the same. Large males residing in territories tended to mate more often than small males, which were usually found outside territories. Since resident males were larger than non-resident males, this size difference was used to see how territorial occupancy influenced longevity. Mark-recapture of measured males revealed no significant correlation between wing length and the further life expectancy of males, strongly suggesting that the mating success of males in territories is also higher when measured over their whole lifetime.

TI SOME ETHICAL ISSUES RAISED BY STUDIES OF PREDATION AND AGGRESSION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Some of the ethical issues raised by studies of predator-prey and aggressive interactions when these involve artificially-staged encounters are discussed. Such experiments call for special care in ensuring that a maximum of information is gained and a minimum of suffering caused. The theoretical importance of the question at issue should be considered, the behavior should be recorded accurately and the possibility of collaborative experiments should be explored. Field studies of natural  encounters should be used wherever possible. Where staged encounters are necessary, the use of model predators should be considered, the number of subjects kept to a minimum and the experiments made as short as possible.

TI FLIGHT BEHAVIOR OF SHARP-SHINNED HAWKS DURING MIGRATION .2. OVER WATER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior of sharp-shined hawks (Accipiter striatus) confronted by water barriers was examined during fall migration at Cape May Point, New Jersey (Delaware Bay) [USA], and during spring migration at Whitefish Point, Michigan (Lake Superior) [USA]. Both study sites were at the end of long peninsulas where hawks must either cross approximately 18-24 km of water or fly hundreds of kilometers around the water barriers. Sharp-shinned hawks readily crossed at both sites when winds lateral (perpendicular) to crossing directions were light, but rarely when winds were strong, suggesting that they preferred to cross when the potential for being blown off course was minimal. A greater proportion of hawks also crossed when flight at the shoreline was at high as opposed to low altitudes, and when land on the opposite side of the water barrier was visible. At Cape May, hawks compensated for lateral winds of up to 6 m/s during flights over water, although very few birds attempted to cross when lateral winds exceeded 5 m/s. At Whitefish, hawks compensated only partially for lateral winds. The difference in realized flight direction between sites was attributable to differing topographies, not to a difference in the hawks'' ability to compensate for lateral wind. There may be a threshold for drift at lateral winds between 5 and 8 m/s for sharp-shinned hawks using powered flight over water.

TI SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL COMPONENTS OF THE MATING SYSTEMS OF KUDU BULLS AND
   RED DEER STAGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations were made on greater kudu (T. strepsiceros) in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Data on movement patterns, courtship, dominance interactions and proportion of time spent in various activities by males during the breeding season are presented. Comparative data on the apportionment of time by red deer (C. elaphus) stags were obtained on the Isle of Rhum, Scotland [UK]. While spatial components of male reproductive behavior were similar in the 2 spp., time-investments differed markedly. Kudu bulls showed little change in time spent feeding and moving during the breeding season, did not herd females and tolerated the presence of younger males. In contrast, red deer stags almost ceased feeding and greatly increased their time spent moving and in sexual or dominance-related activities. Thus the spatial and temporal components of male mating strategies can vary independently, and require separate evolutionary explanations. Comparative data for other ungulates are sparse, but suggest that time-investments are influenced by the duration of the breeding season and the breeding sex ratio. Kudu bulls incur high mortality costs despite their low time-investments in reproductive activities.

TI MALE PARENTAL CARE AND ITS ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE IN A NEOTROPICAL FROG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the Puerto Rican frog Eleutherodactylus cogui, parental care is performed exclusively by males and consists of attending the eggs and hatchlings at a terrestrial oviposition site. The 2 major behavioral components of parental care are egg brooding and nest defense against conspecific egg cannibals. Defense behavior includes aggressive calling, biting, sustained biting, wrestling and blocking directed against nest intruders. Parental care lasts from oviposition to hatching (17-26 days) and  often for several days after hatching. During pre-hatching development males are present in their nests 97.4% of the time during the day and 75.8% of the time at night. A large portion of this time is spent brooding eggs. In a field experiment, males were removed from their nests and the fate of clutches was monitored. Compared to control clutches (males not removed), experimental clutches had significantly lower hatching success and suffered significantly greater mortality from desiccation and  cannibalism. Parental care yields significant benefits to male fitness via increased offspring survival.

TI OPTIMAL DIET MODELS AND RODENT FOOD-CONSUMPTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Generalizations derived from simple optimal diet models were field-tested at forest feeding stations where a choice of 2 foods was offered. The relationship between food availability and consumption by 3 spp. of rodents (Peromyscus maniculatus, Clethrionomys gapperi and Napaeozapus insignis) was examined in 5 separate experiments. In all 5 cases rodents preferred the food which yielded the highest caloric gain per unit handling time, as predicted by the simple models. In all 5 cases, less preferred items were sampled even when they were not part of the optimal diet. In 3 cases the consumption of the non-preferred food type varied with its abundance and in 1 case food preference changed with its availability. These rodents do not use simple optimal diet strategies.

TI DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES TO VISUAL AND ACOUSTIC CUES DURING ESCAPE IN THE
   BAT ANOURA-GEOFFROYI - CUE PREFERENCES AND BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Wild A. geoffroyi tested in their home cave can use either visual or acoustic cues to guide their escape from a Y-maze; but they selectively attend to the visual cue whenever possible. When orienting visually, bats choose to head for the light which in a cave marks the exit. When forced to orient acoustically, bats select a closed runway and hang up to roost. With each of the 6 combinations of visual and acoustic cues tested, bats emit echolocation cries in most trials and indicate by their behavior that they are aware of the acoustic parameters of their surroundings. They select their escape route visually whenever possible, disregarding seemingly pertinent acoustic information. This persistent attention to the visual cue was even more marked when captive bats were tested in the laboratory. The results distinguish the functions of vision and echolocation and show the complex relationship between these 2 senses in microchiropteran bats.

TI THE ONTOGENY OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH GROUP COMPANIONS AMONG
   FREE-RANGING INFANT RHESUS-MONKEYS .1. SOCIAL NETWORKS AND
   DIFFERENTIATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Social networks of infant rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) in a free-ranging, lineage-based group on Cayo Santiago (Puerto Rico) are described by assessing the extent to which 4 measures of positive interaction between infants and finely-divided categories of companions are associated with: degree of relatedness through maternal lines; sex of the companion; age of the companion; and dominance rank of the infant''s lineage. The infant''s social network may mirror that of its mother both in the 1st weeks of life and as late as 30 wk of age. Infants have more positive social interaction with close kin than with distant kin or with unrelated individuals, and thus function as memebers of their lineage from the beginning. They associate more with female companions than with male companions, and more with younger immatures than with older immatures. Infants in the top-ranking lineage spend more time with their own relatives than do infants in other lineages. The fact that these patterns change little as the infant gains independence from the mother supports suggestions that early maternal influence serves to pass on aspects of the mother''s social network. The ontogeny of early social relationships may resemble a process of differentiation.

TI KIN RECOGNITION IN RANA-CASCADAE TADPOLES - MATERNAL AND PATERNAL
   EFFECTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Cascades frog (R. cascadae) tadpoles preferentially associated with full siblings over half siblings and half siblings over non-siblings when reared with siblings or as isolates. These tadpoles can use cues of maternal or paternal origin in distinguishing siblings from non-siblings, but maternal cues are preferred over paternal cues. Thus a hierarchy of cue importance may exist. Our results are consistent with both a phenotypic matching and a genetic recognition system of kin recognition. Thus, both learned and innate components may play a role in R. cascadae sibling recognition. Kin recognition may facilitate preferential treatment of kin, such as cooperation in food finding or in warning against predators and, therefore, those individuals behaving altruistically in kin groups can increase their inclusive fitness.

Of these sounds, 250 were also labeled by the activity, size and sexual composition of the group producing them. Principal components analysis was performed on all the sounds'' variables (1274 .times. 10) and on the variables for a subset of 823 sounds referred to as calls. Results of the principal components analyses indicate that the sounds can be divided into 3 major classes: blow sounds, slaps and calls; the repertoire of calls is a continuum with certain types more common than others. The distribution of the labeled sounds in the principal components analyses patterns revealed general associations between whale activities and the types of sounds produced.

TI SONG MATCHING IN THE GREAT TIT (PARUS-MAJOR) - THE EFFECT OF SIMILARITY
   AND FAMILIARITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Great tits were played recordings of one of their own songs, and a song of the same type from a neighbor and one from a stranger (from more than 500 m away). The birds matched their own songs most often and those of strangers least. Strangers had been predicted to be matched most, because previous work had shown an association between matching and a strong response. An analysis using a difference index showed that the birds matched most often when the stimulus song was very similar in detailed structure to their own rendition of the song. This was confirmed in a 2nd experiment in which similar and different renditions recorded from strangers were played. Once the effect of similarity was partialled out there was a residual tendency to match strangers more than neighbors, as was first predicted. The implications of these results for perception of song categories by the birds, possible use by the birds of their own songs as standards and the functional significance of matching are discussed.

TI CENTRAL PLACE FORAGING IN THE WHITE-FRONTED BEE-EATER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Orians et Pearson (1979) proposed a series of models of optimal central place foraging. Their model for single-prey loading species (those that carry items singly) is tested with a natural population of white-fronted bee-eaters (M. bullockoides) in Kenya. These insectivorous birds breed in colonies but defend nearby foraging territories from which they gather food for their nestlings. Qualitatively, 2 predictions of the model were upheld: as travel time increased birds carried larger insects to their nests and spent longer periods of time foraging; and as distance increased birds were increasingly selective of which insects they ate vs. carried to the colony. Quantitative comparisons were also made using observed travel times and rates of insect capture. As distance increased, the observed sizes of insects carried approached the values predicted by the Orians-Pearson model, the observed foraging times diverged from the predicted values, and the birds spent more time foraging between round trips in a relatively unprofitable area near the colony. These results are examined in light of the theory of central place foraging.

The calling male was removed from 19 satellite associations and 11 of the 19 satellite males began calling. After the calling male was removed from 10 satellite associations, a speaker broadcast synthetic mating calls. All of the satellite males oriented to the speaker. Synthetic mating calls were played back to 14 calling males. Eleven males stopped calling and oriented to the speaker during at least 1 trial. Sequences of synthetic mating calls and synthetic encounter calls were broadcast to 12 calling males. Nine males became satellites when the speaker emitted mating calls; none did so when encounter calls were presented.

TI PLAYFUL INTERACTIONS IN FAMILY GROUPS OF THE COMMON MARMOSET
   (CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS-JACCHUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Play behavior in 6 family groups of common marmosets (C. j. jacchus) is described. Playful behavior patterns comprised a distinct repertoire of behavior and the patterns formed ordered sequences. The differences in the play of adults and offspring are described and analyzed. Adult play was infrequent and most took the form of adult-offspring interactions; it contained fewer bouts of chasing and was less active, and adults elicited fewer bouts. No differences attributable to sex could be determined in the play of offspring and the only pattern that decreased with age was bouncing gait. Possible partner preferences were analyzed, and marmoset twins showed an overall preference for playing with the twin. The vocalizations heard during bouts of play were recorded and analyzed and their relationship to non-playful vocalization discussed; during bouts of play younger animals vocalized to older animals. Marmoset play wrestling differed in form from aggressive wrestling, and patterns occurred during aggressive interactions which were not observed in play. The play of marmosets is discussed with regard to the socioecology of the species and compared to the play of other mammalian species.

TI SPATIAL-ASPECTS OF NEST DEFENSE BY PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH
   (LEPOMIS-GIBBOSUS) - STIMULUS FEATURES AND AN APPLICATION OF
   CATASTROPHE-THEORY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Using fixed stimulus dummies as territory intruders, the spatial distributions of the aggressive responses made by nesting male pumpkinseed sunfish were studied. Results replicated over 3 field seasons indicate that males defend 2 territory boundaries concurrently, depending on whether an intruder is approaching (the defense perimeter) or withdrawing (the attack perimeter). This finding supports Zeeman''s (1976) cusp catastrophe model of nest defense. The defense perimeter remains constant over the breeding cycle while the attack perimeter varies. Ecological costs and benefits of this variation were discussed and a motivational interpretation of the cusp catastrophe model was presented. By varying the speed at which dummies intruded into nests, males reacted with a fixed latency to intruders at a fixed distance from the nest. The spatial distributions of male defense responses were partially determined by the location of the nest rim, but were unaffected by dummy size (contrary to Zeeman''s model) or posture.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male flies homozygous for the ebony11 mutant allele suffer a severe visual impairment and consequently show poor mating success. Ebony males show improved mating in darkness because they initiate courtship more quickly than in the light. They also exhibit a competitive superiority over wild-type males under darkened conditions that correlates with the observed increase in the mutant''s locomotor activity. Locomotor activity levels were shown to correlate with several indices of mating success under both dark and illuminated conditions. The evolutionary implications of this relationship between the 2 characters are discussed.

TI DIURNAL-VARIATIONS IN LEARNING-PERFORMANCE IN CHICKENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Diurnal variations in the learning performance of young chicks were investigated using a visual discrimination task which requires birds to discriminate grains from a background of pebbles. Chicks accustomed to receiving fresh food daily in the morning learned well during the day, in that they pecked almost exclusively at grains; but during the night they pecked indiscriminately at grains and pebbles. This occurred even though food was available ad lib. Chicks accustomed to receiving fresh food daily in the evening learned the task during the day, and also late at night. Thus the shape of the performance cycle depends in part on environmental factors. Other factors, such as activity, which may contribute to, or co-vary with, this variation in learning performance were investigated.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The responses of juvenile and adult gerbils towards newborn test pups were investigated. Young animals of both sexes are less likely to attack the test pup than are older animals. Mature females are more likely to attempt to cannibalize pups than are mature males. Attempted cannibalism by adult males is inhibited when their mate becomes pregnant. If the pregnant female is removed from the cage for 1-3 days, attempted cannibalism is disinhibited. Males which have reared a previous litter will not harm test pups when the female is removed. Experience of a pregnant female and of young pups during the preweaning stage does not influence the incidence of attempted cannibalism in adulthood. Gerbils take full advantage of changing social conditions.

TI EFFECTS OF LONG-ACTING TESTOSTERONE TREATMENT ON FREE-LIVING PIED
   FLYCATCHERS, FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA, DURING THE BREEDING PERIOD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Breeding behavior and spermatogenesis of all males in a population of pied flycatchers, F. hypoleuca, were experimentally prolonged by long-acting testosterone. The behavior of these birds was compared with that of birds from an untreated population and a population where the males were given the vehicle only. The testosterone treatment prolonged territorial behavior, and a higher percentage of nests without a feeding male during the nestling period was found in the experimental area. The proportion of polygamous males did not differ between the experimental and control areas. The feeding activity of those testosterone-treated males returning to their home territories was markedly depressed. The female of such a pair did not compensate for the male''s low feeding activity, but fed the nestlings as she would have done with a normal untreated male at the nest. Females without a male present during the nestling period compensated for their mates'' absence by increasing their own feeding frequency. The song of the male pied flycatcher may be dependent upon androgens. The testosterone-treated males produced fewer fledglings than the control males.

AB The amount of time invested in and the distribution of dustbathing behavior was examined over the course of a day. Amount of time spent dustbathing, preening, ingesting and engaging in sexual/agonistic activities by individual quail was recorded for the light portion of selected photoperiods. Consistency was shown in amounts of dustbathing exhibited by individual birds under the different photoperiods; amount of time spent dustbathing was intermediate with respect to the other behaviors recorded. A daily peak period of dustbathing was evident except under constant light conditions. Selective pressures operating to maximize the efficiency of dustbathing were discussed.

TI TIME-SHARING AS A MECHANISM FOR THE CONTROL OF BEHAVIOR SEQUENCES DURING
   THE COURTSHIP OF THE 3-SPINED STICKLEBACK (GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The male stickleback (G. aculeatus) alternates between activities directed towards the female and activities directed towards his nest during courtship. The hypothesis that a time-sharing mechanism can control the allocation of time to these 2 classes of activities was tested using the double interruption method. Either nest or female related behaviors could be dominant, as measured by the behavior that most frequently followed an interruption. The effect of interrupting subdominant behavior was related to both the length of the interruption and the distribution of uninterrupted visit lengths. The effect of interrupting dominant behavior was independent of these factors. Disrupting the nest with snails altered the timing of behavior only during nest dominant sessions. All these results are consistent with the time-sharing hypothesis. Dominance was related to other behavioral measures of the motivational state of the animal. The relevance of this to the classical disinhibition interpretation of the performance of nest activities is discussed.

Some new techniques, designed to search for and detect possible important sequential organization patterns, are described in light of previous criticisms. Of these techniques, the pre-post-state histogram (PPSH), a multi-order Markov graphical analysis, may be the most important for future work, especially when used in conjunction with the other techniques described.

AB An examination was made of the frequency and consequences of great tits (Parus major L.) of nesting in territories adjacent to those of close relatives. When kin-adjacent individuals were compared with average members of the population there was no evidence of enhanced reproductive success. In some cases breeding performance was better than expected, but it could not be attributed to the nearby presence of close relatives. When kin-adjacent individuals were compared with great tits that did not nest next to close relatives which were breeding in the same year as themselves, male close relatives nesting in contiguous territories commenced breeding earlier than expected. No other differences in breeding performance were detected. The observed frequencies of kin adjacent territories reflected the known patterns of natal dispersal.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Interspecific aggression between leaf-cutting ants [Acromyrmex octospinosus, Atta cephalotes and A. sexdens] is described both in the field and in the laboratory, and a species hierarchy in fighting success is postulated. As opponents get bigger, the dominant species takes longer to attack, until opponents are much larger when the usually dominant species is defeated. Ants that win in fights seem to learn successful strategies, namely to attack specific parts of the body, especially the petiolar connection to the gaster, and to do so very quickly. In the field, the incidence of fighting is highest near to the nest to the nest as ants further from the nest flee in preference to fighting. The ecological relevance of these results is discussed.

TI SENSORY INFORMATION AND THE ORGANIZATION OF BEHAVIOR IN A SHOALING
   CYPRINID FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Quantitative comparison of the behavior of bream, Abramis brama (L.), under 4 controlled conditions indicates that the organization and spectrum of behaviors of this shoaling teleost fish differ according to the sensory information it receives from a conspecific. Bream are true social animals, behaving normally only when in full sensory contact, in contrast to earlier suggestions that vision alone could mediate fish social behavior. Both lateral line and vision are employed simultaneously to maintain individual distance. Mirror images, fish images and real fish are distinguished at different distances, but only the abnormal feedback from an approachable mirror is eventually compensated for, indicating considerable central processing. Lack of lateral line input causes a greater synchrony with the image of a neighbor, reinforcing a similar recent finding in schooling saithe. Bream in full sensory contact are more likely to make forays away from each other. The use of shoal as a more helpful general term for a social group of fish (equivalent to flock in birds) is recommended, and the term school should be restricted to polarized synchronized groups. Lateral line, vision and olfaction are used in shoals, but probably only lateral line and vision in the maintenance of schooling.

AB This study reports on learning in a predacious ground beetle (P. melanarius). The first observations showed an apparent inability to learn spatial information in a maze but indicated the possibility that the beetles could learn to reduce a strong thigmotactic response in an open-field and hence locate a centrally placed water source. The 2nd experiment confirmed the presence of open-field learning and showed that this information is only retained for a period of between 100 and 200 min. Control groups supported the presence of learning but showed that it was only manifested when cued by odor. The final experiment showed that the decline of the effects of the learning experience was not due to a gradual olfactory desensitization to the relevant odor and that it presumably is the result of actual memory loss.

AB The theridiid spider A. elevatus lives as a kleptoparasite in the webs of 2 araneid spiders, Argiope argentata and Nephila clavipes, where it steals small insects from the orb web as well as pillages large prey-items that have already been caught and often predigested by the host spider. The prey-catching behavior of the 2 host spiders and the stealing by the kleptoparasites are described. The success rate of raids on stored prey is given. Two raid strategies were observed in the kleptoparasites: either A. elevatus moved onto the hub during the 1st prey-catching sequence of the host (strategy PxP) or it moved onto the hub during the subsequent (2nd) prey-catching sequence (strategy PPx). Strategy PxP was employed more often than strategy PPx and the stealing success with strategy PxP was superior. The host spiders react to raid-strategy PxP by reducing the duration of prey-catching sequences. The advantages to the kleptoparasites of switching between strategies is discussed.

TI LOCOMOTORY ACTIVITY AND PREDATION STRATEGY OF WOLF-SPIDER
   PARDOSA-AMENTATA (CLERCK) (LYCOSIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Locomotory activity as an aspect of predation strategy was investigated in the wolf-spider P. amentata (Clerck). The spider adopts a ''sit-and-wait'' strategy with periodic changes of site. The frequency of site-change increases with temperature, and the consumption of food at a site increases the duration of stay at that site by a period equivalent to the time taken to ingest the food. Locomotory activity was essentially diurnal and its total duration in a period of 24 h was very low. Even at the highest temperature investigated (15.degree. C) P. amentata is active for only 0.0032% of the day.

TI DISPLAY REPERTOIRE ANALYSIS OF SCELOPORUS-UNDULATUS HYACINTHINUS (SAURIA
   IGUANIDAE) FROM SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB S. u. hyacinthinus [from Virginia, USA] display behavior was studied in the field and laboratory. ''Jiggling'' seems to be a generalized behavior appearing in many contexts with no apparent specialized function. There are 2 distinct display types (A and B) in the species'' repertoire besides jiggling. Based on 177 video-taped displays by 11 males, each of the 2 display types was extremely stereotyped. The stereotypy is of 2 kinds. For the A displays, all males performed a display pattern common to the population (intra-population stereotypy); this would structure the behavior for a species recognition function. For the B display, each male performed a consistent pattern. Each male''s B displays were to a lesser or greater extent individually unique (intra-individual stereotypy); this would facilitate individual recognition. Some males'' B displays showed sufficient pattern variation to make it impossible to present a single display pattern representing the type B pattern for the population.

TI FEEDING-BEHAVIOR OF BROODY FEMALE OCTOPUS-VULGARIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When female O. vulgaris reproduce, their feeding behavior changes. Food intake decreases on the average by 70% normal intake/meal, and additionally by 65% normal number of meals, a total decrease of about 90%. The method of predation upon gastropod prey changes from boring a hole in the shell, secreting a toxin, and pulling out the affected snail, to pulling the living snail out by force, and ceasing to bore. The fact that the post-egg-laying female expends energy to extract the body of the snail which it then scarcely eats may be a unique pattern of feeding behavior.

TI PARAMETERS DETERMINING ATTRACTIVENESS OF STRIPE PATTERNS IN HONEY BEE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Foraging honey bees [Apis mellifica] approached some stripe patterns more frequently than others, the most attractive patterns being ones with narrow stripes spaced a small distance apart. The attractiveness value of a pattern could be predicted by the function 1 (w)(sp); where (w) is the stripe width and (sp) the width of the interval between stripes. This measure was applied to the nectar guide patterns found occurring naturally on flowers. The floral patterns had attractiveness values corresponding to the highest levels found experimentally. These patterns may act as a near distance signal for the bee to land.

TI COURTSHIP SONG OF MALE DROSOPHILA LACKING ARISTAE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB D. melanogaster males homozygous for the mutant genes aristaless and thread lack functional aristae required for auditory perception. The auditory signals produced by the mutant males during courtship are compared with those of intact normal males and males with aristae surgically removed. The courtship song of the mutants consists of shorter phrases spaced at longer intervals than in normal or operated males. This appears to be a pleiotropic effect of the mutant genes which is independent of lack of a functional arista per se. Autostimulation involving feedback through the aristae is evidently unnecessary for maintaining the gross structure of the courtship song in D. melanogaster.

AB Detailed observations were made of the parent-infant interactions of 5 adult pairs and 31 infants common marmosets (C. jacchus), housed in captive family groups. Records of parental measures were taken to 4 mo. old and comparisons made between infants in similar social situations. Sex differences, birth-order variations, singleton and twin infants, parental variation and the proportion of time that older siblings carry infants are compared. Correlations between the measures revealed that both parents are responsible for promoting and regulating increasing infant independence. Other parent-infant studies are discussed and problems of the adaptiveness of the callithrichid social system considered.

TI CONTRASTS IN SOCIAL-STRUCTURE AMONG BLACK-AND-WHITE COLOBUS MONKEY
   GROUPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three types of Colobus guereza groups may be distinguished on the bases of size and composition, namely small one-male groups, large, one-male groups and multi-male groups. The social structure of each type of group is described in terms of the distribution of non-agonistic interactions, the frequency and distribution of agonistic behavior and the organization of the roles of vigilance, territorial defense and leadership. A number of differences were found between the group types which appear to be related to the differences in group size and composition. It is suggested that these group types represent stages in the life-cycle of colobus groups, and that such an interpretation may help to resolve some of the conflicting reports in the literature.

The level of both of these aspects of behavior increased across the 3 conditions. The possibility that this covariance indicates shared internal causal factors for the response to predator and conspecific is discussed.

TI SEXUAL PREFERENCE IN RHESUS MONKEY MACACA MULATTA IN LABORATORY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Quanti-tative studies upon sexual preference have been made on adult rhesus monkeys (2 intact males and 6 ovariectomlzed females) by observing 2 females and a male for series of 30-min. periods. Concurrently, each female was paired by herself with the same males. Each combination of 1 male and 2 females was observed while both females were given estradiol (50[mu]g/day) and again without the hormone. One female (the favorite) copulated, sat and groomed with the male. The other (the non-favorite) interacted much less and was threatened by male and favorite. The males were predominant in determining the favorite and, in most cases, both chose the same female, whether or not the females were estrogen-treated. The behavior pattern, which is described, was stable during each series of observations except in 1 case in which the favorite was sexually unreceptive. No consistent difference in the male''s behavior with the favorite females was detected following removal of the non-favorite. However, when the non-favorites were paired alone with the male, he copulated, sat and groomed with them; there were quantitative differences in the components of the male''s sexual behavior between favorites and corresponding non-favorites.

TI STUDIES ON MOTIVATION IN FEEDING BEHAVIOUR OF DOMESTIC COCK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Four measurements of feeding behavior of the domestic cock were made in a standard situation after the birds were deprived of food for 2, 24 and 48 hr. These were amount consumed, rate of food consumption, rate of pecking and the strength of pecking. When the food offered was in mash form, there were no differences between the birds'' scores in these measurements in the tests after 24-hr. and 48-hr. deprivation. However, after these long deprivation schedules their scores for the amount eaten, pecking rate and rate of consumption were significantly different from those in the 2-hr. deprivation tests. When food of identical nutritive value was offered in the form of pellets the birds ate more and their pecking rate was higher after 48-hr. than after 24-hr. deprivation.

TI FACTORS DETERMINING COLLECTION OF POLLEN BY HONEYBEE FORAGERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individual bees quickly changed from collecting nectar to collecting pollen and vice versa in accordance with their colony''s needs. The proportion of foragers that collected pollen and the amount of pollen collected increased with the amount of brood present. Bees foraged less from colonies deprived of brood and many former pollen-gatherers changed to collecting nectar only. The smell of brood alone and contact with bees tending the brood were each partly responsible for foragers collecting pollen, but access to the brood was the most important factor. When the brood was inaccessible, foraging decreased and many pollen-gatherers collected nectar only. Although brood of all stages stimulated pollen collection, in some circumstances larvae were more effective than pupae. Absence of a queen, with or without brood, increased nectar collection and decreased pollen collection but did not affect the number of foragers. Giving pollen to a colony decreased its pollen collection and increased its nectar collection, but giving carbohydrate did not influence foraging. The results are discussed in relation to using colonies more efficiently for pollination.

   (SIPHONAPTERA - INSECTA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A sexual substance was demonstrated on the cuticle of both sexes. The mating sequence begins when the male''s maxillary palps receive this contact chemical stimulus. A running response by the female orients the partners. Tactile stimuli on the male''s head, antennae and sensilium control the acts leading to genital linkage. Each fixed act produces the specific stimulus situation necessary for performance of the next act. Absence of the required stimulus results in return to an earlier point in the sequence. Sequential integration is thus under rigid stimulus control. Accidental separation of the fleas is avoided by the male stimulating the female''s sensilium so inhibiting her movements.

AB Animals of the Maudsley Reactive and Non-Reactive Strains of Rats were subjected to a procedure involving an underwater discrimination task. The procedure involved mass trials. At the end of each daily series the experimental subjects were injected with 0.25 mg/kg of Nicotine either immediately or after a delay of 5 min.; a control group was administered a placebo. The experiment failed to produce any evidence of augmentation of learning due to the post-trial stimulant treatment whether applied immediately or delayed.

DT Article
AB Unpaired females were routinely present at the aquatic habitat, and indications of territorial activity in this sex were obtained. Neither sex displayed. Males were inattentive to motionless females but approached them sexually when they flew. Sperm transfer followed each observed, seizure, averaged only 7 seconds, and occurred while the male held the female in tandem. Copulation quickly followed sperm transfer, averaged 3 minutes, and was at water. After copulation, pairs flew briefly in tandem, separated without distinctive behavior, and the female descended to oviposit unaccompanied in willow roots for an average of 27 min. Underwater oviposition seemed obligatory. Each female remained near the site of descent while her mate remained nearby throughout her submergence and exhibited guarding behavior by flying toward and displacing conspecific male intruders.

TI OVERTRAINING REVERSAL AND EXTINCTION IN GOLDFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a situation where rats and octopuses show the overtraining reversal effect (ORE), goldfish are more likely to reverse more slowly following overtraining. The reason it is difficult to obtain the ORE in fish is that overtraining does not strengthen the relevant analyzer any more than it strengthens response attachments, while the cause of the ORE in other spp. is precisely that overtraining as a relatively greater effect on analyzers than on responses.

AB Five different tape recorded groups of male vocal patterns were each played to a different group of females kept in constant darkness. Soft warble, a vocalization closely associated with visible male precopulatory behavior patterns and performed in intimate relation to the female, was found to greatly stimulate ovarian activity and egg laying in budgerigars. Other vocalizations produced results insignificantly different from a control group hearing no vocalization. While either component half of arbitrarily divided soft warble seemed just as stimulating to ovarian development as the other half, daily presentation of either for 6 hrs. was more effective than 3 hrs.

AB Hypnotic trance durations of rabbits were prolonged by whole head stimulation with low levels of electric current (0.2 mA.). Effective frequencies were 4, 8 and 100 cycles/ sec. Localized stimulation with still lower current levels (30 [mu]A.) was also effective in prolonging hypnosis duration when the anteroventral thalamus and the pontine reticular formation were stimulated. Caudate stimulation enhanced trance duration at the 90% level of confidence. Stimulation of 2 other brain areas, the amygdala and the hippocampus, was not generally effective in potentiating hypnosis.

AB The emotional behavioFoTS groups of mice suffering from differential development of scrapie, a generalized brain damage disorder, and a normal group were investigated using the open-field test technique. Results showed that the more advanced the neuropathological process the less emotionally responsive the animals became. The correlation between emotional behaviour and the development of generalized brain damage was a highly significant negative one and the differences in emotional behaviour and neuropathological development were significant between the groups. Ambulatory activity was not significantly different between the groups, but suggested a U-shaped relationship between emotionality and brain damage.

DT Article
AB Eight problems in manipulation of baited and unbaited objects were given to Tupaia glis, Galago senegalensis, G. crassicaudatus, Loris tardigradus, Perodicticus potto, Lemur fulvus and L. catta. Loris and G. senegalensis have long bouts of attention and much dependence on hand and eye. They orient rather than manipulate, with little or no manipulation of unbaited objects or objects where the reward is not visible. Tupaia and Lemur have short bouts of attention, relatively great dependence on nose and mouth, and much manipulation of unbaited objects. Perodicticus and G. crassicaudatus are intermediate. The animals'' approach to objects is the same as their approach to food. Their understanding of unfamiliar objects is clearly below that of highest primates. Prosimians which depend more on hand and eye are not the most intelligent, but the most narrowly specialized. A tendency to manipulative play at the prosimian level may have preceded advance to simian intelligence.

AB A study was made of the seasonal changes in the daily activity of cottontail rabbits held in outdoor cages. The data indicated that, unlike some nocturnal animals, rabbit activity is not regulated by the onset of darkness. There was an increase in duration of activity in summer when the nights were shortest. Activity was greatest in April and lowest in January. In general, these results agree with a previous study of rabbits in the wild.

AB Animal pollinators, from insects to vertebrates, gather information about their environment in the form of floral cues and signals and use this information to make decisions. Plant traits such as colours, patterns, scents and shapes can influence pollinator behaviour, leading to the development of preferences and biases and the evolution of prepared learning, and these can work in both appetitive and aversive ways. Aspects of pollinator sensory and cognitive systems and their resulting behaviours are evolving in response to plant traits, which are in turn evolving in response to pollinator behaviour and sensory abilities. In this paper, we propose prepared learning as a framework for studying animal learning within pollination systems. Prepared learning is an established conceptual framework that proposes that animals learn some associations better than others due to an evolved match with the environment. Prepared learning can be a useful evolutionary strategy for animals because they are not attending to all the cues, thus hindering learning. We offer a brief history of the concept, explore examples of prepared learning in pollination and outline ideas for the design of field and laboratory studies, suggesting future directions for the field. Our proposed framework provides us with information needed to predict patterns of prepared learning in pollinators. By studying prepared learning in plant-pollinator interactions, we gain a better understanding of learning in an ecologically and evolutionarily relevant context and can test long unresolved questions about preparedness.

AB Crypsis is a common strategy used by animals to avoid detection. In many bird taxa, plumage colour patterns are assumed to play a role in crypsis, but few studies have directly measured plumage crypsis on ecologically relevant substrates from the perspective of relevant signal receivers. To address this gap, we tested whether the plumage colour patterns of three North American woodpeckers commonly found in New Jersey (U.S.A.) are more cryptic to avian predators on trees utilized for foraging than a random subset of trees from their habitat. We focused on the red-bellied woodpecker, Melanerpes carolinus, downy woodpecker, Dryobates pubescens, and hairy woodpecker, Leuconotopicus villosus. First, we took standardized photographs of the bark of trees on which we observed woodpeckers foraging, as well as photographs of the bark of trees from transects in the same area. Next, we superimposed standardized photographs of woodpecker specimens (dorsal view) onto the bark samples and adjusted the resulting images to estimate how they would appear to the visual system of an avian predator. We then estimated four types of achromatic crypsis from each bird/bark combination image: granularity matching, contrast matching, luminance matching and disruptive coloration. We also estimated how well woodpeckers matched the bark substrates in terms of colour by quantifying the degree of colour similarity in a colour space representing a typical avian predator. We found that woodpeckers were more cryptic against trees they utilized for foraging in terms of disruptive coloration, luminance matching and colour matching, suggesting that the need to be cryptic while foraging is likely to have shaped the evolution of woodpecker plumage patterning.

   EVOLUTION; RESPONSES
AB Abandoning a brood to maximize lifetime reproductive success may result from the current costs affecting future reproductive opportunities. In certain contexts, clutch abandonment can be an evolved breeding strategy rather than a generalized response to stressors such as inclement weather and predation. Obligate brood parasitism, a reproductive strategy in which a parasitic species relies solely on other species to raise its young, imposes fitness costs to hosts and could serve as a trigger for clutch abandonment. This cost, and the resulting clutch abandonment strategy, may vary according to contact with the parasite, sensitivity to parasitism and the value of the current reproductive effort (i.e. brood value). We conducted a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis covering 85 host species of the three generalist cowbird species (Molothrus sp.) in which we examined the following effects on the abandonment (nest desertion and egg burial) of parasitized versus unparasitized clutches: habitat at a small scale (higher host-parasite encounter frequency in open versus forested habitats) and at a large scale (longer interaction between parasites and hosts in prairie versus nonprairie regions), brood value (relative value of a clutch) and host species sensitivity to brood parasitism (relative body mass). Parasitism increased clutch abandonment overall. This increase was strongest in open nonforested habitats, with smaller, more sensitive hosts being more likely to abandon their clutch. Brood value and occurrence in prairie regions did not affect clutch abandonment, indicating that recent, more fine-scale host -parasite interactions were more important than coevolutionary history. Therefore, the abandonment of a brood can be used in diverse parental care strategies, including antiparasitic defences of broodparasitic hosts. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Prey animals may lack appropriate predator avoidance behaviours to novel predators, which has contributed to the decline of many species worldwide following human introduction of novel predators. Excluding novel predators from conservation reserves has been used to attempt to recover naive species with mixed success. However, in the absence of predators, prey naivete can be exacerbated. Reintroducing native predators has been suggested as a solution to addressing this problem and may act as a stepping stone to improve behavioural responses to novel predators. We tested the behavioural responses of two prey species, the burrowing bettong, Bettongia lesueur, and spinifex hopping mouse, Notomys alexis, to the reintroduction of a native predator, the western quoll, Dasyurus geoffroii, and determined whether exposure to a native predator improved their antipredator responses to introduced feral cats, Felis catus. Quoll-exposed bettongs spent less time engaged in inattentive foraging behaviours compared to control (nonpredator exposed) bettongs but did not discriminate between predator and nonpredator visual or olfactory cues (native or novel). Quoll-exposed spinifex hopping mice modified their foraging in open habitats and increased wariness in the presence of quoll stimuli, whereas cat-exposed hopping mice only exhibited increased wariness in the presence of cat stimuli. Our results show that reintroductions of native predators improved general antipredator responses in native prey species, but there was only weak evidence that this led to an improved response to introduced predators. However, reintroducing native predators improved general antipredator behaviour in ontogenetically naive populations which may make them more suitable for releases outside conservation fences where novel predators are present.

AB Aposematic prey use conspicuous, high-contrast colour patterns to warn potential predators that they possess a defence mechanism, and signal uniformity is important to promote predator learning and memory retention; however, documented variation in the aposematic pattern of many species exists. Most aposematism studies use avian predators and insect prey; we know little about how mammalian predators learn about and interact with aposematic prey. For the first time, we evaluated aposematic learning in a mammalian predator-prey system. We conditioned captive coyotes, Canis latrans, to contact brown-furred models, and then trained them to avoid black-and-white models resembling striped skunks, Mephitis mephitis, that sprayed a skunk oil solution before testing their ability to generalize to variant patterns mimicking natural skunk coat variation. Coyotes exhibited great variation at all levels of the experiment but generally showed varying levels of wariness of the skunk-striped model and most effectively learned to avoid the model after being sprayed. Subsequently, whiter models elicited greater avoidance than blacker models, suggesting that the strength of the white on black signal influences coyote aposematic generalization. This pioneering study of mammalian aposematic learning suggests that more conspicuous coloration speeds learning for predator avoidance of aposematic prey and enhances generalization.

AB Age often indicates phenotypic quality, ecological experience or social status in animals. Consequently, behavioural signals in territorial animals that accurately convey age to potential mates or rivals might provide useful information for both signaller and receiver about the likelihood of aggression. We tested whether male territorial yodels convey information about age in the common loon, Gavia immer. Using a sample of male loons of known age, we found that the dominant frequency of Fintro3, a dominant syllable in the beginning sequence of a male yodel, increases strongly with age, but we were unable to replicate an earlier finding linking Fintro3 to body mass. We hypothesize that older male loons, which yodel more often than young males, might do so as a means to advertise their age and higher likelihood of aggression to potential rivals.

AB Population density is a fundamental ecological feature influencing the opportunity for social encounters between individuals. Hence, density can impact various population processes such as social transmission. While the density dependence of disease spread has been studied extensively, we know little about how variation in density influences information transmission. If high densities lead to more social connections, information may spread more rapidly. Here, we experimentally manipulated local population density in great tits, Parus major, and investigated the effects on individuals' acquisition of information on novel food patches. We manipulated density by assigning individuals to either a high- or low -density treatment using automated bird feeders in the wild. We first show how our approach successfully led to changes in local population density. Next, we examine how the manipulation changed the local and individual social environment. At the local level, high -density locations resulted on average in denser and more clustered social networks compared to low -density locations. At the individual level, birds assigned to the high -density treatment had on average more social connections and more central network positions than birds in the low -density treatment. However, despite the effect on network structure, we found no evidence that the density manipulation influenced an individuals' likelihood, or speed, of locating novel food patches. Birds in the low -density treatment still spent a large proportion of time foraging at the high -density location. Thus, the manipulation did not lead to a strict segregation between birds of the different treatments, which may be one explanation for the absence of an effect on patch discovery.

AB Groups of animals often cooperate on shared tasks, but individual contributions are not necessarily equal: individuals can specialize on different tasks (division of labour) or vary in total work performed. Either of these patterns can have fitness consequences. However, few studies have examined division of labour and workload inequality in vertebrates. We analysed individual contributions to parental care in the greater ani, Crotophaga major, a bird that nests communally in groups of two or three pairs and up to two nonbreeding helpers. We examined nearly 600 h of video footage of 10 groups to quantify individual contributions to nest building, incubation, brooding and nestling feeding. There was no clear evidence of division of labour; rather, contributions across some behaviours were positively correlated, suggesting individual differences in overall work performed. Indeed, helpers and one of the breeding pairs in three-pair groups contributed significantly less than the other two pairs. Inequality in overall workload, as measured by the Gini coefficient, was significantly higher in three-pair groups than in two-pair groups, as predicted by collective action theory. However, there were no significant differences in inequality of specific behaviours between two-and three-pair groups, possibly due to low sample size. Finally, anecdotal observations of aggression directed at the pair that contributed the least to parental care in three-pair groups suggested that the lowest-contributing pair's access to the nest might be limited by such aggression, which could be driven by conflicts of interest over group size and membership.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal foraging movements are shaped by sensory-motor abilities, availability and distribution of resources and cognitive skills (memory of where, and possibly what and when, food is available). Inferring a movement process (i.e. the decision rules controlling where to go at any time) from a given movement pattern (i.e. the distributions of some key variables such as the step length or the turning angle) is usually tricky because the same process can generate different patterns depending on the context while similar patterns can be generated by different processes. However, animal movement studies combining sta-tistical (pattern-based) and mechanistic (process-based) approaches can provide valuable insights into the knowledge an animal has of its environment. This knowledge can range between the two extreme cases of a fully naive animal finding food only by chance and an omniscient animal knowing where, when, what and how much food is available at any time. Based on 2 years of 20 min scan sampling of ranging and feeding behaviour, we investigated the foraging movements of two habituated groups of wild western gorillas, Gorilla gorilla, a seasonally frugivorous primate species inhabiting Central African lowland forests. We showed that gorillas may choose the next feeding site by following a movement heuristic favouring the nearest-neighbour feeding site of the highest long-term interest (inferred a posteriori as the total time spent within it over a whole season) likely to yield food at this time. Thus, gorillas seemed to rely on an accurate spatial memory, enabling them to know where the places liable to yield food are located but have limited knowledge of how much food they can find at a given place at a given time. Our study shows how integrative statistical analysis and mechanistic modelling may help improve our understanding of movements and cognition in numerous species.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sickness behaviours are believed to be an adaptive response to infection. However, the degree to which these behaviours can be expressed may be impacted by an individual's social environment. Here we tested, first, whether parasitism reduces the activity behaviour of lambs, Ovis aries, second, whether this occurs prior to other observed costs of parasitism and, third, whether the infection status of other in-dividuals affects the degree to which these behaviours are expressed. Sixty lambs were separated into replicate groups within three treatments: (1) parasitized: all lambs were infected with the parasitic nematode Teladorsagia circumcincta; (2) nonparasitized; all lambs were dosed with water; (3) mixed: some of the group were infected and some were dosed with water. Activity behaviour was monitored before, during and after parasite infection. Parasitized groups had reduced activity levels following infection, and this occurred before any other impact or measure of parasitism was detected. Infected animals in the mixed groups had reduced activity levels following infection, but the level of change was less than that in animals in the fully parasitized groups. Activity levels remained low until lambs were treated with anthelmintic when activity levels of the groups that had been parasitized returned to the same level as nonparasitized groups. These findings show that parasite-induced behavioural changes occur earlier than other more commonly observed signals of infection, but the infection profile of an individual's group can shape these behavioural responses to infection.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Ornamentation found in both sexes, or mutual ornamentation, can be used as a threat signal towards rivals or to bias aggression towards those sharing preferences for mates or other resources. The wide-spread male bias in ornamentation suggests that sexual selection for these competitive functions is stronger in males, but these functions are rarely compared between the sexes. We investigated intra-sexual contests in a mutually ornamented fish, Betta brownorum, that uniquely has both male bias and high intrasexual variation in the presence and size of side blotches. Neither blotch size nor body size predicted the winner in either sex. The frequency of lateral display increased with opponent body size in females. Physical attacks increased when facing similarly blotched opponents only in females. These results suggest that nonsexual social selection contributes more to the maintenance of blotches than sexual selection, as the latter predicts the threat signal and/or aggression bias mainly in the sex with greater ornamentation. Our study highlights that smaller female ornaments can have social functions that are distinct from those of male ornaments and may be partially maintained by social selection in many other systems.

AB High water turbidity, through its multifold influences on aquatic fauna, is considered a major cause of ecological concern. Here we examined the effects of elevated turbidity on the behaviour of a small cyprinid fish, the Stymphalia minnow, Pelasgus stymphalicus, using a combination of the well-established emergence, open field and predator response tests. Subjects from the two treatments differed in the way they emerged from an artificial refuge, with the turbidity-exposed fish being more hesitant. Moreover, these fish were also less active, had a lower propensity to explore and spent less time in the open centre of the test arena, compared to subjects tested in clear water. However, there was no effect of turbidity on the time fish spent immobile. Fish in both treatments responded strongly to a simulated predator attack from above. Turbidity decreased the time fish spent in the centre, the predator simulation decreased time spent immobile and both factors contributed to a decrease in activity, but without significant interaction effects. We discuss how turbidity may increase the perceived predation risk of these prey fish in our test conditions even in the absence of predator cues, as well as the implications of our findings for ecosystem management policy and conservation efforts targeting threatened freshwater fish species.

AB Reproduction provides direct fitness benefits; therefore, it is important to determine why in some societies certain individuals have disproportionate access to reproductive opportunities. The social interactions that underlie reproductive hierarchies can occur in multiple situations, yet they are rarely studied in unison. The reproductive heir in the social wasp Ropalidia marginata is cryptic to human observers until the queen dies or disappears. To determine whether a reproductive heir can be identified through her behaviour, we examined four types of social situations: aggression, spatial overlap, trophallaxis and exchange of solid food. We asked whether accounting for all four social situations in a multilayer network provides more information about the structure of the society than examining each situation on its own or in an aggregate network that does not distinguish between social situations. We found that the reproductive heir had the most social interactions in the multilayer network but not in each of the social situations when considered separately or when all situations were lumped together. Our work demonstrates that multilayer networks can uncover new insights on social organization by explicitly considering the links between multiple situations of social interactions.

AB The tendency to aggregate during the larval stage is widespread and highly variable among anuran species. Several studies have highlighted the link between tadpole group density and their activity level, confirming that, usually, living in groups brings several antipredator benefits. However, nearly all studies have focused on the average behavioural responses of tadpoles tested in groups. In this study, we explored the effects of living in groups of three different sizes (1, 5 and 25 individuals per group) on the antipredator behaviour of individual green toad, Bufotes balearicus, tadpoles. We first assessed their basal activity and then examined changes in mobility rate and total distance after exposure to the chemical cues of predatory dragonfly, Aeshna cyanea, larvae. For both the preand poststimulus activity levels, we also tested the effects of the presence of conspecifics' chemical cues in the experimental tub. Our results showed that (1) a previous brief (8 days) experience of group living is sufficient to affect the basal level of activity of individual tadpoles, which increased with group size; (2) tadpoles that were reared alone did not lower their activity further when exposed to predators' odour; (3) the antipredator response of high density-reared tadpoles decreased in the presence of conspecifics' cues, supporting the so-called dilution effect, which, anyway, may need a minimum group size to be apparent. We conclude that both previous group-rearing experience and current perception of the surrounding environment may affect anti predator behaviour in individual tadpoles.

AB Many animals vary their acoustic signals with weather conditions to ensure sufficient range of signal transmission as atmospheric attenuation increases (the atmospheric attenuation change hypothesis). However, few studies have considered the effects of weather conditions on the vocalizations of endotherms via the effects on their physiological condition (the physiological change hypothesis). In the present study, we directly linked weather conditions to changes in bats' body temperatures and to their echolocation call frequencies. We found a significantly positive correlation between body temperatures and call frequencies among individuals of the great leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros armiger, in the wild. We then monitored changes in body temperature and call frequency of H. armiger over an hour at an ambient temperature of about 11 degrees C. The bats emitted echolocation calls of lower frequencies with decreasing body temperature caused by decreased ambient temperature, supporting the physiological change hypothesis. We also investigated changes in body temperature and echolocation call frequencies for H. armiger from summer to winter. The bats' body temperatures decreased with decreasing ambient temperature. However, echolocation call frequencies increased significantly. A linear mixed-effects model suggested that the change in atmospheric attenuation rather than body temperature had a significant effect on the call frequency, supporting the atmospheric attenuation change hypothesis. Overall, our results suggested that weather conditions can affect the echolocation signals of bats via the effects on their body temperature and on atmospheric attenuation. When both effects coexist, weather-induced adjustments in the echolocation signals could be more likely to be driven by the atmospheric attenuation effect.

AB A primary approach to establishing hierarchy is through contests, in which conflicts are settled using various behavioural patterns. Although dominance ranks in a hierarchy are determined by quality-related innate factors, how the inequality of competitors is assessed and triggers the formation of a hierarchy by means of behavioural interactions remains unclear. Here, we report the sequence of aggressive behaviours that mediates the onset of hierarchy formation in eusocial bumble bee workers by continuously monitoring pairwise contests. Sequential analysis characterized the dynamics of the behavioural repertoire during hierarchy formation in Bombus terrestris; this was organized in phases associated with a divergence in dominance rank and included mutual pumping (a dorsoventral abdominal movement), bilateral physical contact and unilateral strikes. Escalated bilateral aggression served as a mutual assessment strategy and caused a rapid divergence in rank in evenly matched con -tests. Head butting was subsequently performed by dominants, suggesting it is a badge of higher rank. The behavioural progression was also similar in two other Bombus species despite interspecific variation in behavioural patterns. Size asymmetry reduced the duration of bilateral aggression, while age ad-vantages over callow workers eliminated bilateral aggression. These results suggested potential roles of mutual assessment by ritualized fighting in hierarchy formation in queenless bumble bee societies.

However, in primates, research on female social relationships commonly focuses on species and populations with female philopatry and the frequent occurrence of affiliative and agonistic behaviours. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the long-term patterns of female social relationships in a primate with female-biased dispersal, where affiliative and agonistic behaviours among females are rare. We analysed 9 years of continuous data from female Ugandan red colobus monkeys, Piliocolobus tephrosceles, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, and used spatial proximity to establish social networks for 3- and 6month periods. Then, we investigated the differentiation, stability and clustering of social relationships for each of these periods using several approaches. As expected for a primate with female-biased dispersal, our results largely confirmed the absence of temporally stable social relationships and social clusters within the group. However, in about half of the analysed time periods, females formed differentiated social relationships. This indicates that factors other than dispersal patterns and within-group contest competition contribute to the formation of the ephemeral relationships, as measured by spatial proximity, among female red colobus. Therefore, our results on the patterns of female social relationships in a primate with female-biased dispersal provide important empirical insight for the refinements of theories that aim to explain social evolution in mammals.

AB Personalities, i.e. consistent individual differences in behaviour, have been found in many animal populations. However, the reasons why personalities emerge, how they persist and the consequences they have in a changing environment are poorly understood. Factors influencing personalities include genetic background, prenatal (e.g. hormonal) and postnatal (e.g. environmental) conditions, and the strength of these factors can affect the consistency of personalities over time, and hence their flexibility in a changing environment. In birds, for example, hormones in eggs deposited by mothers can modulate aggressiveness of offspring and environmentally induced nutrition deficits in offspring can reduce neophobia later in life. Hence, investigating the fitness consequences of personalities requires the integration of physiological, behavioural and survival measures. We used the opportunity of a reintroduction project of grey partridge, Perdix perdix, to experimentally explore how multiple pre-and postnatal factors including measures of the hormone corticosterone were related to three behavioural traits. Then, we investigated whether the behaviours were repeatable and related to survival after release into the wild. Grey partridges showed distinct personalities affected by multiple pre-and postnatal factors. Proactive birds had low baseline levels of circulating corticosterone and survived longer after release into the wild compared to reactive and passive personalities. Consequently, the number of survivors after 6 months was substantially higher for proactive than for reactive and passive birds. Integrating data on behaviour, physiology and survival thus allows the investigation of the complex interplay of personality and fitness in a changing environment.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article

ID ANIMAL PERSONALITY; ECOLOGY; TRAITS
AB Personality differences may coexist because of their different benefits or, alternatively, because some personality types result from limitations of low individual quality while others require high physical or cognitive abilities. Recent work in a great tit, Parus major, population found that proactive personality is associated with larger head sizes, suggesting that it requires better cognitive abilities. This was never tested in other avian species, and other morphological correlates of personality have also seldom been studied. We used an open-field and a mirror test as proxies to assess personality differences in a large sample of wild common waxbills, Estrilda astrild, and tested whether behavioural differences are predicted by morphological traits that can relate to genetic quality or early life growth (body size), brain volume (head size), growth during moult (wing and tail length) or body condition (size-corrected mass). Exploration in open-field tests was related to size-corrected mass and to wing and tail size, perhaps because birds in better condition or with larger wings can move more or faster. These associations were very weak, with effects sizes close to zero, and, importantly, morphology did not predict behaviour in mirror tests. In waxbills, behaviour in mirror tests correlates with exploration in open-field tests, and provides a better assay of reactive-to-proactive personalities because it is repeatable in the long term. Our results thus indicate that avian personality can be independent of differences in quality between individuals.

AB Reproduction involves communication. Males usually evolve elaborate displays that may declare their qualities and attract females to mate, using signals from different modalities. Females may use cues encoded in courtship signals to evaluate males and make choices concerning their qualities. We investigated the acoustic element of the elaborate display of the small Cavia rodents, the guinea pigs, Cavia porcellus. We verified the potentiality of the courtship call (purr) to reflect male identity and social status, through variations in acoustic structure and male vocal performance. Our results suggest that the purr encodes individuality but not male dominance status. Vocal performance and purr's structural parameters differed between individuals, but there was no correlation between acoustic parameters and male dominance status. Courtship in cavies is a multimodal display, and male quality may be encoded in visual and chemical signals. This study is the first evidence of individuality in the purr. Further studies may reveal the role of each communication channel in the courting process of Cavia. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Yawning, a fixed action pattern, is widespread in almost all vertebrate taxa. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the functions of yawning. These hypotheses, not mutually exclusive, can be conventionally arranged according to both physiological (e.g. drowsiness hypothesis: yawning when switching between sleep and being awake; arousal hypothesis: yawning in contexts of high social tension) and social communicative domains (e.g. contagion hypothesis, activity synchronization hypothesis). Owing to their high social cohesion and synchronized group activity, wild lions are a good model to investigate both spontaneous yawning from the physiological domain and, possibly, contagious yawning, from the social communicative domain. We videorecorded two groups of lions in the Makalali Reserve (Limpopo region, South Africa) and analysed their yawning behaviour. Spontaneous yawning was particularly frequent when the lions were relaxed and, in agreement with the 24 h activity cycle typical of the species, was similarly distributed over the night and day. These findings support the drowsiness hypothesis predicting that yawning is linked to the transition between sleeping and waking (and vice versa). Lions did not show high levels of yawning during competition over clumped food such as carcasses; hence, the arousal hypothesis was not supported. We found that yawn contagion was present, supporting the contagion hypothesis and the activity synchronization hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the convergence of motor behaviour triggered by yawn contagion (to our knowledge never explored in any other species) could represent an important tool to shed light on the adaptive and immediate benefits that underlie the evolution of the yawn contagion phenomenon in human and nonhuman animals. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social relationships are shaped by ecological conditions, giving rise to diverse societies even among related species. Among elephants, females exhibit close, often familial bonds with some degree of philopatry and fission-fusion dynamics. Forest elephant sociality is the least studied among elephant species, and their ecology differs from that of savannah and Asian elephants. We use over 15 years of data from an individually identified population using the Dzanga Bai forest clearing in Central African Republic to characterize social patterns of adult female elephants in two contexts, when entering the forest clearing and within the clearing. Social properties were nonrandom and highly stable over the study period in both contexts. Composition of aggregations within the clearing indicated considerable mixing among females, while association in groups entering the bai together were limited in composition, likely representing core social units. The co-entry data set exhibited distinct communities that were not apparent in the co-occurrence data set. In contrast to savannah elephants, network centrality and age were negatively correlated, suggesting a muted or absent matriarch social hub role in forest elephants at a broader level than family units. Temporal and community analyses indicated that bai co-entry and cooccurrence contexts may represent distinct processes, with the former social and the latter driven by shared resource use. Our results point to social patterns potentially driven by the need for families to fission into small units because of resource competition and highlight the importance of aggregation context in interpreting association indices.

AB Negative patterning discrimination is considered a nonelemental form of learning, and has been extensively investigated across taxa. Several insect species have also been examined with this task, but only honey bees, Apis mellifera, have so far demonstrated this capacity. Recent empirical and theoretical studies suggest that negative patterning can be accounted for by the emergent property of the mushroom body circuitry in the honey bee brain. Given the neurobiological similarity between bumble bees and honey bees, we hypothesized that bumble bees should also have this cognitive capacity. Here we showed that free-flying bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, learned chromatic, achromatic and visual-olfactory bimodal negative patterning discrimination. Further analyses showed that individual bumble bees adopted distinct strategies in approaching negative patterning discrimination, some solving the task in a configural manner, while others solved it via a simpler strategy. Our findings are in contrast to previous work using harnessed bumble bees and highlight the importance of designing experiments around the requirements of specific species. Our results add to our knowledge on insect nonelemental learning and open up new opportunities for examining cognitive limitations and individual decision-making strategies.

AB Collective movement is critical to the survival of some animals. Despite substantial progress in understanding animal collectives such as fish shoals and bird flocks, it is unknown how collective behaviour is affected by changes in multiple environmental conditions that can interact as stressors. Using a fully factorial repeated-measures design, we tested the independent and combined effects of darkness and acoustic noise on the collective motion of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, quantified using high-resolution tracking data from video. Corresponding to the importance of vision in shoaling behaviour, darkness increased nearest-neighbour distances and reduced coordination, measured as speed correlations and differences in directional heading between nearest neighbours. Although individual swimming speeds were not impacted by darkness, the group's centre of mass was slower, an emergent effect of reduced polarisation (i.e. greater group disorder) in darkness. While additional acoustic noise had no detectable effect on these variables, it altered group structure, with fish being more likely to be found side by side one another. Fish were also further from the arena wall (i.e. showed reduced wall following) when there was additional acoustic noise. There was only weak evidence for additive or interactive effects of the two stressors. Across the different environmental contexts, there were consistent, repeatable differences between groups (i.e. group personality variation) in the speed, turning angle and distance from the arena wall of individuals, but the only collective behaviour that was repeatable was group polarization. Our study demonstrates that multiple stressors can have independent effects that impact different aspects of behaviour and highlights the need for empirical studies on multiple stressors as their effects can be unpredictable.

AB Fission-fusion social dynamics are common among a number of vertebrate taxa, and yet the factors shaping these variable associations among subgroup members have not been widely addressed. Associations may occur simply because of shared habitat preferences; however, social ties may also be influenced by genetic relatedness (kinship) or social attraction. Here, we investigate the association patterns of wild black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar using behavioural, spatial (home range) and genetic data from 24 individually identified animals. We collected 40 840 records of group composition over a 17-month period and from this calculated pairwise association indices. We also used ranging coordinates and genetic samples to estimate patterns of spatial overlap and kinship, and then related these measures to patterns of affiliation. From these analyses, we found that dyadic ruffed lemur social associations were generally sparse and weak, that home range overlap was minimal and that average relatedness within the community was low. We found no evidence that kinship was related to patterns of either spatial overlap or social association; instead, associations were primarily driven by space use. Moreover, social preferences were unrelated to kinship. While home range overlap explained most of the variation seen in social association, some variation remained unaccounted for, suggesting that other social, ecological and biological factors such as shared resource defence or communal breeding might also play a role in social attraction. Our results further highlight the need to consider individual space use and nuances of species behaviour when investigating social preference and social association more generally.

AB An appreciation of the diverse roots of animal behaviour study is essential for informed teaching and stimulating current research and scholarship. Insights by early seminal authors are often ignored, insights that may have avoided subsequent controversies or spawned productive research. Even with internet access now available for much early work, historical perspectives are increasingly being lost. Animal behaviour textbooks are often misleading and simplistic on historical matters. In this paper, I document how four authors writing 100 or more years ago greatly influenced my research on nonavian reptile behaviour. These four authors, which merit serious re-reading by students of virtually any taxa and topic, are Jakob von Uexkull, Margaret Floy Washburn, James Mark Baldwin and Wallace Craig. There are also current and upcoming challenges and risks impacting animal behaviour research that may affect how today's research will be viewed in historical perspectives 50, 100 or more years from now.

AB Some crab spiders can change their colour to match the flower they use as a hunting platform and, in choice trials, they select same-colour flowers over contrasting flowers. Colour change is a costly physiological process that could help spiders capture more prey or avoid predators. There is no evidence, however, that crypsis increases the hunting success of spiders, and its effect on predator avoidance has not been studied. To evaluate the effect of crypsis on predation rate we tethered yellow crab spiders, Thomisus onustus, to artificial white and yellow flowers. To evaluate its effect on hunting success we released them on yellow corn daisy, Glebionis segetum, inflorescences and purple common mallow, Malva sylvestris, flowers. The colour contrast between crab spiders and artificial flowers was well above the detection threshold, but it was twice as large for spiders tethered to white flowers. Overall predation risk was higher on white than on yellow flowers. Yellow spiders released on purple mallows were three times more likely to capture prey than those released on yellow daisies. Despite this difference, during field surveys we have never seen a Thomisus female hunting on a mallow flower. Colour match plays a role in predator avoidance. Imperfect crypsis, that is, not matching a flower exactly, still more than halved predation rates on crab spiders and, in the field, spiders selected flowers with colours they could match, ignoring others where their hunting success would be much higher, but where they would be extremely conspicuous.

AB Infant care is costly, and strategies to deal with its energetic demands may involve increasing feeding time or reducing activity levels or social time. In mammals, the most energetically expensive form of infant care is lactation, followed by infant carrying in species where young are transported over long distances. In titi monkeys, infants are carried primarily by males, which allows us to tease apart the effects of lactation and infant carrying. We analysed activity budgets and diet composition in adult males and females in seven free-ranging groups of red titi monkeys, Plecturocebus cupreus, in the Peruvian Amazon over 14 months. Females fed more, consumed more arthropods and rested less after infant birth than before, and males fed less, consumed fewer arthropods and rested more. Lactating females increased feeding time at the expense of mainly resting and, to a lesser degree, social time. Despite the general decrease in social time, females conserved grooming time within pairs. Our results suggest that females and males use opposing strategies to cope with the costs of parental care and indicate the importance of pair bond maintenance for females.

AB Many animals, from humans to invertebrates, exhibit sexual preference for unfamiliar partners. This may reduce the risk of inbreeding and increase offspring heterozygosity. An alternative less tested hypothesis is that selection for neophilia in other contexts (e.g. exploration of unfamiliar environments) may promote mate preference for unfamiliar partners. We tested whether exploratory tendency covaries with female preference for unfamiliar mates in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a species in which exploratory behaviour show significant phenotypic and genetic variation. We measured the exploratory behaviour of females using an unfamiliar environment test. The same females were also tested for preference for an unfamiliar male over a male with which they had spent the previous 24 h. We found that a female's tendency to explore an unfamiliar environment was positively correlated with the strength of her preference for unfamiliar males. Our results support the hypothesis that exploration might play a role in the evolution and maintenance of preference for unfamiliar males via functional pleiotropy.

AB To forage nonrandomly, animals must discriminate among food items. Foods differ in look, smell and taste, providing cues for foragers with appropriate senses. Irrespective of the sensory modality, however, foragers can only use cues effectively if they can detect sensory signals above background noise. Recent evidence shows that foraging mammalian herbivores can detect plant odours, but their capacity to select preferred plants in a noisy olfactory background is unknown. Using choice trials, we tested whether the African elephant, Loxodonta africana, uses plant odour as a salient cue despite increasingly complex and challenging background odours. We first established their preference for familiar plant species. We then tested their capacity to discriminate and select preferred plants based on odour alone. We found that elephants successfully chose preferred species even when presented with complex background odours from nonpreferred plants mimicking multispecies vegetation patches. Elephants also succeeded despite our attempt to mask distinguishing odours with large amounts of a synthetic green leaf volatile. GC-MS analysis confirmed that volatile organic compound profiles differed between plant species. In demonstrating that elephants exploit plant odours even when the signal from preferred plants is embedded in sensory noise of background odours, we provide crucial behavioural evidence that olfaction provides an efficient mechanism for selective, nonrandom foraging. Whether mammalian herbivores recognize novel odours, for example from newly invading plant species, or when air pollution degrades odours of familiar plants, needs investigating. Accounting for the capacity of mammalian herbivores to use plant odour cues will improve models of both their foraging behaviour and the ecosystem impacts of their foraging.

AB An increase in the perceived risk of predation triggers many behavioural changes in prey species, which can have consequences for their reproductive success. Perceived predation risk may also influence investment in extrapair activities and, as a result, the frequency of extrapair paternity (EPP), but this possibility remains largely untested. Here we report on a study of a small passerine bird, the blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, in which we experimentally manipulated perceived predation risk by intermittently broadcasting predator calls throughout the breeding season. We found no evidence that the treatment affected two behavioural indices of extrapair activity (extrabox visits and the time of emergence from the nestbox in the morning during the fertile period) or the rate of EPP itself. The treatment also had no significant effect on clutch size, hatching success or most reproductive behaviours. However, nests in the predator playback treatment produced more fledglings, which was mainly due to a lower frequency of complete brood mortality. We discuss potential explanations for this finding, as well as for the lack of evidence for other effects of the predator playback treatment on blue tit reproductive behaviour. Several measures of reproductive performance suggest that the year in which the experiment took place was an unusually poor one and further work is therefore needed to assess the generality of our findings.

AB Animals tend to learn and make decisions inductively, and simple, individual-level behavioural decisions can scale up to yield interesting emergent properties at the population level. The minority game is a theoretical formulation based on the principle of inductive learning, wherein a group of individuals, each facing two equivalent choices, self-organize to achieve maximum coordination. Coordination increases with memory length up to a certain threshold, and thereafter, at very high memory lengths, decisions resemble a random choice game. We invoked and observed minority games in guppies, Poecilia reticulata, by forcing them to choose between two symmetric chambers in a series of repeated trials. At an intermediate timescale, guppies self-organized into a globally efficient state featuring maximum coordination. After a large number of trials, the guppies approached a steady state in which they behaved as if they were randomly choosing between the two chambers. Intriguingly, both the time taken to reach this globally efficient state (i.e. learning time) and the grouping behaviour for decision making depended on the sexual composition of the fish populations. We identified a positive correlation between group size and learning time in the experiments, which we further explored using simulations to uncover the form of decision-making framework at play, testing between a leader-based framework and a consensus-based one. Our simulations supported the presence of a consensus-based decision-making process in the system. This work also provides an unexplored general framework to further investigate and understand simple decision-making dynamics and structure in animal groups.

AB The nonlinearity and fear hypothesis predicts that the structure of alarm vocalizations will be influenced by the signaller's internal state. Specifically, stressed or otherwise more aroused individuals will produce alarm calls that are relatively more nonlinear (i.e. they sound noisier). The position of an individual in a social network can influence an individual's sense of security. More centrally located individuals may feel more secure and thus we might expect that they would produce noisier calls. Building on previous research about the influence of social relationships on an individual's sense of security, we asked whether social network position explained variation in the noisiness (quantified as Wiener entropy) and goodness of pitch of alarm calls produced by trapped yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. More socially isolated individuals, characterized by lower instrength, produced alarm calls with higher entropy and higher goodness of pitch. These isolated individuals may be more aroused because they have fewer social partners to depend on when presented with a predatory threat; therefore, they produce both noisy and potentially louder calls. Additionally, individuals with higher outcloseness produced calls with higher goodness of pitch, which may be indicative of their ability to better inform neighbours of impending threats. Overall, this study further illustrates how an individual's social network position influences the structure of its alarm calls, which could reflect how individuals perceive their current safety levels.

AB Investigating nonhuman primate vocal communication is often with the intention of elucidating their similarities with human speech and thus reconstructing the evolutionary history of this important behaviour. However, putative parallels between primate and human vocal behaviours have, in some respects, remained elusive. Here, we review two lines of research in marmoset monkeys on volitional vocal control and vocal learning during development that could bridge our understanding of the relationship between primate vocalizations and human speech. Regarding volitional control, we review how changes in vocal output are not solely due to changes in arousal levels and their effect on the vocal apparatus; extrinsic factors like the vocalizations from other conspecifics also have an important influence. With regard to vocal learning, we describe not only how infant marmoset vocalizations undergo dramatic acoustic changes during development that are not wholly explained by physical growth, but also how, as in humans, contingent vocal responses from parents influence the rate of vocal development. We argue that the similarities in the vocal systems of marmoset monkeys and humans may be due to their shared cooperative breeding strategy and prosociality.

AB The evolution of exclusive paternal care in arthropods is influenced by both natural and sexual selection. Male care may simultaneously increase egg protection against natural enemies and male attractiveness to ovipositing females. When caring males desert or die, their clutches may be adopted either by females that provide flexible compensation of parental care or by males that may increase their own attractiveness caring for unrelated eggs. Whether foster parents are as efficient as the original owner males in protecting the clutch is a question that has rarely been addressed. Here we experimentally evaluated the efficiency of egg attendance provided by males of the mud-nest harvestman Quindina limbata. We also tested whether unattended nests are adopted by females and/or unrelated males, and compared the efficiency of the protection provided by foster parents with that provided by the original owner males. We found that when males were present inside the nest, nest visits by egg predators were much lower than in experimentally unattended nests. Ten conspeciflcs (8 males, 2 females) adopted experimentally unattended nests. Foster males were as efficient as the original owner males in decreasing nest visits by egg predators. The most important conclusions of our study are: (1) male protection is crucial for egg survival because unattended nests are promptly attacked by predators; (2) flexible compensation of parental care by females is rare; (3) males adopt unrelated nests and protect the eggs as efficiently as original owner males, probably because egg attendance is a sexually selected behaviour.

AB Animals change their daily activity patterns in response to season, food availability and the presence of competitors. Competition may be an important driver of a species' daily activity pattern, as animals manage conflict by avoiding each other temporally. We evaluated how vegetation structure and the presence of competitors changed the daily activity patterns of closely related fox squirrels, Sciurus niger, and grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis. We monitored squirrel activity in north and central Florida using passive game cameras at two spatial scales: local and point. To understand how seasonality and competition interact to drive behaviour, we compared squirrel activity during the leaf-off (1 January - 15 March) and leaf-on (16 March - 1 July) seasons. We tested for a relationship between squirrel activity and canopy cover by fitting a von Mises kernel distribution. To test how season and competition affected squirrel behaviour, we compared activity by computing a kernel density overlap function, ranging from 0 (no overlap: the squirrels are never active at the same time) to 1 (complete overlap: the squirrels have identical activity patterns). We found that daily squirrel behaviour was not influenced by canopy cover (P = 0.61). Fox squirrels had a single activity peak occurring around midday. In contrast, grey squirrels had a bimodal activity pattern with peaks shortly after sunrise and before sunset. The intensity of this partitioning existed on a gradient and changed with season and the presence of competitors. Fox and grey squirrel daily patterns overlapped the most when they were allopatric in the leaf-on season (overlap = 0.70, P < 0.001) and the least while sympatric in the leaf-on season (overlap = 0.24, P < 0.08). This ephemeral response to competition highlights that various axes of resource partitioning can promote coexistence between closely related species.

AB Understanding how animal groups form and function is a major goal in behavioural ecology. Both genetic relatedness and familiarity among group mates have been shown to be key mediators of group composition. However, disentangling the two in most species is challenging as the most familiar individuals are often the most related, and vice versa. The relatedness between individuals is constant, whereas familiarity is not, and so familiarity may be more likely to mediate interactions in dynamic environments. Here, we manipulated the level of familiarity among groups of the naturally clonal, and genetically identical, Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa, and monitored group behaviour in an open-field assay and when given the opportunity to forage. Contrary to our predictions, fish that were the most familiar with each other showed the highest levels of aggression. Additionally, fish that were less familiar with each other exhibited the highest group cohesion and took the longest to begin feeding, compared to the more familiar fish. These results suggest that familiarity may socially buffer individuals from the perception of risk in novel environments, such as is common in most behavioural assays designed to test group behaviour. Increases in aggression that are associated with increasing familiarity as shown here might be a mechanism by which fish maintain a fission-fusion society with important consequences for the patterns of associations in group-living animals.

AB Living in a seasonally changing environment requires periodic, reversible changes in animals' phenotypes to match variations in their abiotic and biotic environments. These changes may relate to temperature regulation, torpor use, basal metabolic rate, body mass or behaviour, all acting in concert to ensure the best adjustment to the environmental challenges. As winter approaches, many small mammals develop a winter phenotype that is qualitatively and quantitatively different from a summer one. However, there is a significant within-population polymorphism in winter phenotype. We hypothesized that winter phenotype is correlated with consistent between-individual differences in animal behaviour, i.e. animal personality, and energy metabolism. We measured basal metabolic rate (BMR) and behavioural traits in three winter phenotypes of Siberian hamsters, Phodopus sungorus, which were acclimated to summer-like and then to winter-like conditions: fully responding, nonresponding and partially responding to a short photoperiod. We found no differences in behavioural traits between hamsters of different winter phenotypes, but the seasonal increase in activity was lowest in full responders indicating their lower behavioural flexibility than partial responders and nonresponders. The same was true for BMR. While nonresponders and partial responders increased their BMR from summer to winter, full responders did not change it. We argue that different winter phenotypes are maintained in the population because they could be beneficial under different environmental conditions. We also suggest that within a population there is a continuum of winter phenotypes, which is not related to differences in animal personalities. This continuum allows for population maintenance despite environmental conditions changing over short and long timescales. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   VOCALIZATION
AB Circulating hormone levels often vary considerably among males competing for mates, but how this variation affects the signalling phenotype is poorly understood. In the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea, males competing for mates engage in vocal contests that increase circulating levels of the adrenal glucocorticoid corticosterone (CORT) and decrease androgens in contest losers, who characteristically adopt a noncalling 'satellite' mating tactic. We previously showed that CORT administration to calling males reduces vocal effort and increases the probability of satellite behaviour during simulated territorial intrusions, suggesting that elevated CORT compromises vocal quality and decreases the propensity to call in a context-dependent manner. However, the extent to which these effects reflect variation in vocal behaviour of males in natural choruses is unclear. Here, we examined how hormone levels, social context and other potential determinants of vocalization, including body size and condition, relate to vocal attributes and behaviour in calling males and in associated satellites after removal of calling 'host' males. Results revealed that satellites had higher CORT and lower androgens and were smaller and in poorer condition than host males. Host removal resulted in vocalization in 74% of satellites. These males invested less effort in vocalization than hosts, and CORT level best explained these differences. The remaining 26% of satellites did not vocalize after host removal and had lower androgens than satellites that vocalized. Results provide support for context-dependent effects (i.e. host presence/absence) of elevated CORT on the probability of vocalization and link high CORT to reduced vocal quality. In contrast, low androgens were associated with a low probability of vocalization regardless of social context, and androgen level was a poor predictor of vocal attributes. Our results link high CORT and low androgens to variation in signalling quality and behaviour that potentially reduces the probability of attracting females.

AB Learning is a key behavioural adaptation allowing animals to respond to complex and changing environments. Although the field of animal behaviour has seen an increase in the taxonomic breadth of learning studies in recent decades, investigations within an explicit, broad phylogenetic framework are rare, curtailing our understanding of the evolution of learning and advanced cognition. Pit vipers (Viperidae: Crotalinae) represent a particularly interesting taxon in which to study patterns in learning as they are widely studied, have had learning documented in many species, occupy a range of ecological niches and possess vast and varied natural history traits. We investigated the latency to decision in a laboratory thermal maze in 13 species of pit viper (7 species of rattlesnakes and 6 species of nonrattlesnake pit viper) and one true viper species (the puff adder, Bitis arietans (Viperidae: Viperinae), as an outgroup comparison). Relative to the other pit vipers, rattlesnakes uniformly and quickly (after only one trial) decreased their latency to respond to thermal stress; their latency remained low and uniform across the remaining 11 trials. All other pit viper species failed to modify their behaviour across trials and maintained a consistent latency across all 12 trials, as did the puff adder. This pattern could reflect differential learning abilities between rattlesnake and nonrattlesnake pit vipers. Our results underscore the advantages of incorporating a broad phylogenetic perspective when investigating learning and comparative cognition.

AB Animals are able to modify their behaviour in response to changes in their internal and environmental state. The asset protection principle predicts that an animal's risk-taking behaviour should vary as a result of its residual reproductive value (RRV); animals with greater RRV would incur a greater cost if injured or killed and should therefore take fewer risks than those with low RRV. Despite the intuitive appeal of this hypothesis, few studies have effectively separated the effects of RRV on behaviour from those of age. We addressed this weakness in the widely invoked hypothesis by measuring the risk-taking behaviour of female Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, at various points in the animal's lifetime. We found significant effects of age on risk-taking behaviour: older females emerged from a shelter sooner after a simulated predation threat and exhibited greater mobility in an open arena. Importantly, there was also a significant marginal effect of RRV on risk-taking behaviour. Females with lower RRV displayed greater levels of risk taking than females with high RRV. Our results thereby offer support for the asset protection principle as an explanation for state-dependent variation in risk-taking behaviour.

AB Food availability is a major characteristic of habitat quality, linking habitats with demographic parameters such as reproductive performance. Parent birds adjust their food provisioning to both habitat-specific food characteristics and the demands of their young. However, because habitat quality and the brood's food intake are often correlated, the underlying mechanisms of adjustments in parental provisioning remain entangled. How the relationship between habitat quality and parental provisioning behaviour affects the quantity of food available to nestlings and the resulting nestling growth and survival is therefore still incompletely established. We experimentally increased the food intake of little owl, Athene noctua, nestlings in two habitat types differing in food availability and used unsupplemented broods as controls. The food supplementation experiment allowed us to disentangle the effect of habitat type from the effect of the nestlings' food intake on parental provisioning behaviour. Camera traps recording a series of 10 consecutive images for each parental visit allowed us to quantify visiting rates and diet composition by applying a hierarchical multinomial model explicitly accounting for the observation process. Food supplementation caused parents to switch to smaller food items and to increase visiting rates, resulting in similar biomass brought to nestlings in supplemented and unsupplemented broods. Irrespective of the food supplementation, parents in low-quality habitats delivered 63% of the biomass delivered by those in high-quality habitats. Accordingly, we found an increase in nestling survival rates in response to food supplementation in low-quality habitats, but not in high-quality habitats. Our results show that habitat quality affects the biomass of prey delivered to the brood, whereas the nutritional state of the brood affects prey selection or foraging modes of parents. Reproductive output directly reflected habitat quality in terms of food availability, identifying food as the main factor underlying differential reproduction within and between populations.

AB To assess potential mates' quality individuals can observe sexually interacting conspecifics. Such social information use is called mate copying and occurs when observer individuals witnessing sexual interactions of conspecifics later show a mating preference for mates that were seen mating. Most studies have focused on female mate copying, as females are usually the choosy sex. However, much less is known about the existence of male mate copying, probably because of the usual strong asymmetry in sex roles. Mate copying has been documented in female Drosophila melanogaster, and here we report on experimental evidence for mate copying in males of this species in which females can actively reject males and prevent copulation. As mate choice implies high costs for males we assumed that they perform mate copying as well. We created two artificial female phenotypes by randomly dusting females with green or pink powders, and virgin naive observer males were given the opportunity to see a demonstrator male choosing between a pink and a green demonstrator female. Immediately afterwards, observer males were given the choice between two new females, one of each colour. To circumvent the difficulty of determining actual male mate preference, we used two complementary indices of male mate choice, both of which provided evidence for male mate copying. Informed observer males showed a bias towards females of the colour they saw being chosen during demonstrations, while uninformed males chose randomly between pink and green females. This suggests that male fruit flies can also perform mate copying. Although significant, our results in males were less clear-cut than in females in previous studies. However, like females, D. melanogaster males can mate copy based on a single observation. The importance and generality of such mate copying abilities in nature, and their potential impact on the evolution of Drosophila and probably other invertebrates, need further exploration.

AB Nest site selection is a critical behaviour, particularly in species with no parental care, as it can greatly impact offspring survival. Marine turtles depend on sandy beaches to nest, where they select from a range of microhabitats that may differently affect hatchling survival and phenotype. Here we describe the degree of nest site selection at one of the largest green turtle rookeries globally, in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, and how this impacts offspring. In 2013 and 2014 we recorded the spatial distribution of 1559 nests, and monitored 657 females during oviposition, to assess population and individual preferences on nesting site. Overall, females tended to nest close to the vegetation, at a preferred elevation of 4.8-5.0 m, which was above the highest spring tide (4.7 m), enhancing clutch survival. Individuals displayed high repeatability in nesting microhabitat type (open sand, forest border and forest), distance along the beach, distance to the vegetation and elevation, which may result from this behaviour having a genetic basis or from fine-scale nest site philopatry. Hatchlings from cooler nests were larger, potentially dispersing faster and more able to evade predators, while smaller hatchlings, from warmer nests, retained more energetic reserves (residual yolk), which may also be advantageous for initial dispersal, particularly if food is scarce. Thus, individual preferences in nest site selection led to trade-offs in offspring phenotype, but overall, most nesting females selected sites that increased offspring survival, suggesting that nest site selection is an adaptive trait that has been under selection. As under future climate change scenarios females nesting in upper shaded areas should have higher fitness, individual consistency in nesting microhabitat provides opportunity for natural selection to occur.

AB Many animals actively defend their offspring using a range of behaviours from calling and mobbing in birds, to physical grappling in crustaceans, and the expression of these behaviours positively scale with offspring value. While this role of behaviour in defence is well studied, very little is known about how other traits, specifically the structure of architectural constructions such as webs and nests, contribute to offspring defence. Additionally, although some taxa show consistent individual differences in offspring defence behaviour, it is completely unknown whether individuals also differ in defensive structures. We addressed these questions in the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti, by measuring how a female laying an eggcase influences female behaviour and web structure, and whether those traits scale with relative reproductive investment. Our results show that females modified web structure in response to an eggcase, but only the protective elements of web structure positively scaled with the relative value of that eggcase. Finally, despite the significant correlations, fixed effects (e.g. eggcase possession/value) in the models explained only 5-23% of the variation in behaviour and web structure, while the random effect of individual identity explained 46-65% of the variation. This variation drove moderate to high repeatability estimates across all traits, suggesting that some individuals consistently invest relatively more in defence, while some invest less. These results highlight that extended phenotypic traits may be a critical component of offspring defence in some taxa. Furthermore, individual variation in these traits suggest that different reproductive strategies may exist, whereby some individuals invest more in reproduction at a cost to safety/foraging and vice versa.

   AGGRESSION; AMPHIPODA
AB Finding universal rules that predict the success of potential invaders is difficult given the breadth of interactions that occur between the invader and the other species in its new range. Among animal species, behavioural traits may play an especially relevant role in mediating these interactions. Whereas the predatory behaviour of invasive predators is especially well documented, less is known about how behaviour may mediate the success of invasive prey species. Here we tested how the behaviour of both an invasive prey species, the amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus, and a common fish predator, the European perch, Perca fluviatilis, affect the outcome of predation events. Invasive D. villosus exhibited significantly greater sheltering and less exploratory behaviour than a naturalized amphipod Gammarus roeseli. This increased sheltering behaviour in the invasive amphipod appears to have a major functional consequence as this species was far less likely than the naturalized amphipod to be predated by the perch. Contrary to our predictions, the behaviour of the individual perch had no influence on consumption of either amphipod species, suggesting that amphipod behaviour was the key determinant of the success of a predation event. Our results highlight the importance of prey behaviour during predation events and emphasize that consideration of antipredator behaviour in potentially invasive prey species may help improve predictions of invasion success.

AB Migratory organisms face many challenges as they travel to take advantage of changing resources, exhibiting a variety of strategies to successfully move between locations. Birds are a model taxa for understanding migratory systems, relying on a multitude of cues and showing diverse behaviours, one of which is their propensity to give calls during migratory flight. However, this behaviour is understudied and may have implications in orientation, navigation and migration monitoring. Because a variety of migratory behaviours differ among and within species as a function of age, sex and body condition, we evaluated whether flight-calling behaviour was related to any of these variables. We studied flight-calling behaviour in four species of passage migrant warblers in captivity during autumn migration at Powdermill Avian Research Center (Rector, PA, U.S.A.) and Braddock Bay Bird Observatory (Greece, NY, U.S.A.). Our results demonstrate extensive variation in flight-calling behaviour by migrant warblers. When all species were combined, young birds were more likely to call and call at a higher rate than adults. All species-specific models were consistent in suggesting a higher propensity and rate of calling by young birds, although the black-throated blue warbler, Setophaga caerulescens, was the only species-specific model with significant age-related differences. When all species were combined, sex did not have a significant effect on either propensity or rate of calling. The effect of sex was inconsistent across species, and only magnolia warbler, Setophaga magnolia, males were significantly more likely to respond to calls than females. Surprisingly, body condition did not significantly affect the propensity or rate of calling. While our results reflect the complexity of flight-calling behaviour, our finding that young migrants consistently gave more calls has broad utility, particularly in quantitative migration monitoring. These results demonstrate the need for additional study to determine the selective forces influencing flight-calling behaviour. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The role of interspecific aggression in structuring ecological communities can be important to consider when reintroducing endangered species to areas of their historic range that are occupied by competitors. We sought to determine which species is the most serious interference competitor of the endangered Pacific pocket mouse, Perognathus longimembris pacificus, and more generally, whether interspecific aggression in rodents is predicted by body size, residency status or phylogenetic relatedness. We carried out simulated territory intrusion experiments between P. longimembris and four sympatric species of rodents (Chaetodipus fallax, Dipodomys simulans, Peromyscus maniculatus, Reithrodontomys megalotis) in a field enclosure in southern California sage scrub habitat. We found that body size asymmetries strongly predicted dominance, regardless of phylogenetic relatedness or the residency status of the individuals. The largest species, D. simulans, was the most dominant while the smallest species, R. megalotis, was the least dominant to P. longimembris. Furthermore, P. longimembris actively avoided encounters with all species, except R. megalotis. One management recommendation that follows from these results is that P. longimembris should not be reintroduced to areas with high densities of D. simulans until further research is carried out to assess the fitness consequences of the interactions. Our finding that the species least similar in body size is the most serious interference competitor of P. longimembris highlights an important distinction between interference and exploitative competition in rodent communities.

AB Maternal care varies across taxa from brief, minimal care to long-term, intensive care. Mammalian mothers provide extensive and energetically expensive care by definition through pregnancy and lactation, which can extend for years, resulting in behavioural trade-offs between resource acquisition and direct care. In marine environments, mammalian mothers face unique challenges, such as the inability to cache or den their offspring while diving for prey. Dolphin newborns are precocious, accomplishing shallow dives in the first few weeks of life, however, fully mature diving and breath-holding capabilities take years to develop. Consequently, mothers are faced with a trade-off between diving and foraging or remaining close to and protecting their calves at the surface. Here we examined this trade-off, specifically by investigating whether mothers change their dive durations, especially during foraging, as a function of calf age. We used a longitudinal (1988-2014) data set on wild bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Shark Bay, Western Australia, which included 27 388 dive bouts from mothers (N = 26) and calves (N = 41). Our results show that maternal diving behaviour changes in response to calf age and sex. While both male and female calves increased their dive durations with age as expected, mothers were more likely to adjust their diving behaviour to accommodate female but not male calves, especially when daughters were in close proximity. This is consistent with findings that vertical social learning is more critical for daughters than for sons, and may reflect the sex-specific foraging and social tactics of the males and females more generally.

   HYPOTHESIS
AB Fitness costs of incubation ensue whenever the trade-off between incubation and foraging leads to suboptimal incubation or decreased parental body condition. We examined the costs of incubation in a wild population of house wrens, Troglodytes aedon, by experimentally extending or decreasing the incubation period by cross-fostering eggs between nests at different stages of incubation (eggs from control nests were cross-fostered at the same stage of incubation). We determined whether parents or offspring bear the costs of incubation by measuring effects on females and offspring within the same breeding season during which the manipulation occurred, but also by evaluating potential trade-offs between current and future reproduction by monitoring return rates of experimental females and recruitment rates of offspring in subsequent breeding seasons. There was no difference in hatching or fledging success across treatments. There was also no effect of incubation duration on female size-corrected mass, and females from different treatments were equally likely to produce a second brood. Nestlings produced by control and experimental females did not differ in body mass, tarsus length or residual mass. Neither return rates of females, nor the number of offspring recruited, differed across treatments. We conclude, therefore, that although prolonged incubation entails increased energy expenditures, females are able to offset these losses while foraging, thereby mitigating the costs of incubation. This resiliency is more likely to be seen in income breeders, such as house wrens, that retain some ability to recoup energy expended in incubation, than in capital breeders that are constrained by stored energy reserves.

AB Female-female aggression and its functions are poorly understood compared with male-male aggression. Here, we examined the role of female-female aggression in mate defence in an Asian agamid lizard, Phrynocephalus vlangalii, in which male neighbours are valuable to females in both mating success and resource defence. We provided three social contexts by pairing a resident female with either a neighbour male, unfamiliar male or unfamiliar female, then introduced a tethered unknown female ( intruder). We carried out our experiments during and outside the mating season to test the links between female-female aggression and mate defence. The aggressive responses of resident females in these different social contexts were compared by quantifying variation in their territorial displays. Resident females were faster to display to the intruder in the presence of a neighbour male compared with both the unfamiliar male and female. We also found that female lizards signalled faster in the presence of the neighbour male than the other contexts, but only during the mating season. To separate the effects of familiarity from those of sex, we carried out a second experiment in which we paired a resident female with a neighbour male or neighbour female, before introducing a tethered unfamiliar female. In this experiment, resident females responded sooner to intruder females when paired with the neighbour male, although signalling speeds were equivalent. Taken together, our results suggest female-female aggression is used for both resource and mate defence, and so might be under direct selection. Our study highlights that female aggression more broadly requires further work. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Globally increasing urbanization causes major anthropogenic changes in ecosystems, drastically altering phenotypes of organisms. Increased contamination is a well-known result of urbanization, and its effect on behaviour has been extensively studied. Yet, animal personality, consistent behavioural variation between individuals, has rarely been investigated in the context of anthropogenic contaminants. Changes in personalities may affect the viability of populations, and even alter community dynamics. We investigated the effects of exposure to a sublethal dose of the commonly used pesticide esfenvalerate on two personality traits, activity and boldness, and compared these effects between replicated rural and urban populations using larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. We tested for effects on behaviour at three distinct levels: the average levels of behaviours, the consistency of behaviours (repeatability), and the structure of the behavioural correlations (behavioural syndrome). We found that the pesticide treatment changed the average activity and the behavioural covariation (activity and boldness), but not the behavioural repeatability. Importantly, these pesticide-induced patterns depended strongly on urbanization level. The average activity reduction due to pesticide exposure was only present in urban individuals. Moreover, while a behavioural correlation between activity and boldness in rural larvae appeared only after the pesticide treatment, this activity-boldness syndrome was consistently present in the urban larvae. These differential responses of urban and rural populations may be explained by the apparently more efficient coping mechanism with contaminants of urban populations, as well as the generally more stressful urban habitats. These results highlight the importance of measuring behavioural expressions at various levels when assessing contaminant effects, and not just the means. Further, we suggest that pollution may play an important role in understanding the evolution and maintenance of animal personalities in natural populations.

   EXPERIENCE; PREFERENCE FUNCTIONS; CHEMICAL SIGNALS
AB Complex signals of animals involve multiple sensory modes and contain multiple structural components, and teasing apart how these modes and components interact in receiver decision making is an experimental challenge. Females of many species have ordered preferences for increased size or expression of male indicator traits. However, studies also suggest other species may exhibit comparative evaluation of mates rather than absolute preference hierarchies. We examined mate assessment by female wolf spiders, Schizocosa ocreata, using digital playback of video and vibratory/seismic signals in preference and choice tests of male trait differences. In playback experiments, female wolf spiders showed ordered preferences for male condition indicating traits (leg tuft size, vibration signal amplitude) in both individual sensory modes and multimodal (combined) signals. Tests with single modes and multimodal signals showed that trait expression in either signal mode affects outcome of mate choice. Females exhibited transitive preferences, consistently choosing males with larger tuft size or higher amplitude vibration in no-choice and two-choice tests. Thus, female S. ocreata do not necessarily need to compare mates to exhibit preferences for particular traits. Choice tests with multimodal playback showed that females made predicted choices when male traits covaried positively, but in 'cue-conflict' (negative trait covariance) choice tests, females showed a bias for visual signal trait expression (tuft size), displaying priority for visual signals over vibratory signals when in conflict. These studies demonstrate that under controlled experimental conditions, differences in behavioural responses to manipulation of digital video and vibration playback can provide valuable insights about recognition and interpretation of complex signals and their components.

AB Hatching is an essential and often behaviourally mediated process. Many animals can hatch at different developmental stages, and embryos time hatching based on cues indicating threats to eggs or opportunities outside them. However, specific mechanisms enabling such responses, and how their ontogenies combine to determine when environmentally cued hatching is possible, are largely unknown. Many embryos use hatching cues in multiple sensory modalities. Thus, comparing response onset across cue types can distinguish shared ontogenetic constraints, such as hatching ability, from modality-specific constraints, such as sensor development. The arboreal embryos of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, hatch rapidly in response to physical disturbance in predator attacks and hypoxia if flooded. Prior research documented both responses beginning at age 4 days. Because embryos orient in oxygen gradients long before this, we hypothesized the onset of hypoxia-cued hatching is limited by development of hatching ability. The onset of mechanosensory-cued hatching might share this constraint or be limited by a later-developing sensory mechanism. We tested developmental series for hypoxia-cued hatching, by submerging eggs in degassed water to impose strong hypoxia, and for mechanosensory-cued hatching, by manually jiggling eggs as a simulated attack. We identified morphological markers to distinguish developmental stages across the onset of hatching. Hatching competence begins substantially earlier than previously reported. Across sibships, hypoxia-cued hatching began at a smaller size and less developed stage, and on average 8 h earlier than mechanosensory-cued hatching. Both responses increased from 0% to 100% over just a few hours. Latency to hatch after stimulation was longer in hypoxia-cued hatching and uncorrelated with stage, whereas latency in mechanosensory-cued hatching decreased with development. Hypoxia-cued hatching appears constrained by the development of hatching ability, while mechanosensory-cued hatching appears constrained by mechanosensor development. Hatching ability is not the sole constraint on the onset of escape-hatching responses to attacks. c 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The suitability and quality of herbivorous insect hosts for hymenopteran parasitoids is dynamic, varying with host development. Generally, within a host species, large hosts (i. e. older instars) are considered of higher quality for parasitoid development. Studies of interspecific competition between parasitoids have considered the effect of host instar on indirect competition but its effect on interference competition remains unknown. Here, we report the first results on whether the quality of host instars might dictate the outcome of interference competition between sympatric parasitoids of the genus Aphytis (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) when they attack low-quality (second) and high-quality (third) instars of their common host Aonidiella aurantii (Hemiptera: Diaspididae). Oviposition behaviour (host acceptance and clutch size) in low-and high-quality host instars was similar for both Aphytis species in the absence of competition. When they found heterospecific parasitized hosts of high quality, Aphytis melinus laid more eggs and accepted significantly more hosts than Aphytis chrysomphali, whereas there were no significant differences in the low-quality instar. This result suggests that interference competition is mediated by host quality. However, the progeny proportion of both parasitoids in multiparasitized hosts (outcome of competition) was independent of host quality and A. melinus always emerged at higher rates. Therefore, the result of interference competition between these sympatric parasitoids was not affected by host quality and this competition will contribute to the displacement of the native A. chrysomphali by the introduced A. melinus, which has been observed in some areas of the Mediterranean basin.

AB The dear enemy effect arises when territorial animals respond more intensely to unfamiliar strangers than to familiar neighbours. This widespread behavioural phenomenon occurs because strangers represent a threat to both an animal's territory and parentage, whereas neighbours represent a threat only to parentage. Recent research in birds demonstrates some flexibility in the dear enemy effect across the breeding season. Given that neighbours often sire extrapair young, male animals may benefit by responding more aggressively to neighbours during periods of female fertility. Here we investigate the hypothesis that the dear enemy effect varies with female fertility by testing the prediction that male birds will respond more strongly to neighbours when their own mates are fertile than when they are not fertile. We conducted a playback experiment with wild song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, repeating playback sessions to paired territorial males over the course of a breeding season, including periods when females were fertile and periods when they were not. Male song sparrows displayed a dear enemy effect only when their social mate was not fertile. We conclude that male song sparrows adjust behaviour towards neighbours based on their own mate's fertility status, presumably because neighbours threaten a territorial male's parentage during his breeding partner's fertile period. When paternity is not at stake, reduced aggression towards neighbours may enhance fitness, but when paternity is at stake, normal levels of aggression towards neighbours may be favoured as a mate-guarding tactic.

AB Male preference for mating with large females and its benefits on fitness have been shown in several animal taxa. However, the mechanisms underlying this preference are less well known. Dendroctonus valens, a primarily monogamous bark beetle whose females initiate tunnels beneath the bark of host trees, provides a useful system for testing how male mate choice is based on size. Field observations and laboratory experiments demonstrated that D. valens males preferentially entered tunnels containing large females, and that large females were more fecund than small females. Behavioural assays showed that males could discern tunnel size, and preferred larger artificially constructed tunnels in a two-choice assay. Males were also able to walk more quickly through larger diameter tunnels. Volatiles and chirping sounds associated with females were also analysed. Female body size was positively associated with the intensity of the female's chirp, but not with the quantity of pheromones released. Playback of this chirp showed males preferred female-produced sound to a silent control, and that males could discriminate between soft and loud sounds. Male D. valens appear to have evolved strategies of mate selection by relying on dual cues, tunnel size and acoustic signals, to obtain a large partner to increase fitness.

AB Females that quickly and accurately locate and assess males can reduce their risks of predation, dehydration and heat stress while mate searching. Here we measured the accuracy and time it took female fiddler crabs, Uca mjoebergi, to approach robotic claws that simulated males' courtship signals. We ran six experiments: three one-choice experiments varying in waving display rate (fast, medium and slow) and three three-choice experiments with increased number of displays (all with fast wave rate) and complexity (each one at the three different rates; and the three different rates presented at different distances, with the fast wave rate further from the female and the slow wave rate closer to the female). Females approached all waving robots with an accuracy of 9-18 degrees. They approached faster-waving claws more quickly even when they were presented in sets of three claws, but it took females longer to approach a claw in the more complex situation, with claws waving at different rates and distances. Females may approach waving claws more rapidly simply because they present a more continuous and less ambiguous stimulus. The results suggest that high signalling rates may attract females because they reduce female search costs, and they may or may not additionally signal male quality.

AB Oxytocin manipulation has been implicated in the facilitation of social and cooperative behaviours, either through increasing positive and cooperative social interactions, or facilitating bond formation. Here we aimed to determine whether peripheral administration of oxytocin would affect the propensity of unrelated female house mice, Mus musculus domesticus, to cooperate. To investigate this, we used female house mice, with their cooperative ability to communally nurse offspring. Pairs of unfamiliar females received intraperitoneal injections of oxytocin over a 3-day cohabitation period. Following this initial phase, a male was introduced and allowed to mate with the females. We monitored how long it took females to establish and successfully cooperate in the raising of a communal litter. Oxytocin did not affect the females' ability to reproduce. However, oxytocin-treated females took significantly longer to establish a successful communal litter (with pups of both partners being weaned) than saline-treated control females. This delay in communal nursing was due to higher pup mortality and loss of first-born litters in the oxytocin group during their first reproductive event. We conclude that administration of exogenous oxytocin during the early stages of the female relationship delayed the tendency of female house mice to affiliate and cooperate in rearing a communal litter. Our findings contribute to the growing field of oxytocin-based studies and sheds light on the potential long-term effects of oxytocin during early pairwise social interactions.

AB Although the relationship between resource-holding potential and contest dynamics is well studied, how the value of a contested resource influences aggressive interactions has received far less attention. Questions about how animals assess a contested resource, and whether they can update their assessments of resource value during a contest require additional testing. To address this issue, we conducted a series of experiments using an invasive, territorial fish, the round goby, Neogobius melanostomus. We used this species to investigate the impact of resource quality on contest dynamics, and to test how animals gather information on resource value. First, we found that fish preferred an enclosed shelter ('high quality') to an open shelter ('low quality'). Despite this preference for high-quality shelter, fish fought equally hard for both high-and low-quality shelters in staged resource contests when they had no prior experience with the resource. However, when fish were given prior experience, contests over highquality shelters began faster and had more aggressive acts than contests over low-quality shelters. Interestingly, when the value of the resource in the contest was switched from their prior experience, the fish seemed unable to fully update their appraisal of resource value, and contest dynamics were not strictly driven by the previous or current resource value. Round goby may therefore have a limited ability to update their appraisal of resource value when engaged in a contest. Together, our findings demonstrate that fish adjust their aggressive effort to reflect resource value, but previous experience with the resource is required to assess the resource efficiently.

AB Reciprocity is a leading potential explanatory mechanism for the evolution of cooperation between nonkin. It relies upon individuals possessing information about their opponents' behaviour, but in reality this information is probably often imperfect. Different possible strategies for dealing with imperfect information include optimism (cooperate when information is unavailable) or pessimism (defect when information is unavailable). How do the strategies individuals use to cope with imperfect information when deciding whether to cooperate or defect influence the stability of reciprocity? Our previous work (Kurokawa, 2016, Letters on Evolutionary Behavioral Science, 7, 14-16) showed that the conditions under which reciprocity evolves are unaffected by whether reciprocators are optimistic or pessimistic. However, this argument is based on an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) analysis against defectors and does not consider the situation where there are heterogeneous reciprocators with different levels of optimism. In this study, by conducting an ESS analysis, I found that optimism evolves when the cost-to-benefit ratio (i.e. the ratio of the cost of cooperating to the benefit of being cooperated with) is low, whereas pessimism evolves when the cost-to-benefit ratio is high, in contrast to the results of the previous study. I also considered the case where unconditional cooperators and defectors exist and found that optimistic reciprocators are invaded by pessimistic reciprocators when the cost-to-benefit ratio is high and by unconditional cooperators when the cost-to-benefit ratio is low, whereas pessimistic reciprocators are invaded by optimistic reciprocators when the cost-to-benefit ratio is low and unconditional defectors when the cost-to-benefit ratio is high. Thus, both optimistic and pessimistic reciprocators are subject to invasion whether the cost-to-benefit ratio is high or low, suggesting that reciprocity is evolutionarily unstable. This result is consistent with a previous empirical study (Clutton-Brock, 2009, Nature, 462, 51-57), which reported that firm evidence of reciprocity in animal societies is rare.

AB Responding appropriately to predator threat is a critical survival skill for all organisms. Under-responding can result in death, while continually over-responding can waste precious energy reserves and compromise important life history attributes such as growth and reproduction. This trade-off becomes particularly pertinent in predator-rich environments such as coral reefs, yet almost nothing is known of the sublethal physiological responses that coral reef predators elicit in their prey. To address this knowledge gap, we designed equipment and protocols to measure the metabolic responses of a common coral reef fish (juvenile ambon damsel, Pomacentrus amboinensis) to chemosensory and visual stimuli of a common predator (adult yellow dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus). Pomacentrus amboinensis did not exhibit a metabolic response to the chemosensory predator stimulus, yet there was a consistent and significant metabolic response to the visual stimulus that endured for at least 24 h if the predator remained visible. A complete lack of metabolic response of P. amboinensis to the visual stimulus of a nonpredatory wrasse, Halichoeres argus, revealed an impressive ability of juvenile P. amboinensis to rapidly discriminate between similar-sized predatory and nonpredatory fishes. These divergent metabolic responses of P. amboinensis were not explained by measureable differences in their swimming behaviour in the predator versus nonpredator treatments, yet prey that were exposed to repeat predation attempts (predatory strikes) had the strongest metabolic response to the predator. Our findings demonstrate the capacity of coral reef fishes to interpret predator cues and prioritize threats and actions. Moreover, this study is the first to demonstrate that high predator densities on coral reefs could result in repetitive short-term or even chronic long-term elevations in energy expenditure of prey communities.

AB Antipredator vigilance may take a significant amount of time, leading to a trade-off between foraging and vigilance. Studies show that this trade-off is modulated by the perception of predation risk faced by individuals. Anthropogenic noise can disturb acoustic communication by masking both direct predator detection and the perception of conspecific alarm calls. We would expect a decrease in acoustic awareness to be compensated for by an increase in visual awareness. Thus, we tested whether increases in noise produced by commercial aircraft reduced foraging effort and increased vigilance time in great tits. We videotaped birds feeding on peanut feeders in the vicinity of Barajas airport (Madrid, Spain), and measured behavioural sequences before, during and after aircraft sound events. Our results show that, when aircraft noise peaked, the proportion of time devoted to vigilance was maximal, while that devoted to feeding was minimal. As a result, the ratio between vigilance and foraging was at its maximum when aircraft noise was loudest, being almost double that during baseline levels. The duration of vigilance episodes was strongly correlated with noise levels. Also, the duration of feeding bouts was at its lowest during the peak of noise, and increased after this period. We suggest that these behavioural modifications help foragers visually detect possible predators in those situations in which high levels of noise hamper sound perception. Our study suggests that behavioural plasticity could contribute to the resilience of avian populations exposed to anthropogenic disturbance.

   EVOLUTION; INTERFERENCE
AB When multiple species occur sympatrically, divergence in morphological and behavioural traits associated with species recognition and resource use are expected. Individuals that engage in interspecific aggression often suffer fitness consequences if the benefits of securing resources do not outweigh the risks associated with agonism. In the southern Appalachians, interspecific aggression frequently occurs between chestnut-sided warblers, Setophaga pensylvanica, and golden-winged warblers, Vermivora chrysoptera, a species that is experiencing sharp declines in population numbers. Using a combination of correlative and experimental approaches, we explored two potential explanations for interspecific aggression: interspecific competition and mistaken identity. It is commonly inferred that aggressive interactions are the product of competition due to an ecological niche overlap. However, because these warblers have similar crown coloration and aggressive interactions appear stochastic, aggression may be a result of mistaken identity. First, in 2014, we documented spatial overlap of the two species and measured reproductive success and habitat preference (using remote sensing) of golden-winged warblers. We found that golden-winged warblers that settled among high densities of chestnut-sided warblers were more aggressive, but chestnut-sided warbler density did not negatively influence their reproductive success; rather, habitat structure best predicted reproductive success. Next, in 2015, we tested for misidentification using models of conspecifics and heterospecifics in simulated territorial intrusions. We found that both warbler species were equally likely to both types of models, and that the most aggressive individuals were more likely to attack models. Our results suggest that, from the golden-winged warbler's perspective, sympatry is not detrimental and aggression is probably a function of mistaken identity. Yet, these behavioural interactions should be maladaptive, which may lead to the segregation of habitat types or divergence in crown morphology between species.

AB Environmental noise is increasing worldwide, limiting the space available for species to send and receive important acoustic information. Many invasive species produce acoustic signals that alter the spectrotemporal characteristics of available signalling space. This provides an opportunity to test ideas about competitive exclusion by quantifying whether species with shared requirements for acoustic resources will become excluded or partition resource use to permit coexistence. We conducted a field playback experiment to test whether native treefrogs (green treefrogs, Hyla cinerea; pine woods treefrogs, Hyla femoralis) modify their acoustic behaviour to minimize acoustic competition from chorus noise of the invasive Cuban treefrog, Osteopilus septentrionalis. We demonstrate that noise from an invasive species differentially affects the vocal behaviour of native species. Those with similar calls (H. cinerea) shortened calls, called louder and persisted calling in response to masking stimuli while those with different calls (H. femoralis) did not modify behaviour. This evidence suggests that acoustic competition by invasive O. septentrionalis has altered the acoustic community structure, identifying acoustic competition as a mechanism by which invasive species can impact communities. Furthermore, these results broaden the concept of noise pollution, demonstrating fitness-relevant consequences of noise produced by invasive species.

AB Ejaculate production can be costly and males are expected to prudently allocate this potentially limiting resource to higher quality females. However, relatively little is known about facultative sperm allocation in response to the quality distribution of sequentially encountered females, despite this being a more realistic scenario for males in many species. Here, we examined patterns of male investment in a squid, Sepiadarium austrinum, when presented sequentially with small versus large females. Owing to a positive size - fecundity relationship in this species, large and small females are expected to differ in terms of their perceived quality to males as potential mating partners. Yet, despite large sperm investment and significant variation in female quality, sperm investment was determined only by mating order, with males consistently decreasing sperm investment in second matings. These results highlight that, when mates are encountered sequentially rather than simultaneously, prudent sperm allocation may not occur when it is otherwise predicted.

AB Signals of social status can function to alert conspecifics of an individual's dominance, social rank and fighting ability. Such signals are beneficial in resource-limited systems because they can act to reduce conflict between competitors, especially when individuals are unfamiliar with each other. Here, we investigate the social communication function of a conspicuous plumage characteristic of a Neotropical migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler, Setophaga caerulescens, after breeding territory establishment when individuals are familiar with neighbours. To do this, we experimentally manipulated males' white wingspots, a putative signalling trait, and subsequently observed their behaviour. We found that males with experimentally eliminated wingspots had more frequent close-range interactions within and at their territory boundaries with conspecific males and had more agonistic interactions involving aggressive vocalizations compared to control males, although the effects differed according to age class. However, frequency of close-range interactions with female conspecifics was not influenced by wingspot manipulation. Finally, wingspot manipulation did not influence males' territorial song rates or responses to a simulated intruder, indicating no change in individual self-perception. Our study provides evidence that, even when individuals are familiar with each other and on established territories, social status signals continue to convey important information.

AB Why is there so much variation within species in the extent to which males contribute to offspring care? Answers to this question commonly focus on intraspecific sources of variation in the relative costs and benefits of supplying paternal investment. With experiments in the laboratory on the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides, and its phoretic mite Poecilochirus carabi, we investigated whether interactions with a second species might also account for intraspecific variation in the extent of paternal care, and whether this variation is due to adaptation or constraint. In our first experiment we bred beetles in the presence or absence of phoretic mites, using a breeding box that mimicked natural conditions by allowing parents to leave the breeding attempt at a time of their choosing. We found that males abandoned their brood sooner when breeding alongside mites than when breeding in their absence. Female patterns of care were unchanged by the mites. Nevertheless, in this experiment, no correlates of beetle fitness were affected by the presence of the mites during reproduction (neither paternal life span after reproduction nor brood size or average larval mass). In a second experiment, we again bred beetles with or without mites but this time we prevented parents from abandoning the brood. This time we found that both parents and the brood suffered fitness costs when breeding alongside mites, compared with families breeding in the absence of mites. We conclude that males adaptively reduce their contributions to care when mites are present, so as to defend their offspring's fitness and their own residual fitness. Interspecific interactions thus account for intraspecific variation in the duration of paternal care. (C) 2015 The Authors.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB A principal benefit of social living is the communal defence of resources. However, in the ant Ectatomma ruidum, specialized thieves often circumvent detection by conspecific non-nestmates, and those detected are peacefully expelled. Colonies can gather food through typical foraging (opportunistically tracking prey or nutrients in the home range) or by robbing (entering a conspecific nest, waiting for, and then removing a newly arrived food item carried in by a forager). Here, we conducted behavioural assays to determine whether robbers (or 'thieves'), carrying purloined food, manifest behaviours that minimize the probability of detection relative to nonthieving individuals. We found several lines of evidence that individuals carrying stolen food behave distinctly from normal nonthieving foragers. When returning to their home nest with a stolen food item, thieves had fewer encounters with conspecifics, were more likely to pause during movement, and were more likely to release food when grasped. Thieves walked faster while travelling in the victim's home range, compared to their own home range. When experimentally perturbed, thieves were more likely to reverse their direction of movement, while normal foragers continued moving in the same direction. Because the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition, as well as the C:N ratio, was the same for both thieves and nonthieves, we conclude that both groups were accessing the same food sources, using different behaviours to repartition a common resource. We conclude that, although thieves are morphologically indistinguishable from nonthieving foragers, their food retrieval behaviours are distinct in a manner that reduces the probability of detection and aggressive interactions with other conspecifics. We propose that thieves are a distinct caste of forager in E. ruidum. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To enter and integrate into host nests, ant social parasites employ a variety of behavioural and chemical strategies for bypassing host defences. Alternative chemical strategies are often considered separately, because only one is assumed to be effective in each particular species or in specific phases of the usurpation process. We studied the integration process of inquiline social parasite queens of Acromyrmex insinuator into nests of its host, the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior. When transplanted to a new host colony, parasite queens were initially attacked but later accepted by host workers, while non-nestmate host queens were always killed in this process. Parasite queens were more readily accepted by host colonies that already contained a parasite queen. The cuticular chemical profiles of parasite queens appeared to be specific to a host colony and parasite queens had higher amounts of cuticular n-alkanes than host queens, a substance class that is typically not relevant for nestmate recognition. We found evidence for two chemical strategies that are not mutually exclusive: (1) increased n-alkane levels suggest chemical insignificance, i.e. that parasites are able to enter host colonies because crucial recognition labels are absent, and (2) colony specificity of labels and attacks by non-nestmate host workers suggest that camouflage, a gradual acquisition of host colony-specific labels during integration, applies as well. We argue that combining insignificance and camouflage may be synergistically adaptive for intruding inquiline queens when this leads to a higher likelihood of achieving permanent acceptance.

AB Differences in food availability and predation risk can influence how herbivores use landscapes. As a result, trade-offs between costs and benefits can influence habitat and patch selection. To determine how oribi antelope, Ourebia ourebi, weigh up costs and benefits when making habitat and patch level foraging decisions, we measured giving-up densities in artificial patches. First, we determined large-scale habitat use, and then explored how different variables explained patch use within habitats. When the availability of food within patches across the different habitats was equal, oribi preferred to feed in short and tall grasslands and avoided woodlands. Furthermore, the avoidance of woodlands extended into the surrounding grasslands, resulting in oribi feeding less intensively in grassland areas within 15 m of the woodlands. Within the safe grassland habitats, oribi preferred to feed in patches close to tall grass (i.e. escape cover), and where they could see beyond 2 m. These results suggest that oribi select habitats and patches in relation to perceived predation risk (i.e. predation costs outweigh potential food intake benefits). However, when we increased food availability within woodlands, oribi increased their large-scale risk-taking behaviour and fed in these woodlands. Furthermore, this increased risk taking extended to small-scale foraging decisions whereby an increase in food availability within woodlands caused oribi to increase their relative usage of patches that had sight lines as well as patches that were closer to potential ambush sites. Ultimately, these results highlight how changes in food availability can determine the degree to which herbivores are willing to increase their risk-taking behaviour, and how these changes can affect overall landscape use.

AB Contests over resources are a key facet of social behaviour and have received extensive theoretical attention. However, the assumptions and predictions of the theoretical models have rarely been tested experimentally in wild free-living vertebrates. Here, we look at resource contests in wild Neolamprologus pulcher, a cooperatively breeding cichlid fish that lives in permanent territories in Lake Tanganyika, Africa. To elicit a contest, we removed a dominant breeding male from his territory and held him for either a short (4.5 h) or a long (20 h) period. The original resident male was then returned to his territory, which typically resulted in an aggressive contest with a usurping male that had taken over in the original resident's absence. We found that contests were shorter than those previously observed in a laboratory setting, with more physically aggressive attacks. Contrary to our predictions, the relative size difference between the males had no effect on contest dynamics or outcome, probably because all of the males involved in these contests were similar in body size. Instead, motivational factors influenced contest dynamics. Longer original resident removal times increased usurper male aggression, as well as the duration and intensity of the contests. Original residents were more aggressive when contesting over their sole territory (socially monogamous) than when contesting over one of their multiple territories (socially polygynous). Usurpers won more contests overall, and more aggressive fish were more likely to win contests. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine resource contests in wild free-swimming cichlids, and our results reveal that subjective resource value is a primary driver of the dynamics and outcome of territorial conflicts among dominant N. pulcher males. Our results further suggest that respect for ownership may reduce conflict in N. pulcher and be important in governing colony structure. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Jumping spiders (Salticidae) are well known for their unique, high-acuity visual system and complex, visually mediated behaviour. To overcome the limitations of video playback and other open loop systems that are currently available for the study of visually mediated behaviour in jumping spiders, we developed a closed-loop, virtual reality (VR) system in which a spider on a spherical treadmill walks through a projected 3D world that updates in real time in response to its movements. To investigate VR as an experimental technique for spiders as well as validate it as a proxy of the real world, we conducted two experiments to assess whether individual behavioural tendencies and learning transferred from real to virtual environments. In the first experiment, we examined transference of individual behaviour tendencies (spontaneous locomotion and dark/light preference) between real and VR environments, and found that individual differences were conserved. In the second experiment, we investigated transference of beacon-learning tasks between real and VR environments. We found that spiders that had learned a beacon-nest site association in the real world tended to expresses similar associations in the virtual world. Virtual reality offers great promise as a new tool to explore the cognitive processes underlying vision-mediated learning, memory and navigation in jumping spiders.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of risk-based variation in alarm calling in many vertebrate species. Most of the studies on birds, however, have focused on passerine systems perhaps due to the traditional view that passerine vocalizations are more complex. We investigated the presence of a risk-based alarm calling system in a nonpasserine, the herring gull, Larus argentatus, by recording birds presented with varying degrees of threat, and experimentally exposing and quantifying responses to manipulated alarm calls. We found that herring gulls communicate threat urgency in their alarm calls using both frequency and time parameters. Sound recordings indicated that herring gulls change centre frequency modulation patterns of their alarm calls, generate frequency discontinuities in notes and increase the rate of calling with increases in perceived threat level. Playback experiments showed that conspecifics pay attention to both frequency and time parameters and respond most urgently to playbacks of high-threat calls at a high call rate. A less urgent response to high-threat calls at a low call rate and to low-threat calls at a high call rate suggests that threat urgency information is reinforced by both call type and call rate in the herring gull system. This study is one of the first demonstrations of a risk-based alarm calling system in a nonpasserine. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Variation in song structure and song production of birds are thought to relate to variation of both androgen levels and neural nuclei in the song system, as typically these nuclei are larger in males than in females, vary in size among males and are sensitive to steroid hormones. We investigated the relationships among song and note structure, singing rate, androgen levels and the sizes of two song nuclei, the higher vocal centre (HVC) and the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) in male and female red-backed fairy-wrens, Malurus melanocephalus. Males of this duetting species express three discrete reproductive phenotypes that differ in plumage colour and behaviour. Although HVC and RA structure differed between the sexes, there were no sex differences in note structure and complexity of songs, although females differed from some male types in song rate and frequency characteristics. Both auxiliary males and females had significantly lower androgen levels than the two breeding male phenotypes. Male reproductive phenotypes had similar song characteristics and HVC and RA structure, but differed in androgen levels. Sexes and male phenotypes varied in song rate, but these differences did not correspond to differences in androgen levels. Thus, sex differences in song nuclei anatomy and androgen levels were not associated with differences in song structure and singing rate; and, the differences in androgen levels among male phenotypes were not reflected in differences in singing rate, song structure or the song nuclei. We conclude that, similar to other recent findings, the sexes of the red-backed fairy-wren can produce similar song and express similar singing behaviour despite differences in song system structure and circulating androgen levels; singing and song system anatomy appear not to be part of the suite of traits associated with differences in androgen levels in male red-backed fairy-wrens.

ID PARENTAL INVESTMENT; DIET; DIFFERENCE; QUALITY; GROWTH
AB Intrapopulation variability, especially individual foraging specialization, has been investigated in many species. Nevertheless, the repeatability of foraging behaviour remains poorly understood. In particular, whether individuals differ in their respective degrees of repeatability still remains to be determined. Here, we estimated foraging behaviour repeatability in the great cormorant, at both the population and the individual levels, and assessed the effect of repeatability on individual foraging performance. At the population level, we found that some foraging variables were more repeatable (e.g. departure angle and trip duration) than others (e.g. time spent underwater per trip). At the individual level, we found differences in the degree of repeatability for each foraging variable, highlighting the presence of both highly flexible and highly consistent individuals in the population. The effect of repeatability on individual performance depended on the considered timescale: individual-level repeatability of time spent underwater per dive was negatively related to foraging efficiency while individual-level repeatability of time spent underwater per trip was positively related to foraging efficiency. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of studying repeatability at the individual level and shows how both flexibility and consistency in animal behaviour shape their ability to extract energy from the environment.

AB Songs mediate mate attraction and territorial defence in songbirds during the breeding season. Outside of the breeding season, the avian vocal repertoire often includes calls that function in foraging, anti-predator and social behaviours. Songs and calls can differ substantially in their spectral and temporal content. Given seasonal variation in the vocal signals, the sender-receiver matching hypothesis predicts seasonal changes in auditory processing that match the physical properties of songs during the breeding season and calls outside of it. We tested this hypothesis in white-breasted nuthatches, Sitta carolinensis, tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor, and Carolina chickadees, Poecile carolinensis. We measured the envelope-following response (EFR), which quantifies phase locking to the amplitude envelope, and the frequency-following response (FFR), which quantifies phase locking to the temporal fine structure of sounds. Because songs and calls of nuthatches are amplitude modulated at different rates, we predicted seasonal changes in EFRs that match the rates of amplitude fluctuation in songs and calls. In chickadees and titmice, we predicted stronger FFRs during the spring and stronger EFRs during the winter because songs are tonal and calls include amplitude-modulated elements. In all three species, we found seasonal changes in EFRs and FFRs. EFRs varied across seasons and matched the amplitude modulations of songs and calls in nuthatches. In addition, female chickadees had stronger EFRs in the winter than in the spring. In all three species, FFRs during the spring tended to be stronger in females than in males. We also found species differences in EFRs and FFRs in both seasons; EFRs and FFRs tended to be higher in nuthatches than in chickadees and titmice. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying seasonality in EFRs and FFRs and the implications of our results for communication during the breeding season and outside of it, when these three species form mixed-species flocks.

AB Social factors hypotheses predict that social segregation between male and female adult ungulates is due to social preferences among same-sex peers and avoidance of the opposite sex, rather than aggregation due to body size dimorphism and differential needs of the sexes. It is suggested that if such social preference/avoidance exists its roots should be early in life. While juvenile ungulate males show social preference for same-sex and same-age peers a few weeks after birth, no studies have confirmed such a phenomenon in juvenile females. In this study we investigated another possible mechanism that would result in an early social preference for same-sex conspecifics among juvenile females: we hypothesized that offspring-mother attachment is stronger for daughters than for sons. Attachment was measured in lambs, Ovis aries, using three characteristics defined initially in children: proximity seeking, distress following separation and exploration in the mother's presence. Lambs were tested at 3 weeks of age in two experimental situations in which they could interact with the mother, a familiar ewe or an unfamiliar ewe. (1) During a choice test between the mother and the familiar ewe, daughters maintained closer proximity with the mother than sons did. During the test without the mother (a familiar versus an unfamiliar ewe) daughters were more distressed than sons were. (2) In an isolation-reunion-separation test, reunion with the mother increased exploratory behaviour more in daughters than in sons. Overall, our results reveal that daughters displayed stronger attachment behaviours and could be more strongly attached to their mother than sons are. Such early preference may be a key factor leading to social preference among females and social segregation between the sexes. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In insects various ways to produce sounds have evolved for communication both within and between species. Cicada males are particularly known for their loud and diverse songs which are produced by tymbal organs. Females of some cicada species can produce sounds by wing flicking in response to male calls. The cicada species Subpsaltria yangi is unusual in that, besides the tymbal organs of males, it has well-developed stridulatory organs that are found in both sexes. Here, we investigated sound production and mating behaviour of this cicada species. We show that, in the context of pair formation, females produced sound signals by stridulation in response to advertisement signals produced by males with tymbal organs. We also found that the sounds produced by male cicadas with stridulatory organs were extremely similar in acoustic structure to those of females, which indicates that males mimic the signals produced by females during pair formation. Acoustic playback experiments suggested that, by producing female-like sound signals, a male could deceive a receptive female into treating him as a rival female, which makes the male more effective in eliciting acoustic responses from the receptive female. Therefore, the males could gain reproductive benefit by mimicking female sound signals, since they rely primarily on females' acoustic responses to find females.

AB The balance between food and perceived predation risk has been revealed as one of the primary drivers of animal habitat selection. However, few studies have investigated how spatiotemporal scales and movement/activity patterns shape responses to this food/cover trade-off while accounting for individual characteristics (e.g. sex) and for variation in predation risk (e.g. hunting) and in resource abundance/quality. We hence studied temporal changes in habitat selection of 30 GPS-collared females and 15 males of Mediterranean mouflon, Ovis gmelini musimon x Ovis sp., at two scales, i.e. 48 h home range selection within a subpopulation area (broad scale) and choice of movement steps (defined as the linear segment between two consecutive locations) according to activity state (fine scale), in southern France. During the hunting-free/food-abundant period, males selected at both scales the foraging habitats providing the best conditions for optimizing their future reproductive success and only selected areas perceived as safe during inactive steps. During the corresponding lambing period, and at both scales, females selected areas perceived as safe that should optimize lamb survival. They switched to the best foraging habitats only when lambs were weaned and only for active steps. By contrast, during hunting, when food was also scarce, both sexes selected home ranges with high proportions of the habitats perceived as safe, in which they performed all their activities. This result suggested that risk avoidance exceeded all the other individual and environmental factors in the hierarchy of the determinants of habitat selection during the hunting period. Coupling scale-specific habitat selection and activity patterns was hence decisive in disclosing how individuals fulfil their specific needs under seasonally changing levels of habitat attributes important for fitness.

AB Extended phenotypes as signals are widely distributed among animal taxa. For example, many bird species build eye-catching nests or structures, which can potentially mirror the quality or ability of the builder. Rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, nests are usually overly decorated with feathers belonging to different species. Feather carrying in this and other species seems to play a role beyond their supposed thermoregulatory function, that is, to provide insulation to eggs and developing chicks. In this study, we documented for the first time this intriguing pattern of behaviour in the rock sparrow and experimentally tested its potential role as a sexually selected or status signal by means of a feather supplementation experiment carried out in two distinct populations from Italy and Spain. We found that females were responsible for feather carrying, laid larger clutches and provisioned their young at a lower rate in those nests with experimentally added feathers. Decorated nests sustained fewer intrusions by floater individuals and were defended with greater intensity by both parents than control nests, which supports the role of nest ornamentation as a status signal to conspecifics. Presence of experimental feathers did not significantly increase the frequency with which males provisioned their young but males tended to desert their brood less often and spent more time guarding the brood in experimental nests, indicating that feather presence may also play a role in an intersexual context. Overall, our results allow us to exclude the thermoregulation hypothesis as a likely explanation for the occurrence of these decorations and provide partial evidence for the idea that feather carrying conveys information to the partner and potential competitors. Our study thus supports the notion that nonbodily traits serving a direct (naturally selected) function can also evolve a signalling component.

AB Biological market theory models the action of natural selection as a marketplace in which animals are viewed as traders with commodities to offer and exchange. Studies of female Old World monkeys have suggested that grooming might be employed as a commodity to be reciprocated or traded for alternative services, yet previous tests of this grooming-trade model in wild adult male chimpanzees have yielded mixed results. Here we provide the strongest test of the model to date for male chimpanzees: we use data drawn from two social groups (communities) of chimpanzees from different populations and give explicit consideration to variation in dominance hierarchy steepness, as such variation results in differing conditions for biological markets. First, analysis of data from published accounts of other chimpanzee communities, together with our own data, showed that hierarchy steepness varied considerably within and across communities and that the number of adult males in a community aged 20-30 years predicted hierarchy steepness. The two communities in which we tested predictions of the grooming-trade model lay at opposite extremes of this distribution. Second, in accord with the grooming-trade model, we found evidence that male chimpanzees trade grooming for agonistic support where hierarchies are steep (despotic) and consequent effective support is a rank-related commodity, but not where hierarchies are shallow (egalitarian). However, we also found that grooming was reciprocated regardless of hierarchy steepness. Our findings also hint at the possibility of agonistic competition, or at least exclusion, in relation to grooming opportunities compromising the free market envisioned by biological market theory. Our results build on previous findings across chimpanzee communities to emphasize the importance of reciprocal grooming exchanges among adult male chimpanzees, which can be understood in a biological markets framework if grooming by or with particular individuals is a valuable commodity.

AB Lateralized brain function, or partitioning of tasks to separate hemispheres of the brain, directly impacts behaviour and fitness. Highly lateralized individuals tend to outperform nonlateralized individuals in many survival-related behaviours, such as the ability to learn, escape predators and multitask. Despite these benefits to lateralization, there is a great deal of observed variation in this trait within and between populations that is likely determined by the balance between costs and benefits of laterality in a given environment. Laterality appears to be heritable, but it can also vary with the environment experienced during development. We investigated the role of evolutionary history and developmental plasticity in determining the degree of laterality in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a freshwater fish that experiences variable predation pressure in its native range. We compared pairs of closely related populations that experience either high or low levels of predation in the wild, and manipulated the perceived predation risk in the rearing environment using a common garden split-brood design. We assayed laterality in mature male guppies using a detour test. Fish reared with exposure to chemical predator cues were more lateralized than their brothers reared without predator cues. This plastic response is in the direction we would predict if lateralization is favoured in environments with high predation risk. However, unlike findings in related species, we did not detect repeatable differences in degree of laterality associated with historical predation regime, suggesting that predation risk experienced over evolutionary history does not shape laterality patterns in guppies. Thus, although it is currently underemphasized in the literature, plasticity is likely an important contributor to variation in laterality. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Our understanding of chemical signals in mammals derives principally from studies in which researchers examine signal structure or function within a single species. Despite the unique information to be gained from applying comparable methods across multiple species, comparative studies of chemical signals are extremely limited. Here, we review the available literature on the evolution of chemosignals in male and female strepsirrhine primates (galagos, lorises and lemurs), all of which rely heavily on chemical communication. We draw from a few case studies, but focus our review on two comparative studies. In one, researchers examined the volatile chemical composition of urinary signals across 12 species representing most families within Strepsirrhini, including six 'urine-marking' species and six glandular or 'nonurine-marking' species. In the other, researchers examined the volatile chemical composition of glandular signals in eight Eulemur species differing in social or dominance structure. We highlight five findings. (1) Regardless of the scent source, chemical profiles differ substantially between species, providing reliable species 'scent signatures'. None the less, (2) urine markers express more compounds and have more distinguishable species scent signatures in their urine than do nonurine markers, suggesting specialization of function. Within Eulemur (3) chemical richness is greater in multimale-multifemale species than in pair-bonded species. Moreover, (4) whereas chemical richness of male signals is greater in sexually codominant species, chemical richness of female signals is greater in female-dominant species. Together, the findings from both comparative studies, coupled with case studies, suggest that signal richness is linked to some aspect of the focal species' socioecology. Lastly, (5) regardless of the scent source, strepsirrhine chemosignals evolve gradually over time, but at fast rates and homogeneously within different lineages. Comparative studies reveal patterns that cannot be detected from the single-species approach and are therefore critical for providing new insight into the function and evolution of olfactory signals.

AB In a wide range of organisms, including humans, mothers can influence offspring via the care they provide. Comparatively little is known about the effects of fathering on offspring. Here, we test the hypothesis that fathers are capable of programming their offspring for the type of environment they are likely to encounter. Male threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, were either exposed to predation risk while fathering or not. Fathers altered their paternal behaviour when exposed to predation risk, and consequently produced adult offspring with phenotypes associated with strong predation pressure (smaller size, reduced body condition, reduced behavioural activity). Moreover, more attentive fathers produced offspring that showed stronger antipredator responses. These results are consistent with behaviourally mediated paternal programming: fathers can alter offspring phenotypes to match their future environment and influence offspring traits well into adulthood.

AB Behavioural responses of prey to predation risk are often mediated by vegetation structure. Erect woody shrubs are increasing in many arctic and alpine environments, and this change in habitat structure has the potential to alter perception of risk and fear for foraging herbivores. To assess the role of shrub cover in determining behavioural responses to foraging under predation risk, we used measurements of giving-up density (GUD) and video recordings of vigilance behaviour of individual Arctic ground squirrels, Urocitellus parryii, across an alpine tundra to shrub ecotone. Dense shrub habitat was associated with higher GUDs, implying that foraging costs were higher in dense shrub than in less shrub-dominated habitats. Foraging strategies differed between habitats, with a negative relationship between visibility and GUD in high-visibility, open-tundra habitats and a positive relationship between visibility and GUD in low-visibility, shrub-dominated habitats, which may be indicative of alternative foraging strategies in different habitats. Squirrels initially made a high investment in vigilance, which was independent of patch residence time. This presumably increases the costs of quitting patches earlier. In shrub-dominated habitat, erect bipedal forms of vigilance were also observed more frequently. Our results indicate that shrub encroachment into northern and alpine tundra may impose costs on foraging arctic ground squirrels and alter foraging strategies.

AB Kin selection stands among W. D. Hamilton's most influential ideas. The purpose of this review is to assess the impact of Hamilton's ideas about kin selection on studies of social recognition. Kin selection theory predicts that animals should direct aid-giving behaviour to closely related animals, provided that a positive net benefit in inclusive fitness is achieved from the altruistic act. Kin recognition is the key proximate mechanism by which animals can sort more related from less related interactants in a population. Kin recognition also has the potential to allow fine distinctions among animals based on identity by descent. Following the publications of Hamilton's 1964 papers on kin selection, studies of kin recognition focused on four disparate behavioural contexts: identification of group membership, inbreeding avoidance, alarm calls and other forms of aid-giving, and parente-offspring interactions. Investigations of eusocial insects have focused on identification of group membership by phenotypes that are shared among all members of a colony. In birds and mammals, social structure is often based on individual recognition. Some species, particularly rodents, have the ability to make discriminations based on relatedness among animals that they have not previously met. Future studies of kin recognition should be less reliant on assumptions that all forms of societal closure are due to factors related to kin selection. These studies should acknowledge that the role of individual recognition in vertebrate societies is key to understanding the full texture of social interactions, and that individual recognition may be equally important in many other types of animals. Of particular interest will be the discovery of how information about kinship is integrated with information about individual identity. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Organisms evolve to control, preserve, protect and invest in their own bodies. When they do likewise with external resources they privatize those resources and convert them into their own property. Property is a neglected topic in biology, although examples include territories, domiciles and nest structures, food caching, mate guarding, and the resources and partners in mutualisms. Property is important because it represents a solution to the tragedy of the commons; to the extent that an individual exerts long-term control of its property, it can use it prudently, and even invest in it. Resources most worth privatizing are often high in value. To be useful to their owner in the future, they are typically durable and defensible. This may explain why property is relatively rare in animals compared to humans. The lack of institutional property rights in animals also contributes to their rarity, although owner-in-truder conventions may represent a simple form of property rights. Resources are often privatized by force or threat of force, but privatization can also be achieved by hiding, by constructing barriers, and by carrying or incorporating the property. Social organisms often have property for two reasons. First, the returns on savings and investments can accrue to relatives, including descendants. Second, social groups can divide tasks among members, so they can simultaneously guard property and forage, for example. Privatization enhances the likelihood that the benefits of cooperation will go to relatives, thus facilitating the evolution of cooperation as in Hamilton's rule or kin selection. Mutualisms often involve exchange of property and privatization of relationships. Privatization ensures the stability of such cooperation. The major transitions in evolution, both fraternal and egalitarian, generally involve the formation of private clubs with something analogous to the nonrivalrous club goods of economics.

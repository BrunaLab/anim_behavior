TI Does leg-ring colour affect song tutor choice in zebra finches?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA; PREFERENCES
AB Young male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, reared by their mothers alone showed no preference between males with red and with light-green colour rings in their choice of song tutor. Behavioural observations showed that the tutee associated more with the adult from which it was subsequently found to have learnt. In a second experiment, birds reared by both parents wearing either light-blue or light-green colour rngs and then given a choice of tutors wearing these ring combinations also showed no preferences between them. These young males did, however, more often approach the tutor ringed as their parents had been. This may explain why they did not show more interest in the tutor whose song they learnt. The majority of the tutors were used twice, with the ring colour swapped before they were used the second time. There was a strong tendency for the same male to be copied by the two young birds exposed to him. This could not be attributed to a difference in song rate between the two tutors. Further work will be required to discover the basis of that individual's greater attractiveness. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I examined interspecific patterns of female choice for three species of mollies: the 'sailfin' species, P. latipinna and two 'shortfin' species, P. orri and P. mexicana. Females of the sailfin species consistently preferred conspecific males across all male treatment combinations containing conspecifics. Females of the two shortfin species had lower levels of female preference and spent less time interacting with males during trials. The only consistent pattern of female choice in either shortfin species was a preference for the sailfin P. latipinna males over heterospecific shortfin males, but not over conspecifics. This finding suggests a potential bias by shortfin females for the sailfin male phenotype. Males of the three species differed in both behaviour and morphology. Length and relative position of the dorsal fin reliably separated P. latipinna from the two shortfin species. Body depth and shape distinguished males of the two shortfin species. Dorsal fin height was not a reliable cue for distinguishing sailfin males from males of either shortfin species. Males from different populations of the sailfin species P. latipinna differ in both size-specific behavioural rates and size-specific morphometry, particularly in the overall size-adjusted area of the dorsal fin. Increased rates of courtship displays and increased area of the dorsal fin separate males of P. latipinna from males of the two shortfin species as well. If the same traits used by females of P. latipinna for intraspecific discrimination are also important species-recognition signals, this suggests a potential role for sexual selection in contributing to the divergence of male phenotype during speciation of sailfin mollies.

AB We assessed courtship success in 14 adult male brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. Volumes of song control nuclei and visual nuclei were measured in Nissl stained tissue. Variation in courtship success was found to be related to variation in two areas of the avian brain: the song control nucleus, area X, and the thalamic visual area, nucleus rotundus. Volume of area X was negatively correlated with song potency, as assessed by female playback, and with rate of vocalizing. Volume of nucleus rotundus was positively correlated with song potency, vocalizing to females and courtship persistence. These data are the first to implicate a visual nucleus in the use of song. The data also complement previous findings with cowbirds suggesting that song learning involves visual attention to females. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that use of song depends on integration of auditory, vocal and visual information. In that female songbirds in many species assess multimodal performance of song, these findings with cowbirds suggest that future studies of brain and behaviour include a broader view of possible behavioural and neural correlates.

TI A reassessment of the effect of body mass upon flight speed and
   predation risk in birds
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE; FAT; AVOIDANCE; STORAGE; HAWKS
AB A number of theoretical studies have predicted that avian predation risk is mass dependent. Models of bird flight predict that increased mass will reduce flight velocity, making birds more vulnerable to predation. Empirical studies supporting this have demonstrated a significant relationship between mass and routine flight velocity (when birds are not alarmed). Studies investigating the effects of mass upon flight velocity when birds are alarmed, however, tend to show that the mass/velocity relationship is less marked. We found a real difference in the relationship between mass and flight velocity in zebra finches, Taeniopyga guttata, when comparing flights of alarmed and unalarmed birds. Despite the strong mass/routine velocity relationship already shown for zebra finches, mass tended to be a poor predictor of the flight velocity of alarmed birds within the natural weight range of the species. This difference appeared to be partly due to alarmed birds increasing their velocity more when heavy than when light, in comparison to their respective predicted routine flight velocities for their weights. As a result, mass/velocity regression slopes tended to be more shallow for alarmed birds. Consequently, increases in body mass within the natural weight range of a bird, may have less effect on the flight velocities of alarmed birds than they do on routine flight velocities. We therefore recommend caution in the use of weight as a predictor of predation risk in birds without examining its effects upon the flight velocity of alarmed birds. We suggest some explanations for the differences in the mass/velocity relationship between the flights of alarmed and unalarmed birds. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB All animals that are exposed to predators must distinguish dangerous from nondangerous threats and respond correctly. In reptiles, emerging hatchlings are vulnerable to a wide range of predators, particularly if they emerge during daylight. In these experiments I tested the response of pine snake, Pituophis melanoleucus, hatchlings incubated at 22-23, 27-28, or 32-33 degrees C to visual and vibratory stimuli to examine antipredator behaviour. Emerging hatchlings were exposed to one of five conditions: (1) hawk model, (2) white head model. with no facial features, (3)white head model with black eyes, (4) a person, or (5) a vibration without a visual stimulus. I tested the null hypotheses of no differences in response as a function of predator type or incubation temperature. Emergence behaviour when undisturbed was affected by incubating temperature, and antipredatory behaviour was affected by both predator type and incubation temperature. Pine snake hatchlings responded more protectively (withdrawal into tunnels) than defensively (striking), responded with less intensity to a vibration compared with visual predator stimuli, and required longer to respond to a head model without eyes than to all other predator types. Given the relatively small size of hatchlings, it is adaptive for them to withdraw into the nest rather than attack a predator. Hatchlings from eggs that were incubated at medium temperatures required less time to emerge from their underground nests when undisturbed, and had stronger protective responses than snakes incubated at other temperatures. These results suggest that hatchlings incubated at medium temperatures are generally less vulnerable to predators than hatchlings incubated at higher or lower temperatures.

TI Discrete conventional signalling of a continuous variable
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID COMMUNICATION; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; DISPLAYS
AB In aggressive interactions, animals often use a discrete set of signals, while the properties being signalled are likely to be continuous, for example fighting ability or value of victory. Here we investigate a particular model of fighting that allows for conventional signalling of subjective resource value to occur. Perfect signalling and no signalling are not evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) in the model. Instead, we find ESSs in which partial information is communicated, with discrete displays signalling a range of values rather than a precise one. The result also indicates that communication should be more precise in conflicts over small resources. Signalling strategies can exist in fighting because of the common interest in avoiding injuries, but communication is likely to be limited because of the fundamental conflict over the resource. Our results reflect a compromise between these two factors. Data allowing for a thorough test of the model are lacking; however, existing data seem consistent with the obtained theoretical results.

AB Behavioural studies of diving birds have reported that the ratio of dive duration to the duration of the subsequent period on the surface displays a characteristic relation to dive duration. For short dives, the dive to surface ratio increases with dive duration, whereafter the relation peaks, and for longer dives decreases with increasing dive duration. Such a relationship is not a general prediction of existing marginal value models which have been used to predict optimal diving behaviour. This may be because the smooth curve used to describe the oxygen gain rate of individuals after surfacing is not a good reflection of the respiratory physiology of birds. Here we argue that on physiological grounds, the oxygen gain curve for avian divers will not be smooth, but will have two distinct regions (representing oxygen recovery in the respiratory tract, and in haemoglobin and myoglobin, respectively). Modifying two of the classical diving models by incorporating such a kinked curve causes them to predict the humped relationship between dive to surface ratio and dive duration under many circumstances. We also present data on the duration of dives and surface periods from three species of diving seabirds: the shag, Phalacrocorax aristotelis, the black guillemot, Cepphus grylle and the common guillemot, Uria aalge. All three species showed a humped relationship for dive to surface ratio as a function of dive duration. In line with the predictions of our model, when oxygen stores on surfacing were greatly depleted, the dive to surface ratio peaked at short dive durations.

ID PREDATION; BENEFITS
AB Laboratory experiments with a rock-dwelling nocturnal gecko, Oedura lesuerii, showed that retreat-site selection (and other behaviours) are affected by the interplay between thermal benefits, social advantages and avoidance of predators. Velvet geckos were highly selective in habitat choice: they preferred artificial retreat-sites that mimic the thermal properties of natural rocks in full sun rather than those that mimic rocks in full shade. mature male geckos rarely shared retreat-sites with other adult males: and these lizards strongly avoided retreat-sites covered with the scent of a natural predator (the broadheaded snake, Hoplocephalus bungaroides), After documenting these preferences? we carried out additional trials in which two or more of these factors co-occurred, as is often the case in nature. Social dominance interacted with thermal benefits in determining retreat-site selection, with smaller (subordinate) males forced to use cooler retreat-sites when larger (dominant) males were present. Avoidance of predators was a higher priority than thermoregulation: the lizards would forego a warmer retreat-site with predator scent in favour of a cooler, unscented one. There was also an interplay between social dominance and predator scent: smaller males were forced to use either predator-scented retreat-sites or no retreat-site when larger males were present. General activity levels, and the frequencies of specific behavioural acts, also shifted in response to social and predator-scent cues. Our study emphasizes the complexity of habitat-selection behaviour in these lizards, and clarifies the criteria used in retreat-site selection when (as is commonly the case) the animal must choose between conflicting priorities.

AB We monitored 74 (41 male, 33 female) radiocollared raccoons (Procyon lotor) from February 1990 to July 1992 on the Welder Wildlife Refuge, Texas, to relate male and female space use to each other and to the spatial distribution of water, a critical resource for raccoons. Female home ranges were spatially aggregated early in the study, when standing water occurred in only a few, widely separated patches on the study site, but were randomly distributed during seasons when water was more widely distributed. Adult females generally foraged and rested independently of other adults. Most adult males were arranged in spatial groups whose home ranges overlapped little with those of adjacent groups. These groups were usually composed of three to four individuals; Doncaster's (1990, J. theor. Biol., 143, 431-443) test for dynamic interaction and visual observations showed that group members tended to associate positively during resting and foraging activities in all seasons. Among raccoons, as among many other mammals, female spatial patterns are apparently determined primarily by resource distribution, whereas male patterns are influenced by the distribution of females.

AB We examined mate switching between mated pairs of monogamous convict cichlids as a function of mate quality (size). A mated pair was established in each half of a 284-litre aquarium, an opaque partition separating the two pairs. When the partition was removed, mis-assorted pairs (large males with small females competing with small males with large females) re-sorted themselves such that the larger male and the larger female paired with each other 46% of the time. In contrast, when we exposed initially assorted pairs to each other, large pairs remained intact most of the time and dominated smaller pairs. The pair containing the large male, whether re-sorted or intact, dominated over the other pair and was the only one seen to spawn. Re-sortment resulted both from a preference of males for larger females and of females for larger males, and from the ability of larger individuals to displace their smaller consexual. Small females, however, when paired with a large male? often dominated large females and prevented the large female from mating with the large male. Re-sortment was also influenced by the compatibility of large individuals in their initial pairing situation. Large individuals that had been more compatible with their initial mates were less likely to switch mates. Our results support both the better-option and the incompatibility hypotheses of mate-switching. The availability of more than one breeding site in the aquarium had no effect on the frequency of resortment. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID FEMALE MATE CHOICE; SELECTION; PYRALIDAE; SIGNALS; ANURAN
AB Pair formation in the lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is initiated by male ultrasonic signals that attract receptive females. Individual males vary ill attractiveness to females, and the most attractive males are distinguished by exaggeration of three signal characters: pulse rate, peak amplitude and asynchrony interval (temporal separation between pulses generated by movements of the left and right wings during a given wing upstroke or downstroke). Using flow-through respirometry, we measured the resting and signalling metabolic rates of males whose relative attractiveness was known. Acoustic recordings and metabolic measurements were made simultaneously, and we calculated net metabolic rates and factorial metabolic scopes as measures for the energetic cost of signalling. On average, attractive males had higher net metabolic rates and factorial metabolic scopes than unattractive ones, but many unattractive males also had high values. Thus, high expenditure of energy on signalling is necessary but not sufficient for attractiveness. This may result because only one of the three signal characters critical for female preference, pulse I-ale, is correlated with energy expenditure. Although the results are consistent with the good genes model of sexual selection, they do not conflict with other indirect or direct mechanisms of female choice.

ID POECILIA-RETICULATA; FEMALES COPY; OTHERS
AB We performed four experiments to examine effects on the mate choices of female Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica, of observing a male mate with another female. Each experiment was conducted in three phases: (1) a pre-test during which subject females were allowed to choose between two males with which to affiliate; (2) an observation phase, in which subject females either watched or did not watch the male they had spent less time near during the pre-test (their 'non-preferred' male) copulate with a 'model' female; and (3) a post-test when subject females again chose between non-preferred and preferred males. Only females that had watched their non-preferred male mate with a model female during the observation phase spent significantly more time affiliating with him during the post-test than they had during the pre-test. Watching mating did not change females' criteria for choosing males, and non-preferred males that had mated recently were no more attractive to females than were non-preferred males that had not done so, unless subject females actually observed the mating take place. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that female quail copy one another's mate choices. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Investigations of the effects of testosterone on male mating effort have focused on behaviours associated with intra-sexual interactions. We tested whether testosterone may also affect male reproductive behaviour by mediating the intensity and frequency of male courtship. In two simultaneous choice experiments, we assessed the relative attractiveness of testosterone-implanted males, whose testosterone levels were manipulated to match naturally occurring spring peaks, and empty-implanted control males, whose testosterone levels were lower and resembled those of males caring for young. In both experiments, testosterone-males outperformed control-males, giving both more frequent and more exaggerated displays. Females showed a significant preference for the peak-testosterone males as measured by both female attendance and female courtship displays. We concluded that variation in testosterone can affect male attractiveness to females and thus male copulatory success. Thus, testosterone has the potential to mediate all aspects of male reproductive behaviour and may provide a mechanism through which males adjust their full range of breeding behaviours (i.e. inter-sexual as well as intra-sexual and parental behaviour) to fit their current status. In a second experiment, we tested the effect of oestradiol treatment on female mating preferences. No evidence was found that oestradiol changed the preferences of females.

AB The evolution of conspicuous coloration is often hypothesized to be driven by sexual selection, where colour traits may function as honest signals of individual abilities in male contest competition and female choice. However, game theory models suggest that colourful badges (i.e. energetically cheap signals) may have no function in sexually selected contests, because the value of the contested resource is too high relative to the costs of fighting. We investigated this assertion by experimentally staging male contests over nest sites (a crucial resource for attracting females) in old (greater than or equal to 2 years) male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis. Males with a relatively large white forehead patch (i.e. a condition-dependent plumage trait displayed in male contests) enjoyed a competitive advantage in disputes over experimentally vacated territories. No other measured morphological variable predicted the outcome of such a dispute. Furthermore, the winners of the disputes acquired a female more quickly than did the losers. Thus, our results suggest that the white forehead patch of male collared flycatchers may function as a badge of status that is also used in sexually selected contests over resources. We suggest that this is because the value of the contested territory may be relatively low compared with the cost of fighting when alternative vacant sites exist in the neighbourhood.

AB While much is known about the hormonal basis of pre-laying behaviour of domestic hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, little is known about how the behaviour is initiated or how changes in this behaviour occur. An experiment was conducted in which hens had to overcome an aversive task, during the course of pre-laying behaviour, in order to reach a nest site. Twelve hens were tested in four treatments presented as a Latin square design. The test arena was arranged such that hens could approach the nestbox only along one corridor, and return to the home pen by another. The four treatments consisted of leaving the corridor leading to the nestbox empty, or placing a hen that was dominant, subordinate or unfamiliar to the test-bird in it. Hens took longer to enter the corridor leading to the nestbox when there was a dominant or unfamiliar stimulus-bird than with a subordinate or an empty corridor. They also made more attempts to find alternative routes to the nestbox during the searching phase of pre-laying behaviour when there was a dominant or unfamiliar stimulus-bird, than with a subordinate stimulus-bird or empty pen and made fewer entries into the corridor with an unfamiliar stimulus-bird, but not a dominant or subordinate stimulus-bird or an empty pen. We suggest that hens are weakly motivated to reach the nest site during the searching phase. However, the motivation to gain access to a nest site increases near the start of the sitting phase of pre-laying behaviour. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   PARASITES; HANDICAP; CHOICE
AB Recent studies of lekking animals suggest that a suite of characters may be favoured by sexual selection. Examples of such traits are high survival, increased androgen levels, territory features and morphological characters including exaggerated morphological ornaments. Here we argue that such selection is often mediated by behavioural differences and we use results from a field study of lekking black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, as an example of our argument. In the absence of females, males display a range of stereotyped behaviours including vocalizations, visual displays and fighting. When females attend the lek, the behavioural repertoire of the males becomes more limited. Time budget analyses reveal that in the vast majority of cases, males in the presence of females perform only three types of behaviour: a vocal display called rookooing; a courtship behaviour called circling; and fighting. This suggests that female preference could be based on male courtship and fighting behaviour while females visit individual male territories and that displays not used in the presence of females could be ruled out as important for female preference. Sexual selection in black grouse, however, is a complex interplay between male-male competition and female choice and therefore female preference is not the only determinant of male success. Successful males were more often involved in fights in the absence of females on the lek and defended territories that were larger than expected. Therefore, we hypothesize that differences in male fighting ability result in some males occupying relatively large territories at the centre of the leks. Relatively large territories seem to be needed for successful courtship. Therefore behavioural differences mediate differences in male copulation success both through female preference and male-male competition. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The degree to which females are consistent in their mate preferences has implications for studies of sexual selection. Because choice of females for particular males may be affected by temporal changes in male characteristics, consistency of mate preferences of individual females of Poecilia rericulata was studied by presenting them with the same male pairs in consecutive trials under three experimental procedures: live males behind clear glass, live males behind one-way glass and images of males on videotape. Although females did not habituate to males in any of the experiments, they spent significantly more time in proximity to males behind clear glass than in the video and one-way glass presentations. Females preferred the bright male over the pale one in the video and the clear glass presentations, but not in the one-way glass experiment. Repeatability of preferences by individual females for a male was high in the video and one-way glass presentations but low in the clear-glass experiment. Behavioural interactions with the male in the clear-glass experiment affected both the time that females spent viewing males as well as female visual preferences. Results indicate that the video playback is not only useful for detecting differences between female preferences for morphological traits of male guppies, but is also much more effective in detecting preferences than the other two techniques, because it eliminates temporal variation in male behaviour.

AB Allogrooming behaviour was analysed in a wild group of tufted capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella, in Iguazu National Park, Argentina. Evidence is provided that allogrooming in this platyrrhine species serves an important social function, as has been demonstrated for catarrhine primates. Using ad libitum sampling, 654 grooming sessions were recorded during 740 contact hours with one group. Seasonal variation was found in daily time allocation to allogrooming and the mean duration and reciprocity of sessions. Individual dominance rank was an important determinant of grooming relationships. The dominant male and female were the most actively involved in grooming. Among adults, dominant individuals were involved in more sessions than were subordinate individuals. The females maintained strong grooming relationships with each other and tended to reciprocate more within sessions than did males. Oestrous females engaged in more grooming bouts with adult males than did non-oestrous females. Females with newborn infants were attractive social partners for the remaining members of the group. A social function for allogrooming in Cebus is indicated by the close relationship between allogrooming, the social system and coalition formation, and by the changes in quantity and direction of grooming in response to oestrous behaviour and to the birth of infants.

AB Four experiments were conducted to determine how experience around the time of natal emergence affected the development of litter-mate preferences in juvenile Belding's ground squirrels, Spermophilus beldingi. Social preferences were ascertained by observing six captive groups, each housed in outdoor enclosures beginning at natal emergence, and recording the frequency of dyadic play. Juveniles preferred their litter-mates as play partners on day 1 above-ground, demonstrating that pre-emergent interactions influenced social development. Whether cross-fostered young displayed play-partner preferences based on relatedness and rearing history depended on when young were exchanged with respect to natal emergence, which suggests that social development is especially sensitive to experience shortly before natal emergence. Juveniles do not display litter-mate preferences if they emerge into an environment from which dams have been removed, but in the present study, if juveniles interacted for 1 week before dams were withdrawn from enclosures, then litter-mate preferences were manifested both before and after dams were withdrawn. These results suggest that a foundation for litter-mate preferences is laid before natal emergence, and that preferences are solidified by interactions between litter-mates on their first few days above-ground. Finally, non-litter-mates that interacted with each other shortly after natal emergence were preferred social partners during later encounters compared with non-litter-mates denied the opportunity to interact shortly after emergence. Collectively, the four experiments demonstrate that social experience around the time of natal emergence is crucial to the developmental process that generates litter-mate preferences in S. beldingi.

AB To understand how individual differences in fertilization success arises in the fly Dryomyza anilis, variation in sperm precedence between and within males was studied. In D. anilis, a mating consists of a copulation followed by tapping sequences during which the male taps the external genitalia of the female. These tapping sequences increase last male sperm precedence. Each male in the experiment was repeatedly mated with a set of females. In the first treatment, mating was interrupted after the male had an intromission. In the second treatment, the male was allowed to perform five tapping sequences after an intromission. In the third treatment, the male was allowed to perform an unlimited number of tapping sequences after an intromission until interrupted by female resistance. There were large differences between males in all three treatments as shown by the 95% confidence limits of the mean fertilization success. Repeatabilities of mating time and the number of tapping movements per tapping sequence were high indicating clear differences between males in these components of mating behaviour. Within individual males, the more tappings per sequence, the higher the fertilization success. In matings with an unlimited number of tapping sequences, fertilization success depended on female resistance. Within-male variation in fertilization success was higher in matings with an unlimited number of tapping sequences than in matings interrupted after a copulation. Several components of male mating behaviour thus contribute to the variation in sperm precedence in D. anilis. Female behaviour, in particular, resistance of tapping movements, can also increase variation in sperm precedence. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB This study investigated the function and mechanism underlying a previously documented 'mirror-image ambiguity' (i.e. the mirror image of a pattern is treated as similar to the original stimulus) in foraging bumblebees, Bombus impatiens. Artificial flowers were constructed so that the mirror image of a petal configuration was different from the left-right reversal of that configuration. Bees were first trained to discriminate between rewarding and unrewarding artificial flowers that differed only in their configuration of four differently patterned petals. On subsequent choice tests between two empty flowers. the bees chose the rewarding configuration (S+) over the unrewarding one (S-), over the mirror image and over the left-right reversal. In the critical test conditions, the bees failed to choose the mirror image over a novel petal configuration, but they chose the left-right reversal over the novel configuration (78% of the time). A mirror-image mental transformation was ruled out as a mechanism underlying mirror-image ambiguity. The notion that mirror-image ambiguity has general functional significance (e.g. is a by-product of the symmetry of the nervous system) received no support. The results favour a specific mechanism tied to a specific function: a left-right transposition of a floral pattern, which would enable foraging bees to recognize vertically symmetrical flowers that were partially occluded at the time of learning.

AB Many insects foraging for nectar or pollen exhibit flower constancy, a learned fidelity to a particular species of plant that previously provided a reward. Constancy may persist even when alternative flowers are available that provide a greater or less variable reward. This strategy entails more travelling time than one of generalization (visiting all suitable flowers as they are encountered). The consensus at present is that this increase in travelling time is offset by decreases in handling time; switching between flower species incurs a cost in time spent learning to 'handle' the new flower species that is avoided by remaining constant. If this is so, then the optimal strategy should depend upon the density of flower species (and thus the travelling time), with switching occurring below a threshold density of the target flower species. This prediction is tested using the butterfly, Thymelicus flavus, by analysing foraging patterns under natural conditions. This species exhibited constancy: of 465 visits to flowers 85% were to the same species as last visited. As predicted switches between flower species occurred in response to low encounter rates of the flower species on which the individual had previously fed. However, butterflies ignored the vast majority of suitable flowers that they encountered, even when they were of the species to which they were constant. This casts doubt on explanations for flower constancy as an adaptive strategy that minimizes handling time and maximizes resource acquisition per unit time within learning constraints.

AB The dunnock song repertoire comprises multiple song types, and during bouts of singing males repeat a song type several times before switching. Several hypotheses suggest that the rate at which males switch song types may function in male-male aggression, mate attraction, or both. Dunnocks switched song types 10 times faster when searching for a receptive female than during male-male interactions. Polyandrous and polygynandrous males switched song types significantly faster than monogamous and polygynous males when separated from a fertile female, but there was no difference in switching rates during song duels or spontaneous song bouts outside the fertile period. Thus males were more likely to switch song types if they were competing to attract a receptive female than if they had exclusive access to females. Contrary to the predictions of the anti-exhaustion and anti-habituation hypotheses, the rate of song switching was higher in the contexts in which song rate was slower.

AB The hypothesis that demographic processes are important in determining social structure among non-human primates through their effects on the development of individual social relationships was tested. Changes in maternal behaviour, infants' social milieux and infants' social networks were examined as a function of changes in group size and composition among free-ranging rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta, on Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. Data were analysed for 10 group-years collected between 1974 and 1990 representing a single social group during periods of rapid expansion and fissioning, two daughter groups following fissioning and an unrelated group that did not undergo fissioning. As group size expanded, infants found themselves near (<5 m) larger numbers of group members and smaller proportions of close kin. Mothers spent more time near their infants and sought more proximity with them. Infants developed social networks that were more highly kin biased. When the groups fissioned, these trends reversed. Significant correlations were found between group size, mother-infant interaction and infant social networks across all group-years. Individual variation in the degree to which infant social networks were kin biased was related both directly to the infant's social milieu and indirectly to its relationship with its mother. Given the long-term nature of the mother's influence on social networks, these results suggest that demographic influences on developmental processes can lead to progressive changes in social structure in the absence of resource scarcity.

AB The impact of sexual behaviour on the display of scent marking (chinning) was assessed in New Zealand white male and female rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus L. In bucks, the occurrence of one ejaculation or six mounts immediately decreased chinning frequency. This behaviour pattern remained depressed below pre-mating (baseline) levels at 30 and 60 min (P<0.01) following mounts or ejaculation. The execution of a single mount also reduced chinning, although to a lesser extent and for a shorter time (0 and 30 min; P<0.01) than after six mounts. Ambulation in an open field was not modified by mounts or ejaculations. When copulating to satiety, males displayed 15-42 ejaculations across 2.6-8.4 h and were unable to ejaculate for at least the next 2 hours (criterion used to establish sexual satiety). Following satiety, chinning frequency remained significantly below baseline for longer than after one ejaculation (2 h). In intact oestrous females, the performance of one or three lordosis responses significantly reduced both chinning and ambulation (P<0.01). Results show that the display of mating rapidly activates a neural mechanism that inhibits chinning in male and female rabbits. The specific inhibition of chinning observed in males versus the generalized depression of activity detected in females is discussed. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male sailfin mollies show size-dependent variation in sexual behaviour. The level of variation between six north Florida populations in rates of condition-dependent behaviours was estimated and whether behavioural variation is ordered with respect to male body size distributions was determined. In five of six populations, courtship display rates increased with male length, supporting previous evidence. Several results were not consistent with those reported elsewhere. Rates of gonopodial thrusting and gonoporal nibbling were not related to male body length. Courtship display rates adjusted for male body size were not ordered with respect to male body size distributions. High adjusted courtship rates were characteristic of populations where males were predominantly large and where they were predominantly small. No consistent pattern of variation existed between populations in the relationships of the three behaviour patterns to one another. Variation between populations in size-dependent behaviour is therefore far more extensive but less patterned than previously reported. These results imply that evolution can adjust the rates of the three behaviour patterns both independently of one another and of body size, and that the direction of behavioural evolution is not likely to be constrained by covariances within any single natural population.

ID SHIFTING-BALANCE THEORY
AB The purpose of this study was to relate the social organization of a population of red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, to evolution theory. During a 7-year study of lifetime breeding success in an unconfined population of red junglefowl, only a small proportion of the most dominant cocks and hens produced most of the adults of succeeding generations. Variability in progeny number reared to independence was such that the genetically effective number of adults in the study population was only 28% of what it would be if the progeny distribution were random (Poisson). Under an isolation by distance model, the effective breeding size was 47% of the harmonic mean (43) of population size over seven years. Combining these two estimates, the genetically effective breeding size of the population was only about 13% of the census number of adults. These results suggest ample basis for random differentiation of local populations in this species, which combined with natural selection and other factors should help to provide favourable conditions for adaptive evolution as envisaged by Sewall Wright in his shifting balance theory of evolution. Social behaviour often greatly restricts effective breeding size of local populations, and so helps to determine the conditions for adaptive evolution favoured by Wright. Wright's theory is based on application of the principles of animal breeding to evolution, and further evidence for this theory is cited from studies on breeding of domestic fowl. The red junglefowl is the principal and perhaps sole ancestor of the domestic fowl. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Lifetime mating success of individually marked, male sagebrush crickets, Cyphoderris strepitans, was studied in a field enclosure over 2 years. Male mating was inferred on the basis of damage to the hind wings upon which females feed during copulation. There was a virgin male mating advantage in both years. Male mating success was correlated with adult longevity and nights during the season spent singing, but not with male mass. The opportunity for sexual selection differed between years and appeared to be constrained by the observed virgin male mating advantage. The spatial distribution of males was variable within seasons, and changed over the course of both seasons. Mating in sagebrush crickets resembles that of some frog species where chorus tenure is the best predictor of male lifetime mating success. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In spite of its evolutionary importance, little is known about intraspecific variation in sexual selection. In the soapberry bug, Jadera haematoloma, absolute adult sex ratio varies within and between populations because of differences in mortality rates, creating natural opportunities for variation in the intensity of sexual selection. Sex ratios in Oklahoma, U.S.A., are variably male biased, but approach 1:1 in the Florida Keys. Comparisons of reproductive aggregations in Oklahoma and the Florida Keys showed a higher large-male mating frequency only in Oklahoma, mainly in aggregations with above-average male:female ratios. There was no evidence of assortative mating by size in either region. In laboratory tests, large and small males were similar in several mating characteristics, including mate-guarding ability, but large males searched for mates with a significantly greater rate of locomotion. To predict how this difference in searching rate interacted with sex ratio, the equilibrium mating frequencies of large and small males were modelled across the observed range of sex ratios. This model predicted the pattern observed in nature: with increasing sex ratio, the proportional large-male mating advantage increased and then asymptoted. Notably, the asymptotic value was close to the ratio of the average mate-searching locomotion rate of large males to that of small males, further indicating that a size-based difference in mate searching is the main cause of the large-male mating advantage. This species thus shows a mosaic pattern in the intensity of sexual selection on body size, which depends on the interaction of sex ratio and male mating competition.

ID INFANTS; AGE
AB Hinde & Barden (1985, Anim. Behav., 33, 1371-1373) suggested that the teddy bear has evolved to match sign stimuli that release nurturant behaviour. Bears are usually bought for infants and young children. From an evolutionary perspective it seems paradoxical that young children who themselves require intensive nurture should exhibit a preference for objects that afford nurturing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the origin of the preference for nurturant sign stimuli. The preference for baby-featured bears was examined in three age groups: 4, 6 and 8 year olds. The 6 and 8 year olds significantly preferred baby-featured bears; however, the 4 year olds did not. The evolution of the teddy bear is thus apparently not driven by the ostensible consumer, the young child; the preference for baby features may be part of a wider, relatively late development of nurturant feelings towards young.

AB Human, Homo sapiens, female orgasm is not necessary for conception; hence it seems reasonable to hypothesize that orgasm is an adaptation for manipulating the outcome of sperm competition resulting from facultative polyandry. If heritable differences in male viability existed in the evolutionary past, selection could have favoured female adaptations (e.g. orgasm) that biased sperm competition in favour of males possessing heritable fitness indicators. Accumulating evidence suggests that low fluctuating asymmetry is a sexually selected male feature in a variety of species, including humans, possibly because it is a marker of genetic quality. Based on these notions, the proportion of a woman's copulations associated with orgasm is predicted to be associated with her partner's fluctuating asymmetry. A questionnaire study of 86 sexually active heterosexual couples supported this prediction. Women with partners possessing low fluctuating asymmetry and their partners reported significantly more copulatory female orgasms than were reported by women with partners possessing high fluctuating asymmetry and their partners, even with many potential confounding variables controlled. The findings are used to examine hypotheses for female orgasm other than selective sperm retention. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

This pattern of activity has a self-similar structure; the activity record appears the same regardless of the time scale used. There is a power law dependence of the rate 'constants' that describes how the activity of flies turns on and off. As a consequence no natural time scale for the measurement of the activity level exists, and the amount of activity depends on the time scale of measurement. The observation of fractal time variability in animal behaviour may illuminate the processes that produce activity. Fractal time variation in movement activity can lead to Levy flight patterns of movement, which produce efficient searches. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ID ALLOPARENTAL CARE; GULLS; BIRDS
AB Adoption in the emperor penguin was investigated to determine its rate of occurrence, biological causes and adaptive value. The study was carried out over 2 years in Terre Adelie (Antarctica). Adoption was relatively common: 351 cases were recorded out of 2068 chicks in the colony in 1993. Adoption occurred after kidnapping (53%, N=185) of a chick or with the brooding of a chick found wandering in the colony. Long-lasting adoptions were rare (2.3%) and most lasted only 0.5-10 days. Adopted chicks were 1-2 months old. Allofeeding occurred in a minimum 14.8% (N=52) of adoptions in 1993. Alloparents were failed breeders and non-breeding adults at the colony during the breeding cycle and were usually females. Chicks may benefit from being allofed and protected when winters are particularly harsh and more alloparents are available. However, alloparenting may be particularly explained by proximal causes, such as endocrinological mechanisms allowing the birds to be exploited by chicks soliciting food or brooding.

AB The foraging and echolocation behaviour of three European pipistrelles (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. nathusii and P. kuhlii) was studied under natural conditions. The pipistrelles were photographed with two 35 mm cameras under stroboscopic illumination, and their echolocation signals were recorded simultaneously. This permits a three-dimensional reconstruction of the flight paths of bat and prey, and allows the details of echolocation behaviour to be studied in the context of natural foraging behaviour. The general relationships between foraging and echolocation behaviour were consistent among the three species. Foraging behaviour consisted of four stages: search flight (before detection of prey), approach flight (pursuit after detection of prey), capture and retrieval of prey. These stages correlated with phases in echolocation behaviour: search, approach, and terminal phase followed by a pause. Detection of prey occurred at distances of 1.14-2.20 m. The search cone extending from the bat's mouth was up to 150 degrees wide. The pipistrelles caught prey in mid-air, either with the tail membrane alone or by funnelling it with a wing onto the tail membrane. Except for some intra- and interspecific differences in sound duration, pulse interval, bandwidth and terminal frequency in search phase, the structure and pattern of the echolocation signals were similar in the three pipistrelles. In the approach and terminal phases, pulse duration and pulse interval decreased with the approach to the target, while bandwidth and sweeprate increased. While pursuing insects, the pipistrelles precisely avoided an overlap between outgoing signal and the echo returning from the prey. Furthermore, the bats stopped emitting signals several centimetres before they reached the insect. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Intraspecific nest parasitism in the barnacle goose, Branta leucopsis, was recorded by direct observations of females trying to lay eggs in the nests of other females. This was observed on 36 occasions. Parasitic egg-laying attempts were observed both in mornings and evenings, and lasted on average at least 20 min. Parasitic females approached host nests very fast and immediately sat down on or close to the nest. Host females attacked parasitic females intensively, but host males were much less aggressive. Males paired to the parasitic females were sometimes seen, but they never took any active part in the parasitic egg-laying attempts. Parasitic females probably successfully laid an egg most of the times, as the clutch size in host nests was on average 0.9 eggs larger than in nests where parasitic egg-laying attempts were not observed. Host females were observed to retrieve eggs laid outside the nest cup. Of 27 known cases, parasitic females made their egg-laying attempts before or at the host's start of incubation on 12 occasions, and after the start of incubation 15 times. It is suggested that parasitic females exploited features in the behaviour of potential hosts, such as egg retrieval and low aggressiveness in host males, to succeed in their egg-laying attempts. Nest parasitism seems to be a facultative, 'best-of-a-bad-job' tactic in barnacle geese, as parasitic females were observed to have nests of their own before or after the year they behaved parasitically, but never in that particular year.

AB The courtship sequences of wild-caught Diosophila silvestris males paired with virgin females (the daughters of wild-caught females) were studied in the laboratory to examine behavioural characters affecting male mating success. Successful males courted the female persistently (without breaks) and spent more time in the head-under-wings position and in wing vibration than unsuccessful males. The relative durations of head-under-wings and wing vibration appeared to be consistent within males. Females were active and vigorous participants in courtship, contrary to the stereotype of female Drosophila being passive observers of male displays. The females could interrupt the courtship by flying away from the courting male, but they often returned to the male waving their wings. Receptive females waved their wings, and spent more time standing and less time preening than unreceptive females. After slashing at the male (or as a reaction to male circling) they stood still more often than unreceptive females. It appears that although receptive females do not have a particular signal that invariably indicates receptivity, they encourage male courtship throughout the sequence, by being active early, and standing still later. These results will serve as a baseline for comparisons with other species, and to stimulate experiments to examine female mating preferences.

AB The social structure of a feral cattle, Bos taurus, population in Donana (southwest Spain) was studied. Social affinity among individuals was related to their age-sex classes. Cows and young animals formed stable social groups or cow-herds based on long-term social links among their members. The members of a given herd shared a common home range and maintained an active spatial and social segregation with members of other social groups. Both for its stable composition and for its fidelity to a home range, a herd constitutes a stable social environment. The stability of social structure and the mechanisms involved in its maintenance in Donana cattle are discussed in the context of a controversy raised by apparently contradictory findings on bovine social behaviour.

   HETEROPTERA; WATERSTRIDER; STRATEGIES; EVOLUTION; AVOIDANCE; CONFLICT
AB Predation risk associated with the various components of the mating behaviour of the water strider Gerris buenoi are investigated with a series of experiments. Mating behaviour in this species includes frequent harassment of females by males (mate searching), pre-mating struggles that may function as mate choice by females, mating which includes copulation and male mate guarding, and post-mating struggles. Each component of the mating behaviour of females increases predation risk. Escape by females from harassment by males increases the movement rate of females and predacious backswimmers are attracted to movement at the water surface. Capture success of backswimmers is almost tripled on females engaged in pre- and post-mating struggles relative to single females. Because longer pre-mating struggles are one mechanism by which females bias the mating success of male phenotypes in water striders, these data demonstrate that mate choice is costly to females. Finally, mating females are at twice the risk of predation than are single females. Some components of mating behaviour in males also appear to increase predation risk. Males searching for mates spend a higher portion of their time in the open water habitat (out of refuge) and move more often than females. Use of the open water habitat increases exposure to backswimmers and movement on the surface attracts backswimmers. Males that successfully grasp females engage in pre-mating struggles, during which capture success by backswimmers on males is significantly increased. However, in contrast to females, there was no significant increase in capture success of backswimmers on mating relative to single males.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID FALCO-TINNUNCULUS; ALARM CALLS; BEHAVIOR; NEPOTISM; KESTREL
AB Escape response of common voles exposed either to a kestrel, Falco tinnunculus, model ''flown'' overhead or to neighbouring voles from the same family responding to such a model were investigated. The majority of voles (81%) either froze or ran for cover when exposed to the sight of the kestrel model. Neighbouring conspecifics, who could not see the kestrel model, also responded provided they could see model-exposed voles. A smaller fraction of the neighbouring voles also responded when the could only hear the escape responses of other voles. The fraction of voles responding decreased with increasing distance between the two groups. At short distances visual contact played a major role, and running voles affected neighbours more than freezing animals. At larger distances acoustic contact may prevail. Freezing was as effective a signal as running. It is argued that individual voles may benefit from social synchrony of ultradian feeding rhythms by exchanging warning signals when a predator appears, as well as from possible energy savings and the ''safety in numbers'' effect.

TI SIZE-ASSORTATIVE MATING IN THE BLISTER BEETLE LYTTA-MAGISTER
   (COLEOPTERA, MELOIDAE) IS DUE TO MALE AND FEMALE PREFERENCE FOR LARGER
   MATES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Although positive assortative mating has been the subject of much theoretical analysis, its causes are still poorly understood. Results of a study of the blister beetle Lytta magister suggest that assortative mating by size occurrs because both males and females prefer large mates. Males were less likely to terminate courtships with larger females, resulting in a mating advantage for larger females in the field. In captivity, males provided with a size-matched and a larger female courted and mated more frequently with the larger of the two females. However, in experiments with a female and two males, small males courted and mated with relatively small females more often than did large males. Even though size-related male-male aggression was absent, large males showed a mating advantage in the field. This finding suggests that large males are preferred by females. Because large size is the universally preferred phenotype, these individuals are more able to express their preference and tend to pair off. Small beetles are then left no choice but to mate among themselves. Preference for large mates has presumably evolved because large females produce more eggs per clutch and large males are more capable of producing the large spermatophore passed during mating.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mongolian gerbils live in cooperative pairs or family groups, but they mate promiscuously. To investigate the reproductive outcome of alternative male and female mating strategies a series of laboratory studies was carried out. The number of ejaculations received by postpartum or cyclic oestrous females, mating with one or two males, was controlled. The paternity of juveniles was determined by the genetic marker of coat colour morph. When presented with one male, 70% of the postpartum oestrous  females delivered a litter following one ejaculatory series, whereas all females delivered following two or more. When females were presented with two males in succession, and there was only one ejaculatory series, 90% of the females in postpartum oestrus, but only 35% of the cyclic oestrous females delivered a litter. Whether the sire was the cage-mate of the female or a strange male had no effect. Litter size increased significantly, and its variance decreased, with the total number of ejaculatory series. When two males copulated with the same female, the male with relatively more ejaculatory series sired a larger proportion of the litter, irrespective of mating order. When two males were allowed the same number of ejaculatory series, there was a shift from first-male advantage, to no order effect, to last-male advantage following one, to two or three, to four or five ejaculatory series from each male. The relative reproductive outcome of the first male was influenced more by the copulatory effort of the second male than by his own effort. The consequences of number and mating order of sires for average litter size and paternity are analysed.

TI URINE MARKING IN POPULATIONS OF WILD HOUSE MICE MUS-DOMESTICUS RUTTY .3.
   COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE SEXES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The potential roles of urine marking for intersexual communication between house mice were examined within eight captive territorial family groups. The responses of resident males (dominant and subdominant adults, subadults and juveniles) and females (breeding and non-breeding adults, subadults and juveniles) were measured towards introduced urine marks from familiar resident, familiar neighbour and unfamiliar mice of the opposite sex. Responses were consistent with the hypothesis that males  mark at a high rate to advertise their identity and dominance over their marked territory to other mice. Dominant males counter-marked all types of female urine at a high rate. Most females were attracted to marks from their resident dominant male but tended to avoid marks from neighbour and unfamiliar dominant males; non-breeding adult daughters were not significantly attracted to resident male marks and invaded the neighbouring territory persistently. Female mark responses were variable, though breeding females counter-marked urine from unfamiliar subadult and neighbour dominant males significantly more than they marked a patch of home or clean substrate.

   BUSHCRICKET REQUENA-VERTICALIS (TETTIGONIIDAE, ORTHOPTERA) - ACTIVE
   FEMALE CHOICE OR PASSIVE ATTRACTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of sound as a cue for female choice in the bushcricket Requena verticalis was investigated in both the field and laboratory. Females oriented to the closer of two calling males in a two-male field trial. Preference appeared to depend on the power of the higher frequency components (circa 28 kHz) of the call''s spectrum, as well as the variance in chirp rate. Recording the songs of small and large males, and testing females on a two-speaker laboratory arena, revealed that when absolute call intensities were held at the same level, females could not distinguish between males from different size classes. However, where a consistent speaker preference occurred to a recording of either a large or small male, preference was shown towards the speaker producing a song with the greater power in the high frequency part of the spectrum. When the call of a single male was duplicated and presented as a choice to the female at different intensities, females were able to differentiate the call with an intensity difference of 1 dB in calls where the low frequency was more pronounced than higher frequencies, and with a 3 dB difference where this balance was less pronounced. Acuity, as expressed by the distance the female travelled before reaching the speaker, was improved where higher frequencies were more pronounced.

TI ADAPTIVE SUICIDE IN PEA APHIDS - DECISIONS ARE COST SENSITIVE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Inclusive fitness theory predicts that host suicide may evolve when a ''suicidal'' host''s genetic contribution, resulting from reduced parasitism in kin, exceeds the sacrifice of its own reproductive contribution. ''Suicidal'' behaviour was examined in pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, parasitized by Braconid wasps, Aphidius ervi, when reproductive potential varied. Fourth instar aphids parasitized at the second instar (which produce no offspring before mummification) chose the most dangerous  escape behaviour when approached by a ladybird beetle, Hippodamia convergens, predator while fourth instar (which can expect to produce seven to eight offspring) behaved no differently from unparasitized individuals. Therefore, ''suicidal'' behaviour in aphids is cost sensitive. Coastal and interior aphid biotypes were cross-parastized with wasps from non-local habits. Coastal aphids, unlike interior aphids, are not faced with different mortality risks in their predator escape behaviour and do not behave differently when parasitized. The fact that parasite type had no effect on aphid behaviour, so long as the same biotype was infected, makes it unlikely that modified behaviour in infected interior aphids is merely a proximate effect of interior parasities.

TI IMPACT OF COURTSHIP FEEDING ON CLUTCH AND 3RD-EGG SIZE IN
   GLAUCOUS-WINGED GULLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Gulls are usually not considered to be food-limited during the egg-laying stage. Egg-removal experiments have demonstrated the ability of gulls to lay additional eggs and to increase the size of the typically smaller third egg. Investigators in several recent studies, however, have invoked food limitation as a constraint on egg production. The relationship between courtship feeding rate, territory attendance, clutch size and third-egg size was studied in the glaucous-winged gull, Larus  glaucescens. Courtship feeding rate rose steadily during the 30 days prior to laying, and peaked 2 days before the first egg was laid. Control males increased the amount of time they spent on their nesting territories and sharply decreased courtship feeding rate following the laying of the first egg. In contrast, males whose first and second eggs were removed experimentally within 12h of laying, neither increased their territory attendance not decreased their courtship feeding rate until after  the third egg was laid. Females at experimental nests laid more eggs and heavier third eggs (relative to the weight of the first egg) than did females at control nests. Courtship feeding rate was negatively correlated with differences in weight between first and third eggs. The courtship feeding rate during egg laying appears to serve as proximate constraint on third-egg size and may serve as either a proximate or an ultimate constraint on clutch size.

TI SOCIAL PREFERENCE OF ZEBRA FINCHES FOR SIBLINGS, COUSINS AND NONKIN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Adult zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were tested for their tendency to perch selectively near relatives in two experiments. In the first experiment, males and females were allowed to choose between opposite-sex siblings (r = 1/2) and non-kin (r .ltoreq. 1/16); males were also tested with male siblings and non-kin. The second experiment was similar to the first, except that stimulus sets consisted of first cousins (r = 1/8) and non-kin of test birds. Neither sex discriminated between siblings and non-kin in heterosexual tests, but males preferred to associate with siblings in isosexual tests. Females preferred male first cousins over non-kin; this result is believed to reflect a mating preference. For both female heterosexual preferences and male isosexual preferences, discrimination of kin was not dependent on shared prior experience.

TI RANDOM SETTLEMENT OF FEMALE PIED FLYCATCHERS, FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA -
   SIGNIFICANCE OF MALE TERRITORY SIZE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a study of the pied flycatcher the availability of nest sites, and hence the territory size of males, was manipulated. The number of females that a male attracted was positively correlated with his territory size; males in a low-density plot attracted more females than males in a high-density plot. A partial correlation analysis showed that territory size was the single most important determinant of male mating success, at least late in the season. If females actively choose between males on  the basis of territory size or male density, males in the low-dendity plot should be preferred over those in the high-density plot. However, the relative number of females settling in the plots was the same before and after manipulation of male density. The results are consistent with an hypothesis of random female settlement where females arrive randomly in relation to area and mate with the first male they encounter. It is argued that when females are constrained by time and energy, random settlement is the best pairing strategy they can adopt, as high-quality males in high-quality territories are most likely to be detected by prospecting females. The results suggest that male pied flycatcher defend territories to gain access to females.

TI THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF HAREM POLYGYNY IN THE SAND TILEFISH,
   MALACANTHUS-PLUMIERI - RESOURCE OR FEMALE DEFENSE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sand tilefish occurs in colonies composed of polygynous mating units aptly characterized as harems. Field studies were conducted to examine the extent to which male tilefish monopolize harems through defence of resources important to females, by directly restricting the locations of mates that aggregate to reduce predation risk, or both. Burrow and female removals, combined with feeding experiments and observation of foraging and prey distribution, indicated that females defend a home burrow refuge and a surrounding feeding space. Male removals revealed that females do not position territories solely to be near mates, but spawn with whichever male occupies their feeding area. Responses to female removals confirmed that intrasexual competition restricts the location and amount of space occupied by some females. Group formation suggests, however, that competition costs are not so high as to prevent female occupation of adjacent territories. Instead, joining harems may promote dependable spawning oportunities for females that are restricted to home burrows for predator avoidance. Male removals indicated that males position their territories to acquire mates. Males did not, however, prevent their mates from moving to territories of other males when adjacent spaces were made vacant experimentally. Males did not abandon their territories when all mates were removed. Also, unmated males defend territories that are as large as those of males with as many as three mates. These results support the resource defence hypothesis. Monopolization of multiple mates is only feasible, however, because tilefish aggregate for reasons probably related to predator avoidance. Therefore, aspects of harem formation in tilefish are also consistent with the female defence hypothesis. We argue that a dichotomy between resource and female defence may not apply well to tilefish or other group-having fish where females are site-restricted and egg production and spawning is iterated year-round.

TI PHENOTYPIC CORRELATES OF DOMINANCE IN CARRION CROWS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON
   ACCESS TO FOOD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of age, sex and body size as determinants of dominance status was studied in a winter flock of individually marked carrion crows, Corvus corone corone, and their importance in gaining access to a clumped food source assessed. Sex, age and body size determined, in decreasing order of importance, the outcome of agonistic encounters between individuals. Males won over females, adults over juveniles, and within the same age-sex classes, the large birds over the small ones. Males had  access to clumped food for a higher proportion of time than females, and large individuals for a higher proportion than small individuals. Junvenile males, however, had as much access to the food as adult males, achieving this through shorter and more frequent feeding bouts. Thus the determinants of dominance, as assessed from the dyadic interactions, did not strictly correspond to the determinants of food access. The rank order of age, sex and body size as determinants of dominance is important, since different order determine which members of a population will be subordinate. If subordination has consequences for suvival, access to resources, dispersal and other life-history parameters, this order is important in predicting which individuals will survive, breed, disperse or migrate.

TI ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATIONS BY MALE HAMSTERS - PARAMETERS OF CALLING AND
   EFFECTS OF PLAYBACKS ON FEMALE BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male and female hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus, were observed during prolonged matings. Ultrasonic vocalizations by the male were frequent initially and declined during testing, but were positively associated with the duration of female lordosis. Most calls were uttered while sniffing the female, although early in the test period when most ejaculations were occurring, high rates were also observed during non-contact behaviour such as grooming. Following exposure to the first female, introduction of a novel female stimulated the return of high rates of male calling. In a follow-up experiment, males uttered more ultrasonic calls in the 30-s period following ejaculation than in the preceding 30-s interval. These results provide evidence that males utter ultrasonic vocalizations that enhance lordosis during extended sexual interactions, and that the patterns of male calling are consistent with behaviours that maintain receptivity and ensure successfully fertilization. Two  other experiments examined whether different male calls have different effects on female behaviour. Males utter at least two structurally distinct types of ultrasonic vocalizations during sexual behaviour: one is produced during interaction with a female in lordosis(during-female), and the second is uttered following removal of the female (post-female). In the first experiment, playbacks of during- and post-female calls were equally effective in prolonging the duration of lordosis in females  relative to taped noise. In a second experiment, however, tape-recorded post-female calls induced more ultrasonic vocalizations from females than during-female calls; both call types elicited more calling from females than taped noise. Therefore, although there were differences in potency, during- and post-female calls did not differ in the types of responses elicited from females under two different conditions. Thus, these male calls induce context-appropriate responses in females. In a final  experiment, structural differences were found in the male vocalizations occurring just before and after ejaculation. Together, these experiments show that ultrasonic vocalizations by male hamsters consistently vary in rate and structure during sexual interactions, and suggest that the responses of females may vary accordingly.

TI BEHAVIORAL DYNAMICS OF INTRASPECIFIC BROOD PARASITISM IN COLONIAL CLIFF
   SWALLOWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Colonial cliff swallows, Hirundo pyrrhonota, in southwestern Nebraska commonly brood-parasitize (lay eggs in) nests of neighbouring conspecifics. At least 22%, and perhaps as many as 43%, of all nests were estimated to contain one or more parasitic eggs. Colour-marked parasites maintained nests of their own in addition to parasitizing the nests of others. Parasitism usually occurred among close neighbours when nests were left unattended momentarily. Parasites'' and hosts'' first laying dates  tended to be synchronized. Parasitism often occurred early in a host''s laying period or 1-3 days prior to the host''s start of egg laying. Hosts rejected any eggs added more than 4 days before they began laying. Hosts laid smaller clutches than normal, either as a direct response to being parasitized or because parasites preferentially selected hosts that were to lay small clutches for other reasons. Parasitic egg laying appeared successful, with only about a quarter of parasitic eggs known not to survive. On an annual basis, colour-marked parasites laid more total eggs and fledged more total young than did colour-marked hosts. Parasites, however, were also parasitized themselves, and thus being a parasite was costly. There was little evidence that parasites routinely removed host eggs. Parasitism tended not to occur in extremely small colonies and among solitary nesters, but there was no relationship between incidence of parasitism and colony size for colonies with more than 10 nests. Intraspecific brood parasitism probably serves to minimize risk in uncertain environments by distributing eggs in several nests to ensure that at least one offspring will survive to independence. Incidence of brood parasitism in a colony increased with uncertainty of reproduction.

TI FORAGING DECISIONS - PREY CHOICE BY PIGEONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Four pigeons, Columba livia, served as subjects in a foraging analogue testing the predictions, both qualitative and quantitative, of the prey choice model. In experiment 1, the search cost between successive prey encounters was varied. In experiment 2, the proportion of rich to poor prey opportunities was varied. In experiments 3 and 4, both search cost and the proportion of rich to poor opportunities were varied in order to manipulate the encounter rate with only the rich prey type and only  the poor prey type, respectively. In every experiment nearly all rich prey type opportunities were accepted when offered. Further, as the encounter rate with the rich prey type decreased, the subjects accepted more poor prey type opportunities (experiments 1-3). Both of these results conformed to the predictions of the prey choice model. The acceptance of the poor prey type often, but not always, approximated the all-or-none selection predicted. Selection of the poor prey type changed when the  encounter rate with only the poor prey type was varied (experiment 4), in clear violation of the predictions of the prey choice model.

TI PARENT OFFSPRING RELATIONSHIPS IN WINTERING BARNACLE GEESE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relationship between parent geese, Branta leucopsis, and their offspring was monitored in order to discover some of the possible costs and benefits resulting from their association. Compared with birds without young the amount of time parents devoted to feeding was restricted in autumn and winter when they spent significantly more time being vigilant and aggressive. Family goslings fed without interruption for longer periods in autumn, were victims of attacks less often and grew fatter  than unattached goslings. By the time the geese migrated to the breeding grounds in spring over 60% of goslings were unattached. The appearance of unattached young was related to the frequency of parental attacks on them and to inter-sibling aggression. However, the majority of parents were still associating with at least some of their brood after 9-10 months. Birds with more breeding experience associated with offspring for longer. Maintaining association with offspring did not reduce a  parent''s chances of surviving to, or breeding in, the following year. In fact, birds that remained with young for the longest period bred more successfully the next year than those with shorter periods of parental care. It is suggested that extended association with goslings may increase a parent''s chances of breeding in the future due to the ''contributor'' effect of the goslings that stayed in the family. Such goslings spend more time being vigilant and repelling neighbours which enables  parents to increase their feeding time.

TI TERRITORIALITY, COOPERATION AND RESOURCE PRIORITY - HOARDING IN THE
   MONGOLIAN GERBIL, MERIONES-UNGUICULATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An experimental study was conducted at Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia, China involving six previously known multi-male, multi-female age-structured groups of gerbils occupying non-overlapping teritories. The animals were presented with grain for hoarding in seven petri dishes placed on a line across areas judged to be border zones between territories. The animals were provoked into trespassing by alternately supplying the dishes on each side of the border with grain. Agreement was found, both within and between groups, as to the location of territorial borders within an overlap zone of 1-4 m. Resident animals had clear priority of access to grain placed in their own territory. Most members (95%) of the six groups took part in hoarding, and the grain was brought to common group-stores in each case. Compared with the period prior to the experiment, more animals became active in the defence of their territories when hoardable food was present. There were no differences between animals of different age and sex categories in hoarding or in chasing activity, although individual differences were found.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF MALE-DOMINANCE ON SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN BLACK DUCKS
   AND MALLARDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The influence of male dominance on male-female social interactions was examined in black ducks, Anas rubripes and mallards, A. platyrhynchos, that were raised from hatch in four different groups (male and female mallards; male and female black ducks; male mallards and female black ducks; male black ducks and female mallards). The mate preference of females, independent of the influence of male dominance, was determined by exposing females to four caged, isolated males, one from each different group. All females preferred the type of male they had been raised with since hatch. Females were then exposed to the same four males, now free-swimming, to determine how male dominance influenced the initial preference. Under these conditions, each female associated primarily with the most dominant of the four males, regardless of her initial mate preference. Mallards were the most dominant males in all tests. These results demonstrate that male dominance influences social  interactions and is one factor contributing to hybridization between these two species.

TI INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES IN TEMPERAMENT OF DOMESTIC DAIRY GOATS -
   CONSTANCY AND CHANGE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Change is an essential property of development, yet some element of stability or consistency is necessary for the maintenance of individual distinctiveness. The issues of constancy and change were addressed in a study of individual differences in temperament of domestic dairy goats, Capra hircus. Within-individual stability was assessed on an absolute basis by evaluating changes in mean scores on five behavioural measures monitored in goat-human encounters at 14, 22 and 30 weeks of age. Between-individual stability was examined by comparing rank orders of individuals across successive ages and situations. Human-reared goats consistently expressed low levels of timidity. Behaviour of dam-reared goats increasingly resembled that of human-reared goats, while relative individual differences remained stable. Individual differences in timidity scores, derived from five interrelated behaviour measures, reliably predicted differences in pituitary-adrenal responsiveness at 14-30 weeks and behavioural outcomes in five different situations at 55 weeks. Timidity scores of all dam-reared goats exceeded scores of human-reared goats. Among serum pairs of fraternal twins, a goat''s rank within the dam-reared group predicted its sibling''s rank within the human-reared group. An individual''s genotype and its early postnatal environment both contributed to processes underlying the development of stable individual differences in temperament of domestic dairy goats.

Brightness of malar feathers and body weight were weakly associated with female dominance. Female rank, weight and bill depth were related to success in pairing. Competition and choice favored specific traits less strongly in females than in males.

TI SEXUAL DIFFERENCES IN REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT - TIME ACTIVITY BUDGETS OF
   MONOGAMOUS KILLDEER, CHARADRIUS-VOCIFERUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB By measuring the time allocated to various reproductive and somatic activities it was possible to look at differences in the strategies of the sexes for killdeer, a monogamous species. Killdeer time-activity budgets supported the general hypothesis that males and females maximize fitness in different ways. Males allocated more time than females to mating activities: mate attraction and territorial defense. However, the parental roles of the sexes were not those predicted for a monogamous  species; males allocated more time than females to parental activities throughout a nesting attempt. Males appeared to be less time-constrained, and better able to perform parental activities. Females allocated more time to foraging than did males. It is suggested that the amount of time females allocated to parental activities is limited by the high energy demands of egg production. Further, high nest-failure rates may select for females maintaining good condition for re-nesting. The costs of  desertion for killdeer were considerable. Adult removal experiments supported the hypothesis that two parents were necessary for successful reproduction. No individuals managed to raise offspring alone successfully. Lone males, however, were able to hatch chicks while females were not. The need for continuous parental attentiveness may result in selection for biparental care for killdeer.

AB Six of 19 male chacma baboons living in a natural environment in Botswana were born in troops where they attained alpha status. At least three of these six males sired young in their natal troops. Nine other paternal males were immigrants, hence they were more distantly related to their mates, who were all natal. Offspring of natal and immigrant parents survived equally well to 90 days. These observations suggest that for this and other mammalian species the evolutionary history of a population may determine inbreeding costs.

TI EVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS OF POLYGYNY IN THE ARGENTINE ANT,
   IRIDOMYRMEX-HUMILIS (MAYR) (HYMENOPTERA, FORMICIDAE) - AN
   EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A comparison of several physiological parameters of queens of Iridomyrmex humilis in experimental monogynous and polygynous colonies showed that queens in monogynous colonies became heavier, had more developed ovaries and laid about twice as many eggs. Workers in monogynous colonies were more attracted to queens, which therefore probably received more food. This may partially explain the higher weight and fecundity of queens in monogynous colonies of Iridomyrmex humilis and possibly other  ant species. In polygynous colonies, queens differed greatly in their fecundity. These differences did not appear to be the result of a dominance hierarchy. These results are discussed from an evolutionary point of view. Two hypotheses of mutualism and colony level selection are proposed as an alternative to kin selection which is unlikely to be the exclusive selective influence in the evolution of polygyny either in I. humilis or in most other ant species.

TI THE EFFECTS OF TRICHINELLA INFECTION ON INTERSEXUAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN
   MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Parasitic infection may influence mating behaviour in at least two ways: (1) by creating a selection pressure for mate choice based on apparent resistance to infection and (2) by reducing the likelihood of an infected individual mating through induced changes in its physiology or behaviour. These two possibilities were tested using a nematode infection in laboratory mice. Female CFLP mice were infected with larvae of the aphasmid nematode Trichinella spiralis and allowed to interact with  uninfected males which were either experienced or inexperienced in terms of having previously copulated. Both the responses of males towards infected and uninfected females and the responses of females towards males were recorded. Overall, males were significantly less likely to mount, copulate and show other behaviours related to copulation with infected females. When experienced and inexperienced males were considered separately, experienced males showed significantly more investigatory activity towards infected females, but infection did not appear to affect responses by inexperienced males. Infected females were more likely to avoid or respond aggressively to attempts to mount by males and the latency to the first attempt to mount correlated positively with the frequency of avoidance/aggression towards approaching males. The results suggest that infection in females influences intersexual interactions by inducing a disinclination to accept mounts and copulate. The functional implications for parasite transmission are considered.

TI AGGRESSIVE HOWLING IN WOLVES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB During two studies that investigated the responses of wolf packs to either human simulations or pre-recorded playbacks of wolf, Canis lupus, howling, single adult wolves from five different packs approached my location and howled on a total of six occasions. The howls uttered by these close-approaching wolves were significantly deeper in pitch than comparable samples of howls recorded from animals that did not approach. In addition, howls of two of the five animals differed in structure from most of the other howls recorded during both studies. These close-approach howls were characterized by the presence of harmonically unrelated frequency sidebands near the end of the howl. This feature was rare in howls recorded during occasions when wolves kept their distance. These results indicate that the structure of wolf howling during aggressive interactions with strage wolves follows Morton''s (1977) motivation-structural rules, which state that natural selection will favour the use of low-frequency, harsh sounds by hostile animals. This relationship follows from the physical constraints of vocal production: animals of larger size can produce sounds of lower pitch and harsher tonal quality. As body size is a primary determinant in the outcome of aggressive interactions, vocalizations signalling size (i.e., low-pitched, harsh sounds) will be of selective value for individuals engaged in aggressive interactions.

TI THE TIMING OF THE SPERM EFFECT ON FEMALE DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER
   RECEPTIVITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The long-term inhibition of re-mating in female Drosophila melanogaster has been termed the sperm effect, because it is associated with sperm stored in the female''s ventral receptacle. Previous studies have shown that the sperm effect leads to a nearly complete loss of female receptivity within 1-2 days of mating. However, short-term effects, associated with the act of copulation itself, usually inhibit female remating for at least one day, obscuring the initial onset and kinetics of the sperm effect. Using females whose receptivity was not completely inhibited by short-term effects, the re-mating frequencies after initial matings to XO (sterile) or to XY (fertile) males were compared to estimate when the sperm effect first begins to inhibit re-mating, and over what time interval the effect is complete. The results indicate that the sperm effect is first evident about 8-10 h after mating. The inhibitory effect of stored sperm gradually increased over the next few hours, and XY-mated females become completely unreceptive by about 12 h after mating. Short- and long-term effects may overlap by several hours, and thus are not mutually exclusive. However, short-term effects diminish as sperm effects gradually lead to a virtually complete loss of receptivity.

TI ADAPTIVE ADVANTAGES OF MONOGAMY IN THE GREAT TIT (PARUS-MAJOR) - AN
   EXPERIMENTAL TEST OF THE POLYGYNY THRESHOLD-MODEL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB According to the polygyny threshold model, monogamy will prevail if variance in habitat quality is so small that females benefit from being monogamously paired in a poor habitat rather than being polygynously mated in a better habitat. This was tested in a monogamous territorial species, the great tit (Parus major), in two different habitats, viz. poor coniferous and rich deciduous forest by removing males in the latter. Widowed females fledged fewer young, and fledged young were lighter and  had shorter tarsi compared to a control group in the deciduous forest indicating the importance of male assistance. Experimental broods were on average lighter than control broods in the deciduous forests which suggests that the polygyny threshold was not reached. No significant differences were found between control groups. Therefore, monogamy may prevail in the great tit because the difference between habitats is not of such a magnitude that polygyny would be advantageous for females.

TI ODDITY AND THE CONFUSION EFFECT IN PREDATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB We report on two sets of experiments designed to clarify the roles of sensory ''confusion''and prey ''oddity'' as they interact to influence the hunting success of a pursuit predator, the largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), on silvery minnows (Hybognathus nuchalis). Bass quickly captured solitary minnows, but performed many unsuccessful attacks and took much longer to make a capture as prey school size was increased. At school sizes of eight and above, bass were effectively stymied, demonstrating the ''confusion effect''. The inclusion of one or two ''odd'' (blue-dyed) minnows in a school of eight greatly increased the ability of bass to capture both normal and odd prey, but this effect of oddity disappeared at a school size of 15. The implications of these results for understanding the adaptive basis of mixed species flocks, herds and schools is discussed.

TI IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTIONS WHEN INDIVIDUALS DIFFER IN COMPETITIVE ABILITY
   - PHENOTYPE-LIMITED IDEAL FREE MODELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A series of prospective models is developed to investigate ideal free distributions in populations where individuals differ in competitive ability. The models are three types. In the continuous-input models, there is continuous arrival of food or mates into each habitat patch, and competitors scramble to obtain as large a share as possible. In the interference models, the prey density in a particular patch stays constant but the presence of competitors slows down the rate at which prey are captured. In the kleptoparasitism model, individuals have food or females stolen from them by competitors higher in the dominance hierarchy, and in turn steal items from subordinates. A general result of the continuous-input and interference models is that the population of competitors can be truncated between patches so that the individuals with the highest competitive ability occur in the best patches, or in the patches where competitive differences are greatest. Individuals of lowest  competitive ability occur in the poorest patches or where competitive differences are least, and intermediate phenotypes are ranked between these two extremes. Thus the ideal free prediction that all individuals will achieve equal fitness will not apply. However, in continuous-input cases where competitive differences between phenotypes remain constant across patches, this solution is only neutrally stable, and forms only one element of a set of equilibrium distributions. The fact that many empirical studies of continuous-input have found approximately equal mean fitness across patches may relate to this finding. Most interference studies contradict the simple ideal free solution by having different mean intake rates across patches; this may relate to the predicted positive correlation of competitive ability with patch quality. The kleptoparasitism model usually generated continuous cycling of individuals between habitat  patches, though some correlation could be found between competitive ability and patch quality.

TI MECHANISMS OF FOOD SIZE SELECTION BY BULLFINCHES (PYRRHULA-PYRRHULA L)
   FEEDING ON SUNFLOWER SEEDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Size-selective feeding is usually discussed in relation to ''optimal diet'' models, which provide no indications of mechanisms of choice. In a series of experiments, captive bullfinches were presented with single sunflower fruits, pairs, and batches of fruits, and we attempted to discover how they discriminate among fruits of a continuous range of sizes and shapes. We investigated: (1) the proximate cues (e.g. size, shape, weight) that birds use in deciding whether or not to choose a fruit; (2)  the correspondence between these criteria and a prospective estimate of the profitability of fruits; and (3) the efficiency in selecting better fruits that was ultimately achieved by birds'' decisions. Efficiency of selection was better when fruits could be directly compared with one another, and choices from pairs of fruits were based on their relative features as well as absolute sizes. Some birds assessed fruits by brief manipulation in the beak before making a choice. Selection corresponded more closely to the prospective estimates of fruit profitability than to that actually realized when fruits were eaten, probably because of huge variation in the behavioural costs of handling (i.e. handling time and the probability of dropping fruits). We suggest that patterns of food variability can impose strong constraints on food selection mechanisms.

TI MALE TERRITORIALITY, FIGHTING AND ASSESSMENT OF FIGHTING ABILITY IN THE
   AUSTRALIAN FROG UPEROLEIA-RUGOSA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of Uperoleia rugosa form aggregations around the breeding pond. Within the aggregations, each calling male maintains an exclusive zone in which it does not tolerate another calling male. However, attacks on silent intruders, satellite males or females were never observed. Territorial males warned calling intruders by changing from advertisement calls to encounter calls (a display); if the intruder persisted in calling the resident would either attack or retreat and call elsewhere.  Fights were usually won by the heavier males, and males of similar weight were more likely to fight, whereas males retreated from opponents that were substantially heavier. Calling was energetically costly and territorial males lost weight and thus their fighting abilities declined, whereas silent satellite males gained weight and were able to oust lighter territorial males. There was thus a dynamic interchange between territorial and satellite males depending on their relative weights. The  playback of recorded advertisement calls showed that males can assess each others'' fighting abilities on the basis of their vocalizations. Males retreated from a loudspeaker broadcasting the calls of a larger male but they attacked the loudspeaker if the calls of smaller or similar sized males were played (N = 39, P < 0.01, one-tailed binomial test). Dominant frequency was probably the call parameter used in assessment as it was correlated with the weight (r = -0.71, P < 0.001, N = 100) and  hence the fighting ability of the caller, but this hypothesis needs further testing.

TI NEPOTISM IN PRAIRIE DOGS (CYNOMYS-LUDOVICIANUS) VARIES WITH COMPETITION
   BUT NOT WITH KINSHIP
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behavioural interactions among black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) of the same sex clearly show nepotism (the favouring of kin). Males and females consistently interact more amicably with kin than with non-kin. Nepotism in this context is striking for 2 reasons. First, individuals do not interact more amicably with close kin such as offspring and full-siblings than with more distant kin such as half-siblings, full-nieces, half-nieces, and half-nephews. Second, nepotism varies  inversely and dramatically with changes in competition for either oestrous females (among males) or nesting burrows and breeding rights (among females).

TI A COMPARATIVE-STUDY OF STATUS SIGNALING IN SPARROWS (GENUS ZONOTRICHIA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In three tests of status signalling predictions, Harris'' sparrows (Zonotrichia querula) were shown to support ''status signalling'' theory when compared to groups of monomorphic white-crowned sparrows (Z. leucophrys). However, within Harris'' sparrow groups, extreme age-related variation in plumage might explain the results, rather than small degrees of plumage differences used to signal specific dominance ranks. Further tests indicated that plumage variability may be important for increased individual recognition in all groups of Harris'' sparrows, including groups of adults in alternative plumage, but not in groups of white-crowned sparrows. Finally, comparisons with a third congeneric species, the white-throated sparrow (Z. albicollis), supported previous findings because this species behaved as if plumage variability was important in individual recognition, but not in status, or even age signalling. I suggest that signals functioning in individual recognition are present in both Harris'' and white-throated sparrows, and that signals functioning in age-class recognition are present in Harris'' and white-crowned sparrows.

TI INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR IN DOGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior towards other dogs and people was recorded for 102 dogs of four breeds and six crosses. The variation between dogs could be described by the first two principal components, which we have labeled ''confidence'' and ''aggression-dominance''. Descriptions based on these two dimensions closely correspond to the descriptions of four social displays in wolves. The two principal components help in the interpretation of these displays. The agonistic behavior of dogs changes with maturity and also with the nature of the dog with which they are confronted.

TI EVOLUTION OF MONOGAMY IN SEASIDE SPARROWS, AMMODRAMUS-MARITIMUS - TESTS
   OF HYPOTHESES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Seaside sparrows (A. maritimus) are monogamous throughout their range. Male-removal experiments, measurements of territory quality and nest placement in relation to territory boundaries, and observations on foraging behavior and on intraspecific aggression were used to assess the applicability of pertinent hypotheses that could explain the occurrence of monogamy in this species. Since experimentally widowed females can rear .apprx. 2/3 as many young to independence as pairs, male help is advantageous but not necessary for female reproductie success. Female-female aggression is probably not important in maintaining monogamy. Experimental bigamy was induced in seaside sparrows in New York [USA], thus showing that males will accept 2nd mates. Territory quality (suitable cover, nest-sites and food) is very heterogeneous in the sparrow populations. However, ''polygyny thresholds'' evidently are not exceeded either because resources on salt marshes are not limiting (cover,  nest-sites) or because females can nullify the effects of resource (food) disparity between territories by feeding at distant sites outside their mates'' territories.

TI SIGNALS OF STATUS IN WINTERING WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS,
   ZONOTRICHIA-LEUCOPHRYS-GAMBELII
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The possibility of plumage status signaling within the social systems of wintering birds has been a controversial issue. The reality of such signaling is demonstrated conclusively for the 1st time. Data from 8 groups of captive white-crowned sparrows (Z. l. gambelii), each with 8-11 different individuals, show that immature and adult females with crowns painted to resemble more brightly colored, dominant adult males consistently win encounters with control birds of their own age and sex.  Signals that correlate with age (adult vs. immature) and sex (adult male vs. adult female) are used by the birds as reliable indicators of relative dominance position. This demonstration of status signaling draws attention to the need to explain how such a system can be evolutionarily stable; some suitable models are discussed.

AB Selected results of a longitudinal field study and of complementary laboratory work on the social system of Papio hamadryas are summarized. Social structure in the study area comprises 4 nested levels: families, clans, bands and troops. The mechanisms maintaining the long-term pair bonds in families were investigated experimentally and include male herding and an inhibition of male rivals. The stages of male careers in relation to harem formation are described. Male kin remain in stable clans for life, whereas females are transferred. Laboratory work demonstrated stages of social relationships pervading the formation of groups regardless of their composition. Field evidence indicated that hamadryas bands communicate about the direction of the watering place to be visited that day.

TI SPECIES-UNIVERSAL MICROSTRUCTURE IN THE LEARNED SONG OF THE SWAMP
   SPARROW (MELOSPIZA-GEORGIANA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A swamp sparrow song is a 2-s string of .apprx. 10 identical syllables, each made up of 2-5 distinct notes. Naturally-occurring syllables are highly polymorphic. The development of syllable patterning is strongly influenced by imitation. Analysis of 452 songs indicates that, whether simple or complex, all syllables were assembled from the same species-universal set of note types, consisting of 6 basic categories. Two populations studied intensively, 1000 km apart, differed in the number of notes per syllable and the ordering of note types within a syllable. It appears that song dialects can be defined in the swamp sparrow by reference to these features. The process of song learning in the swamp sparrow consists of the selection of a particular number, timing and sequence of notes from a limited set of types. While some degree of selection of within-type note variants is possible, the structure of the major categories of swamp sparrow note types is in large degree genetically preordained.

TI THE EFFECTS OF HABITAT ON THE VIGILANCE OF SHOREBIRDS - IS VISIBILITY
   IMPORTANT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of reduced visibility caused by objects adjacent to the prey are studied in 2 spp. of shorebird. A reduction in visibility causes an increase in the level of vigilance, indicating an increase in vulnerability despite the greater degree of camouflaging. This increase is due to individuals being less able to see both approaching predators and their neighbors. Turnstones, Arenaria interpres, and purple sandpipers, Calidris maritima, show very similar increases in the level of vigilance with decreasing visibility, but achieve these increases by different means: turnstones lengthen the duration of each vigilant scan, while purple sandpipers scan more often. Increasing scanning rate produces a shortened interval between scans, which reduces the risk of being caught unawares by an approaching predator. It may also reduce feeding efficiency, and this might be more serious in turnstones due to greater handling times for food items, so causing them to adopt a different  strategy to increase vigilance.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Counter-marking in mice, Mus musculus was investigated by analyzing urine deposition on filter paper marked asymmetrically with urine of the opposite sex. Intact males deposited large numbers of urine spots with a marked angular bias towards previously marked quadrants. More spots were deposited on proestrous and ovariectomized donor urine patterns, their distribution being more centrifugal on estrous urine and more centripetal in quadrants containing a large female urine spot in a central position. In contrast, castrated male mice deposited very few spots with no angular bias. Female urine patterns showed angular bias in response to intact, but not castrated male donor urine, a larger number of spots being produced by estrous females. Thus, the pattern of deposition offers scope for 2-way communication of information about reproductive potential.

TI VARIATION IN THE SONG OF THE GREAT REED WARBLER
   ACROCEPHALUS-ARUNDINACEUS IN RELATION TO MATE ATTRACTION AND TERRITORIAL
   DEFENSE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Variation in the song structure of the great reed warbler A. arundinaceus was investigated using a variety of observational, analytical and experimental techniques. Males have 2 types of song, long and short songs. Short songs consisted of relatively few, stereotyped, low-amplitude syllables and were given by males during territorial encounters with rival males. Males were more reluctant to approach during playback of short songs and when lured in by long songs retreated when playback was switched to short songs. Long songs consisted of a wide variety of high-amplitude elements added to the basic short song structure. Long songs were only given spontaneously by unpaired males and ceased when a female had been attracted. In Acrocephalus warblers, monogamous species have evolved long, complex and variable songs for mate attraction largely through intersexual selection. Polygynous species have evolved short, simple and stereotyped songs for territorial defense through intrasexual  selection. The great reed warbler is a partial polygynist, and through evolutionary compromise has evolved a variable song structure which can be shortened for territorial defense and lengthened for mate attraction.

AB Ocelli on the dorsal plumage of P. malacense (Aves: Phasianidae) are arranged around the real eye only during displays to females, not to other males; those nearest the eye are the better mimics. Ways in which the ocelli resemble the real eye include color, convexity, iridescence, roundness and concentricity. They also track the female as the male shifts position. In this genus there has been concomitant radiation of iris and ocellus color. The general importance of the eye in galliform displays is discussed.

TI MALE-FEMALE INTERACTIONS IN PRAIRIE VOLES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Dyadic encounters between virgin female prairie voles (M. ochrogaster) and males with various reproductive histories were analysed using observational techniques and sequential analysis. Unfamiliar, sexually inexperienced males interacted in a manner that would permit physical contact, pheromone transfer and the subsequent induction of female sexual behavior. Low levels of olfactory investigation were seen among sibling males and females, which may account for the failure of such pairs to reproduce. Agonistic encounters were common between females and unfamiliar, sexually experienced males, suggesting that fighting could also provide a behavior barrier to reproduction.

LA English
DT Article
AB A previous study reported that individual females of the pipevine swallowtail butterfly, B. philenor, exhibit different search modes when searching for host plants on which to oviposit. An alternative explanation for the results of that study exists: apparent differences in searching behavior may simply represent differences in the composition of the vegetation over which females fly. The results from the present study rule out this alternative explanation and indicate that apparent differences in search mode reflect underlying differences among females in response to leaf shape.

TI KIN RECOGNITION IN WHITE-FOOTED DEERMICE (PEROMYSCUS-LEUCOPUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The degree of relatedness between individuals can influence subsequent social behavior. P. leucopus populations may consist, in part, of related individuals. Kin recognition could benefit individuals in establishing sub-populations and inbreeding avoidance. White-footed deermice were tested in pairs according to one of the following categories: littermate sibling, cagemate (ls-c), littermate sibling, non-cagemate (ls-nc), non-littermate sibling, none-cagemate (nls-nc), non-sibling, cagemate (ns-c) and non-sibling, non-cagemate (ns-nc). Differences between nls-nc and ns-nc encounters indicate kin recognition that cannot be due to prior contact. Both sexes investigated related to strangers (nls-nc) of the opposite sex more than unrelated strangers (ns-nc). Males avoided related stranger males and chased unrelated stranger males. Females warded unrelated strangers longest. This is the 1st study to demonstrate kin recognition that is not based on prior contact in a small rodent.

TI BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES TO VISUAL-STIMULI BY THE SNAIL LITTORINA-IRRORATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The visual capabilities of gastropod mollusks and most other invertebrates possessing structurally simple eyes are poorly known. Vision in untrained marsh periwinkles (L. irrorata) was studied in the laboratory, using oriented movements towards test shapes as the response measure. This intertidal species is active when exposed at low tide, both during the day and at night, and it travels vertically on plant stems with a tidal rhythm. In detection tests, the estimated response threshold for a single vertical bar was 0.9.degree., while the response threshold for an equal-size horizontal bar was 2.4.degree. or 3.7.degree., depending on bar position. Snails detected a 5.degree.-wide bar in 4.3 1.times. of light and a 40.degree.-wide square having about 95% reflectance (off-white) on a white (100% nominal reflectance) background in 2800 1.times.. Discrimination tests revealed a strong preference for vertical bars over both diagonal and horizontal bars of the same width, but no preferences in several other situations. Various factors suggest that L. irrorata may see better than most other gastropods.

TI PRE-COPULATORY BEHAVIOR IN THE MALE MONGOLIAN GERBIL .2. EFFECTS OF
   POST-CASTRATION SEXUAL AND AGGRESSIVE INTERACTIONS ON RESPONSIVENESS TO
   ANDROGEN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of post-castration interactions with estrous females on the responsiveness of pre-copulatory patterns to androgens were examined in male Mongolian gerbils. Males that were (EXP group) or were not (NONEXP group) allowed post-castration experience with females were compared. Following castration, male aggressive and female defensive patterns increased significantly in the EXP group; fighting between the pairs also increased. Androgen treatment reduced both fighting and the defensive patterns of test females to pre-castration levels, and induced male pre-copulatory behavior similar to that of the NONEXP group. Restoration of pre-copulatory behavior in the EXP group to levels shown by the NONEXP group requied longer treatment, syggesting that post-castration experience of aggressive interactions decreases the effectiveness of androgen.

TI SOCIAL SPACING IN THE MORMYRID FISH GNATHONEMUS-PETERSII (PISCES) - A
   MULTISENSORY APPROACH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sensory basis of group cohesion in the weak-eletric fish G. petersii was investigated in a circular tank with groups of 4 fish each, interacting through a wide-meshed plastic screen with intact or operated conspecifics, or with other stimulus objects. These stimuli were confined to 1 or 2 peripheral holding compartments. The response measures were obtained from the free swimming fish and included the time the fish spent together as a group, the time they spent in front of the holding compartments, the circular distribution of the fish''s positions, and the mean nearest neighbor distances. Under empty compartment conditions, 4 different groups were tested, consisting of either intact, electrically active fish, or electrically silent fish (with their electric organ surgically rendered inoperative), or blind, or silent and blind animals. The loss of either sensory modality, vision or feedback from electric organ discharge, led to changes of comparable size, decreasing the time spent as a group and increasing the mean nearest neighbor distance. In fish lacking both modalities, group cohesion was further impaired. With stimuli present in one or both holding compartments, the strength of social attraction depended on the nature of the stimulus: the more intact stimulus conspecifics were present, the more densely did the fish group in front of the stimulus compartment. Wired-in electric organ discharges (simulating waveform and intensity) and electrically silent fish were equally attractive, but only half as attractive as intact fish. Blind, free-swimming fish aggregated with intact and also with silent conspecifics. Under dim light conditions, group cohesion was predominantly, though not exclusively, affected by electrosensory feedback from the electric organ discharge and visual input. Mechanical and olfactory cues may also be involved.

TI THE PECK ORDERS OF CHICKENS - HOW DO THEY DEVELOP AND WHY ARE THEY
   LINEAR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of peck orders in mixed sex groups of domestic chickens was observed to determine how linearity occurred. Based on threats, head-pecks and submission, dominance relationships emerged in a virtual peck right form. Leaping by males did not closely conform to dominance relationships. There were no rank reversals in 50% of male-male and 80% of female-female relationships, and only single changes occurred in most of the others. These resulted from the movements of individuals up the hierarchy rather than from any general reorganization of relationships. Reversals did not necessarily occur between rank neighbors, and stable triangles were sometimes introduced. The initial status of males and females depended upon the age at which they first showed aggression, while the final, stable status of males depended upon the age at which they were first submitted to. Sexual maturity of the males produced a number of changes, with earlier-maturing birds tending to rise in status above their later-maturing campanions. Linear hierarchies thus appear to result from birds developing at different rates.

TI GROUP-SIZE AND ANTI-PREDATOR STRATEGIES IN A MARINE INSECT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Predator avoidance is a primary function of the flotillas of the marine insect H. robustus (Hemiptera: Heteroptera, Gerridae). With fish predators whose approach is unseen by the insects, Halobates that live in groups acquire a double protection: a lower probability of attack, as a result of a simple dilution effect, and a higher probability of escape if attacked. With visible predators, such as surface-feeding fish and birds, this protection is augmented by predator-induced avoidance behavior, the nature of which is related to the size of the group. In large groups, the highly aroused individuals respond quickly during a predator''s approach and do not disperse, but maintain a high level of confusion behavior within the aggregation. In small groups, the individuals are not highly aroused and respond only when the predator approaches very closely, whereupon they rapidly and synchronously disperse. Predator avoidance behavior is postulated to result from a balance between the advantages of suppressing conspicious escape movements until the last moment (the small group strategy) and the advantages of early warning and conspicuous confusion behavior (the large group strategy).

TI FORAGING SUCCESS IN JUNCO FLOCKS AND THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL HIERARCHY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relative advantages of flocking for socially dominant and subordinate dark-eyed juncos (J. hyemalis) were investigated in a laboratory experiment. Success in finding seeds hidden in an artificial tree was determined for all individuals hunting alone. When hunting alone, birds who spread their searching more evenly over the habitat had a greater chance of finding the food source. Flocks of 4 were housed together and subsequently each flock formed a dominance hierarchy social structure. High-ranking individuals obtained more seeds when in flocks than when hunting as isolates. In numbers of seeds obtained, socially low-ranking birds gained no advantage in comparison to their performance as isolates. In this experiment, the primary advantage of flocking for low-ranking individuals was the reduced chance of obtaining no food at all.

TI RESPONSES OF YOUNG BLACK SKIMMERS TO HIGH-INTENSITY DISTRESS NOTES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The semi-precocial young of the black skimmer (R. niger) rely on cryptic behavior to avoid detection by predators. After capture most individuals emit loud distress calls, and chicks crouched nearby often run just seconds after these calls begin. Experimental distress calls significantly increase the likelihood of running, regardless of whether a sibling or non-sibling call is used. Since chicks in close proximity are usually siblings, such distress notes could evolve through kin selection, even if disadvantageous to the caller. Such calls may startle and distract a predator, providing the captive with an opportunity to escape.

TI AGGRESSION OF BREEDING EASTERN BLUEBIRDS (SIALIA-SIALIS) TOWARD THEIR
   MATES AND MODELS OF INTRASPECIFIC AND INTERSPECIFIC INTRUDERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hypotheses regarding the evolution of aggressive patterns during the breeding season in eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) were tested by placing models of eastern bluebirds and house sparrows (Passer domesticus) into territories of experimentally-naive breeding pairs of eastern bluebirds during 3 stages of the nesting cycle. The responses of the resident males to models of male bluebirds decreased from the egg-laying to the nestling stage, and this response pattern can be interpreted as support for the protection-of-parentage hypothesis or the nest-site-defense hypothesis. The aggression of resident males to resident females during trials with models of male bluebirds weakly conforms to the pattern predicted by theprotection-of-parentage hypothesis. The aggressive response to models of house sparrows also decreased from the egg-laying to the nestling phase in a manner consistent with the nest-site-defense explanation. No aggression toward mates by males or females was observed during trials with house sparrow models, an observation consistent with the predictions of the protection-of-parentage hypothesis.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The reproductive behavior of the blue gourami, T. trichopterus, was examined in 15 bisexual pairs and 22 trios maintained in 75-l aquaria for 23 days. During this time, 74 spawning episodes occurred among 26 different pairs and trios. Of these spawnings, 69 were directly observed. Both males and females were capable of mating repeatedly with the same or different partners with as little as 20-24 h separating successive spawnings. Females often mated with 2 males in the same afternoon, while only 1 male succeeded in mating with 2 females in 1 day. Blue gouramis probably do not form pair bonds. Both sexes will mate with different partners when the physical environment permits 2 or more males to maintain territories in the same aquarium.

TI SPECIES SONG DISCRIMINATION IN ADULT FEMALE SONG AND SWAMP SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six female song sparrows (M. melodia) and 6 female swamp sparrows (M. georgiana) were treated with estradiol, and their response to song measured by frequency and intensity of copulation-solicitation display. Test stimuli were synthetic songs composed of either song sparrow or swamp sparrow syllables assembled in either song-sparrow-like or swamp-sparrow-like temporal patterns. Female song sparrows responded preferentially to songs containing their own species'' syllables or temporal patterns. Female swamp sparrows were also sensitive to both syllable type and temporal pattern, in contrast to male swamp sparrows, which show no preference in temporal patterns.

TI LARVAL DISPERSAL AND CANNIBALISM IN A NATURAL-POPULATION OF
   ZOPHOBAS-ATRATUS (COLEOPTERA, TENEBRIONIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A natural population of the tenebrionid beetle, Z. atratus, was studied in an attic in El Zamorano, Honduras. Larvae were living in bat guano and were densest in the deepest part of the guano. No pupae or pharate pupae were found in the guano; they were always located a small distance away from the guano pile. Adults occurred on the guano surface and the beams and tiles of the roof. When larvae of 3 different ages and weights were marked and released in the guano, only the older, larger larvae were recaptured away from the guano, indicating a correlation between larval dispersal and increased weight and/or age. When 50 pharate pupae were exposed to a natural population of active larvae, only 4 (8%) survived after 5 days. This intense cannibalism of pharate pupae is consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of pupation by crowding and the associated pre-pupal dispersal evolved at least partly in response to cannibalism.

TI MOTHER-INFANT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG FREE-RANGING RHESUS-MONKEYS ON CAYO
   SANTIAGO - A COMPARISON WITH CAPTIVE PAIRS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The general course of mother-infant relationships among free-ranging rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) on Cayo Santiago is remarkably similar both qualitatively and quantitatively to that observed in the socially living captive colony at the MRC [Medical Research Council] Unit at Madingley, England [UK]. Small but consistent differences may be due to differences between mothers in the 2 environments rather than differences between infants. Captive mothers may be described as more protective and less encouraging of early independence in their infants than free-ranging mothers. Captive pairs have become more like free-ranging pairs over the years, perhaps as captive mothers have been allowed to raise their infants in the presence of kin. A unitary concept of environmental complexity is not useful in accounting for the results.

TI THE SOCIAL COMPONENT OF DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIPS IN RHESUS-MONKEYS
   (MACACA-MULATTA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An all-male rhesus group was added to a 2nd group, 1 animal at a time at weekly intervals, in reverse order of their dominance ranks. Significant positive correlations prevailed for the host group dominance ranks throughout the study, but the dominance ranks of the introduced males were random with respect to their original ranks. A 2nd experiment repeatedly introduced the alpha and beta males of a multi-male heterosexual group into a 2nd group where they were the lowest-ranking animals. On each return they reclaimed alpha and beta positions. When the alpha and beta males of the 2nd group were introduced to the 1st group, they became the lowest-ranking animals in the group. Reversal of the direction of introduction again demonstrated that relative ranks were dependent on the social context.

TI BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES DURING INTERMALE AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS IN A
   COCKROACH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Intermale interactions of the American cockroach, P. americana, were analyzed to determine what behavioral strategies individuals employ. Longer interactions have a greater tendency to contain escalated (dangerous) acts. The nature of the initial dyad (act of the initiator and response of the other individual) of an interaction changes with the length of the interaction, although there is a considerable overlap between the ways in which interactions of different lengths begin. Interaction lengths are non-randomly distributed, with an excess of long and short interactions and a deficiency of interactions of intermediate length. In short interactions, the initiator is the probable winner; in intermediate length interactions the initiator and non-initiator win equally often; and in long interactions the non-initiator is the probable winner. Being the 1st individual to escalate a fight confers an advantage only in very short interactions.

AB Experimental manipulation of breeding site quality did not alter the mate preference of female mottled sculpins (C. bairdi). Females of this species may choose mates based on male size. By choosing a larger male, a female increases the probability that some of her eggs will hatch because large males are unlikely to abandon their nest sites.

TI SEASONAL VARIABILITY IN SPATIAL DEFENSE BY FREE-RANGING RHESUS-MONKEYS
   (MACACA-MULATTA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Data on the rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) of Cayo Santiago [Puerto Rico, USA] demonstrate both intergroup and seasonal variability in spatial defense. Of the 5 groups only 1 defends an area, and only during the birth season. The 4 non-defensive groups share 2 feeding stations and live in such close proximity that spatial defense would require high outputs of energy. The group that maintains an exclusive area has its own feeding station and lives in semi-isolation on an easily defensible end of the island. Its defense of this end of the island during the birth season provides a protected area for infants and assures the group exclusive access to flowering and fruiting plants. Relaxation of this defensive behavior during the mating season maximizes opportunities for intergroup matings.

TI MATING RELATIONSHIPS AND BREEDING SUPPRESSION IN THE DWARF MONGOOSE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Dwarf mongooses live in packs containing a dominant breeding pair. The .alpha. female produces litters at regular intervals, usually 3 times/yr. Other sexually mature females come into estrus in synchrony with the alpha female and occasionally become pregnant but may not raise their offspring. Some females which had not been visibly pregnant nursed the young of other females. Early in the alpha female''s estrous cycle, the .alpha. male maintains proximity and copulates with her exclusively, attaching any other adult males which approach. Later he also copualtes with other adult females and the beta male mates with the .alpha. female. The .alpha. pair are probably the parents of the great majority of young born in the pack.

TI EFFECTS OF FOOD-DEPRIVATION ON FIGHTING BEHAVIOR IN STANDARD OPPONENT
   TESTS BY MALE AND FEMALE TO STRAIN ALBINO MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male and female ''TO'' strain albino mice (48 of each) were used to study the effects of withholding food on fighting behavior in standard opponent tests (rank-related fighting). Thirty-six hours (but not 12 or 24 h) of food deprivation produced marked deficits in the fighting evidenced by male mice in these tests. These results, taken in conjunction with an earlier finding that food deprivation causes a marked increase in the incidence of locust-killing behavior in laboratory mice, provides further evidence that one form of interspecific aggression (locust killing by mice) and one form of intraspecific fighting have different motivations. They may have little in common.

TI SIMULTANEOUS PARTIAL-REINFORCEMENT EFFECT AND REVERSED
   PARTIAL-REINFORCEMENT EFFECT IN RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hungry rats were trained on a 2-choice discrimination task in a free responding situation in a Skinner box. One stimulus light and lever was associated with 100%, the other with 50%, food reinforcement, and the 2 stimuli alternated every 30 s. In extinction the rats made more responses in the presence of the 100% stimulus, but made more responses on the 50% lever. The rate of responding declined over the 7 days of extinction, but the percentage correct, after an initial drop, remained constant. These, and earlier results using similar paradigms, are interpreted in terms of Capaldi''s (1966) theory of the partial reinforcement extinction effect.

AB Orienting responses by mink aerial and underwater visual discrimination tests were most frequent when the grating lines subtended angles at the eye near the visual threshold angle. Factorial analysis showed that in air and in water at ranges from 10-90 cm most responses occurred at 30 cm discrimination distance and more occurred to marginally supra-threshold than to marginally sub-threshold stimuli. Between media, more responses occurred in air than in water. At longer ranges the mink oriented less readily than at 30 cm but if orienting occurred better discrimination followed than if the mink did not orient.

TI MATERNAL VOCALIZATIONS OF MALLARD DUCKS (ANAS-PLATYRHYNCHOS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB While incubating, brooding and calling their young out of the nest, female mallard ducks (A. platyhynchos) utter a species-typical maternal vocalization that their young find highly attractive. To determine the characteristic acoustic features of these calls, the vocalizations of 7 hens in the field were recorded. The pre-exodus and nest exodus calls of these hens were similar with respect to frequency modulation, presence of a low-frequency impulsive sound, note duration and repetition rate. The exodus call differs from the pre-exodus call in having more notes per burst and more harmonics, with a corresponding upward shift in dominant frequency. Repetition rate and frequency modulation may be the critical acoustic features of the auditory basis of species identification in mallard ducklings.

   SEASONAL-VARIATION IN RESPONSE INTENSITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB From theories of the functions of territorial possession and consideration of causal mechanisms of behavior, predictions are derived about the pattern of change in territorial defence behavior by male songbirds. These predictions are tested with data from playback experiments to red-eyed and Philadelphia vireos (Vireo olivaceus and V. philadelphicus), species that are intraspecifically and interspecifically territorial. The analyses indicate that the pattern of response-intensity change of Philadelphia vireos is more closely related to resource assurance functions of territorial possession than is the pattern of change of red-eyed vireo behavior. These and other differences between the species in patterns of change of response intensity are related to differences in the life histories of the vireos and are discussed in light of the hypothesis that the Philadelphia vireo is a social mimic of the red-eyed vireo. A new multivariate method of response intensity quantification is presented and discussed.

AB Winter social behavior in free-living and captive flocks of dark-eyes juncos (Junco hyemalis) was studied. Visual and vocal signals used by flocked juncos were analyzed structurally and functionally. The frequency and form of agonistic behavior in several social and environmental contexts was examined in an attempt to provide insight into the relationship between junco communication and social organization. A system of classification of signals, based upon the meaning of cues to the signaller, is proposed. Evidence is given to suggest that the behavior of subordinate, rather than of dominant, individuals controls the operation of the social system in junco flocks. Some ecological implications of junco social behavior are discussed.

AB The maternal and paternal behaviors of O. torridus and P. leucopus in laboratory cages were observed daily. In both species, the females spent more time in the nest area with the young and groomed the young more frequently than their male partners, but the males played a surprisingly active role in nest attendance. Paternal nest attendance was more frequent in O. torridus males than in P. leucopus males. Onychomys males were also active in grooming the young than Peromyscus males. These species-specific patterns of parental care are discussed in relation to the behavioral and ecological characteristics of Onychomys and Peromyscus.

TI LABORATORY DETERMINATION OF STARTLE REACTION-TIME OF STARLING
   (STURNUS-VULGARIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Startle response times of starlings (S. vulgaris) to auditory and visual stimuli were determined in the laboratory. Birds were placed in an anechoic chamber and exposed to either a 1 ms flash of unfiltered white light, or a 30 ms pure tone burst. An electronic detection system monitored and recorded the activity of the birds. The recording apparatus allowed for an accuracy to 10-4 s in measuring reaction times. The mean reaction time of birds to light stimuli was 76.38 ms. The mean reaction time to sound stimuli was 80.64 ms.

TI SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR IN ZEBRA FINCH TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA - RESPONSE TO
   FAMILIAR AND NOVEL PARTNERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB On their introduction to a novel female, unpaired male zebra finches showed initial courtship, followed by a phase of nest soliciting. Pairing the partners changed the balance between these activities, speeding the transition from courtship to nest soliciting. This experience with the partner involved both the formation of a pair-bond, and changes in her familiarity, and it was the latter which was most important; hormonal changes were probably not involved. The behavior is compared with that of doves and pigeons, and the possible role of aggression in the causation of courtship is discussed.

TI MAMMALIAN SOCIAL-SYSTEMS - STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mammalian societies are complex socio-ecological systems controlled by the interactions of numerous internal constraints and external factors. A simple model is presented which describes these systems functionally in terms of the adaptive behavioral strategies for resource exploitation, predation avoidance and mating and rearing of young to maturity shown by the individuals that comprise them. The relations between species-specific limitations on the range of potential individual social behavior and the environmental variables to which the system is responsive are analyzed and hypotheses from correlational and analytical field studies examined. The continued development of sophisticated systems-analytical approaches to societal analysis is advocated, taking into account the contrasting informational provenance of factors of different types. This is preferred to either an over-emphasis on environmental determination of excessively formalized neo-darwinian modelling based on assumptions from genetics and selection theory alone.

TI COMB BUILDING BY ORIENTAL HORNET (VESPA-ORIENTALIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Oriental hornet young queens and workers were induced to build combs in observation boxes. Both workers and queens displayed building activity over a period of 2-6 wk, which is approximately the time range necessary for the development of one generation (from egg to pupa or maximally from egg to imago). Building activity and the comb architecture was influenced by such factors as: size of group, age of hornets, amputation of wings, tarsi and tips of antennae and light, and by feeding with mannose and barbiturates. Cell size is influenced by various drugs.

TI LEARNING AND IMITATION AS A FUNCTION OF SOCIAL-STATUS IN MACAQUE MONKEYS
   (MACACA-NEMESTRINA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Learning and imitation were examined in animals selected from 2 groups of 16 pigtail monkeys. There were significant differences in performance on a cued-alternation task as a function of both social status within the stable group, and prior exposure to a social model. High status animals were more responsive, but were less successful in acquiring appropriate response delay. Exposure to the model improved response latencies and acquisition of response delay for all subjects. Model exposure did not improve alternation performance. Results are discussed in terms of prior social experience of the subjects, general learning strategies and differential sensitivity to multiple reinforcement contingencies. Findings are related to ethological concepts of imitation, and field reports on primate social learning.

AB Quantitative measurements of feather posture were made over a range of ambient temperature in deprived and non-deprived birds. Barbary doves raise their feathers when cold and sleek them when hot. The ambient temperature at which the feathers were fully raised was higher in birds deprived of food or water. No differences between body regions were observed in response to temperature, but in defensive and aggressive behavior there were marked and characteristic differences.

TI AVOIDANCE OF ELECTRIC SHOCK BY COCKROACH PERIPLANETA AMERICANA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The experimental method used was to suspend the animal, ventral surface downwards, over water so that it received shocks unless the leg was held above the surface. Despite the fatigue involved, Horridge''s demonstration of learning by cockroaches based on leg position, evaluated against results for animals receiving non-contingent shocks, was confirmed. Confirmation was also obtained that animals that have received a period of non-contingent shocks were subsequently unable to learn when shocks were made contingent to responses. In a study of shock currents varying from 20 to 60uA in 20-uA steps, learning deteriorated approximately linearly with increasing shock intensity. Relevant neurophysiological findings of Hoyle are discussed and a prediction that animals should learn equally well to adopt the opposite leg position from that used in the 1st experiment was found to hold true.

TI SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR OF MALE RATS UNMATED TO 16 MONTHS OF AGE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sixteen albino male rats unmated to 16 mo. of age and mated between 16 and 20 mo., were examined for fertility and given 7 15-min. copulation tests during the latter period. Control males were mated from puberty. At 20 mo. the males were killed and their accessory reproductive organs weighed. Only 1 unmated male failed to father a litter; there was no significant difference between the ability of unmated and mated males to impregnate females. Nevertheless, the sexual activity of the unmated group was significantly inferior to that of the control males. At 16 mo., the unmated males showed hardly any sexual activity; gradually their activity increased and at 19 mo. it reached a level not significantly inferior to that of the control group. At 20 mo., of 6 accessory reproductive organs examined, only the penis of the unmated males was significantly smaller. In male rats aged 16 mo. or more, continuous heterosexual contact is needed to maintain a maximal potential for sexual behavior.

This was not due to position habits being broken down more readily when more stimuli were used. An explanation in terms of the negative stimulus being less averslve for the group having fewer negative stimuli is offered.

TI CATNIP AND OESTROUS BEHAVIOUR IN CAT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This research evaluated Todd''s (1963) suggestion that catnip elicits an aspect of oestrous behavior. A series of experiments revealed that: the catnip reaction consists primarily of a unique combination of body rolling and face rubbing; the reaction is independent of sex or presence of gonads; catnip does not result in an increase in killing, fighting or sexual mounting when cats are paired with live rats or a stuffed object approximately cat size; reacting cats show an increase in attention being similar to that shown to males by oestrous females, and that the most striking aspect of the behavior of oestrous cats is a unique rolling pattern which is very similar in its display of components to the catnip rolling.

TI HUNGER THIRST AND DISPLACEMENT PECKING IN BARBARY DOVE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Barbary doves (Strep-topelia risoria) frustrated in drinking behavior by physical obstruction, experimentally induced avoidance, or by removal of the water from the water bowl, were found to spend about 20% of the subsequent 5 min. pecking at small objects on the ground. The evidence obtained, from a series of experiments, for the view that this pecking belongs to the feeding system, is as follows: the total time pecking is increased by the presence of grain; the time spent pecking is partly replaced by time spent at a specific food getting activity, when birds have previously been trained to obtain food in this way; food deprivation prior to the test increases the time spent pecking when grain is present, and this effect is counteracted by allowing the birds to feed just before the test; the time spent pecking when birds are physically obstructed in courtship is increased by food deprivation and is decreased by allowing deprived birds to feed just before the test; birds obstructed in courtship spend more time pecking if they have a thirst induced food deficit.

TI A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIOUR OF AFRICAN CICHLID FISH
   PELMATOCHROMIS GUENTHERI (SAUVAGE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior of this west African species is described throughout its life cycle. Fifteen individuals and their progeny were observed. The following are specifically discussed non-territorial and territorial periods, courtship and pair formation, spawning, and the parental period. The latter deals with adult activities during the period of incubation (only the male orally incubates the eggs), the free swimming phase of the young, and the parental color patterns during this latter phase. The chronological appearance of certain behavior responses and their associated color markings in the young are discussed. Finally, a behavioral and morphological comparison is made between substrate brooding, and presently known oral-brooding cichlids. The results show that single dimensional changes in specific characters give little insight into the evolution of oral incubation and, that, it is perhaps better to use the concept of "grades" (units of biological improvement characterizing certain adaptive levels) when dealing with the evolution of this process.

TI AUDITORY CAPACITIES IN FISHES - THRESHOLD VARIABILITY IN BLUE-STRIPED
   GRUNT HAEMULON SCIURUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Auditory thresholds in the blue-striped grunt, Haemulon sciurus (Pisces, Family Pomadasyidae) were determined by the use of avoidance conditioning. A total of 421 threshold determinations on 23 subjects showed both intra- and inter-individual variability. The thresholds from 50 cps to 200 cps averaged about 20 db below one microbar, and from 300 cps the threshold curve rose along an exponential curve to a maximum of 39 db above one microbar at 1,000 cps. The accuracy of the obtained thresholds was about [plus or minus] 2.5 db taking both equipment and testing errors into account. Repeated tests of the same animals at the same frequencies resulted in progressively lower thresholds, and 3 successive tests were generally required to determine the lowest threshold. This variation was greatest at frequencies below 300 cps. Individual differences in auditory sensitivity among the several animals were distinct, with variations over 10 db at some frequencies. These individual differences were most apparent at frequencies below 300 cps. The latency of response to the signal rose as the threshold was approached, but the frequency of inter-trial crossings decreased significantly. The testing method was based on the "staircase" technique, and both 2 db and 5 db steps were used. No significant difference in threshold was observed for the 2 step sizes.

TI PROBING RESPONSE OF STOMOXYS CALCITRANS (L) ) STABLE FLY ) TO VAPOURS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Probing was clearly distinguished from proboscis extension alone and from the biting response. Vapor above 0.16% ammonia solution stimulated probing in over half the flies tested in small air chambers 24 hr. after satiation on blood. Water vapor also stimulated some probing. Feeding on blood or on high concentrations of sucrose solution immediately raised the probing threshold. Lower, but still readily acceptable sucrose concentrations although inbibed in as large or larger volumes than a 2.0 [image] sucrose solution did not appreciably effect the probing threshold. There was a gradual fall in the threshold in the 25 to 30 hr. period following feeding. The threshold was at a similar low level 24 hr. after feeding on either blood or 0.5 [image] sucrose solution. The probing response was not effected by 24 hr. rhythms of behavior. Day to day fluctuations in probing threshold of a population of flies did not appear to be of a cyclic nature. The response to ammonia vapor was not effected by antennal removal, but tarsal lacquering caused a fall in response in both antennae-less and normal flies. In a short series of other compounds tested the vapor of n-propylamine and several of the lower fatty acids approached ammonia in stimulating effect.

TI RESPONSE OF ISOPODS TOWARDS TEMPERATURE HUMIDITY + LIGHT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The isopods Armadillidium vulgare, Latr., and Venezillo arizonicus, Mulaik and Mulaik, were found respectively in mesic and xeric habitats in southern Arizona. The response to light and humidity was studied in a choice-chamber apparatus and the response to temperature in a thermopreferendum apparatus. The reaction was analyzed by the following criteria: excess time spent in one alternative, the number of shifts, residence time and speed. V. arizonicus was the only isopod found to be negatively thermo-active even at 40[degree]C. It also preferred intermediate humidities, and did not respond to the saturation deficit of the air. The normal positive photoreaction of A. vulgare changed to a negative one at high temperatures, but was not affected by humidity.

AB In group-living animals, it is important to understand how individuals perceive the quality of social relationships because it subsequently affects their decision-making during social interactions. One way to assess how individuals perceive the quality of social relationships is to examine contexts and social factors affecting individuals' stress levels. In this study, we aimed to examine the influence of individuals in proximity (within 1 m) on stress levels during resting and foraging behaviour in wild Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, on Kinkazan Island, Japan. We collected data on self-scratching, a behavioural indicator of stress, from 11 adult females across 58 days. During rest, the frequency of self-scratching was higher in the absence of proximate individuals than in their presence. However, social relationships between the focal individual and a proximate female did not affect the frequency of self-scratching. In contrast, during foraging, there was no significant difference between the frequency of self-scratching in the absence and the presence of proximate individuals. However, the frequency of self-scratching was higher in proximity to a related female than in proximity to an unrelated female. These results suggest that stress levels due to proximity to other individuals are influenced by the focal individual's activity. Furthermore, these results indicate that foraging competition among related individuals and spatial separation from other individuals is one of the causes of stress in this species.

ID TEMPERATURE-SIZE RULE; PREDATION RISK; SELECTION; FITNESS; CYCLE
AB Knowledge of how animals use behaviour to adapt to changing environmental conditions is important for understanding how they will be impacted by climate change. Rising global temperatures are increasing the moisture-holding capacity of air, leading to greater cloud cover, which attenuates shortwave radiation, reducing the amount of radiation reaching animals on the ground. We experimentally investigated how changes in cloud cover may impact ectotherms that bask in sunshine to regulate their body temperature. We manipulated the degree of shade experienced by an annual insect, the field cricket, Gryllus campestris, under natural and seminatural conditions. Shading nymphs in large field boxes did not affect development time and had only a small negative effect on mass at maturity. To investigate whether crickets were able to compensate for increased shade through changes in their behaviour, we monitored the activity of experimentally shaded and unshaded wild cricket nymphs. Unshaded nymphs sought shade at midday, whereas shaded nymphs basked throughout the day in the most sunlit positions. Most ectotherms are profoundly affected by the energy they receive from sunlight. Our findings suggest that mobile ectotherms may be able to compensate for changes in cloud cover. However, they may incur costs due to greater exposure to threats such as predation. Understanding behavioural flexibility and the costs and benefits of different strategies is required to make accurate predictions about how terrestrial ecosystems will be impacted by changing solar insolation due to climate change.

AB Behavioural plasticity can modulate the costs and benefits of sociality and thus may play a prominent role in mediating competition and facilitation during social interactions in mixed-species groups. However, investigations of assembly patterns of mixed-species groups typically treat species' behavioural attributes as static rather than dynamic features that can change in social contexts. We investigate four axes of behavioural plasticity that may modulate interactions within mixed-species groups: (1) species' selective preference for joining certain groups, (2) species' ability to flexibly change their behaviour in response to groupmates' behaviour and (3) shifts and/or (4) flexibility of species' niche breadth resulting in either shrinking or expansion when foraging with conspecifics versus when foraging with heterospecifics. We assess variation in these axes of behavioural plasticity in an Australian mixedspecies avian community. All species had selective preferences for flocks of certain strata, and some flexibly matched their flockmates' foraging strata. Three species exhibited patterns of niche shift, and one species showed niche expansion. These findings suggest that species converge in strata in mixed-species flocks despite the potential for increased competition and emphasize that species can plastically react to changes in their social environment in numerous ways. Acknowledgment of such plasticity is likely integral to understanding the nuances of heterospecific interactions. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sound exposure studies require replicated sound treatments for the results to be representative for sound classes in general. Additionally, reused treatments in replicated designs need to be accounted for statistically. The lack hereof is referred to as simple and sacrificial pseudoreplication, respectively, and results should be interpreted accordingly. We quantified the occurrence of these issues and subsequent interpretation of results in 104 underwater sound exposure studies (2019-2023). The majority of the studies (85%) did not replicate sound treatments. From the ones that did, most did not statistically acknowledge the hierarchical structure of the data. Unreplicated treatment designs limit the generalizability of the findings. Nevertheless, only small differences were found in how the results of unreplicated and replicated treatment designs were interpreted. This commentary aims to provide guidance in the design, analysis and interpretation of sound exposure studies, which are equally valid for aquatic and terrestrial research. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Behavioural syndromes receive attention from many disciplines for their potential evolutionary significance. Personality traits and behavioural syndromes often vary among species and even within species (i.e. between sexes and populations). Whether correlations among behaviours emerge as an adaptive response or a developmental constraint, however, is still debated. As a foundation for future studies to test the adaptive versus constraint hypotheses, we investigated repeatability and covariation of aggression and boldness between two genetically distinct populations of eastern red -backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus , and between sexes in those populations. We predicted that individuals would show consistency in behavioural traits across trials (i.e. their behaviour would be repeatable) and that aggressive behaviour would be positively correlated with boldness. We also predicted that behavioural syndromes would vary between genetic groups and sexes. Salamanders were exposed to standard resident/intruder territorial trials to assess their aggressive behaviour. We then conducted a refugeemergence assay to determine boldness, which involved calculating a boldness index from latency to emerge and time spent back inside refuge after initial emergence. We found that our boldness index and two aggressive displays (all -trunk -raised and look towards) were repeatable. Further analysis indicated a positive correlation between boldness and aggressiveness, suggesting the presence of a behavioural syndrome in our sample. However, we did not find strong evidence for geographical or sex differences. Our results warrant future research to determine whether a shared behavioural syndrome in our sample has resulted from adaptive or constraining mechanisms in these populations. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Egg retrieval is regarded as an ancestral behaviour that evolved in birds as an adaptation to eggs accidentally rolling out of nests and a fixed pattern of instinctive behaviour. By contrast, egg recognition is a later and specific adaptation that arises under selection pressure from brood parasitism, through which eggs likely belonging to brood parasites are rejected from the nest. Furthermore, egg recognition is flexible and can be enhanced through learning. We performed an empirical study on 12 populations of seven species in the tit family (Paridae), which revealed that mimetic eggs were retrieved more frequently than nonmimetic eggs across species; however, the rejection patterns were completely contrasting. Furthermore, species with a stronger recognition capacity of nonmimetic eggs retrieved eggs with lower probability; however, they rejected them with higher probability. This study also revealed that although egg retrieval is possibly a fixed pattern of instinctive behaviour, it can be modified to become a flexible reaction that adapts to subsequent evolution. Moreover, egg recognition, a specific adaptation to brood parasitism, gradually reshapes or modifies egg retrieval behaviour during evolution in a predictable manner, resulting in birds with higher levels of egg recognition being less willing to retrieve an egg from outside their nests.

AB Invasive species may differ from native species in terms of behavioural responses to the stress of encountering a novel environment. Learning about the nature of these differences can help us understand the mechanisms of dispersal and success of the alien species in colonized environments. Here, we investigated this topic using two Ponto-Caspian gobies as model species. They constitute a specific group of invasive fish spreading in North America and Europe. They are benthic, territorial fish of low mobility; they are poor swimmers and are strongly associated with shelters. We compared the behaviour of two invasive goby fishes (the racer goby, Babka gymnotrachelus, and the monkey goby, Neogobius fluviatilis) to that of their native counterparts (the European bullhead, Cottus gobio, and the gudgeon, Gobio gobio, respectively). We used three laboratory tests to measure boldness-shyness traits: shelter occupancy test, novel object test and open field test. The European bullhead left the shelter later and was less active, and avoided the open field to a greater extent than the racer goby. The gudgeon was more associated with the shelter and novel object than the monkey goby and, in contrast to the monkey goby, decreased its activity in the presence of the novel object and in the open field. All the species were attracted to the vicinity of the novel object. Our study suggests that the invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies are bolder when confronted with structural changes in their environment and have a greater potential to spread across the open bottom, devoid of hiding places, compared to their native analogue species.

AB Sleep is a universal phenomenon reported in a wide variety of species, from jellyfish to humans, with varying patterns and functions across taxa. However, the adaptive significance of sleep remains largely unknown, especially in wild populations, due to the lack of adequate models. Salmonid fishes are good candidates since they are one of the most studied wild animals and show remarkable diel activity patterns within and among species. Here, for the first time, we show that a typical resting posture (contact with the riverbed) of the brown trout, Salmo trutta, meets the criteria of behavioural sleep: (1) a resting posture with behavioural quiescence, (2) elevated arousal thresholds and (3) homeostatic regulation as a response to sleep deprivation. We also found a remarkable individual variation in sleep phenotypes (nocturnal, intermediate and cathemeral) even within the same population. Note that homeostatic regulation was observed for this species with flexible diel activity. Because of their variability and flexibility, salmonids represent a promising candidate for an experimental model to clarify the advantages of sleep behaviour in wild populations.

AB Alternative reproductive strategies typically involve the use of divergent suites of morphological and behavioural traits to maximize reproductive success. The genetically determined male morphs of the jumping spider Maevia inclemens have dramatically different secondary sexual traits and courtship behaviour, the functions of which remain elusive despite extensive research. Building on a previous study, here we tested the following two hypotheses that might explain their drastically different morphology and behaviour: (1) males of the tufted morph may use tufts on their head to signal their mate quality to females; (2) males of the striped morph may use contrasting black-and-white striped legs to suppress female aggression during courtship. To test these hypotheses, we manipulated the tuft lengths of tufted males and presence/absence of leg stripes on striped males. We paired the manipulated males with unmated females and quantified various measures of mating success, female receptivity, female aggression and reproductive output. Despite extensive analyses, we found little support for our a priori hypotheses. Instead, our models suggested that male body condition is more likely to influence the outcome of mating interactions than variation in the target traits we manipulated. These robust negative results allow us to revise our hypotheses and provide new insight into this unique male dimorphism that has puzzled biologists for decades. They also provide a broad context for thinking about the evolution and maintenance of other unusual cases of male dimorphism across taxa.Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many animals, body size is correlated with reproductive success. Selection sometimes generates striking differences in body size between males and females (i.e. sexual size dimorphism, SSD). SSD is common in spiders (Araneae), and is typically explained by selection for larger, more fecund females and rapidly maturing, and consequently smaller, males. Within a species males and females also often vary in body size. In the false widow spider, Steatoda grossa, females are larger than males and males trade body size for rapid development and early maturation. Moreover, males vary considerably in body size, suggesting that under certain conditions there may be advantages to large size. Here, we tested the role of male body size on mating success under noncompetitive and competitive mating conditions (i.e. male-male competition) in S. grossa. We found that body size did not influence mating success or copulation duration under noncompetitive conditions, but that larger males were more successful at obtaining access to females under competitive mating conditions. Additionally, we found that total copulation duration was significantly lower when a rival male was present. Our results show a large male advantage under male-male competition, which we suggest may contribute to the high variation in male body size observed in S. grossa. We further suggest that the reduced copulation duration observed under competitive mating conditions may have potential ramifications for male and female reproductive success and we discuss how patterns of selection acting on male body size might limit the extent of SSD in this species.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB The presence of social cues of reproductive competition can favour plasticity in reproductive traits and strategies. However, whether these types of social cues may also lead to transgenerational plasticity via maternal effects has scarcely been investigated. To test this hypothesis, I exposed adult female crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, to either a low or a high density of intermale competition cues during the period of egg formation by altering the density of males in the surrounding environment. Then, I assessed how the experimental manipulation affected the reproductive strategies of male offspring by quantifying their relative investment in sexual signalling, courtship behaviours and sperm production. The results revealed that males whose mothers were exposed to a high density of males invested less in calling for potential mates in adulthood but interestingly when they had access to a mate, they courted her more intensively than males of mothers exposed to a low density of males. Yet, offspring sperm production was unaffected by the experimental treatment, suggesting that the maternal influence on offspring traits under postcopulatory sexual selection may be weaker. Overall, my findings highlight the role of socially mediated maternal effects in promoting transgenerational plasticity in different offspring reproductive traits and the possibility that offspring reproductive strategies may be under, at least partially, maternal influence.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social organization in animals is a fundamental factor driving population dynamics and individual spatial distribution. Affiliation among kin is common in social groups, but kinship is no safeguard against intraspecific competition. Within social groups, the closest competitors are often related. In this study, we present 14 years of GPS-position movement data from 65 pairs (i.e. breeding pair, pup-adult breeder and pup-pup) of Scandinavian wolves, Canis lupus. We investigated social behaviour by examining spatial and temporal patterns of cohesion through winter to early summer (January to July) including two key reproductive periods, mating and birth, using mixed regressive nonlinear time series analysis (GAMM). During the mating period, breeding wolf pairs remained cohesive, while offspring increasingly dissociated. Offspring became even more solitary until the next birth period, when most permanently left their natal pack and territory. We suggest that the social organization of wolves may be modulated by intraspecific competition related to social aggression during the mating period and food competition around the birthing period. Early independence followed by immediate natal dispersal may be advan-tageous to both offspring and parents if the chances of finding food and a breeding partner and settling in a vacant area are high.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Resources that draw individuals to a specific location may result in the formation of groups and development of individual social preferences. Simultaneously considering both ecological and social factors can therefore reveal underlying mechanisms of group formation and organization. Females of some temperate bat species roost in groups during the spring and summer months within which they give birth to and nurse their pups. Females switch roosts frequently, but the factors that influence roost switching remain poorly understood. To characterize the structure of a bat maternity group and gather evidence for the role of social preference in shaping this structure, we used roost co-occurrence data from little brown myotis, Myotis lucifugus, implanted with passive integrated transponder tags and roost boxes monitored with passive readers in Salmonier Nature Park, Newfoundland, Canada. By developing informed null models, we more directly investigate hypotheses that may explain why bats roost together. Although our results suggest that association patterns of maternity groups can largely be explained by similar interindividual patterns in bats' roosting frequencies within a given roost box (roost fidelity), other factors are likely to contribute to the observed structure. We thus provide support for the potential influence of roost and social preferences in shaping maternity group structure. (C) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Noise pollution has been steadily increasing in the ocean, negatively affecting aquatic ecosystems by causing both behavioural and physiological deficits for many marine animals, including fishes. To date, most research investigating the effects of noise on fishes has been conducted in controlled laboratory settings; however, these experimental conditions often lack ecological validity, and it is largely unknown whether the effects observed in aquaria are representative of real-world responses for animals experiencing noise in the wild. In this study, we used a combination of laboratory and field playback experiments to assess the effects of noise on nest defence and parental care behaviours in an intertidal-breeding toadfish, the plainfin midshipman, Porichthys notatus. Nest-guarding males without eggs in the laboratory exhibited a nearly four-fold increase in defensive behaviours under boat noise playbacks compared to under ambient con-ditions. However, in the field, no significant changes were detected in the defensive or parental behaviours by guarding males with eggs under exposure to noise. Our study demonstrates that anthropogenic noise can impact nest defence behaviour in plainfin midshipman males, but also that its impact depends on contextual cues such as testing environment, presence of eggs and the noise stimulus used. Our results highlight the urgent need for more field studies and for studies that pair and compare laboratory versus field results to quantify and mitigate the potential harm caused by noise pollution to organisms and pop-ulations in coastal environments.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Evolutionary history, parental experience and individual experience provide distinct avenues by which the environment alters phenotypes, yet the mechanisms mediating phenotypic variation on these timescales may interact. Here we examine how parental environment and juvenile experience jointly modify offspring phenotypes in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Parents were reared in the laboratory either with or without predator cues, and offspring were split and reared either with or without predator cues. We found that parental effects led to smaller body size, an increase in whole-body cortisol and increases in activity and antipredator behaviour in open field and model predator assays. For most traits, both individual and parental experience with predators produced similar outcomes. For some traits, male and female offspring differed in consequences of parental and individual exposure to predator cues. Together, our results suggest that parental effects and offspring experience influence males and females differently, last into adulthood and highlight the complex interactions between intergenerational and developmental plasticity.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Chemical signals, such as those used in social communication, are often present as complex blends of compounds, suggesting that complexity is important in signal perception. Very few studies, however, have examined the interactions between different components of complex signals in social signalling. In the Mysore day gecko, Cnemaspis mysoriensis, secretions of males are sufficient to elicit a behavioural response in females and these male secretions differ from those of females in the presence of two key chemical compounds: cholesterol and squalene. This provided us with an opportunity to determine the functions and interactions of individual components in a complex multicomponent chemical signal. First, using tongue flick assays, we established that both components independently elicit a behavioural response in females, but not males. When presented as a multicomponent mix, the response levels of females were similar to those shown towards the individual components, thereby indicating that cholesterol and squalene are redundant components. Moreover, female responses towards these components matched their level of response towards natural male secretions, confirming that both cholesterol and squalene signal sex identity of males. When presented with a gradient of multicomponent stimulus concentrations, females, but not males, incrementally adjusted their tongue flick responses to different levels. Further, responses of females were similar regardless of whether cholesterol or squalene was at a higher relative concentration in the multicomponent stimulus. These last two sets of results indicate that the overall concentration, but not the relative ratio of cholesterol and squalene, has the potential to encode information about male quality. Lack of responses by males to these compounds across experiments strongly indicate the role of cholesterol and squalene in intersexual, and not intrasexual, communication. Overall, we show that two sex-specific compounds in a complex multicomponent chemical signal are effective in communicating complex sexual information from males to conspecific females.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   AVAILABILITY
AB The circadian thermoenergetics hypothesis (CTEH) suggests that endotherms benefit by being active during the warmer period of a 24 h cycle and by resting when temperatures drop, since this lowers energetic investment in thermoregulation. In accordance with the CTEH, cathemeral (i.e. active during both daytime and night-time) Azara's owl monkeys, Aotus azarae, of the Argentinean Chaco increase their daytime activity during the relatively cold winter compared to the summer. Still, it remains unclear whether these behavioural changes are explained by major shifts in energy balance. Thus, we sought to understand how thermal challenges influence the allocation of behaviours during the daytime that tend to conserve energy (resting), increase its availability (foraging) or expend it (travelling). We constructed a priori a set of linear models to evaluate the relationships between daytime behavioural patterns and photoperiod, moonlight, age, reproductive status and hourly, daily and weekly fluctuations in ambient temperatures, as well as some of their interactions. We analysed 4985 20-minute focal samples collected during 0600-2100 hours from 140 recognizable individuals from 15 groups across 13 years. Our results indicate that, from the warmest to the coldest months, daytime resting frequencies decreased by 31%, whereas daytime foraging frequencies increased by 131%, while travelling frequencies remained unchanged. Daytime activity patterns were explained by the interaction between weekly average temperatures and either lunar activity, age class or reproductive status. Generally, daytime activity increased as temperatures decreased seasonally, but this is effect was masked during full moons; and infants, juveniles, subadults and solitary adults used the daytime differently. Finally, travelling and foraging increased during longer days or at times of daily maximum temperatures but decreased when these two factors interacted (i.e. long summer days at daily maximum temperatures). In summary, daytime behaviours of A. azarae may be structured by thermoenergetic investment, as predicted by the CTEH. ?? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In the field of sexual selection, it is common to encounter the idea of 'sex roles': choosy and caring females and competitive and promiscuous males. Despite criticism of these stereotypes from some evolutionary biologists, sex roles still appear as a norm in much of the sexual selection-related literature. This may be because scientists anthropomorphize animal behaviours, which raises the question of whether demographic traits and experiences can influence one's perception regarding sex differences in nature. Here we tested whether age, gender, country and experiences are associated with different perceptions of sex differences in nature. We conducted a survey in which we asked participants about their perception of the frequency at which certain behaviours associated with sex roles (promiscuity, mate choice, intrasexual competition and parental care) occur in nonhuman animals for each sex. We found that participants' country, research experience with certain taxonomic groups and research experience with sex-specific topics were associated with different perceptions of sex differences in nonhuman animals; participants from more gender-unequal countries showed greater agreement with the idea of sex roles. In contrast, participants who had experience with mechanisms not predicted by the idea of sex roles such as male mate choice, paternal care and female-female competition showed lower agreement with the idea of sex roles than other participants. We suggest that increasing social diversity in academia and encouraging researchers to diversify the sexes and taxa of animals they use to investigate reproductive behaviours could challenge pre-existing biases in animal sex differences.

AB Animals that hunt for food underwater and return to the surface for air ('divers') are limited by their ability to store oxygen. The aerobic dive limit (ADL) is the dive duration at which all the possible oxygen stores have been used. It has been claimed that models of optimal diving predict that divers will be close to this limit and that the data do not match this prediction. I characterize closeness to the ADL by the fraction of the maximum amount of stored oxygen that is used during a dive. At the ADL this fraction is 1. I show that an optimal diver does not necessarily have a close to 1 and point out that the key feature predicted by the model is that the diver should have no oxygen stores left when it returns to the surface. The data cited against optimal diving do not address this issue. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parents face a trade-off when allocating limited resources to reproduction and self-maintenance, and this can result in differential investment in individual offspring when rearing multiple offspring simultaneously. In birds with biparental care, it is not well understood how each parent allocates its resources to different chicks of the same brood. Theory suggests that parental investment depends on offspring quality and brood size, but empirical quantification of parent-offspring interactions during the post fledging stage is often difficult. We worked with captive common ravens, Corvus corax, a slightly dimorphic songbird with extended periods of biparental care, to investigate the effects of offspring sex, body mass, brood age and brood size on the feeding probability by both parents. We further investigated the influence of the same factors on offspring begging behaviour and affiliative interactions between parent and offspring. Mothers were more likely to feed and affiliate with their offspring than fathers. Fathers were more likely to feed and affiliate with sons than daughters, whereas mothers showed no preference. When more than one son was present, fathers were more likely to feed and affiliate with heavier sons than light sons. Brood size increased the begging probability of chicks, but decreased their probability of being fed. Our results suggest that biparental care in ravens is skewed towards the mother and that paternal care is selective. Selective paternal investment in the heaviest son may be adaptive in a system where heaviest males better compete for resources during dispersal. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Understanding variation in social grouping patterns among animal taxa is an enduring goal of ethologists, who seek to evaluate the selective pressures shaping the evolution of sociality. Cohesive association with conspecifics increases intragroup feeding competition and may impose constraints on group size. Furthermore, in sexually dimorphic species, males and females may have different nutritional requirements, which can lead to suboptimal foraging in mixed-sex groups. How do animals living in permanent social groups mitigate these foraging costs? Niche differentiation is often hypothesized as a mechanism, but rigorous and detailed tests of the extent and context of differences in diet and habitat use, key tenets of this hypothesis, are rare. We investigated the potential for niche differentiation in foraging activity budget and environment use in a population of wild white-faced capuchin monkeys, Cebus imitator, in northwestern Costa Rica. Using a robust data set of 15 879 foraging scan samples collected from four groups over 13 months, we found that smaller individuals e.g. juveniles and females forage more often on smaller branches. We additionally found clear evidence of predator sensitive foraging wherein the smallest individuals spent less time on the ground during invertebrate foraging. Importantly, niche differentiation was far more evident overall during invertebrate foraging, likely due to spatial constraints and environmental homogeneity imposed by fruit patches. In summary, we found considerable variation in habitat use across age and sex classes, likely attributable to differences in size and relative predation risk. These variables likely reduce intraspecific feeding competition by promoting differential diet and habitat use. Our results also provide insight into the limits of niche differentiation as a strategy for competition reduction and may shed light on the evolution of fission-fusion dynamics in highly frugivorous species.

AB Animal sociality can vary in response to both biotic and abiotic factors, and variation in the rate and types of interactions that occur between individuals of a group can result in greatly differentiated social structure and ultimately social evolution. However, social structures are often generalized to the species or population level and do not consider potential shifts in structure over time. We used social network analysis to investigate the social structure of black-tailed prairie dogs (hereafter 'prairie dogs') and determine the demographic features that may underpin the observed social structures in a population that experiences increased seasonal shifts of environmental conditions compared to populations in the centre of the geographical range. Prairie dogs live in highly social colonies, display an elaborate range of social behaviours and experience very dynamic changes in body condition due to variable environmental conditions. We used exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to examine the effects of body condition, age, sex and spatial arrangement on static and temporal social networks. We expected that spatial arrangement would most strongly influence social structure given the delineated burrow systems of a prairie dog colony. We hypothesized that body condition influences social structure over time, where those in better body condition maintain the social structure. Prairie dogs associated preferentially with individuals near themselves and of the same age. Furthermore, we also determined that body condition correlated positively with maintaining social structure over time, where those in poorer body condition experienced an increase in the loss and gain of relationships compared to those in better body condition that maintained connections. Our study confirms previous conclusions of association based on age and also highlights the importance of considering dynamic individual traits such as body condition in the importance of long-term social structure. These results also show the promise of both static and temporal ERGMs in a biological system and demonstrate the potential for increased temporally driven hypothesis testing using this technique.

AB Tourism-related feeding of wildlife can result in detrimental, human-induced changes to the spatial distribution, social behaviour and health of target species. The feeding of sharks as part of shark-viewing activities has become increasingly popular in recent years to ensure reliable and consistent encounters. A common limitation in determining how feeding affects individuals or populations is the lack of baseline data prior to the establishment of a feeding site. Here, we documented the residency, spatial distribution, activity patterns and daily metabolic rates of juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris, prior to initiating daily feeding for 27 days to assess the effect of short-term feeding. We implanted acoustic transmitters equipped with accelerometers to record movement and activity in six lemon sharks. Sharks progressively anticipated the feeding events during the 27 days of daily feeding, as shown by a change in activity and increased time spent near the feeding site 1 h prior to feeding events. Shark behaviour did not fully return to baseline levels within the documented 90 days of postfeeding recovery. However, neither spatial distribution outside the refuge nor mean daily activity was affected by feeding. Sharks decreased their metabolic rates over the course of the study, but this was probably due to falling water temperature rather than the effect of feeding. Overall, our study shows that anticipatory behaviour in juvenile lemon sharks can occur within 11 days of daily feeding events, but behavioural changes seem confined to fine-scale movement patterns and may not affect these sharks' daily energy needs. The ability to assess the effects of daily feeding at a site where tourism has not been occurring previously provides new information for operators and managers of wildlife tourism to account for and minimize potentially detrimental effects on the target species.

AB The ability to produce innovative behaviour is a key determinant in the successful coping with environmental challenges and changes. The expansion of human-altered environments presents wildlife with multiple novel situations in which innovativeness could be beneficial. A better understanding of the drivers of within-species variation in innovation propensity and its consequences will provide insights into the traits enabling animals to thrive in the face of human-induced rapid environmental change. We compared problem-solving performance of 31 striped field mice, Apodemus agrarius, originating from rural or urban environments in a battery of eight foraging extraction tasks. We tested whether differences in problem-solving performance were mediated by the extent and duration of the animal's exploration of the experimental set-ups, the time required to solve the tasks, and their persistence. In addition, we tested the influence of the diversity of motor responses, as well as of behavioural traits boldness and activity on problem-solving performance. Urban individuals were better problem solvers despite rural individuals approaching faster and interacting longer with the test set-ups. Participation rates and time required to solve a task did not differ between rural and urban individuals. However, in case of failure to solve a task, rural mice were more persistent. The best predictors of solving success, aside from the area of origin, were the time spent exploring the set-ups and boldness, while activity and diversity of motor responses did not explain it. Problem-solving ability could thus be a contributing factor to the successful coping with the rapid and recent expansion of human-altered environments.

AB Life histories are strongly age dependent, notably linked to the onset of reproductive maturity and subsequent senescence. Consequently, ageing is predicted to impact behaviour, through the expression of either mating tactics in males or neonatal antipredator tactics in females. However, the influence of ageing, and the associated reproductive activity, on spatial behaviour remains poorly investigated. In this regard, we quantified ageand sex-specific intra-annual variation in movement rates and space use of two large herbivores with contrasting life histories: the roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, an asocial species with a territorial male mating strategy and a hider neonatal tactic, and the Mediterranean mouflon, Ovis gmelini musimon x Ovis sp., a gregarious species with a roaming male mating strategy and a follower neonatal tactic. We expected age-related differences to be mostly related to (1) age-specific mating tactics during the rut for males and the presence/absence of offspring for females, and (2) experience and/or locomotory senescence otherwise. During the rutting period, older roe deer males travelled greater daily distances than younger males due to patrolling behaviours for territory defence, whereas older mouflon males travelled less than younger males, which often adopted coursing tactics to mate with females. During the birth period, reproductive females had smaller home ranges than nonreproductive females in roe deer, whereas no marked differences were observed in mouflon females. The most marked age-related variation in space use of mouflon occurred outside the reproductive periods; specifically, the oldest individuals travelled less far and had a smaller home range (females only) than younger individuals. Our findings illustrate how space use tactics vary within and between populations of large herbivores, providing strong evidence that age and reproductive activity are major determinants of their spatial behaviour.

AB The invasive zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (ZM), established in Europe for a long time, has recently been joined and commonly outcompeted by a new invader, the quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (QM). To identify factors contributing to this displacement, we studied behavioural differences between the species: aggregation, movement, and responses to conspecifics, congeners and their alarm cues. Compared to ZM, QM were more aggregated and less motile, crawling shorter distances for a shorter time at a slower speed. Conversely, QM exhibited more nonlocomotor movements. Both species aggregated and burrowed less and showed more nonlocomotor movements in response to conspecific and heterospecific alarm cues. They also moved shorter distances in the presence of conspecific alarm cues. ZM delayed their locomotion and nonlocomotor movements, whereas QM started locomotion earlier in the presence of both alarm cues. Mussel responses to living heterospecifics resembled those to alarm cues. In mixed-species aggregations, ZM attached to conspecifics more often than to QM shells, whereas QM were nonselective. To summarize, QM are less mobile, less selective regarding attachment site and more aggregated than ZM. This allows QM to perform better in mixed-species assemblages by spending less energy on relocation and overgrowing ZM to a higher extent than vice versa. Both species responded to heterospecific signals, which is helpful in mixed-species assemblages, particularly in novel areas occupied by these invasive species. Nevertheless, similar responses to alarm cues and living heterospecifics suggest a negative interaction between the congeners. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many species of insects have sex-specific and species-specific cuticular lipid profiles that help regulate mate recognition and courtship behaviour. However, in adult butterflies, little is known about cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), the main component of the lipid profile, and their function in mating. Here, we investigated whether Papilio polytes males use cuticular lipids and major CHCs in mate discrimination. When males were presented with freshly killed female and male specimens, copulation attempts were more frequent after contact with the females. Upon removal of the cuticular lipid with solvent washes, the ratios of copulation attempts were similar for both male and female specimens. When male or female cuticular lipid extracts of P. polytes or Papilio protenor (a sympatric and related species) were applied to washed female specimens, males displayed less interest in specimens treated with extracts other than that of the conspecific females. Chemical analysis of the extracts revealed that the CHC profiles, especially the C23-C25 range, differed greatly between the sexes of the two species. Of the identified major hydrocarbons, authentic chemicals 7-tricosene (characteristic of P. polytes males) and 9-pentacosene (characteristic of P. protenor females) greatly reduced the ratio of male copulation attempts with the treated female models. Hence, P. polytes males use the CHC profile of their partner for mate discrimination, and particular alkenes probably play important roles in the prevention of interspecific and same sex courtships.

AB With an increasing human population and expansion of urban settlements, wild animals are often exposed to humans. As humans may be a threat, a neutral presence or a source of food, animals will benefit from continuously assessing the potential risk they pose in order to respond appropriately. Herring gulls, Larus argentatus, are increasingly breeding and foraging in urban areas, and thus have many opportunities to interact with humans. We recently found that herring gulls take longer to approach food when being watched by a human. However, it is not known whether aversion to human gaze arises from experience with humans, and whether individual differences in responsiveness are a result of differential exposure. Here, we tested whether herring gulls' responses to human gaze differ according to their age class and urbanization of their habitat. We measured the gulls' flight initiation distance when an experimenter approached with either a direct or an averted gaze. Neither gull age class nor urbanization significantly influenced the effect of human gaze on flight initiation distance. However, as recently fledged juveniles responded strongly to the experimenter's gaze, aversion to human gaze may not require extensive exposure to humans to develop. Gulls in urban areas could be approached more closely than those in rural areas, consistent with findings in other species. These results indicate that gaze aversion is present early in development and that exposure to humans may influence gulls' responses to perceived risk from humans. Investigating the processes generating individual differences in responses to humans will provide further insights into human-wildlife interactions and the effects of urbanization.

AB Optimizing reproductive success is an essential part of evolution for both sexes. Females can optimize mating by avoiding superfluous mating advances and insemination, since both take time away from other activities and may incur costs related to sperm receipt. While many separate-sexed organisms are known to exhibit mate avoidance, much less is known about this for simultaneous hermaphrodites. We addressed this here, using a simultaneously hermaphroditic species that can choose to mate in either of the two sex roles during each mating interaction. Recently, avoidance behaviours in response to natural matings were observed in the hermaphroditic pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, potentially deterring insemination. To disentangle whether such behaviours are mediated by the mechanical act of mating or the receipt of accessory gland proteins and/or sperm, we intravaginally injected individuals with control or test fluids. Our results show that the avoidance behaviours, crawl-out and biting, were more frequently expressed when individuals were inseminated with accessory gland proteins and/or sperm. These behavioural components of the recipient increased time in courtship prior to insemination, which is concordant with the hypothesis that the partner tries to discourage the potential sperm donor from inseminating. Understanding the mechanism underlying the effects that molluscan accessory gland proteins induce contributes to our understanding of the molecular basis of the recipient's (behavioural) responses as well as how such biochemical postcopulatory strategies evolve.

AB Wild ungulates can recognize certain predators without previous experience, but this innate ability may be relaxed under domestication. Using naive dairy calves, Bos taurus, we examined the effects of exposure to a predator odour (coyote, Canis latrans, urine) and two control odours (deer urine and water) on (1) latency to approach a milk food reward, (2) exploration, vigilance and locomotor play, (3) magnitude of the startle response to a sudden noise delivered upon arrival at the feeder and (4) heart rate during feeding in 10 min trials on three consecutive days. In response to predator odour, calves delayed feeding and tended to explore more and play less in the first 30 s of the trial compared to calves exposed to control odours. The duration spent feeding and standing with the head raised (i.e. vigilant) did not differ among treatments. On the first day, calves exposed to predator odour startled more to a sudden noise than control animals. Mean heart rate during feeding decreased across days in the control treatments, but not in the predator treatment, suggesting a sustained response to the predator odour. We conclude that naive domestic calves retain the ability to distinguish between predator and nonpredator odour. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper examines the context of science scholarship and research careers experienced by behavioural biologists from under-represented minority (URM) groups during the period starting in the late 1800s until the early decades of the Animal Behavior Society (ABS). For much of history, white European and American men have dominated the seats of scientific leadership, shaping narratives and controlling who asks scientific questions, how these questions are examined and what is significant. Yet, individuals from URM groups have navigated careers in animal behaviour and related fields, and along with some nonminority allied scientists, have often simultaneously advocated for diversity and inclusion among our ranks. The lasting impact of these scholar activists has been important not only to the discipline, but to science as a whole. This paper shines lights on missing narratives of URMs who were often excluded in academic histories, as well as emphasizing the importance of creating more inclusive spaces for future animal behaviour scholars. I highlight the contributions of American scientists in the U.S.A. who have contributed to the development of animal behaviour and related disciplines and have raised awareness about social justice and inclusivity in our field.

AB Understanding the sources of variation in reproductive fitness is a central goal of sexual selection research. Research investigating factors limiting male reproductive potential typically focus on limited mate availability or mate access. This focus often minimizes the potential relevance of physiological or other limitations on male reproductive potential, in contrast to the emphasis on studying such limitations in females. This gap in knowledge leaves open questions about how variation in male reproductive success emerges across successive mating bouts. Here, we contribute to bridging this gap by examining male reproductive potential across successive matings and across time. To reveal limits to male reproductive potential, and sources of variation in these limits, we measured mating rate and offspring production in Drosophila melanogaster males under conditions in which mate limitation was abrogated and food was abundant. Even under these ideal conditions, we discovered distinct limits to male reproductive potential after just a few mating bouts. After males mated two to five times on a given day, additional matings often resulted in zero progeny. Furthermore, we found nonlinear relationships between the number of females a male mated with and the number of progeny he sired; and these relationships depended on the male's genotype, early life social environment and recent mating experience. These findings suggest that males who obtain more mates do not always sire the most offspring and that males who are highly successful in obtaining mates during one time period may not be able to continue this success on subsequent mating bouts and days. Together, these findings suggest trade-offs between current and future reproduction for males. More broadly, these results highlight how sexual selection studies may be expanded across individuals' lifetimes to develop a fuller picture of how sexual selection shapes variation.

DE animal innovation; group size; pool of competence hypothesis
ID AUSTRALIAN MAGPIES; TIBICEN
AB The benefits of group living have traditionally been attributed to risk dilution or the efficient exploitation of resources; individuals in social groups may therefore benefit from access to valuable information. If sociality facilitates access to information, then individuals in larger groups may be predicted to solve novel problems faster than individuals in smaller groups. Additionally, larger group sizes may facilitate the subsequent spread of innovations within animal groups, as has been proposed for human societies. We presented a novel foraging task (where a food reward could be accessed by pushing a self-shutting sliding door) to 16 groups of wild, cooperatively breeding Australian magpies, Cracticus tibicen dorsalis, ranging in size from two to 11 individuals. We found a nonlinear decline in the time taken for the innovative behaviour to emerge with increasing group size, and social information use facilitated the transmission of novel behaviour, with it spreading more quickly in larger than smaller groups. This study provides important evidence for a nonlinear relationship between group size and the emergence of innovation (and its subsequent transmission) in a wild population of animals. Further work investigating the scope and strength of group size-innovation relationships, and the mechanisms underpinning them, will help us understand the potential advantages of living in larger social groups.

AB Navigation is a ubiquitous challenge to mobile animals as it is essential for finding mates, food and shelter. It can rely on self-generated (idiothetic) as well as external (allothetic) information. The contribution of either source of information depends on multiple factors, including the sensory modality. Far-range modalities such as vision have frequently been studied in the context of navigation, but the extent to which near-range sensory systems provide information for navigation is much less understood. Here we focused on spatial learning in the weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii. During their nocturnal excursions these fish typically rely on their short-range active electric sense to explore their environment. We addressed how these fish navigate and how electrosensory information is integrated in navigation. All fish learned to localize a target in a Barnes-like maze. In a series of transfer tests, we found that fish followed an idiothetic navigation strategy. When this strategy failed, fish were able to integrate electrosensory information to complete the task. Our results indicate that the active electric sense contributes to navigation in a resource-efficient and context-dependent manner. Together they show that weakly electric fish can incorporate highly localized sensory input in egocentric navigation. Extending these results will be important to reveal the sensory mechanisms of egocentric navigation in fish as well as to research whether and how spatially confined near-range sensory information might be used to form global representations of space.

AB Explaining how and why some species evolved to have more complex social structures than others has been a long-term goal for many researchers in animal behaviour because it would provide important insight into the links between evolution and ecology, sociality and cognition. However, despite long-standing interest, the evolution of social complexity is still poorly understood. This may be due in part to researchers focusing on the feasibility of quantifying aspects of sociality, rather than what features are characteristic of animal social complexity in the first place. Any given approach to studying complexity can tell us some things about animal sociality, but may miss others, so it is critical to decide first how to conceptualize complexity before jumping in to quantifying it. Here, we briefly summarize five existing approaches to measuring social complexity. Then, we highlight three fundamental concepts that are commonly used in the field of complex systems: (1) scales of organization, (2) compression and (3) emergence. All of these concepts are applicable to the study of animal social systems, but are not often explicitly addressed in existing social complexity measures. We discuss how these concepts can provide a rigorous foundation for conceptualizing social complexity, the potential benefits of incorporating them and how existing measures do (or do not) include them. Ultimately, researchers need to critically evaluate any measure of animal social complexity in order to balance the biological relevance of the aspect of sociality they are quantifying with the feasibility of obtaining enough data.

AB Most models of animal foraging assume that individuals make decisions rationally. One expectation of rationality theory is that preferences should be hierarchical or transitive. For many animals, including humans, making decisions about what to eat can become difficult when various parameters of choices are not positively related to one another and no single option may be considered the best. These complex decisions can result in irrational behaviour, suggesting that the value of any particular option may vary depending on the other available options. Here, we tested whether frog-eating bats, Trachops cirrhosus, are transitive in their preferences for frog calls. These bats attend to several attributes of the calls, such as call amplitude and complexity, when choosing a frog to target in their attack. While acoustic preferences are largely understood in isolation, we have a limited understanding of how bats choose between calls that vary along several important acoustic dimensions. Here, we conducted a series of binary choice experiments manipulating amplitude and complexity both separately and together to evaluate whether these bats make transitive foraging decisions. We found that bats are transitive in their rankings of calls based on these acoustic dimensions, with preferences reflecting a trade-off between both amplitude and complexity. Overall, our results add support to the notion that bats' preferences obey the general principles of rational behaviour and support the use of optimality approaches to the study of animal behaviour and decision making.

AB Contests are largely driven by resource value, but their outcome also depends on asymmetries in fighting ability between contestants. Consequently, individuals benefit from assessing these asymmetries when deciding to engage opponents or retreat. Yet, there is much about these assessments that we do not know. First, it is often difficult to discriminate whether individuals only assess their own fighting ability or if they compare it to that of their opponents by mutual assessment. Second, the extent to which assessment improves over the course of a contest, as predicted by theory, has remained largely unexplored. We addressed these questions by studying assessment during territorial contests between male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens. Findings show the consistent use of mutual assessment when deciding to engage opponents, with a progressive increase in assessment accuracy over sequential contest phases by reducing the use of dishonest signals. Importantly, contrary to theoretical expectations, we found evidence of a novel form of mutual assessment in which fight motivation increased (rather than decreased) when contestants assessed their opponents as more formidable than themselves. Although contestants shifted to opponent-only assessment when adjusting display and attack, the collective evidence shows greater aggressive intent towards more threatening opponents. We argue that explanations for this form of assessment may be provided by considering territorial dynamics related to reproductive success and parental investment.

AB An animals' ability to classify relationships between conspecifics according to kinship, affiliation and dominance constitutes an important adaptation to life in social groups. Yet, variation in the degree of competition as well as in association patterns is assumed to put differential pressure on social cognition. Because little is known about social cognition in more tolerant societies, we investigated the social knowledge of Guinea baboons, Papio papio, ranging in the Niokolo Koba National Park, Senegal. Guinea baboons live in a fluid multilevel society with 'units', 'parties' and 'gangs'. Units comprise a 'primary' male, a small number of females and young. Male-female associations may last between a few weeks to several years, and females freely transfer between males at all levels of the society. Male-male relationships are characterized by high spatial tolerance and low level of competition. We examined whether males tracked changes in male-female associations at the level of the unit. We played back grunt exchanges between a female and a primary male to 25 males and recorded male responses. The grunt sequences simulated an affiliative interaction between individuals from different units (potentially indicating a female transfer to a new male, hereafter 'inconsistent' condition) or from individuals of the same unit ('consistent' condition). Surprisingly, males looked longer when exposed to the consistent compared to the inconsistent condition. In the more competitive chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, in contrast, animals responded more strongly to experimentally simulated deviations from existing social patterns. Our study suggests that the value of social information indeed varies with the degree of competition of Guinea baboons: because of female choice, little is at stake for males when a female transfers to a new male. Furthermore, the high gregariousness of the animals may favour the classification of deviant interaction patterns, at least initially, as 'social noise'.

AB The change in coral reefs from live coral to algal-dominated seascapes prevents some fish species from using chemical alarm cues to gain information about their risk of predation. Field experiments showed that Ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, were able to learn the identity of individual novel predators from a cocktail of odours from three predators derived from digestive products. Learning only occurred when the predators had been fed conspecifics of the prey species in the presence of water that had passed over live hard coral. This allows novel predators to be identified long after the immediate capture and ingestion event. Fish that had the same learning opportunity in degraded water took more risk and died faster on habitat patches in the field. Ambon damselfish respond to chemical alarm cues from closely related Pomacentrus nagasakiensis, in both live and degraded water, yet experiments suggested they cannot use the congeneric diet odours to label predators. However, we did find a modest survival benefit under natural conditions, suggesting some limited learning occurred. Findings suggest that as coral habitats degrade, fishes that are affected by the changing chemistry will have a greatly reduced range of mechanisms for obtaining and updating threat information, altering the resilience of communities.

ID PREY CAPTURE; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS
AB Behavioural responses to the environment often require the suppression of strong internal predispositions or the overriding of external lures, tasks performed by a cognitive function called inhibitory control. Inhibitory control of nonhuman animals is generally measured with the cylinder task: subjects are presented with food inside a transparent cylinder and must inhibit their tendency to reach the food directly and instead detour round the cylinder to solve the task. However, several studies have raised concerns about the validity of this test to compare different species. Recently, a tiny teleost fish, the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, was tested with the cylinder task and scored higher than many mammals and birds. Before considering that guppies display unpredictably high inhibitory control, it is important to exclude that they were advantaged by some noncognitive factors. In particular, guppies could enjoy three advantages: experience with transparent surfaces (i.e. the walls of maintenance aquaria), experience with detouring round see-through obstacles (vegetation in the maintenance aquaria) and the spread of food odour in the water from the sides of the cylinder. We tested whether these factors affect guppies' performance in the cylinder task by manipulating both their experience with transparent surfaces before the task and the diffusion of food odour cues from the cylinder. Guppies raised in transparent aquaria or with transparent panels placed inside the tank did not show advantages over guppies with no experience with transparent surfaces. Furthermore, the guppies' performance was not reduced when the cylinder was pierced in the middle, so that both visual and olfactory cues lured them in the same direction. These results seem to exclude methodological explanations for the high inhibitory control score of guppies, and they indicate that even teleost fish can display efficient inhibitory control.

AB Animal signals of competitive ability allow contests for limited resources to be settled without costly physical fights. Traits indicating competitive ability are diverse and span visual, acoustic or chemical modalities. Although animal signalling has been intensively studied, research has focused mainly on male traits. Little is known about the extent and functionality of competitive signals in females and whether there are sex differences in signal function. We studied whether plumage colour signals competitive ability in female and male lovely fairy-wrens, Malurus amabilis. In this species, both sexes sport elaborate but sexually dichromatic ornamental plumage. Using a mirror image stimulation test, we first assessed the relationship between male and female colour and agonistic behaviour, controlling for other physical, social and ecological variables. We then tested whether colourful plumage influenced aggressive response in both sexes by experimentally manipulating plumage colour and measuring individual responses to their mirror image. Females and males were more aggressive towards naturally less colourful reflections of the cheek patch in the mirror. However, when we manipulated plumage colour, both females and males responded more aggressively to experimentally increased cheek colour reflection in the mirror. Our findings suggest that plumage colour signals competitive ability in an aggressive context in both sexes and raises the possibility that signal reliability may be maintained by social interactions where individuals police and punish dishonest signals.

AB Identifying reproductively viable partners may be the most important aspect of searching for a mate. When females vary in their reproductive receptivity, it is incumbent upon males to discriminate among females based on the likelihood of successful copulation and fertilization. We have observed that female African giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei) demonstrate profoundly delayed sexual development, with some adults exhibiting a highly neotenous, fully fused vagina. To say that the lack of vaginal patency presents a barrier to mating is a tremendous understatement. Based on this unique observation, we tested male preferences towards urine collected from patent and nonpatent females. We found that males with longer anogenital distances (AGD; a proximate measure of developmental masculinization) show differential interest towards patent and nonpatent females, preferring patent females. Strikingly, males with short AGDs did not show any differential interest between female odours. Correspondingly, only patent females demonstrated reduced interest in odour from short AGD males; nonpatent females did not demonstrate a preference. Our study demonstrates that pouched rats show differential interest in odours closely associated with mate quality. We are the first, to our knowledge, to show that the AGD of the evaluator enhances mate preferences and influences their interest in potential mating partners.

AB In singular cooperative breeders few females breed successfully, but those that acquire dominant positions can achieve high levels of breeding success, leading to strong selection for traits that enable individuals to acquire and maintain dominance status. However, little is known about the process by which females acquire dominant breeding status or the traits that enable them to do so. Female meerkats, Suricata suricatta, can acquire dominance either by inheritance after the death of the previous dominant, by displacing the incumbent dominant or at the foundation of a new group. Here we investigated the possible fitness benefits associated with these different routes to dominance and the traits that affect an individual's probability of acquiring dominance via these routes. We found that all routes to dominance had similar fitness benefits and that when a dominance vacancy arose, weight was the main determinate of succession, with age still influencing within-group succession and the eldest subordinate female, the beta, often succeeding to dominance. Since the chance that subordinate females will acquire dominance is also positively correlated with the duration of their tenure in the beta position, we tested whether beta females adjusted their growth or cooperative behaviour to avoid eviction and increased their tenure length as the beta. However, there was no indication that betas employed either strategy to increase their tenure. Given that the differing routes to dominance have equivalent fitness pay-offs and are triggered stochastically, selection probably favours flexibility rather than strategies that commit individuals to a specific route.

AB Male mate choice based on female secondary sexual traits is increasingly reported, even in species with otherwise conventional sex roles. However, empirical evidence of male mate preference remains scarce for vertebrate species other than birds and fish. Here we examined male mating investment in response to female coloration in the Alpine newt, Ichthyosaura alpestris. In our experiment, males had a choice between females that varied in the redness of the belly (red versus yellow). We recorded five parameters indicative of male preference, and the female's response. Additionally, we performed these preference trials in different light conditions (control and blue filter) to test whether male choosiness depends on the female's colour signal. We found that males adjusted their mating investment according to the encountered female. Males courted red females longer than yellow females, regardless of the red female's response. Nevertheless, if yellow females were responsive, males invested as much courtship time as for red females. Males might have a guaranteed insemination with responsive females regardless of belly colour. In addition, redder females might provide quality advantages when an insemination is successful. We further detected that less colourful males tended to invest more spermatophores for red females than males that were colourful themselves. Both effects, however, were evident in both light conditions. Since larger females had redder bellies, body size and belly colour may confer similar information about female quality. Taken together, our results provide evidence that males choose a specific female coloration and size, but also reveal potential behavioural compensation mechanisms by less colourful females to obtain similar male effort. Our findings are thus consistent with the idea of mate choice based on colourful ornaments but highlight that interactions may be complex and multiple cues as well as female responses should be considered when investigating male mate choice.

AB Recently we have found that when prospecting for nests, brood-parasitic female cowbirds (Molothrus ater) vary in their use of personal and social information when selecting a nest (White, Davies, Agyapong, & Seegmiller, 2017, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 284, 1-8), with females that are most accurate at using personal information relying least on social information and vice versa. Here, using these same female subjects, we studied whether their strategies of using social and personal information would generalize to other cognitive tasks. In two experiments we investigated whether females would attend to others when selecting a foraging site. We varied the amount of social information present and the degree of conflict that existed between personal and social information about the location of mealworms hidden in soil. We found consistency in performance within females across nest-prospecting and foraging tasks: females that were most accurate at using personal information when prospecting for nests were also most accurate at using personal information when locating food sites. Also, similar to nest prospecting, the most personally accurate females were the least dependent on social information when personal information was present. Surprisingly, however, when no personal information was present, these accurate females were most responsive to social information. Taken together, these studies suggest that females weigh the relative value of social and personal information for decisions they make and they use the most valuable information for action.

AB Behavioural flexibility, the ability to adjust behaviour to environmental change by adapting existing skills to novel situations, is key to coping with, for example, complex social interactions, seasonal changes in food availability or detecting predators. We tested the tree skink, Egernia striolata, a family-living skink from eastern Australia, in a set-shifting paradigm of eight colour/shape discriminations including reversals, an intradimensional acquisition of a new colour/shape and extradimensional shift from colour to shape (and vice versa). Skinks could learn to discriminate between colour/shape pairs and reverse this initial stimuluse-reward association; however, they showed no significant decrease in the probability of making a correct choice in the extradimensional shift suggesting that they did not form an attentional set. Subjects appear to have learnt each stage as a new problem instead of generalizing stimuli into specific dimensions (set formation). In conclusion, tree skinks solved a discrimination reversal by focusing their attention towards visual stimuli and flexibly adjusting their choice behaviour accordingly. These lizards learned to use multidimensional visual stimuli to find a food reward but did not generalize stimuli into dimensions. Furthermore, this study is the first to test for set shifting in a lizard species and thereby allows us to extend set-shifting theory to a new taxon for comparison with primates, rodents, a bird and a turtle.

AB Sociality beyond mated pairs, whether in the form of nesting colonies, clustered territories or leks, presents an evolutionary puzzle because densely packed individuals typically incur high fitness costs. One hypothesis to explain clustered distributions is that they overlie clumped distributions of resources. However, numerous studies have shown that resource distributions are often insufficient to explain individuals' settlement decisions, suggesting that clustered breeding distributions are driven by other types of benefits, possibly related to ecological, social and genetic factors. One can ask more specifically whether animals cluster because of some underlying ecological factor, or whether aspects of their reproductive behaviour and mating systems are more influential. Accordingly, evaluating the influence of sexual selection upon the evolution of mating systems can be crucial for understanding the underlying causes of animal aggregations. In this article, we review the behavioural ecology of three types of mating systems where breeding occurs in clusters: colonial, lekking and socially monogamous clustered territorial systems. We highlight sexual selection as a potential explanation for the emergence of aggregations in all three cases. In particular, we discuss the hidden lek hypothesis, which postulates that aggregations in colonial and territorial species can be driven by increased opportunities for extrapair copulations.

AB Males of several animals, including insects, use acoustic signals to attract a sexually receptive conspecific partner. In the orthopteran chorusing genus Poecilimon (Tettigoniidae), male signalling as well as female preference can be related to male body condition and to the social environment. Song is thought to be an honest signal of male quality, and song characteristics are therefore often important for sexual and social selection. At the same time, signal expression is plastic and this plasticity depends on the quality of the individual signaller, the acoustic components preferred by females and rivals' body condition and proximity. Using the bushcricket species Poecilimon ampliatus as a model, we investigated how both internal (body condition) and external (level of competition) factors affected the expression of temporal song characteristics. We show that both factors significantly affected acoustic signalling activity: when competing against light rivals, heavy males adjusted the characteristics of their songs to different social conditions. However, light males competing against a heavy rival showed less plasticity in their acoustic signals across social conditions. During the most escalated competition, heavier males increased their acoustic signal investment up to the maximum level, signalling with longer verses and higher duty cycles, in comparison to all other treatments. Body condition and the social environment affected male acoustic signal activity, which suggests that these factors mediate the allocation of resources for signalling and different strategies adopted in competition. The adaptive plasticity of acoustic signals in this species raises new questions about the potential role that this process could play in natural choruses, where more than two competitors are signalling simultaneously.

AB Individuals benefit from socially acquired information to avoid predation risks and enhance foraging efficiency. Spix's disc-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, form very stable social groups despite their need to find a new roosting site daily. Thyroptera tricolor produce two contact calls: inquiry calls, emitted during flight, and response calls, produced by bats after finding a suitable roost (in a furled leaf). Bats within social groups exhibit consistent individual differences in vocal behaviour and thus, groups are composed by a mix of less vocal and more vocal individuals. To date, it is not known whether consistent individual differences in contact calling behaviour decrease the time required for roost finding and whether vocal behaviour is correlated with an individual's ability to quickly locate roosts, thus constituting a behavioural syndrome. Here, we compared the time spent by social groups in finding roosts when a bat called from inside the roost, either frequently or infrequently. Moreover, we estimated how well calling rates inside a roost predicted a bat's ability to later find a new roost. Results of behavioural experiments and field observations show that social groups enter roosts faster when the bat inside the roost called more. This suggests that more frequent calling decreases search time, which may allow groupmates to save energy and decrease exposure to predators. Moreover, vocal activity also predicted discovery of more roosts (furled leaves) in their natural habitat, which emphasizes the relevance of more vocal individuals for the group. Our work represents a step in understanding the importance of communication and individual vocal behaviour in group formation and stability in gregarious animals.

AB Trap-building predators are sit-and-wait predators that construct a trap and wait for other arthropods to be captured in their trap. The abiotic features of their microhabitat play a significant role in their foraging success, and trap relocation can be costly and risky. Wormlions are fly larvae that construct pits in loose soil to catch prey that fall into their pit-traps and serve as a fine example of a trap-building predator. Wormlions flourish in cities and often occur under buildings that provide shelter from direct sunlight and rain. Here, we studied in the laboratory and in the field the effect of simulated rain and soil moisture on wormlion (Vermileo sp.) habitat choice, response to prey and prey escape success. Wet soil had a strong negative effect on the wormlion pit size and its response to prey, and a positive effect on the probability of ant prey escaping the pit-trap. All these limitations led to a strong avoidance by wormlions of wet soil both before and after a pit was constructed, even at the cost of pit relocation. A field experiment comparing wet and dry plots nevertheless failed to show the expected directional relocation from wet to dry plots, and we provide several explanations as to why the patterns detected in the laboratory were less clear in the field. We suggest that rain presents a considerable limiting factor for wormlion hunting success, and that rain-shielding artificial structures could be responsible for the success of these predators in urban environments. It remains to be tested whether our results hold true for other trap-building predators and whether their preference for dry habitats is as strong as that of wormlions.

AB In songbird species with repertoires of multiple songs, individuals in territorial interactions can engage in song type matching, in which one bird responds to another using the same song type. Song type matching is thought to be associated with aggressive intent, although empirical support for this hypothesis is mixed. Here we test the alternative hypothesis that males selectively use song type matching, depending on singing ability, to optimize their relative performance in a communication network. We recorded the responses of male swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, to playback trials in which they heard stimulus songs of higher or lower vocal performance relative to their own version of those songs. We predicted that, if males use song type matching to influence the perceptions of conspecifics outside the interacting dyad, males would (1) match stimulus songs that they themselves could perform better and (2) respond with a different song type to stimulus songs that they could not perform as well. We found that males song-type matched more often than expected by chance across trials, but contrary to our expectations, they were at least as likely to match to playback of higher-performance songs as to playback of lower-performance songs. As in previous studies, we also found that males sang with higher vocal performance in response to playback than when singing spontaneously, and that they did not preferentially respond with their highest-performance song type as a countersinging strategy. Our results support the idea that in swamp sparrows, song type matching functions primarily within the dyad rather than to broadcast superior performance ability to other conspecifics in the communication network.

AB Animals must identify reliable cues amidst environmental noise during learning, and the cues that are most reliable often depend on the local ecology. Comparing the performance of populations of the same species across multiple versions of a cognitive task can reveal whether some populations learn to use certain cues faster than others. Here, using a criterion-based protocol, we assessed whether two natural populations of sticklebacks differed in how quickly they learned to associate two different discrimination cues with the location of food. One version of the discrimination task required animals to use visual (colour) cues while the other required animals to use egocentric (side) cues. There were significant behavioural differences between the two populations, but no evidence that one population was generally better at learning, or that one version of the task was generally harder than the other. However, the two populations excelled on different tasks: fish from one population performed significantly better on the side version than they did on the colour version, while the opposite was observed in the other population. These results suggest that the two populations are equally capable of discrimination learning, but are primed to form associations with different cues. Ecological differences between the populations in environmental stability might account for the observed variation in learning. These findings highlight the value of comparing cognitive performance on different variations of the same task in order to understand variation in cognitive mechanisms.

AB Characterizing individual variation in parental care is critical to understanding how selection shapes and maintains patterns of care, yet little is known about how individual parents vary in their responses to the environment. Reaction norms, functions that describe how phenotypes change across an environmental gradient, provide an elegant framework for studying individual variation in behavioural responses. We use a reaction norm approach to investigate how studying plasticity, which describes variation within an individual through time, and personality, which describes repeatable variation among individuals, together explain individual variation in the parental behaviour of the anemonefish Amphiprion percula. More specifically, we test how resource availability influences individual parental responses to the environment and discuss the consequences for our understanding of plasticity and personality in parental care. Breeding pairs of A. percula were fed either a high or a low food ration and their parental behaviours were monitored. Individuals exhibited plasticity in parental behaviour across the two resource environments. Furthermore, individuals were repeatable in their behaviour through time, as evidenced by significant among-individual variation in intercept. Finally, the slope and elevation of individual reaction norms varied, revealing a level of variation not captured at the population level and providing insight into the potential mechanisms generating individual variation.

AB The costs and benefits of a particular behavioural trait, such as boldness or aggression, may vary depending on the physical environment. We tested whether the common practice of adding physical structure (i.e. boulders) to streams to increase salmonid density has behavioural consequences, as open habitats are predicted to favour individuals that are more bold and aggressive. Wild young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon were captured from habitats of varying physical complexity and placed into semi-natural stream enclosures for 11 days while their behaviour was observed and tested in both open and structurally complex environments. We found evidence for personality, or consistent individual behavioural differences across contexts, for avoidance and site attachment, with repeatabilities of 0.287 and 0.206, respectively, but not for activity or frequency of aggression. Fish were significantly more active and aggressive in the open habitats, and more site-attached in the complex habitats. Active and aggressive fish also grew more in the wild, while site-attached fish grew less in the wild, but more in the enclosures. However, contrary to our expectation, the complexity of the original habitat was not a significant predictor of personality. Our results suggest stream restorations involving increasing habitat complexity will alter the behaviour of young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon, but will not favour any particular personality types.

AB In some social insects, workers can produce females asexually through thelytokous parthenogenesis. This allows them to produce replacement queens (i.e. requeening) if the queen has died, but also to compete with the queen to produce females (i.e. reproductive cheating). For the first time, we experimentally tested the role of worker thelytoky under quasinatural conditions in the ant Cataglyphis cursor, where the queen uses both sexual and thelytokous reproduction. We reared pairs of orphaned and queenright colonies in enclosures for almost 3 months, during which they competed for resources. Orphaned colonies lost more workers than queenright colonies over the course of the experiment, presumably because of the costs of reproductive conflicts between workers. Nevertheless, they produced new queens through worker thelytoky and new colonies through colony fission. This is the first unambiguous demonstration that worker thelytoky allows requeening under natural conditions in this species. We further showed that worker thelytoky results in reproductive cheating in the form of a few workers reproducing in the presence of the queen (in queenright colonies) and a few worker lineages producing more new queens than other lineages (in orphaned colonies). In addition, it also results in rare instances of social parasitism, that is, workers entering and reproducing in foreign colonies. These benefits to workers seem too occasional and too low to drive the evolution of thelytoky in this species. We argue that thelytoky probably evolved in the queen caste, where it allows the production of young queens and confers frequent and large benefits by increasing gene transmission, but is also expressed in workers because of genetic correlations between the two castes.

AB Environmental and developmental conditions can drive substantial variation in offspring behaviour and developmental trajectory. While incubation temperature is well known to influence development in oviparous animals, little is known of the role of parental temperature on offspring phenotype (i.e. thermal parental effects). Following exposure of male and gravid female jacky dragons, Amphibolurus muricatus, to one of two thermal treatments (short-bask versus long-bask) and incubation of their eggs at a constant temperature, we examined whether the preovipositional parental treatment influenced offspring performance-related behaviours. We detected main and interactive effects of parental treatment on offspring behaviours including feeding, exploration and antipredator. Sex-specific effects of parental treatment included long-bask sons being more likely to feed and being bolder following predatory attack than short-bask sons, while the differences between treatments for daughters were smaller. Behaviours were not consistent between 1 week and 1 month of age and showed little correlation across behavioural contexts. Some behaviours emerged as promising mechanisms of documented parental effects on offspring growth and survival in these individuals. In particular, boldness among long-bask sons in an antipredator context may be linked to their greater rates of growth posthatching. Overall, our findings suggest that thermal parental effects influence variation in animal behaviours relevant for subsequent fitness outcomes.

AB How prey animals determine predation risk remains uncertain. We propose that one signal of high predation risk is repeated activation of fight-or-flight behaviour. We activated escape runs in the cricket Gryllus texensis by blowing air on the cerci. Escape runs were induced for 5 min, three times per day, three times per week for 4 weeks. Repeated fight-or-flight behaviour led to a loss in mass and decreased life span, suggesting a decline in somatic maintenance. However, there was an increase in egg laying, which we interpret as terminal reproductive investment. Stress responses remained robust. Octopamine (OA), a stress neurohormone in insects, increased in concentration in the haemolymph after running, and the magnitude of the increase was the same even after repeated activation (i.e. there was no habituation of the response). There was also no increase in basal OA haemolymph levels. In a second experiment, crickets were exposed to a mantid (predator, Tenodera sinensis), a walking stick (nonpredator, Carausius morosus), or an empty container. None of the crickets exhibited fight-or-flight behaviour. However, mantid-exposed crickets decreased egg laying. There was no decrease in life span or mass. There was no change in basal levels of OA, or in the magnitude of the OA increase after running. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that repeated fight-or-flight behaviour induces reproductive responses that would be adaptive for a shortened life span. These responses differ from those produced by predator cues alone. Even short-lived animals, such as crickets, appear to alter reproduction depending on the relative predation risk and their residual reproductive potential.

AB We investigated whether calf age and calf size influence habitat choice by humpback whale mother-calf pairs in their breeding grounds. During 1997-2008, we conducted focal follows of mother-calf pairs in Hawaiian waters. Tail-fluke identification photographs and calf lengths (measured through video-grammetry) were obtained. Water depth and sea-bed terrain type were derived from GPS data. Identification photographs were matched so that the habitat choices could be established within breeding seasons. Across 72 mother-calf pairs resighted over various intervals within a breeding season, magnitude of depth change between initial and final sightings increased significantly with resighting interval. There was a significant increase from initial depth to final depth for relatively long resighting intervals (27-51 days), but no significant difference for relatively short resighting intervals (2-26 days). Although there was no preference for sea-bed terrain type by mother-calf pairs at their initial sighting, there was a preference for rugged terrain at their final resighting. A resource selection model indicated that the relative probability of a location being used by a mother-calf pair increased (as a function of water depth and rugged sea-bed terrain type) from initial to final sighting; a finding supported by subsequent tests of habitat preference versus availability. For 96 measured calves, calf length and water depth were positively correlated, even when ordinal day of measurement was controlled for statistically; a finding confirmed by a general linear model that simultaneously investigated the relationship between water depth, sea-bed terrain type, number of escorts, ordinal day and calf size. Thus, both calf age and size influence habitat choice by mother-calf pairs in their breeding grounds. The movement of mothers and their maturing calves into deeper waters where they favour rugged sea-bed terrain appears to be part of a suite of behavioural changes during the pre-migratory phase of residency in the breeding grounds.

AB When they detect a predator, some prey exhibit mobbing behaviour and produce mobbing calls that quickly draw a mixed conspecific and heterospecific group against the predator. While the efficiency of this strategy is often linked to interspecific communication, it raises the question of how animals recognize these signals as mobbing calls. It is usually suggested that associative learning about a predator when heterospecific mobbing calls are heard plays a crucial role in communication among species. Alternatively, phylogenetic conservation or evolutionary convergence could also explain this communication process. To determine whether prior experience is required to express a mobbing response, we conducted playback experiments with four European passerine species: great tit, Parus major, blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, coal tit, Periparus ater, and common chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs. The aim of the study was to examine whether they would respond to the mobbing signals of several North American passerines. As expected, because natural selection might shape a strong response to conspecific mobbing calls, our focal species reacted more strongly towards their own mobbing calls than towards those of American species. Nevertheless, for the three European species of tit, prior experience of heterospecific mobbing calls was not required to elicit a response. Additionally, for great tit and chaffinch, we found that acoustic similarity could explain behavioural responses to allopatric species. In contrast, such similarity was probably not the main mechanism underlying the response for the other two European species. Heterospecific response to mobbing calls probably involved many different mechanisms. Further studies focusing on each of these should allow us to understand their relative contribution to heterospecific communication. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Vibrations are a ubiquitous source of information in the environment, and are utilized by a wide range of animals. In this review, I concentrate on the propagation of vibrations across and through substrates, which are materials and surfaces. During the propagation process, physical constraints act on vibrational signals and cues, including loss of energy, filtering or distortion of information. An understanding of these physical mechanisms is important for answering biological questions about communication and information gathering, particularly the reach of signals/cues and how information can be separated from background noise. In this review, I explore the interdisciplinary links central to the field of biotremology to probe the extent to which physical laws limit information propagation. In what follows, I start with a primer in wave theory, before focusing on how the physical factors of wave type and substrate properties affect vibration propagation. I then turn to the interacting biological factors that influence signal/cue propagation during animal-substrate coupling, discussing the numerous behavioural and morphological adaptations employed to mitigate physical constraints. Following this, I then move from limits to possibilities, discussing how animals harness physical laws to provide useful information. Using examples from a wide range of animal systems and biological contexts, I highlight the array of evolutionary strategies to promote the propagation of information given inevitable physical constraints.

AB Despite their ubiquity in human behaviour, the communicative functions of nonverbal vocalizations remain poorly understood. Here, we analysed the acoustic structure of tennis grunts, nonverbal vocalizations produced in a competitive context. We predicted that tennis grunts convey information about the vocalizer and context, similar to nonhuman vocal displays. Specifically, we tested whether the fundamental frequency (F0) of tennis grunts conveys static cues to a player's sex, height, weight, and age, and covaries dynamically with tennis shot type (a proxy of body posture) and the progress and outcome of male and female professional tennis contests. We also performed playback experiments (using natural and resynthesized stimuli) to assess the perceptual relevance of tennis grunts. The F0 of tennis grunts predicted player sex, but not age or body size. Serve grunts had higher F0 than forehand and backhand grunts, grunts produced later in contests had higher F0 than those produced earlier, and grunts produced during contests that players won had a lower F0 than those produced during lost contests. This difference in F0 between losses and wins emerged early in matches, and did not change in magnitude as the match progressed, suggesting a possible role of physiological and/or psychological factors manifesting early or even before matches. Playbacks revealed that listeners use grunt F0 to infer sex and contest outcome. These findings indicate that tennis grunts communicate information about both the vocalizer and contest, consistent with nonhuman mammal vocalizations.

   DEPARTURE RULES; PREY-SELECTION; FOOD PATCHES
AB The marginal value theorem models patch departure decisions for foraging animals when resources are unevenly distributed. A key component of these models is the decelerating energy gain function used to represent patch depletion. However, the within-patch gain function has rarely been assessed in marine predators. We evaluated the gain functions in foraging bouts of northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris, using a long-term data set (2004-2012) that included complete foraging trips from 205 individual female northern elephant seals on 303 migrations as revealed by time-depth recorders and satellite tags (Argos System Inc.). Since the majority of putative prey capture attempts are associated with vertical excursions at the bottom of dives, we used vertical excursions to evaluate patch depletion across foraging bouts as defined using dive shapes. Rates of energy gain were measured using changes in mass and body composition across trips. Decelerating gain functions occurred in 83% of 77 820 foraging bouts, with the remainder showing accelerating functions. Rates of patch depletion strongly influenced patch residence times. Despite wide variation between individual patches, mean deceleration exponents did not vary with year or season, suggesting that average rates of patch depletion were relatively stable across the study period. The mean duration and number of dives in foraging bouts showed little annual or seasonal variation; however, the mean rate of vertical excursions during foraging dives varied and predicted rates of energy gain across migrations. The relative mean consistency of individual diving behaviour despite wide variation in geoposition supports the idea that northern elephant seals have evolved a foraging strategy that buffers against short-term variation in prey abundance and optimizes energy acquisition across the duration of the migration.

AB The evolution of migration combines the selective advantages of breeding with ephemeral resources at high latitude or altitude with the benefits of overwintering at distant sites with adequate resources to promote survival. Migration between sites involves changes in behaviour, especially the transition from migration to nesting, or in autumn, the transition to wintering stage. We focus here on the vernal transition. Because migration and onset of nesting are mutually exclusive events, transition from a social, hyperphagic and highly mobile state to territoriality and pair bonding involves complex behavioural changes. In Arctic regions, weather in spring is unpredictable adding another dimension of complexity to the migration/breeding transition. Nevertheless, the brief Arctic summer requires that songbirds arrive on the breeding grounds while conditions may still be unfavourable, thus delaying nesting until conditions ameliorate. This requires flexibility and coordination of migration behaviour to be able to leave if weather deteriorates, or to become territorial, attract a mate and begin nesting within hours when conditions permit. In Gambel's white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii, neuroendocrine regulation of reproductive development progresses throughout vernal migration so that males and females are mature when they arrive on the nesting grounds, but final ovarian maturation leading to ovulation and reproductive behaviours is suppressed. What provides the 'brake' to the onset of nesting? We focus on the adrenocortical response to acute stress that is greatly increased at arrival, especially in males, probably to enable flexibility in behavioural responses to severe weather. More recent evidence suggests that a hypothalamic peptide, gonadotropin-inhibiting hormone (GnIH) may provide the brake for the onset of nesting without suppressing development of a functional reproductive system. Experimental investigations show that gene silencing of GnIH in the brain increases singing and reproductive behaviours accompanying the onset of nesting. Thus we suggest that corticosteroids and GnIH play important regulatory roles specifically at the transition from vernal migration to the onset of nesting.

AB In many species, females may be particularly selective about the expected direct benefits of choosing a potential mate or the male's genetic contribution to their offspring. Growing evidence suggests that female choosiness can also be influenced, for instance, by local abiotic factors, the social environment or the presence of heterospecifics. In amphibians that breed in highly temporary ponds with limited trophic resources (such as the yellow-bellied toad, Bombina variegata), competition during larval development may have a strong impact on the fitness of offspring. Accordingly, one might expect females to apply hierarchical decision making, balancing intraspecific competition risks during larval growth against the relative indirect benefits associated with the quality of the male. To investigate this issue, we conducted experiments in seminatural enclosures to test whether the preference of yellow-bellied toad females for good call attractiveness (determined by fundamental frequency) is affected by the risk of larval competition within the pond occupied by the callers. Overall, our results showed that females have a preference for low-frequency calls when prior information does not enable them to assess the relative quality of ponds. However, when prior information enables females to unambiguously determine relative pond quality, females appear to apply hierarchical decision making in which the quality of a pond prevails over call cues related to the quality of the male.

AB Experiments inspired by Aesop's fable The crow and the pitcher have been suggested to show that some birds (rooks, Corvus frugilegus, New Caledonian crows, Corvus moneduloides, and Eurasian jays, Garrulus glandarius) understand cause-effect relationships pertaining to water displacement. For example, the birds may prefer to drop stones in water rather than in sand in order to retrieve a floating food morsel, suggesting that they understand that only the level of water can be so raised. Here we re-evaluate the evidence for causal understanding in all published experiments (23 928 choices by 36 individuals). We first show that commonly employed statistical methods cannot disentangle the birds' initial performance on a task (which is taken as an indicator of causal understanding) from trial-and-error learning that may occur during the course of the experiment. We overcome this shortcoming with a new statistical analysis that quantifies initial performance and learning effects separately. We present robust evidence of trialand-error learning in many tasks, and of an initial preference in a few. We also show that both seeming demonstrations of causal understanding and of lack of it can be understood based on established properties of instrumental learning. We conclude that Aesop's fable experiments have not yet produced evidence of causal understanding, and we suggest how the experimental designs can be modified to yield better tests of causal cognition.

AB Animal personality has become a major topic in animal behaviour. Much recent progress has come from the use of the open-field test, which is routinely used to separate individuals into fast and slow explorers. However, there is no standard way to conduct the test and it is unclear whether the test really measures exploration. Here, we addressed these issues by combining an open-field test with a battery of independent assays intended to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the behavioural traits suggested to measure exploration in the open-field test. Our study subjects were common mynas, Acridotheres tristis, introduced to Australia. The analyses confirmed that the open-field test allows individuals to be separated according to their propensity to explore, mainly through metrics related to spatial and object examination of the novel cage. However, other metrics classically used to describe exploratory behaviour, such as the latency to enter the novel space, reflected shyness rather than exploration. The open-field test can therefore be a powerful tool to investigate personality, but only if the biological meanings of the metrics derived from the test are properly validated with independent behavioural assays.

AB In species with parental care, offspring often solicit food through elaborate begging displays. Begging is thought to be a reflection of offspring need, but short-term fluctuations in begging do not necessarily provide reliable information. Parents thus have to adjust their provisioning behaviour to the changing demands of their offspring, while minimizing the costs of responding to unreliable information. We conducted two experiments with blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, in which we tested how parents respond to short-term and long-term changes in begging intensity. In the first experiment we investigated how parents respond to increased begging during a single nest visit. In the second experiment we investigated how parents respond to increased begging during every nest visit for 1 h. Parents did not return faster to the nest during the short-term manipulation. Contrary to our expectations, however, parents also did not return faster to the nest in response to long-term manipulation. Instead, parents spent more time in the nestbox during both the short-term and the long-term manipulation. Our results highlight that the general pattern of a positive parental response to increased begging may not be a universal one. Comparisons across species and populations may help reveal the factors underlying variation in parental responsiveness to begging. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Females often benefit from the ability to assess courting males using multiple signal modalities. Differences in the transmission properties of each signal modality, however, may hinder a female's ability to detect signals, and result in variation in individual sensory experience. Such variation in sensory experience would include, for example, variation in courtship modality experience. It is unknown, however, whether differences in courtship modality experience affect preferences for unimodal and multimodal signals. We tested the effects of juvenile courtship modality experience on adult mate preferences in the wolf spider, Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz). Male S. ocreata use a combination of visual and vibratory signals as a multimodal signal, and female S. ocreata (without previous experience) have been shown to weigh unimodal vibratory and unimodal visual signals equally. Whether individual variation in courtship modality experience affects the relative weight of unimodal signals is unknown not only in S. ocreata, but is poorly understood across animal taxa. We used playback techniques to manipulate the courtship modality experience (unimodal visual signals, unimodal vibratory signals, multimodal signals, or no signals) of penultimate females. Upon maturation, we counted the number of receptivity displays towards each unimodal signal and a multimodal signal on three consecutive days of single presentation studies. In no-choice adult trials, courtship modality experience affected unimodal, but not multimodal, preferences. Female S. ocreata preferred the familiar unimodal signal in no-choice presentations (e. g. females exposed to vibratory signals were more receptive toward those signals). However, females preferred multimodal signals over unimodal signals, regardless of their juvenile courtship modality experience. In two-choice trials, female S. ocreata significantly preferred visual signals, regardless of their experience. Taken together, an individual's courtship modality experience has the ability to affect unimodal courtship preferences, but may be limited based on whether adult females are presented unimodal signals in no-choice or two-choice trials.

AB Habitat selection trade-offs between avoiding predation and gaining energy are well studied, but similar trade-offs resulting from multiple threats to survival remain poorly understood. We studied how seaside sparrows, Ammodramus maritimus, approach nest site selection decisions to avoid threats to nesting success from predation and tidal flooding. Along a nest height gradient, nest site selection to avoid tidal flooding (i.e. placing nests higher) may make seaside sparrow nests more vulnerable to predation, and selection to avoid predation may make nests susceptible to flooding. We monitored nesting success rates and nest site selection decisions of breeding seaside sparrow pairs at five sites near Brunswick, Georgia in April-July of 2013-2015. We found that seaside sparrows encountered a nest site selection trade-off along a gradient of nest height. Nest height had an effect on survival probability during each of our study years, with positive effects of nest height on predation probability and negative effects of nest height on flooding probability observed in some years. Sparrows dealt with this trade-off by altering their nest site selection in relation to a threat's predictability; low within-season variability in predation risk and high information about predator presence in open marshes make predation risk more predictable than the magnitude of tidal flooding, which is governed by unpredictable and variable winds. Sparrows responded to predictable predation threats by nesting at lower nest heights in years with higher predation risk, but sparrows responded to unpredictable flooding threats by placing nests higher off the ground but only following nest failure from flooding. Understanding decision making through a lens of threat predictability could provide a useful approach for studies of other animals' habitat selection trade-offs.

AB The mating propensity of an individual is expected to depend on the costs and benefits of mating, which may vary across the sexes and across different mating opportunities. Both males and females should gain fitness either by mating with multiple mates and/or by mating with higher quality mates. Therefore, an important question in the area of sexual selection concerns what makes an optimal mate. From a female perspective, females are expected to prefer males providing direct material benefits for the present generation and/or indirect genetic benefits for their offspring in the subsequent generation. Because the male's contribution to these benefits can be limited, as reproduction imposes nontrivial costs on males, the female's benefits from mating can vary markedly as a function of the condition of her mate. In capital breeding species, in which males invest most of their larval resources in a single reproductive event, the females are likely to prefer to mate with virgin males in good condition (i.e. males that have developed on high-quality food sources). In this study we used the European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana, to test experimentally whether the larval nutrition and mating history of males influence their quality as mates. We provided wild L. botrana males originating from different cultivars and vineyards with unlimited access to standardized females, and examined the lifetime reproductive success of the males and the consequences for the reproductive output of females. Our results show that 'male quality' depended on both the male larval origin and mating history, and that females discriminated between males and mated more with males having high spermatophore quality (virgin males and males from certain cultivars or vineyards) to obtain substantial direct benefits.

AB A competitive resource-based environment such as larval crowding is an important stress factor in the life history of holometabolous insects such as Drosophila melanogaster and can have major consequences for adult fitness through its direct effects on body size. We investigated precopulatory sexual behaviour, which is an important subset of adult fitness, using D. melanogaster populations adapted to larval crowding for 100+ generations. We found that selected males evolved significantly higher courtship frequency than their ancestral controls. While we found a negative correlation between larval density and adult courtship frequency using low, moderate and high larval rearing densities, we also found that supplementation of live yeast, which is an important dietary component in their life cycle, caused a significant rise in courtship frequency. We further dissected out the male and female behavioural components that contribute to overall courtship activity by factorially combining selected and ancestral male and female types, reared in both low and high larval densities, and found that courtship frequency of selected males was higher with selected females than with control females. We also quantified the mating frequency, a crude measure for mating success, and found that increased courtship frequency in selected populations did not lead to increased mating success. From the results of this and a previous study, we conclude that precopulatory sexual activity in these populations is not traded for life span.

AB Optimal foraging theory (OFT) suggests that air-breathing diving animals should minimize costs associated with feeding under water (e.g. travel time, oxygen loss) while simultaneously maximizing benefits gained from doing so (e.g. foraging time, energy gain). Humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, foraging along the Western Antarctic Peninsula appear to forage according to OFT, but the direct costs and benefits in terms of their behaviours (e.g. allocation of time) have not been examined. We compared the foraging behaviour of humpback whales in this region inferred from multisensor high-resolution recording tags to their behaviour predicted by OFT time allocation models assuming the following currencies were being maximized: (1) the proportion of time spent foraging, (2) the net rate of energetic gain and/or (3) the ratio of energy gained to energy expended (i.e. efficiency). Model predictions for all three currencies were similar, suggesting any of these OFT models were suitable for comparison with the observed data. However, agreement between observed and optimal behaviours varied widely depending on the physiological and behavioural values used to derive optimal predictions, highlighting the need for an improved understanding of cetacean physiology. Despite this, many of the theoretical OFT predictions were supported: shallow dives (i.e. < 100 m), which were short and executed most frequently, yielded the highest proportions of foraging time, and the greatest net rates of energy gain and were the most efficient. In addition, dive and foraging times increased in duration rapidly with increasing maximum dive depths to approximately 100 m and then at lower rates with deeper dives. Our findings offer a thorough examination of the applicability of time allocation OFT models to the behaviours of a large, air-breathing, diving predator and provide insights into the foraging ecology and physiology of humpback whales in the Western Antarctic Peninsula.

   SELECTION
AB Same-sex sexual behaviour (SSSB) occurs in animals ranging from insects to mammals, yet its evolutionary origins remain enigmatic. Is it adaptive, or has it evolved as a by-product of selection for other traits? Using data from two experiments on male spring field crickets, Gryllus veletis, we tested whether SSSB is socially adaptive, sexually adaptive, correlated with other sexual behaviours and/or a result of sex misidentification. By identifying how sexual experience, audience composition, mate attraction signalling time, body size/mass, food composition and aggression levels correlated with levels of SSSB, we found support for the misidentification and phenotypic correlation hypotheses. More aggressive males were more likely to court other males, and males who spent the most time signalling to attract mates tended to spend the most time courting other males, suggesting that aggression, mate signalling effort and same-sex courtship may all be phenotypically correlated. However, the positive relationship between mate attraction signalling effort and probability of expressing same-sex courtship only occurred in males on a high-carbohydrate, low-protein food, suggesting that the expression of such a phenotypic correlation may be constrained by dietary carbohydrate availability. Finally, males were more likely to be courted if they were less aggressive and spent little time signalling for mates, but, for the latter, only if they were on high-carbohydrate foods, suggesting that together, diet, which may alter chemical cues involved in sex identification, and behavioural cues may lead to sex misidentification. Thus, SSSB in male G. veletis does not appear to be adaptive, probably evolving instead as a by-product of selection for other sexually selected traits. By investigating both proximate and ultimate factors contributing to the evolutionary enigma of SSSB, we may gain important insights into the selective forces shaping aggression, social interactions and reproductive strategies in social animals.

AB Studies on mate choice mainly focus on the evolution of signals that would maximize the probability of finding a good-quality partner. Most models of sexual selection rely on the implicit assumption that individuals can freely compare and spot the best mates in a heterogeneous population. Comparatively few studies have investigated the consequences of the mate-sampling process. Several sampling strategies have been studied from theoretical or experimental perspectives. They belong to two families of decision rules: best-of-n strategies (individuals sample n partners before choosing the best one within this pool) or threshold strategies (individuals sequentially sample the available partners and choose the first one whose quality exceeds a threshold criterion). Almost all models studying these strategies neglect the effect of scramble competition. If each paired individual is removed from the population of available partners, the distribution of partner quality dynamically changes as a function of the strategies of the other competitors. By means of simple simulations assuming opportunity costs, to the exclusion of all other costs, we show that scramble competition is a sufficient constraint to severely impair the evolution of choosy decision rules. In most cases, the evolutionarily stable strategy is to have a very low acceptance threshold or to sample two individuals at most in the population. This result may explain some discrepancies between predictions from previous models and their experimental validations. It also emphasizes the importance of considering the pairing process in studies of sexual selection. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Two explanations have been offered for this: (1) neuromuscular activity: males need increased sodium for flight because they are more active flyers than females; and (2) direct benefits: sodium is a type of direct benefit provided by males to females via ejaculate during mating. Surprisingly, there is little direct experimental evidence for either of these. In this study, we examined both explanations using the pipevine swallowtail butterfly, Battus philenor L. If sodium increases neuromuscular activity, males consuming sodium should be better fliers than males without sodium. If males collect sodium for nuptial gifts that benefit their mates, males consuming sodium may have greater mating success than males without sodium. In that case, females then need an honest cue/signal of the quality of male-provided direct benefits that they can assess before mating. If sodium affects male courtship flight by increasing neuromuscular activity, how a male courts could serve as such a premating cue/signal of male benefit quality. Therefore, sodium may benefit males in terms of obtaining mates by increasing their neuromuscular activity. In this study we found that males that consumed sodium courted more vigorously and had greater mating success than males that consumed water. In addition, the courtship displays of males consuming sodium were significantly different from those of males consuming water, providing a possible honest cue/signal of male benefit quality that females can assess. Interestingly, we did not find evidence that sodium consumption affects male flight outside of courtship. That only aspects of male flight related to mating were affected by sodium, while aspects of general flight were not, is consistent with the idea that sodium may benefit males in terms of obtaining mates via effects on neuromuscular activity.

AB In Lepidoptera, male investment in the ejaculate usually declines over consecutive matings, a depletion that could have profound consequences for female reproductive output. Since successive matings can affect the ability of males to provide phenotypic benefits, there may be strong selection for females to discriminate between males with different mating experience. The aim of our study was to determine whether monandrous females of the European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana, are able to discriminate between males of different quality based on their mating experience in order to maximize direct benefits (by receiving large spermatophores from virgin males) and minimize mating costs (by avoiding low-quality nonvirgin males). Nonvirgin males produced spermatophores five times smaller than those of virgin males; consequently, mating with nonvirgin males significantly reduced female fecundity and increased their motivation to remate. In a mate preference experiment, we found that females were more likely to mate with virgin males and more frequently rejected nonvirgin mates. Moreover, nonvirgin males required more time to achieve mating than virgin males. Our results suggest that females are able to discriminate between males with different mating experience, and prefer virgin males, thereby maximizing direct benefits associated with receiving large spermatophores.

AB The relation between mating system and sex-biased dispersal has been debated for three decades. However, the relative importance of the processes involved in this relation remains poorly known. In this study, we paid special attention to kin competition. We built an adaptive individual-based model fixing three mating systems (monandry, polyandry, monogamy) in a metapopulation, and allowing dispersal across patches to evolve independently for males and females. Our simulations showed that a difference in the number of mates can determine the evolution of sex-biased dispersal. Dispersal appears male biased under monandry and polyandry, but balanced under monogamy. By contrast, we showed that inbreeding can influence but does not promote sex-biased dispersal, and that the primary sex ratio does not qualitatively affect the evolution of sex-biased dispersal under monandry and polyandry. These results are driven by the interaction of two factors: the variation in reproductive success between patches in the metapopulation and kin competition. These two factors are influenced by the mating system, which modifies both the competition for access to partners and the mean relatedness between individuals. To ascertain that kin competition actually drives sex-biased dispersal, we made simulations with destruction of any genetic structure in the metapopulation, and we found that in this case dispersal was not sex biased.

AB Social relationships established early in life can have effects on social structure and influence individual fitness. Eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, nurse their young for at least 18 months, allowing for a strong bond to develop between mothers and young. Because most female kangaroos are philopatric, the mother-offspring relationship established during lactation could persist into adulthood, resulting in clusters of female kin. Strong social bonds, however, are based on affiliative behaviours and frequent interactions. In particular, one might not expect strong bonds among related individuals unless there are advantages to interacting with relatives compared to associating with unrelated conspecifics. We examined development of the mother-offspring relationship in eastern grey kangaroos from permanent emergence from the pouch to the time of weaning. We studied a high-density population at Wilsons Promontory National Park, Victoria, Australia. There were few differences in the behaviour of sons and daughters towards mothers. However, daughters foraged slightly closer than sons to their mothers and daughters were weaned approximately 2 months later than sons if the mother did not have a surviving large pouch young. Mothers associated more closely with their daughters than their sons when offspring were aged 10-29 months but neither sex associated closely with their mothers beyond 33 months of age. Mothers never intervened to defend their young from aggressive individuals and it was the offspring that maintained spatial proximity to their mothers. Kangaroo mothers had few interactions with their juvenile offspring other than nursing. Females may be philopatric and settle near close kin as adults but kangaroos appear to have few of those early affiliative interactions necessary for social bonds to develop.

AB Intergroup contests determine access to resources and influence the evolution of group living in social species. Asymmetries in resource-holding potential and payoffs should influence the outcome and intensity of such contests. We evaluated predictors of contest outcome and intensity using data collected over 40 months from 6 groups of wild blue monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis. We found increased odds of winning when a group was larger and used the contest site more than its opponent, and when contests occurred closer to the group's home range centre while farther from the opponent's centre. However, a larger difference in group size (across five pairs of opposing groups) did not predict a greater proportion of contests won by the larger group. Some evidence suggested increased odds of a draw when group sizes were more similar. In addition, contests were longer and more aggressive when groups were more similar in size and when the contest site was similarly central in both groups' home ranges. Contests were also more aggressive when the opposing groups' use of the contest site was more similar. Overall, asymmetries in resource-holding potential (i.e. group size) and/or payoffs related to the contest's location influenced a group's competitive advantage, the likelihood of a draw and the intensity of intergroup contests. Although comparable data are limited, it seems clear that both types of asymmetries can play a role in determining the outcome and intensity of intergroup contests, and that the relative power of each may vary across species.

AB Intense intrasexual competition for breeding opportunities is a characteristic of cooperatively breeding species with high reproductive skew. In such 'singular' cooperative breeders, females suffer greater variability in direct reproductive success than do males, and this in turn leads to greater intrasexual competition in females. Under such circumstances, selection should favour traits that enhance female competitive ability, such as size, fighting skill or aggression. However, despite burgeoning interest in female intrasexual competition, there is limited evidence that female cooperative breeders exhibit more pronounced competitive traits than do males. We examined whether intrasexual competition has influenced the expression of a competitive behavioural trait (i.e. prey theft) in a 'singular', cooperatively breeding mammal, the dwarf mongoose, Helogale parvula. We used both observational and experimental data to assess whether wild dwarf mongooses exploit interference foraging competition to persecute their reproductive rivals, and whether the sexes differ with regard to this behaviour. We found that nonalpha female mongooses preferentially stole from other females rather than males, and that, under natural foraging conditions, they were more likely to steal prey from their closest rival (i.e. the female immediately below themselves in the dominance hierarchy) than from easier targets much lower in rank. In contrast, male dwarf mongooses (and alpha females) did not exhibit any sex bias, stealing prey indiscriminately from all lower ranking group members. We conclude that the acute intrasexual rivalry suffered by female dwarf mongooses has led to the differential development of this competitive behavioural trait.

AB Many species of birds conspicuously call or sing early in the morning, thereby creating an avian dawn chorus. While these vocalizations probably function to advertise territory occupancy, when species should start singing is not well understood. A common explanation is that birds sing at dawn to maximize signal transmission due to low atmospheric turbulence during the early morning (acoustic transmission hypothesis); however, this idea does not explain why species in the chorus often start singing at different times. Here we test a version of this hypothesis: interspecific differences in call start times during the dawn chorus are a result of noise avoidance at the song's frequency. To test this hypothesis we quantified the spectral and temporal properties of the dawn chorus and the acoustic landscape at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Inspection of 36 dawn recordings at 12 sites identified 27 species of birds, with most species having consistent start times across sites and days. In contrast to expectations, we found that birds singing within the same frequency range did not temporally partition acoustic space during the chorus. Discriminant function analysis revealed that nearly all species in the chorus produced distinctive vocalizations. Surprisingly, song start time was positively related to peak frequency. Birds with high-frequency vocalizations did not begin singing until after orthopteran insects stopped producing loud sounds at the same frequencies. These results suggest that birds that sing at frequency bands shared by nocturnal insects avoid acoustic masking by delaying song start times. Playbacks of emerald cicada, Zammara smaragdina, buzzes conducted during the dawn chorus produced an inhibitory effect on the call activity of birds singing within the bandwidth of cicada calls. Thus, insect noise appears to create an important frequency-dependent constraint on the calling activity of birds. This constraint is overcome by temporal partitioning of acoustic space.

AB Newborn rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, locate their mother's nipples through typical orocephalic movements elicited by odour stimuli, in particular by the mammary pheromone (MP). The MP also promotes neonatal odour learning: after single pairing with the MP, an initially neutral odorant becomes able to elicit sucking-related head-searching/oral-grasping movements. However, the behavioural significance of the MP-induced odour learning remains poorly understood. We carried out three experiments to explore its influence on milk intake and compare its consequences with those resulting from nursing-induced conditioning. First, pups conditioned to an odorant by pairing with the MP on postnatal days 2-3 were shown to gain more milk on day 4 during nursing by a female carrying the conditioned odorant along the nipple lines. Second, surprisingly, nursing-induced odour learning failed to induce this effect. We therefore determined whether the location of the conditioned odorant on or around the nipples modified the pups' milk intake: it appeared that after nursing-induced conditioning, the pups gained more milk when the conditioned odorant was applied directly on the nipples. Moreover, several results showed that pups could learn different odorants during successive days of conditioning, and that the more recently acquired cue was the most influential on milk intake. This study suggests that the MP plays a critical role to ensure sucking performance in newborn rabbits, not only through its releasing effect, but also through its ability to promote the acquisition of novel odours carried by the mother.

AB Behavioural flexibility is essential for survival in a world with changing contingencies and its evolution is linked to complex physical and social environments. Serial reversal learning, in which reward contingencies change frequently, is a key indicator of behavioural flexibility. While many vertebrates are capable of serial reversal learning, only birds and mammals have previously been shown to use rule-based decision strategies (e.g. win-stay/lose-shift) to become better at learning changes in reward contingencies across reversals. While the lifestyles of many amphibians have a degree of complexity, the evidence to date suggests limited levels of behavioural flexibility. Here, we show that the poison frog Dendrobates auratus, which has evolved complex parental behaviours that likely depend on remembering locations in a flexible manner, can use a win-stay/lose-shift strategy to increase their behavioural flexibility across sequential changes in the reward contingencies in a visual discrimination task. Furthermore, probe trials demonstrate that the frogs used the provided visual cues to spatially orient in the maze in a manner reminiscent of complex spatial cognition. Our study provides the first evidence of serial reversal learning in frogs and is the first to demonstrate the use of a rule-based learning strategy in a nonavian, nonmammalian species.

AB Ever since Karl von Frisch's Nobel Prize-winning work in the early 1900s, bees have served as an important model system for the study of learning, memory and foraging behaviour. Bees can learn about floral features including colour, scent, texture and electrostatic charge, and show surprisingly sophisticated forms of learning. However, nearly every study of bee cognition and foraging to date has used a sole reward: nectar, most often in the form of a simple sucrose solution. Plants also offer a number of other rewards to pollinators, the most prevalent being pollen that bees collect as their primary source of protein. Indeed, a significant proportion of angiosperm species are nectarless, rewarding bees with pollen alone. Surprisingly, whether free-flying bees can learn visual features based solely on floral pollen rewards is unknown. Here we show that bees can learn to associate multiple floral features with a pure pollen reward. Furthermore, these associations are remembered long term, comparable to bees' memory for nectar associations. These findings raise new questions about bee learning and the evolutionary history between plants and bee pollinators. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Insects, as well as vertebrates, possess morphological, physiological and behavioural sexual dimorphisms. Because they are commonly bigger and produce eggs, female insects usually require more and specific energy intake. In addition to quantitative and qualitative requirements in food for reproduction, animals also have to avoid eating lethal toxins. The praying mantis Tenodera aridifolia is a good model to investigate sexual differences in feeding behaviour because its sexual dimorphism is marked in terms of morphology and behaviour. Here, we observed that females ate approximately four times as much prey as males. We then investigated the attacking and feeding behaviours of praying mantises by presenting mealworms injected with bitter solutions (quinine hydrochloride dihydrate or denatonium benzoate at 50 or 500 mM) as prey. We observed that males had a low level of acceptance for bitter prey: unlike females, they reduced consumption of mealworms injected with 50 mM of these bitter solutions. However, they showed higher motivation (unlike females, their rate of attack on prey increased when they reduced their consumption of mealworms). This difference in ingestion between the sexes did not seem to be due to different sensitivities for these bitter solutions (there was no detectable difference between the sexes in time taken to drink drops of these bitter solutions). Instead, this seems related to males and females having different feeding strategies based on different nutritive requirements. The possible effects of nutritional composition of prey on avoidance behaviours in predatory insects are discussed. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The use of evolutionary game theory and the concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) have come under criticism lately because game-theoretic models are often constrained to overly simplistic situations. Furthermore, game-theoretic models commit the behavioural gambit, that is, they assume that individuals have some unspecified decision mechanism that duplicates the outcomes that would be expected from natural selection acting on genetic alternatives. The producer-scrounger game is an ideal illustration of the criticisms aimed at the game-theoretic approach; it has generated a number of game-theoretic models that make specific predictions for highly simplified foraging conditions. Simulation models of the producer-scrounger game that incorporate the linear operator learning rule, however, have been more successful in replicating the empirical results. In these models, groups of animals forage for patches of food using a linear operator learning rule. The linear operator model furthermore provides a new prediction about the effect of variation in patch quality within a producer-scrounger game. Current models based on evolutionarily stable strategies and empirical investigations have always assumed or used patches of uniform quality. Yet patches vary in quality and some environments are potentially more variable than others. The linear operator model predicts an increase in scrounging behaviour when patch quality varies. We tested this prediction using captive foraging flocks of male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in two treatments with variable and nonvariable patch quality. The results show that as individuals have more experience in the variable environment, they increase their scrounging behaviour. Linear operator models may therefore provide a general and empirically valid means of exploring the outcome of animal decisions in social foraging situations too complex to be addressed by evolutionary game models.

AB Parental attractiveness influences paternal and maternal efforts in a wide range of animals that exhibit biparental care. However, we still lack an understanding concerning the direction of the covariance between attractiveness and parental effort, perhaps because studies typically consider only one or a subset of multiple attractiveness signals. In this study we investigated predictions of four hypotheses about the relationship between attractiveness traits (plumage coloration, song and leap display traits) and parental effort (feeding rates) in a wild population of the blue-black grassquit, Volatinia jacarina, a Neotropical sexually dichromatic bird with biparental care. Paternal effort was negatively correlated with male blue-black coloration (UV chroma) and maternal effort was positively correlated with male provisioning rate. Thus, more attractive males relative to the UV chroma are worse fathers relative to less attractive males in this trait. However, female provisioning rate was positively correlated with another male attractive trait: the blue-black plumage coverage. The song, leap display and other features of male coloration were not associated with either male or female parental effort. Taken together, these results support the parental-mating trade-off hypothesis for paternal behaviour, which predicts that attractive males should invest less in current offspring in order to acquire extrapair matings. Also, our results partially support the positive differential allocation hypothesis: although females invested highly in offspring of males with more blue-black plumage coverage, they did not compensate for the low investment of males with UV-shifted blue-black plumage. We highlight the need for future studies to consider multiple sexual traits in order to investigate the relationship between attractiveness and parental investment.

AB In insects with sex role reversal in mating, in which females actively court males, large and nutritious ejaculates are a common direct benefit to females. Such ejaculates are costly for males to produce and their size and composition can depend on male condition. However, the fitness effects to males and females of such condition-dependent provisioning are less clear. Here, we studied the effects of phenotypic condition on mating behaviour, ejaculate size and reproductive output in honeylocust beetles, Megabruchidius dorsalis. Our experimental design allowed us to disentangle the independent effects of juvenile resource acquisition in both sexes (as reflected by body size) and resource acquisition by adult males (feeding). We show that phenotypic condition of both sexes had sizeable independent and interactive effects on mating and reproductive output. In males, resources accrued during the juvenile phase had significant but relatively marginal effects on male mating and reproduction. Male adult feeding, in contrast, had sizeable effects on almost all aspects of male and female reproduction, through the nutritional effects of ejaculates in females. We discuss our findings in light of the reversal of both sex roles and sexual size dimorphism exhibited by this species, relative to related species. Our results highlight the importance of testing the interaction of male and female condition on components of fitness to understand the evolution and maintenance of mating systems.

AB Some social signals are sexually selected both by female mating preferences and by male-male competition for mates. Studies of the behavioural mechanisms that mediate responses to these signals provide insight into how sexual selection operates. Courting male fiddler crabs, Uca terpsichores, sometimes build large sand structures called hoods at the openings to their burrows. Hoods attract females to males' burrows for mating because they elicit landmark orientation, a behaviour that is selected by predation. Males also orient visually to their own hoods when errors are introduced experimentally into their nonvisual mechanism for path integration. These errors occur naturally when males move far from their burrows to court females or fight neighbours. Here we explored whether courting males also use hoods as visual beacons to the location of their burrow. Crabs that rely on path integration to orient to their burrow keep their lateral axis closely aligned with the bearing home. We therefore measured and compared the distances males moved from their burrows and the maximum deviations between males' body axes and home bearings for males that did and did not build hoods, males that had their hood removed and males that had a hood added to their burrow. Males with hoods did not range further from their burrows than those without hoods, but they exhibited greater maximum deviations between their body axes and the bearings to their burrows. Hoods may facilitate courtship by allowing males to move more freely than when they rely on nonvisual path integration alone. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Scientists are increasingly coming to realize that oncogenic phenomena are both frequent and detrimental for animals, and must therefore be taken into account when studying the biology of wildlife species and ecosystem functioning. Here, we argue that several behaviours that are routine in an individual's life can be associated with cancer risks, or conversely prevent/cure malignancies and/or alleviate their detrimental consequences for fitness. Although such behaviours are theoretically expected to be targets for natural selection, little attention has been devoted to explore how they influence animal behaviour. This essay provides a summary of these issues as well as an overview of the possibilities offered by this research topic, including possible applications for cancer prevention and treatments in humans.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) reflectance and UV vision are both common among animals and are known to function in mate choice and male-male competition among numerous vertebrates. In comparison, examples of functional UV reflectance among invertebrates are scarce. In a territorial damselfly (Megaloprepus caerulatus), data from natural territorial contests indicated that males assessed the male wing band of rivals. We investigated the functions of (1) UV reflectance of the male-specific white wing band in territorial contests by staging contests between size-and age-matched, control and UV-reduced males, and (2) UV reflectance of the female-specific wing tip in sex recognition by presenting control and UV-reduced females to territorial males. Results showed that males whose UV reflectance of the white wing bands was reduced were more likely to lose contests. This effect dissipated late in the reproductive season, when breeding sites typically decrease in value. UV reflectance of the female wing tips did not affect male sex recognition, nor did it affect the detectability of a female at a male territory. Our study provides the first direct evidence from invertebrates, and one of the few among all animals, that UV reflectance of wing ornamentation affects the outcome of male contests in the field.

AB The adaptive canalization hypothesis predicts that traits with low phenotypic plasticity are more fitness relevant, because they have been canalized via strong past selection, than traits with high phenotypic plasticity. Based on differing male body size plasticities of the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis (low plasticity) and Neoseiulus californicus (high plasticity), we accordingly hypothesized that small male body size entails higher costs in female choice and male-male competition in P. persimilis than N. californicus. Males of both species are highly polygynous but females differ in the level of polyandry (low level in P. persimilis; medium level in N. californicus). We videotaped the mating interactions in triplets of either P. persimilis or N. californicus, consisting of a virgin female (small or standard-sized) and a small and a standard-sized male. Mating by both small and standard-sized P. persimilis females was biased towards standard-sized males, resulting from the interplay between female preference for standard-sized males and the inferiority of small males in male-male competition. In contrast, mating by N. californicus females was equally balanced between small and standard-sized males. Small N. californicus males were more aggressive ('Napoleon complex') in male-male competition, reducing the likelihood of encounter between the standard-sized male and the female, and thus counterbalancing female preference for standard-sized males. Our results support the hypothesis that male body size is more important to fitness in the low-level polyandrous P. persimilis than in the medium-level polyandrous N. californicus and provide a key example of the implications of sexually selected body size plasticity on mating behaviour.

AB Social animals must time and coordinate their behaviour to ensure the benefits of grouping, resulting in collective movements and the potential emergence of leaders and followers. However, individuals often differ consistently from one another in how they cope with their environment, a phenomenon known as animal personality, which may affect how individuals use coordination rules and requiring them to compromise. Here we tracked the movements of pairs of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, separated by a transparent partition that allowed them to observe and interact with one another in a context containing cover. Individuals differed consistently in their tendency to approach their partner's compartment during collective movements. The strength of this social attraction was positively correlated with the behavioural coordination between members of a pair but was negatively correlated with an individual's tendency to lead. Social attraction may form part of a broader behavioural syndrome as it was predicted by the boldness of an individual, measured in isolation prior to the observation of pairs, and by the boldness of the partner. We found that bolder fish, and those paired with bolder partners, tended to approach their partner's compartment less closely. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms that govern the dynamics and functioning of social groups and the emergence and maintenance of consistent behavioural differences.

AB Upon discovering food, common ravens, Corvus corax, produce far-reaching 'haa' calls or yells, which are individually distinct and signal food availability to conspecifics. Here, we investigated whether ravens respond differently to 'haa' calls of known and unknown individuals. In a paired playback design, we tested responses to 'haa' call sequences in a group containing individually marked free-ranging ravens. We simultaneously played call sequences of a male and a female raven in two different locations and varied familiarity (known or unknown to the local group). Ravens responded strongest to dyads containing familiar females, performing more scan flights above and by perching in trees near the respective speaker. Acoustic analysis of the calls used as stimuli showed no sex-, age-or familiarity-specific acoustic cues, but highly significant classification results at the individual level. Taken together, our findings indicate that ravens respond to individual characteristics in 'haa' calls, and choose whom to approach for feeding, i.e. join social allies and avoid dominant conspecifics. This is the first study to investigate responses to 'haa' calls under natural conditions in a wild population containing individually marked ravens. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Social learning is a widespread phenomenon allowing animals to use information provided by other animals when presented with a novel situation. A number of recent studies suggest that nonspecific Pavlovian conditioning may explain some forms of social learning, so that animals simply learn to use the presence of conspecifics as a predictor of reward. In this study, we investigated the conditions of flower choice copying behaviour in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We raised bumblebees in controlled laboratory conditions to compare the social learning performance of bees with different previous associative experiences. We investigated the influence of foraging experience with conspecifics on transferring the preference for a socially indicated flower type to flowers of the same species not occupied by conspecifics. Observers that had the opportunity to associate conspecifics with rewarding flowers instantly acquired the social flower preference and equally visited occupied and unoccupied flowers of the socially indicated flower type (stimulus enhancement). Such usage of social cues requires prior experience with live conspecifics (bees familiarized only with inanimate model bees did not display the same generalization from socially indicated flowers to other flowers of the same type). By contrast, nonsocial cues and immobile model bees, even if they had been previously associated with rewarding flowers, resulted in a wholly different pattern of preference, where observers preferred only those individual flowers with the nonsocial cue or model bee attached (local enhancement). This difference suggests a special salience of live social cues as information providers and results in different patterns of associative learning than nonsocial cues.

AB Introduced predators are a major driver of worldwide biodiversity loss. However, if endemic prey are not rapidly extirpated by invaders, they may evolve antipredator traits that promote coexistence with invaders. We studied antipredator behaviours in fish-naive and fish-exposed populations of Cascades frog tadpoles, Rana cascadae, to test the hypothesis that fish-exposed populations have evolved stronger defensive behaviours. We raised tadpoles from field-collected eggs in fish-free aquaria, and performed behaviour assays to quantify their behaviours with and without fish scent cues. Fish scent induced strong decreases in activity and increases in refuge use in both population types, potentially indicating a persistent ancestral response to fish. Populations co-occurring with fish were constitutively less active and in refuges more than naive populations in the absence of cues, but had a smaller plastic decrease in activity and a smaller increase in refuge use when exposed to cues. Weakening of the antipredator response in fish-invaded populations may be a signal of contemporary evolution towards optimization of time spent foraging versus the fitness costs of time spent avoiding predation.

AB There is mounting evidence that pathogen threat affects social preferences and responses. In humans, the presence of strangers also elicits heightened sensitivity to pathogen threat, promoting 'in-group' bias and 'out-group' avoidance. Whether or not a similar effect of social context on responses to pathogen threat occurs in nonhuman animals is unclear. Here we show that the responses of female laboratory mice, Mus muculus, to males are also rapidly affected by the presence of unfamiliar or infected males. In female mice, where odour cues drive appetitive and aversive social responses, brief (1 min) exposure to the urinary odours of an unfamiliar male led to females subsequently discriminating more strongly against the odours of males subclinically infected with the murine nematode parasite, Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Likewise, brief exposure to the odours of infected males attenuated the responses of females to the odours of the normally preferred unfamiliar males and enhanced their preferences for familiar males. These findings are consistent with the concept of 'assortative' sociality, whereby the presence of pathogen threat and unfamiliar individuals biases female preferences for uninfected and familiar individuals ('in-group' preference and, in human terms, 'ethnocentrism') and leads to the avoidance of unfamiliar individuals ('out-group' avoidance and 'xenophobia'). Hence, as in humans, social information associated with infection can rapidly bias the social preferences of female mice. These rapid shifts in social preferences can have implications for our understanding of the evolution of social interactions and group composition.

AB Associations in mixed-species foraging groups are common in animals, yet have rarely been explored in the context of collective behaviour. Despite many investigations into the social and ecological conditions under which individuals should form groups, we still know little about the specific behavioural rules that individuals adopt in these contexts, or whether these can be generalized to heterospecifics. Here, we studied collective behaviour in flocks in a community of five species of woodland passerine birds. We adopted an automated data collection protocol, involving visits by RFID-tagged birds to feeding stations equipped with antennae, over two winters, recording 91576 feeding events by 1904 individuals. We demonstrated highly synchronized feeding behaviour within patches, with birds moving towards areas of the patch with the largest proportion of the flock. Using a model of collective decision making, we then explored the underlying decision rule birds may be using when foraging in mixed-species flocks. The model tested whether birds used a different decision rule for conspecifics and heterospecifics, and whether the rules used by individuals of different species varied. We found that species differed in their response to the distribution of conspecifics and heterospecifics across foraging patches. However, simulating decisions using the different rules, which reproduced our data well, suggested that the outcome of using different decision rules by each species resulted in qualitatively similar overall patterns of movement. It is possible that the decision rules each species uses may be adjusted to variation in mean species abundance in order for individuals to maintain the same overall flock-level response. This is likely to be important for maintaining coordinated behaviour across species, and to result in quick and adaptive flock responses to food resources that are patchily distributed in space and time.

AB Olfaction is an ancient sensory capability, and yet while it is now widely recognized that birds have olfactory mechanisms, use of the sense within a social context has been largely overlooked. In our study, we aimed to determine, for the first time, whether plumage odour may contribute to avian subspecies discrimination. We used a species complex, the crimson rosella, Platycercus elegans, which exhibits large geographical and phenotypic differences. Across 2 years in a wild population of P. elegans elegans we tested whether females at the nest could: (1) discriminate odours of conspecifics; (2) discriminate odours of subspecies; (3) discriminate odours of sexes of conspecifics; and (4) habituate at different rates to odour treatments. We found that female response differed between odours of feathers of consubspecifics, heterosubspecifics, heterospecific controls and sham controls and between odours of sexes of conspecifics. Across all odour treatments, we found habituation to the odour and the rate of habituation differed between odour treatments. Our results indicate that P. e. elegans females are able to discriminate conspecifics, consubspecifics and sexes based on plumage odour. To our knowledge, this is the first work to show that birds of a certain subspecies can discriminate the odour of its own subspecies from that of other subspecies. Our findings suggest that olfaction in birds may play a larger role than hitherto considered, and may even act as a signal to maintain or promote population divergence.

AB Formants, the resonance frequencies of the vocal tract, are the key acoustic parameters underlying vowel identity in human speech. However, recent work on nonhuman animal communication systems has shown that formant variation provides potentially important information to receivers about static and dynamic attributes of callers. Meerkats, Suricata suricatta, produce broadband noisy bark vocalizations, lacking a clear fundamental frequency and harmonic structure, when they detect aerial or terrestrial predators. Here we investigated whether formants in meerkat barks have the potential to provide reliable information on caller identity and the predator context (aerial versus terrestrial predator) in which they are delivered. Acoustic analyses of naturally occurring barks and measurements of this species' vocal tract length were used to confirm that the six clear frequency bands below 15 kHz in meerkat barks represent formants. Discriminant function analyses subsequently demonstrated significant interindividual variation in the formant pattern of meerkat barks, suggesting that formants could be used by meerkats to identify conspecifics. In addition, mixed-effects models indicated that the frequency of the first formant was lower in barks produced in aerial versus terrestrial predation contexts. These results add to a growing body of literature on the potential function of formants in nonhuman animal vocal communication systems, and also imply that signalling external and referential information through such resonance frequencies, as in human language, might be more widespread in animals than previously thought.

AB Dominance hierarchies allow group-living animals to regulate the partitioning of reproduction, but the recognition systems underlying dominance interactions remain equivocal. Individual recognition, a cognitively complex recognition system, is often posited as an important mechanism for the regulation of linear dominance hierarchies because of its high level of precision. However, providing it actually allows a fine-scale discrimination of the individuals' statuses, status discrimination may offer an alternative, simpler, recognition system allowing the same level of precision while saving the memory-related costs associated with individual recognition. With the aim of disentangling the cognitive mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of hierarchies, we here studied the within-group recognition systems in the ant Neoponera apicalis, where orphaned workers compete over male parentage in a linear hierarchical structure. Overall, we found that status discrimination abilities were in fact sufficient for the establishment and stabilization of linear hierarchies. The observed level of accuracy allowed fine-scale discrimination of all top rankers' hierarchical status, and thus translated into a functional individual discrimination of all competing workers at the top of the hierarchy. Low-ranking workers did not exhibit such fine-scale status discrimination. We moreover showed that a putative signal of fertility, 13-methylpentacosane, precisely labelled the workers' position in the hierarchy, thereby providing the recognition cue likely to explain the individuals' discrimination abilities. This signal could therefore play a key role in the regulation of the reproductive conflict in this species. In contrast with the traditional view, our study shows the implication of a cognitively simple but equivalently efficient recognition system during the emergence and stabilization of a linear dominance hierarchy.

TI Zebra finches select nest material appropriate for a building task

AB Across the animal kingdom, many animals build structures. One especially diverse example is that of nest building by birds. It remains unclear, however, what birds know or whether they learn about the structural aspects of the material with which they build a nest. Here we tested whether nest-building male zebra finches would choose the appropriate type of material when building in a novel situation. They did do this: males provided with a nestbox with either a small or a large entrance hole and with nest material of two types ('long' and 'short') chose the type of material that was appropriate for the box in which they built. Additionally, the birds' material use improved with experience: males building in nestboxes with small entrances became less choosy in their material choice as they became more skilled at inserting material of either length into their nestbox. The birds, therefore, first chose the appropriate materials for the nestbox in which they were building but then modified their handling skills so as to make use of all of the available material. How the cognitive abilities used in this nest-building context compare with those used in solving other physical problems such as tool use tasks is not yet clear.

AB Maternal effects can result in transgenerational phenotypic plasticity, in which environmental variation experienced by mothers is translated into phenotypic variation in offspring. Although maternal effects have been a focus of much recent research, little is known about the long-term consequences of disturbance of the maternal social environment on offspring phenotype in socially monogamous and biparental species. We hypothesized that pair separation followed by re-pairing may generate maternal effects on offspring development. Here, we gave previously paired female zebra finches access to new males 6 days following removal of their original partner to assess experimentally the effects of re-pairing (an ecologically relevant form of social disturbance) on female reproductive investment, yolk corticosterone concentrations and subsequent offspring phenotype. Pair disruption boosted growth in female offspring and delayed the development of plumage colour sex dimorphism in males. Although yolk corticosterone concentrations were not affected by the treatment, offspring from treated mothers were less responsive to social isolation in a novel environment compared to control offspring. This is, to our knowledge, the first study demonstrating that maternal re-pairing prior to hatching has long-lasting effects on offspring phenotype in a socially monogamous and biparental species. Our results also suggest that prehatching maternal effects of this social disturbance are not mediated by maternal yolk corticosterone. Additional studies are required to determine the potential pathways of these maternal effects (e. g. other hormones, epigenetic programming, protein/nutrient content of eggs, etc.) and their adaptive value.

AB Prey animals often need to learn the identity of unknown predators, and not surprisingly, nearby conspecifics provide a rich source of information about both the identity and risk level posed by unknown predators. Individuals that learn from watching conspecifics that show a weak response to a predator often learn that the predator is a mild threat, while those that observe conspecifics that show a strong response to the predator, learn that the predator is a high-level threat. This means that any factor that influences the intensity of the antipredator response of the tutor can potentially influence the efficacy of information transfer to the observer. We know that food resources influence the activity levels of prey, making them more or less conspicuous to nearby conspecifics. We also know that prey often ignore risk if they have restricted access to food resources. This means that food resources have the potential to dramatically change social learning dynamics. In the present study, we found that tadpoles fed restricted diets had much higher activity levels than those fed ad libitum food resources. Their high activity made them more conspicuous to nearby conspecifics, causing them to be much more efficient as tutors. Our work highlights the dynamic nature of social learning, as information transfer is likely to change considerably from place to place and year to year as resources change through space and time.

AB We studied territorial interactions with respect to inter-and intraspecific communication of Ranitomeya imitator with the syntopic species Ranitomeya variabilis. These poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) are phenotypically very similar and are considered to be Mullerian mimics. Males of both species use calls for intraspecific communication, but only R. imitator males use calls to advertise and defend their territories. We hypothesized that, to avoid the risk of 'wasting' energy for territorial defence, R. imitator males should be able to discriminate between conspecifics and its model species R. variabilis by the structure of its call. We conducted phonotaxis field experiments attracting wild R. imitator males towards (1) an R. imitator advertisement call, (2) an R. variabilis call, (3) four modified calls with the temporal call parameters note length and internote interval substituted between the two species, and (4) two R. imitator calls at different dominant frequencies beyond the call's known natural range. Male R. imitator did not show responses towards any R. variabilis call (original or modified to match the R. imitator call), but did approach the sound source during playbacks of R. imitator calls with properties of R. variabilis. They also approached their own advertisement call when the dominant frequency was modified. This shows that modified call parameters did not have significant effects on R. imitator males' ability to discriminate their own call from that of R. variabilis. We conclude that the call parameters note length, internote interval or dominant frequency are not essential for call discrimination in R. imitator, perhaps suggesting that among Mullerian mimic anurans, discrimination of conspecifics and heterospecifics acts at a more complex level.

AB Correlational evidence suggests that animals may use changes in barometric pressure to predict or respond to changes in weather. Birds adjust the timing of migratory flights and migratory restlessness in response to changing weather, and they make facultative movements in response to storms during winter and breeding. Using the pressure chamber of a hypobaric climatic wind tunnel we tested the responses of white-throated sparrows, Zonotrichia albicollis, to experimental changes in air pressure alone, or air pressure and temperature in combination. Sparrows in wintering (short-day) condition were exposed to gradual changes in pressure/temperature at dawn that simulated large but realistic high-and low-pressure weather systems. During a drop in pressure, birds approached their food cup more quickly and moved more often. There was no effect of increasing pressure and no additional effects of temperature change. Sparrows in spring migratory condition (photostimulated) were exposed to pressure/temperature changes in the evening. Decreases in temperature resulted in less migratory restlessness during the first hour of night, but there was no additional effect of pressure changes. These experimental results indicate that white-throated sparrows can facultatively adjust their behaviour in direct response to changing barometric pressure and temperature.

AB Nonconsumptive or trait-mediated effects of predators on their prey often outweigh density-mediated interactions where predators consume prey. For instance, predator presence can alter prey behaviour, physiology, morphology and/or development. Despite a burgeoning literature, our ability to identify general patterns in prey behavioural responses may be influenced by the inconsistent methodologies of predator cue experiments used to assess trait-mediated effects. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to highlight variables (e. g. water type, predator husbandry, exposure time) that may influence invertebrate prey's behavioural responses to fish predator cues. This revealed that changes in prey activity and refuge use were remarkably consistent overall, despite wide differences in experimental methodologies. Our meta-analysis shows that invertebrates altered their behaviour to predator cues of both fish that were fed the focal invertebrate and those that were fed other prey types, which suggests that invertebrates were not responding to specific diet information in the fish cues. Invertebrates also altered their behaviour regardless of predator cue addition regimes and fish satiation levels. Cue intensity and exposure time did not have significant effects on invertebrate behaviour. We also highlight that potentially confounding factors, such as parasitism, were rarely recorded in sufficient detail to assess the magnitude of their effects. By examining the likelihood of detecting trait-mediated effects under large variations in experimental design, our study demonstrates that trait-mediated effects are likely to have pervasive and powerful influences in nature.

AB All animals live and move through three-dimensional environments, yet we do not understand how three-dimensional space is learned, remembered and used. Pelagic fish are ideal model organisms for studying three-dimensional spatial cognition as they move freely through volumes with six degrees of freedom. This is in contrast to surface-bound animals, such as rats, which are constrained to three degrees of freedom of movement. The type of movement that vertebrates display, whether freely moving through volumes (flying or swimming) or surface-bound, might shape their representation of space. We investigated true three-dimensional spatial cognition in an animal that moves freely within volumetric space. We interrogated the three-dimensional trajectories of freely swimming fish (banded tetras, Astyanax fasciatus) that were previously trained to navigate towards a reward inside a maze with horizontal and vertical components. The fish accurately encoded the rewarded three-dimensional direction. As predicted, free-swimming deviations from their original constrained trajectory were similar in both the horizontal and vertical axes, unlike in surface-bound rats. This equality between dimensions is the first direct evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the way animals move through their environment shapes how they learn and use spatial information, indicating a previously unknown adaptation in cognitive representations of space.

AB Because reproductive decision making affects all taxa, parents often use environmental cues to optimize their decisions. Although prefertilization decisions (e. g. mate choice) are well studied, postfertilization decisions, such as oviposition site selection (OSS), can also have profound effects on parent and offspring fitness. We used the Texas field cricket, Gryllus texensis, to examine how OSS was affected by temperature and predation risk. These two factors constrain fitness and may trade off with one another or contribute to parenteoffspring conflict (e. g. if ovipositing at offspring's thermal optimum entails increased risk of predation to the parent). Crickets preferred oviposition sites that were warmer and had lower predation risk, but they traded off their preference for temperature with predation risk during OSS. Yet, G. texensis preferred to oviposit at sites that were significantly warmer (up to 30.5 degrees C) than their preferred body temperature and the optimal temperature of offspring (26-27 degrees C). This thermal mismatch may be due to selection on hygrosensation (not thermosensation). We show that widespread environmental factors can exert complex interactive effects on important reproductive decisions. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID DECISION-MAKING; BEHAVIOR; STRESS
AB The collective behaviour of human crowds emerges from the local interactions of individuals. To understand human crowds we therefore need to identify the behavioural rules individual pedestrians follow. This is crucial for the control of emergency evacuations from confined spaces, for example. At a microscopic level we seek to predict the next step of pedestrians based on their local environment. However, we also have to consider 'tactical-level' individual behaviour that is not an immediate response to the local environment, such as the choice between different routes to exit a building. We used an interactive virtual environment to study human exit route decisions in simulated evacuations. Participants had to escape from a building and had to choose between different exit routes in the presence of evacuating simulated agents. We found no inherent preference for familiar routes, but under a stress-inducing treatment, subjects were more likely to display behaviour in their route choice that was detrimental to their evacuation time. Most strikingly, subjects were less likely to avoid a congested exit by changing their original decision to move towards it under this treatment. Age and gender had clear effects on reaction times in the virtual environment. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The capacity to modify vocal syntax to changes in social context is an important component of vocal plasticity and complexity in adult vertebrates, especially in human speech. The ecological significance of this behaviour has been well established in some avian species but not in mammals where complex, multisyllabic vocalizations are rare. The Brazilian free-tailed bat, Tadarida brasiliensis, is a mammal that sings like a bird, producing hierarchically structured songs that vary in the order and number of phrases (i.e. syntax) from one rendition to the next while simultaneously following specific organizational rules. Here, we used playback experiments to examine the function of songs and tested whether song syntax is correlated with social context. Free-tailed bats responded rapidly and robustly to echolocation calls that mimicked a bat flying past the roost but did not respond to conspecific song playbacks. We compared songs that were directed at a passing bat with songs that were produced spontaneously and found that bats produced longer songs with different phrase content and order when singing spontaneously than when singing to bats approaching their roost. Thus, free-tailed bats quickly varied song composition to meet the specific demands of different social functions. These distinct singing behaviours are similar to those of some songbirds, suggesting that bats and birds have converged upon a similar set of production modes that may reflect common neural mechanisms and ecological factors.

AB In species in which males provide females with nuptial gifts, females can benefit from choosing mates offering the larger or higher quality donation. The existence of such preferences assumes that females can reliably assess a male's gift before mating. However, in certain species, for example most bushcrickets, prior, direct assessment of the nuptial gift is impossible because females choose males before the gift's transfer. Any female assessment of a male's expected donation could therefore only be made via reliable premating cues or signals. In the bushcricket Ephippiger diurnus, males provide females with a large spermatophore at mating, which consists of an ampulla, housing sperm, surrounded by a nutrient-containing spermatophylax that females consume. As female mate choice occurs before transfer of the spermatophore, females may rely on the premating acoustic signals that males emit to attract females. We investigated whether certain parameters of E. diurnus male song could reliably inform females about the material benefits to come. We found no evidence that any male song traits studied (call rate, syllable number, peak frequency) could predict spermatophylax nutritional content. However, our results provide good evidence that male mate choice is likely to occur concomitantly with female choice as the size and quality of the nuptial gift appeared to vary with female traits (age and size). This added presence of male choice would render premating assessment of direct benefits transferred by males effectively impossible for E. diurnus females.

AB Individuals often show predictable variation in social tendencies over time and across contexts. In species that rely on social interaction for the development of courtship behaviours, predictable variation in juvenile social behaviour may influence the ontogeny of courtship skills by exposing young individuals to different levels of contact with conspecifics. During the autumn and winter, brown-headed cowbirds utilize a social display known as the head-down to facilitate close social interaction with others. In this study we investigated whether head-downs rates are correlated across social contexts, and thus constitute a social temperament trait, and whether variation in head-down rates predicts subsequent courtship behaviour in juvenile cowbirds. During the autumn, we used a fission-fusion perturbation on a flock of juvenile females and males, and recorded the number of approaches and head-downs across social contexts. All individuals were then followed into the breeding season, where we recorded male singing behaviour, female chatter vocalization and consort status. We found that female head-down rates were correlated across contexts during the autumn, and that females that engaged in more head-down displays received more songs from males, responded to more songs with chatter vocalizations and were more likely to be in a consortship during the breeding season. As far as we know, this study presents the first demonstration that a social temperament trait can predict competent adult-like courtship behaviour in juvenile birds, and suggests that juvenile sociability may be an important developmental mechanism in the emergence of reproductive competence.

AB In this essay we outline how video-related technology can be used as a tool for studying animal behaviour. We review particular aspects of novel, innovative animal behaviour uploaded by the general public via video-based media on the internet (using YouTube as a specific example). The behaviour of animals, particularly the play behaviour focused on here, is viewed by huge audiences. In this essay we focused on three different kinds of media clips: (1) interspecies play between dogs and a range of other species; (2) object play in horses; and (3) animal responses to stimuli presented on iPads, iPods and iPhones. We argue that the use of video is a good means of capturing uncommon or previously unknown behaviour, providing evidence that these behaviours occur. Furthermore, some of the behaviours featured on YouTube provide valuable insights for future directions in animal behaviour research. If we also take this opportunity to convey our knowledge to a public that seems to be fundamentally interested in animal behaviour, this is a good means of bridging the gap between knowledge among an academic few and the general public.

AB A standard way of describing the vocal behaviour of nonhuman primates is to classify the vocal repertoire as either graded or discrete. We analysed a large database of calls given by adult males of a primate considered a typical example for discrete vocal behaviour, the forest-dwelling Campbell's monkeys, Cercopithecus campbelli. We recorded vocal responses from several dozen individuals to their main predators, crowned eagles and leopards. Using cluster analysis techniques, we found two main call types, which were modified further by optional affixation of an inflexible vocal structure. It was possible to force the four call types into eight subtypes, with various degrees of gradedness. When taking context into account, we found that acoustically discrete and nonaffixed calls tended to be given right after discovering a predator, while acoustically graded and affixed calls were given during later parts of a predator encounter and to nonpredatory disturbances. In sum, our results suggest that classifications of primate vocal repertoires as either discrete or graded are likely to be meaningless, as communicatively relevant acoustic variation can be present within seemingly discrete call types.

AB Variation in sex hormone exposure during early embryonic development contributes to individual differences in behaviour and cognitive abilities later in life. Digit ratio has gained considerable interest as a putative marker for early androgen/oestrogen exposure in behavioural ecology research. Studying digit ratio in nonhuman laboratory as well as wild vertebrate species may be useful to assess whether different traits may be influenced by a common (e. g. endocrine-related) mechanism and whether digit ratio might be used as a phenotypic indicator for behavioural or fitness-related traits. We examined whether digit ratio (third-to-fourth toe ratio; 3D:4D) may indicate a common mechanism underlying endurance and antipredator behaviour in male painted dragon lizards, Ctenophorus pictus. We have previously shown that 3D:4D is associated with the presence/absence of a yellow throat patch (bib), with males with bibs having higher 3D:4D than those without bibs. In this study we found that 3D: 4D predicted antipredator behaviour with individuals with higher 3D:4D having shorter escape response times; however, 3D:4D was not associated with endurance. Endurance and antipredator behaviour were also associated with male coloration. Males expressing a bib had shorter escape response times and lower endurance than those without a bib. Moreover, males with orange head colour had lower endurance compared to yellow-headed and uncoloured males. On the basis of these results, we speculate that the associations between antipredator behaviour, endurance, 3D:4D and male sexual coloration are caused, at least partly, by different underlying mechanisms.

AB Animal personalities have become an established concept in animal behaviour. Despite this, the potential influence of early life experiences on adult personality is often overlooked. Juvenile exposure to environmental cues such as conspecific signalling or predator cues may provide relevant information regarding the make-up of the forthcoming environment. Individuals might be able to use these cues to adjust developmental trajectory and adult personality to prevent a personality-environment mismatch. Using the field cricket Gryllus integer, we show that individuals reared in the presence of conspecific acoustic sexual signals alter both growth rate and an adult personality trait. Males reared in the presence of acoustic sexual signals were less aggressive and less likely to become dominant relative to those reared in the absence of acoustic signals. Additionally, acoustic treatment interacted with juvenile body mass: large juveniles reared in the presence of acoustic signals were larger than small juveniles reared in the presence of acoustic signals and larger than all juveniles reared in silence. We discuss the potential adaptive significance of the observed developmental and personality differences. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Signals in animal communication are commonly judged as aesthetically appealing by human standards. This is particularly common for birdsong, often equated to musical compositions. No formal test, however, has analysed the harmonic properties of bird vocalizations. Musical intervals are based on the same physical characteristics of sound that underlie animal vocal signals. Thus, animals may use these intervals as rules to organize their vocalizations in a similar way as music. I tested a prediction derived from this hypothesis, that frequency ratios of adjacent notes in birdsong are closer to harmonic intervals than expected by chance. I determined to what degree the intervals created by adjacent notes of the song of nightingale wrens, Microcerculus philomela, conform to harmonic intervals. I analysed songs from 81 birds across the entire distribution range of the species, comparing the intervals formed by adjacent notes to three musical scales: chromatic, major diatonic and major pentatonic. Comparisons were made based on null model distributions. From 243 comparisons, only six (similar to 2%) were significantly close to harmonic intervals, suggesting no consistent use of harmonic intervals. The frequency of the notes is the most varying song parameter in this species. If the frequencies are not determined by harmonic intervals in this species, it seems less likely that it happens in other birds with more complex song elements. Documented musical properties in birds might be caused by cultural biases of the listener or misunderstanding of the physics of musical compositions.

AB Because female reproductive success in social mammals is determined largely by parental rather than mating effort, intrasexual competition among females has typically been assumed to occur primarily over food. Recently, however, renewed attention has been paid to the importance of other sources of variation in female fitness, with a concomitant focus on a broader definition of intrasexual selection that encompasses both competition for resources and competition for mates and social partners. We present behavioural and demographic data gathered over 15 years on a group of wild chacma baboons, Papio hamadryas ursinus, which show that females incur several costs when living in groups with many females and comparatively few males: increased intrasexual aggression, less stable bonds with female partners and increased mortality. Female-female aggression was higher in years when the adult sex ratio was more highly skewed towards females, with low-ranking females exhibiting particularly high rates of aggression towards other females. Females' social bonds with other females also became less stable in years when the group contained many females. Finally, female mortality rates were highest in years when the group contained comparatively more females and fewer males. The negative correlation between the number of males and female mortality suggests that the increase in mortality was due to increased predation rather than food competition. Results indicate that intrasexual competition for social partners, mates, paternal investment, and perhaps also male protection occurs even in species where females exhibit low reproductive skew.

AB Honeybees, Apis mellifera, show learned odour preferences for flowers that provide nectar as a reward. However, little is known about such behavioural plasticity when bees exploit pollen sources. Furthermore, the question about whether nectar and pollen foragers use the same learned strategy to improve foraging efficiency remains untested. Here, we demonstrate that honeybee foragers are able to learn odour cues associated with pollen as a reward. This was tested in free-flying bees in a dual-choice feeding device after the bees had gathered pollen from a scented feeder. Free-flying bees that associated odour with pollen successfully recalled these memories in olfactometer odour choice tests in a Y-maze, but they failed to show extension of the proboscis to learned odour cues when restrained (proboscis extension reflex, PER, assay). In addition, odour cues associated with pollen at the feeding site induced foraging reactivation when bees were blown into the hive. In PER assays, after fatty acids were applied to the bees' antennae, pollen foragers were more responsive than nectar foragers. This, in turn, allowed pollen foragers in the PER assay to associate an odour cue with pollen in some trials. On the other hand, the unconditioned response (UR) and the odour-conditioned response (CR) to sucrose and amino acids were similar for both types of foragers. Pollen foragers also showed more URs to fresh pollen of different flower species and even performed better during conditioning with some pollen types as the reward than did nectar foragers. By studying biases in pollen-foraging responses after learning, we provide new insights to help comprehend and characterize the search for food between pollen and nonpollen honeybee foragers.

AB Many threatened species' reintroductions in Australia fail because of predation by introduced cats and foxes. We attempted to improve reintroduction outcomes by training greater bilbies, Macrotis lagotis, to recognize cats as predators. The movement and behaviour of trained and control bilbies were compared in both a predator-free environment and in an area where cats and foxes were present. Trained bilbies within the predator-free environment moved significantly further, used more burrows with more entrances and changed burrows more frequently than untrained control animals. Trained bilbies also moved burrows when presented with olfactory predator stimuli while control bilbies did not. However, when bilbies were reintroduced to an area where predators were present, there was no difference in survival, movement or burrow use between trained and control bilbies. Both groups exhibited high survival rates in the first 6 months after release. In the presence of predators, both trained and control bilbies appeared to be more predator-aware possibly because of control bilbies learning from trained conspecifics or cohabiting rabbits or through inadvertent contamination of control animals during training. Results suggest that bilbies can be taught to recognize exotic predators but this may not necessarily translate into improved reintroduction success in the wild. Further investigation into cultural and filial transfer of antipredator behaviour is recommended. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are one of the most suitable candidates for elucidating the genetic bases of mate choice in vertebrates, given the potential benefits in terms of immunocompetence that can be passed to the offspring through MHC-associated mate choice. Female mate choice may favour males that possess particular MHC alleles or those with diverse MHC genotypes (good genes hypothesis), or males that possess MHC genotypes that differ from that of the female (compatibility hypothesis). Our goal was to evaluate mate choice in relation to MHC genotype in the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum. Using both laboratory and field analyses, we investigated whether the (1) number of shared MHC alleles between males and females, (2) number of amino acid differences between female and male MHC alleles, (3) MHC heterozygosity of males, (4) number of amino acid differences between male MHC alleles, and (5) frequency of MHC alleles of males differ between preferred and nonpreferred males in the laboratory and between potential sires and random males from the population in the field. In the laboratory, our results indicate that MHC alleles of preferred males differ in fewer amino acids compared to MHC alleles of nonpreferred males. Concomitantly, in the field, MHC alleles of possible sires differed in fewer amino acids than those of random males in the population. Plus, possible sires were more heterozygous and carried distinct MHC alleles compared with random males, thus providing more support to the 'good genes' hypothesis. We discuss the possible reasons why MHC-based mate choice was more evident in the field and the implications of such a female mating strategy in the subterranean environment.

AB In some dwarf spiders (Linyphiidae, Erigoninae), males have cephalic modifications that produce chemical secretions that females touch during courtship and/or copulation. We investigated the influence of these cephalic hump secretions on courtship, copulation probability, copulation behaviour, remating, oviposition and paternity in the dwarf spider Oedothorax retusus. We compared these parameters between males that offered secretions and males whose cephalic hump was experimentally covered. Females mated twice and we limited each male to a single 1 min insertion of his palp into one of two spermathecae. Thereby, the sperm masses of rival males were transferred into separate spermathecae in potentially similar amounts. This set-up prevented direct sperm competition within a spermatheca and allowed us to test selective sperm usage by the female. Virgin females were more likely to mate with males that were able to release secretions. When copulation occurred, males with a covered hump needed significantly more insertion attempts and required more time from first hump contact to the onset of sperm transfer in both virgin and mated females. The number of eggs in the subsequent eggsac was significantly increased for females that only mated with males with an open hump, indicating that substances transferred with the male secretions promote egg production. Paternity of the two male types was not significantly different suggesting that the gland products do not trigger female choice of sperm. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Choice for mate quality and number of mates are key components of female mating strategies. We investigated how selection on female choosiness also influences number of matings in various ecological conditions. In our individual-based model, females choose their first mate according to an evolving acceptance threshold and then mate with males of increasing quality (trade-up choice). We simulated evolution of this threshold under various conditions of density, sex ratio and mating cost. Thresholds rapidly evolve towards a small set of values that depend on the tested parameters. Consistent with intuitive predictions, choosier females are selected when either number of encounters with males or mating cost is high. Selection results in most females sharing the same threshold. Variation in female mating patterns remains because some variation in thresholds is maintained, at least by mutations, and because of random events affecting number of matings. Our model indicates that mating cost strongly affects evolution of female choosiness and mating frequency. Moreover, it influences the relative importance of other factors: when mating cost is low, selection on acceptance thresholds is weak and relatively more females use thresholds that differ from the norm. In that context, mate quality is therefore the most important factor affecting female reproductive success. When mating cost is high, females evolve thresholds such that both the cost of multiple mating and the risk of remaining unmated become as important as mate quality. High mating cost, by selecting for high choosiness, also leads to females mating with fewer males. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Intraspecific variability in mating systems has been documented previously, but there are few studies where investigators have used intraspecific comparisons to investigate the influence of ecological or demographic factors on social and genetic mating systems. We studied two populations of prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, one near Lawrence, Kansas, U. S. A., and the other in Bloomington, Indiana, U. S. A. We examined differences in spatial structuring of vegetation between sites, which might contribute to intraspecific variation in social and genetic mating patterns. Since space use is often related to the mating system, we calculated home range size of a subset of adult males and females in both populations and used live trapping to examine the number of same-or opposite-sex conspecifics sharing capture locations. We applied social network analysis to live-trapping data to quantify the number and strength of social ties with opposite-sex conspecifics. Genetic parentage analysis provided an estimate of the number of mates per individual. We found that space use and overlap with members of the same and opposite sex were best explained by effects of site and sex. The relative strength of social associations with opposite-sex conspecifics was best predicted by site, density and sex. The genetic mating system was best explained by population density. Although we cannot disentangle population density from ecological variables related to site (e. g. distribution of vegetation) that may have affected social monogamy in our study populations, our study shows that extrinsic variables do affect differences in social and genetic mating systems between populations.

AB While observational and experimental field studies have demonstrated that extrapair paternity is associated with a variety of male traits, there are still few published studies associating measures of paternity with behavioural preferences of females for extrapair males. In this sense, the majority of studies of extrapair paternity have failed to separate male competition from female choice. In this study we compared patterns of extrapair paternity in western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, to previously published data on extrapair mating preferences from the same population. Results from previous experiments, where females' mates were prevented from guarding or otherwise interfering with extrapair mating, accurately predicted patterns of paternity at 256 unmanipulated nests examined over a 6-year period. Specifically, as predicted based on which males were accepted as extrapair copulation partners, genetic extrapair sires were older but not larger than a female's social mate. At the same time, relatively older extrapair males were not proportionally more successful, in terms of proportion of offspring sired, than younger males. Together these findings indicate that female choice for older males is expressed, but male competition, sperm competition and intersexual conflict also influence the magnitude of paternity. We suggest that experimental approaches, combined with measures of paternity under unmanipulated conditions, provide important opportunities to test the potential role of male versus female behaviours as selective factors in extrapair fertilizations.

AB Eusocial living influences mating system evolution if kin selection selects for a low number of fathers to increase helper relatedness and helping incentive. Consequently, polyandry resulting in pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection is restricted in social compared to nonsocial species. Despite a growing body of literature, empirical studies are still needed to understand fully the effects of kin selection on mating system evolution or vice versa. Here we review the mating biology of termites and conclude that they make interesting study species to unravel the evolutionary interplay between mating system evolution and eusociality. A number of reproductive characteristics of termites differ substantially from those of other insects. Polyandry appears to be mostly absent in termites and lifetime pair formation is achieved early in life, after an initial dispersal flight. The consequent absence of postcopulatory sexual selection coincides with the loss of a number of reproductive traits, such as elaborate male and female genitalia, flagellated sperm and seminal fluid-producing male accessory glands. The absence of sexually selected, female-harming male traits suggests that the interests of males and females are well aligned in most termites, fostering the evolution of kings, males with life expectancies comparable to those of queens and the ability to supply sperm continuously. Comparative work on mating system evolution between the diplodiploid termites and the haplodiploid hymenopteran social insects can be used to explain the influence of kin selection. We conclude that the study of social insect reproduction offers exciting opportunities to understand the evolutionary interplay between sexual, natural and kin selection.

AB Many animals can recognize previously encountered individuals and modify their behaviour towards them. Individuals also can have increased growth or other fitness components when interacting with familiar compared to unfamiliar individuals. One hypothesis explaining fitness benefits is that animals forage less in the presence of unfamiliar conspecifics because they spend time avoiding or interacting with these potentially more aggressive individuals. We tested this hypothesis in a territorial salamander, Plethodon cinereus, which is active on the forest floor at night. In our first experiment, we tested whether nocturnal activity was a suitable quantitative reflection of foraging. Level of nocturnal activity had a significant positive effect on mass gain and a significant negative effect on prey abundance in enclosures. Adult P. cinereus are known to be less aggressive towards familiar juveniles, and juveniles grow more when cohabitating with familiar adults, so we tested whether a lack of familiarity between juveniles and adults decreases nocturnal foraging activity of juveniles or adults. Juveniles were less active in enclosures with unfamiliar females than with familiar females with whom they had cohabitated in the laboratory. There were no differences in juvenile foraging activity based on familiarity with males. Surprisingly, adult salamanders were more active in enclosures with familiar juveniles than in enclosures with unfamiliar juveniles, even though juveniles are much smaller and do not pose physical danger towards adults. We conclude that adults and juveniles forage more when they interact with familiar conspecifics and we discuss hypotheses that may explain why familiarity affects interactions in these contexts.

AB Models of antipredator vigilance show that animals should be more vigilant when in smaller groups, when neighbours are farther away, and when they occur at the edge rather than at the centre of a group. However, models fail to specify how animals are expected to look out for threats while actually scanning. We suggest that head movements during scanning may represent a way that animals can control the value of scanning while in groups. Head movements can be used to increase visual coverage (visual search) as well as bring features of the environment to more sensitive parts of the eyes (visual fixation). We conducted a seminatural experiment with brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, in which we manipulated group size and neighbour distance, and recorded vigilance for peripheral and central individuals. During scanning, the rate of head movements by peripheral individuals increased, probably to enhance visual coverage due to their higher perceived risk of predation. However, individuals that were farther apart and in smaller groups used a different scanning strategy by reducing their rate of head movements (e. g. increased the averaged time they spent holding a given head position steady), probably to fixate their gaze longer on neighbours. Visual fixation may be useful for obtaining social information about predation threats from the behaviour of groupmates. We show that (1) a vigilance metric associated with head movement behaviour, which is attuned to the visual system of a species, can provide novel information about vigilance in groups, and that (2) birds have different head movement strategies, probably associated with different visual targets, when the risk of predation is higher. 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals are sensitive to risk or the variability of a reward distribution, and the energy budget rule of risk sensitivity theory predicts that it is adaptive for an animal to be risk averse when it is on a positive energy budget and to be risk prone when it is on a negative budget, because the utility of a potential large reward is much higher in the latter case. It has, however, been notoriously difficult to find conclusive empirical support for these predictions. We performed a comprehensive test of the energy budget rule in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, by constructing empirical utility functions and by testing the choice of bees for a constant or variable reward with an olfactory conditioning assay subsequent to manipulating their energy budgets. We demonstrate that a decline in energetic state leads to an increasing choice for a variable reward, while an increase in energetic state leads to an increased choice for a constant reward. We then show that subjects maintained on constant high or low energy budgets are risk indifferent, which suggests that an animal must perceive a change in its energetic state to be risk sensitive. We discuss the challenges of finding empirical evidence for the energy budget rule and the necessity of integrating physiological assays in these tests. Based on our previous results showing that parasitic infections cause an energetic stress in honeybees, we also discuss the possibility of energetic shortfall being responsible for the observed display of risky behaviour in infected bees.

AB Leafcutter ants are known to reject previously accepted plants if they prove to be unsuitable for their symbiotic fungus: a phenomenon that involves avoidance learning. Workers need to associate the detrimental effects of the incorporated plant with its characteristics, chemical and/or physical features, thus allowing plant recognition at the foraging site on subsequent days, and its avoidance. We addressed the question of to what extent olfactory memory underlies delayed avoidance of plants unsuitable for the symbiotic fungus. Odour is an important plant characteristic used as a recognition cue outside the nest during foraging. Acromyrmex ambiguus foragers were able to learn about a plant's unsuitability for their symbiotic fungus, rejecting this substrate in a binary choice experiment in the laboratory. Presented with leaf discs of two plant species simultaneously, one known to be unsuitable and one suitable, individual foragers significantly preferred the suitable plant species. When presented only with the plant odour, foragers steered away from the odour of the known unsuitable plant species, moving towards the simultaneously presented odour of a suitable plant species. Foragers were therefore able to identify plant species and recall information about substrate suitability for the fungus through the plant's odour alone. None the less, foragers showed a significantly stronger avoidance of known unsuitable substrate when they could make contact with the leaf discs, suggesting the use of additional cues for plant identification. It is argued that not only appetitive, but also aversive learned responses are involved in the process of plant recognition by foraging leafcutter ants.

AB Laboratory training and testing of auditory recognition skills in animals is important for understanding animal communication systems that depend on auditory cues. Songbirds are commonly studied because of their exceptional ability to learn complex vocalizations. In recent years, mounting interest in the perceptual abilities of songbirds has increased the demand for laboratory behavioural training and testing paradigms. Here, we describe and demonstrate the success of a method for auditory discrimination experiments, including all the necessary hardware, training procedures and freely available, versatile software. The system can run several behavioural training and testing paradigms, including operant (go-nogo, stimulus preference and two-alternative forced choice) and classical conditioning tasks. The software and some hardware components can be used with any laboratory animal that learns and responds to sensory cues. The peripheral hardware and training procedures are designed for use with songbirds and auditory stimuli. Using the go-nogo paradigm of the training system, we show that adult zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, learn to recognize and correctly classify individual female calls and male songs. We also show that learning the task generalizes to new stimulus classes; birds that learned the task with calls subsequently learned to recognize songs faster than did birds that learned the task and songs at the same time.

AB We investigated whether wingless sexuals of the ant Hypoponera opacior adjust mate-guarding behaviour to the level of competition in the nest. Males mate with young nestmate females shortly before these emerge from the cocoon. Aggressive interactions among adult males have never been observed, but males embrace and guard the cocoons of their mating partners for up to 2 days. In laboratory experiments, the duration of pupal guarding increased with the number of adult males in the nest, but decreased with an increasing number of mating partners per male. These findings demonstrate that males are aware of the competitive situation in the nest and adjust their mating behaviour in an adaptive manner. Males also guarded and attempted to copulate with sterile worker and male pupae. These misdirected behaviours might be the result of identification errors, as we found that the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of young individuals of the different castes were very similar. Copulatory behaviour towards sterile workers is certainly maladaptive, whereas interactions with young males may provide a fitness benefit: We found a high mortality rate of young males that were embraced and guarded by adult males. Adult male-male pupae interactions predominantly occurred when only a single male was present in the nest. In addition, single-male nests were found at unusually high frequencies. These findings suggest that wingless males try to kill their pupal rivals through embracing when there are few adult competitors in the nest, but switch to mate-guarding behaviour when intramale competition is high.

AB Prey that respond to inappropriate cues in their assessment of predation risk spend more time performing defensive behaviours and less time undertaking behaviours that promote fitness. Hence, prey should respond to cues that are the best predictors of predation risk relevant to the prey individual. Many fish undergo ontogenetic shifts in habitat and resource use during their lifetime; consequently, prey fish are exposed to a variety of predators at different stages of their development. Also, as relative concentration of the alarm cue represents both spatial and temporal information about a predation event, prey should adjust the intensity of their antipredator response in a threat-sensitive manner. We found that the ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, exhibited a threat-sensitive response to damage-released cues of conspecifics, with the magnitude of the response dependent on the cue concentration. Higher cue concentrations (suggesting a greater threat) elicited a stronger avoidance response, while low cue concentrations (weak threats) elicited a weak antipredator response. Moreover, the nature of the response depended on the ontogenetic stage of the cue donor. Reef-naive recruit individuals exhibited consistent antipredator behaviours when exposed to alarm cue concentrations from individuals of the same ontogenetic stage, modest antipredator responses to juvenile skin extracts, and no antipredator behaviours when exposed to cues from adult fish. Individuals that alter their avoidance response in a manner that reflects the magnitude of risk successfully balance the trade-off between defensive and risky or fitness-promoting behaviours, and natural selection would presumably favour these individuals.

AB Herbivores challenged by diets with high concentrations of tannins learn by individual experience to self-select medicinal compounds such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which neutralizes the negative postingestive effects of tannins. We investigated the transmission of this acquired self-medicative behaviour from mother to offspring. One group of ewes (experienced, N = 8) was conditioned to associate the beneficial effects of PEG after consuming a tannin-rich diet. Ewes ingested a meal of high-tannin food and were then offered PEG. Subsequently, ewes ingested the same tannin-rich meal and were then offered a food (grape pomace; control) that did not have the medicinal effects of PEG. After conditioning, the experienced group and a naive group of ewes (N = 8) were given a choice between the high-tannin food, PEG and grape pomace. Experienced ewes showed higher intake and preference for PEG than did naive ewes (P < 0.05). Subsequently, experienced and naive ewes with their naive lambs, as well as a group of naive lambs without their mothers (N = 8), were exposed to the tannin-rich diet, PEG and grape pomace. Lambs were then tested for their ability to self-medicate with PEG by offering them a choice between the tannin-rich diet, PEG and grape pomace. Lambs from experienced and naive mothers showed a higher preference for PEG than did lambs exposed without their mothers (P = 0.05). Thus, the presence of the mother (experienced or naive) was important for naive lambs to learn about the medicinal benefits of PEG. We conclude that the mother's presence per se may increase the efficiency of creating new knowledge, such as preference for a medicine, within a group, beyond transmitting and maintaining this knowledge across generations.

AB The study of the genetic consequences of dispersal is a central topic in evolutionary, conservation and behavioural research. However, few studies have simultaneously considered dispersal movements from marked individuals and contemporary patterns of gene flow. We analysed the link between dispersal behaviour and gene flow in four populations of blue tits with different degrees of connectivity. For this purpose, we monitored four breeding patches and used genotypic and captureemarkerecapture data to study the genetic consequences of dispersal at different spatial scales. Data on natal dispersal movements revealed that both males and females dispersed less than expected under a random pattern of settlement at the two large spatial scales considered: the whole study area and the two main localities. However, natal dispersal distance was lower than expected under random settlement within natal patches in males whereas an opposite pattern was found for females. Accordingly, microsatellite data revealed limited gene flow between the localities studied and an isolation-by-distance pattern of genetic structure that was particularly strong at the large spatial scale (i.e. considering geographically distant breeding patches). Finally, the strong male philopatry was reflected by a stronger genetic structure and a lower admixed ancestry in this sex. Overall, we found evidence that restricted dispersal and fragmentation may have both contributed to reduce interpopulation gene flow at different spatial scales in a forest species and that there is concordance between genetic studies and those based on captureemarkerecapture.

AB Third-party interventions of dyadic contests are often explained by appealing to high-level cognitive processes such as coalition formation between group members. However, alternative accounts that do not appeal to sophisticated cognitive processes have been proposed. We tested predictions from two such models using the fallow deer, Dama dama, as the model taxon: (1) a random target model that argues that intervention is directed randomly towards a target and (2) a specific target model that assumes that targeting is directed at contestants that have low resource-holding potential. Contrary to predictions of the specific target model, we found no evidence that targeting following third-party intervention increased as the resource-holding potential of the target declined. Both models argue that intervention serves to prevent individuals from gaining a winner effect and advancing up the hierarchy. Being targeted did not result in a decline in dominance rank, although targeting was associated with investment in dominance-related fighting tactics. Fight intervention was associated with an increase in rank early in the rut and accounted for increased mating success. Therefore, interveners benefited beyond simply preventing rivals from advancing in the hierarchy. In theoretical terms, a random target as opposed to a specific target model explains intervention behaviour in the fallow deer. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many animal species have complex cognitive abilities previously assumed to be limited to humans. Explanations for how these abilities evolved have focused on ways in which cognitive performance may influence survival, such as solving ecological problems or navigating complex social environments. However, sexual selection (differences in the reproductive success of individuals) can also lead to the evolution of complex traits. This could occur, for example, if females prefer males with better cognitive ability. A common assumption of models of female choice for male cognitive ability is that performance scores on different cognitive tasks are intercorrelated. In the present study, we evaluated performance of male satin bowerbirds on six cognitive tasks. Although we found little intercorrelation amongst males' performance scores of these tasks, males with better scores for two integrative measures of these cognitive tasks had higher mating success, which is a good indicator of reproductive success in this species. In addition, a multiple regression analysis suggested that performance on most cognitive tasks independently predicted mating success. Our results point to an important link between sexual selection and cognitive ability that has not been well appreciated and appears to be quite complex.

AB Many haplorhine primates flexibly exploit social cues when competing for food. Whether strepsirrhine primates possess similar abilities is unknown. To explore the phylogenetic origins of such skills among primates, we tested ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, for their ability to exploit social cues while competing for food. We found that in two contexts ringtailed lemurs spontaneously approached food out of their competitor's view. To assess whether these skills are related to the relatively complex social structure seen in ringtailed lemurs or shared more broadly across a range of strepsirrhines, we then compared ringtailed lemurs to three lemur species with less complex societies in the same food competition task (N = 50 lemurs). Although all species skilfully avoided food proximate to a competitor in a pretest, only ringtailed lemurs performed above chance in the food competition task that required subjects to avoid food that an experimenter was facing in favour of one that he was not facing. We also compared all four species in a noncompetitive gaze-following task. Ringtailed lemurs were again the only species that looked up more frequently when an experimenter gazed into space than when an experimenter gazed forward (although at relatively low frequencies). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ringtailed lemurs have undergone convergent social-cognitive evolution with haplorhines, possibly as an adaptation for living in the largest and most complex social groups among strepsirrhines. Results are discussed in terms of lemur cognitive evolution as well as the social intelligence hypothesis. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Individuals within species differ in their behavioural reactions to the environment. Consistent individual differences in these behaviours (personality traits) are often correlated and known to be under natural selection. These differences are frequently associated with variation in physiological traits, such as endocrine profiles. For example, variation in circulating testosterone levels is associated with variation in several personality traits and has been hypothesized to be a marker for personality in humans and rodents. The importance of testosterone in controlling both behavioural strategies and individual physiological differences suggests that direct selection on personality traits might cause pleiotropic selection on the physiological mechanisms underlying these traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified levels of plasma testosterone levels and measured phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced immune responses of male great tits, Parus major, in lines artificially selected for diverging levels of avian personality ('fast' and 'slow' exploratory behaviour). We found that testosterone levels were highly repeatable within individuals and fluctuated predictably over the season. Contrary to our expectations, 'slow' explorers had consistently higher levels of baseline testosterone and higher immune responses than 'fast' explorers. These results show that phenotypic selection for variation in personality traits corresponds to consistent differences in hormone profile and immune function, but that higher aggression levels do not need to be associated with higher baseline testosterone levels. Our results confirm that personality traits have evolved as a result of selection on both the underlying controlling physiological mechanisms and the phenotypic traits.

AB Variation in the level of competition for mates and territories is likely to influence the behaviour of competitors. The start of the dawn chorus in songbirds is influenced by a variety of internal factors (e. g. circadian rhythms) and external factors (e. g. light levels, social cues). Here we investigate whether the start time of the dawn chorus is influenced by the singing behaviour of conspecific competitors. Using an Acoustic Location System, we recorded the dawn chorus in neighbourhoods of 5-10 black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus. We used playback to simulate an unfamiliar male performing a dawn song bout within an existing male's territory. Playback began 15 min before the earliest song sung by any male on the preceding day. Focal males began singing a mean +/- SE of 4.3 +/- 1.6 min earlier on the day of playback (time relative to sunrise), significantly earlier than on the previous day. We also found a significant communication network level response where neighbouring males began singing 2.3 +/- 0.8 min earlier in response to playback. Dawn song bouts of males that received playback were longer, but ended at a similar point relative to sunrise. As this effect of a simulated conspecific on chorus start time is on the scale of only a few minutes, other factors probably play a significant role in shaping the timing of dawn chorus onset. Our results show that animals adjust the timing of their sexual communication in response to increased levels of competition. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In social species, the structure and patterning of social interactions have implications for the opportunities for sexual interactions. We used social network analysis to explore the effect of habitat structural complexity on the social and sexual behaviour of male Trinidadian guppies. We used replicated semi-natural pools in which we quantified male social network structure and reproductive behaviour under simple and complex habitats. In addition, we compared two populations of guppies that differed in their evolutionary history of predation (one high, one low). The level of habitat complexity did not significantly affect social network structure. However, social networks differed significantly between populations, which we suggest is due to differences in predator experience. Males from the high-predation population had greater overall social network differentiation and fewer male-male associations than their low-risk counterparts. Contrary to our prediction that males would associate more frequently with relatively large (more fecund) females, we observed a negative correlation between female size and the strength of male-female associations. We also found no effect of population or habitat complexity on either harassment or sexual network structures. There was, however, a significant interaction between habitat structure and population on the expression of reproductive strategies, with high-predation males expressing fewer sigmoid displays in the complex habitat and the opposite trend in low-predation males. We suggest this pattern is driven by population differences in male-male competition. We discuss our results in the context of the evolution of social structure and male reproductive strategies.

AB Venom is a metabolically expensive commodity that animals should use judiciously. The venom-metering hypothesis proposes that venomous animals control, or meter, the quantity of venom they deploy during predatory or defensive situations. We sought to clarify experimentally whether the buthid scorpion Parabuthus transvaalicus can regulate defensive venom expenditure based on perceived risk. Scorpions were tested under two threat conditions by inducing them to sting repeatedly a parafilm-covered cup. The high-threat condition involved five sting presentations at 5 s intervals, and the low-threat condition comprised five sting presentations at 5 min intervals. Venom metering appeared to be modulated at three levels: wet versus dry sting, composition of venom injected and volume of venom delivered. Scorpions delivered dry stings more often under the low-threat condition, but in both conditions were more likely to employ wet stings as the threat persisted. Venom appearance changed during successive stings from clear (potassium-rich 'prevenom'), to opalescent, to milky (protein-rich 'venom'), with biochemical analyses (protein assay and MALDI-TOF) confirming the compositional changes. However, progression through this sequence depended on quantity of venom expended, with milky secretion appearing only after the limited quantity of clear secretion was exhausted (i.e. composition and volume covaried). Scorpions injected approximately two-fold more venom per sting during the high-threat compared to the low-threat condition, with milky venom appearing more quickly within the sequence of five stings for the high-threat condition. Thus, these scorpions perceive risk and regulate venom expenditure during stinging according to level of threat, providing further support for the venom-metering hypothesis.

AB This paper describes a novel combination of feeding motivation and spatial preference testing. We used the feeding motivation test to determine a 'low' barrier height that broiler chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, that were not food deprived would cross to get to food, and a 'high' barrier height that food-deprived chickens would cross to get to food. These barriers were then used to assess the chickens' spatial preferences. Birds could show their spatial preference by moving between two compartments with different stocking densities (14.7 birds/m(2) in a compartment of fixed size versus 9.3, 12.1 or 14.7 birds/m(2) in a compartment of adjustable size). The compartments were separated by either the low or the high barrier. In the density preference test, the number of birds in the adjustable compartment increased with increasing size of this compartment, indicating that birds preferred lower densities, an effect that became more pronounced with age. This effect occurred even when a barrier was used that had previously deterred 20-25% of birds from crossing to get to food after 6 h of food deprivation, suggesting that achieving a lower density was important to the broiler chickens. Since this methodology does not involve training, it could be used to evaluate the importance of spatial or other preferences in a wide range of domestic and nondomestic species.

AB Recent discoveries of single-gene influences on social behaviour have generated a great deal of interest in the proximate mechanisms underlying the expression of complex behaviours. Length polymorphism in a microsatellite in the regulatory region of the gene encoding the vasopressin 1a receptor (avpr1a) has been associated with both inter-and intra-specific variation in socially monogamous behaviour in voles (genus Microtus) under laboratory conditions. Here, we evaluate the relationship between avpr1a length polymorphism and social associations, genetic monogamy and reproductive success in free-living prairie vole, M. ochrogaster, populations. We found no evidence of a relationship between avpr1a microsatellite length and any of our correlates of either social or genetic monogamy in the field. Our results, especially when taken in conjunction with those of recent experimental studies in seminatural enclosures, suggest that avpr1a polymorphism is unlikely to have been a major influence in the evolution or maintenance of social monogamy in prairie voles under natural conditions.

AB Hermit crabs use empty gastropod shells as protective armour and enlarged chelipeds as signals and weapons. However, carrying armour and arms may impose energy costs that result in increased lactate and hence potential fatigue and there may be consequent effects on general activity. We investigated whether variation in shell and cheliped size influences lactate levels in hermit crabs. Lactate was positively related to residual cheliped size for both sexes and was higher in males than females; when we controlled for body size, the former had larger chelipeds. Shell weight unexpectedly had no effect on lactate but crabs in small shells had high lactate, possibly because of reduced ability to maintain a respiratory current. The size of natural shells had no effect on activity but the addition of food odour increased locomotion. However, activity was not related to lactate. We conclude that possession of larger chelipeds than expected for body size imposes significant costs and may limit development of sexual dimorphism.

AB Monogamous animals face an interesting dilemma: whether and when to terminate a nonproductive relationship. To address this issue, I examined whether reproductive compatibility is a criterion for maintaining a monogamous pair bond between mates. Prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, are small rodents that form long-term, monogamous pair bonds evidenced by a strong preference for their familiar partners, and thus are an excellent model animal in which to study mate fidelity. Accordingly, I examined partner preferences by male prairie voles and related their behaviour to the reproductive status of their mates. I found that, when given a choice between their familiar female partner and a stranger, male prairie voles differed in their responses depending on the pregnancy status of the partner. Males that were paired with females for 2 weeks displayed mate fidelity only when mating had been initiated within approximately 48 h after pairing. In contrast, males whose mates experienced a delay in the onset of sexual receptivity displayed nonselective affiliative behaviour. I also found that, in addition to being appropriately timed, mating must be successful. Males that mated with ovariectomized females for whom pregnancy was precluded did not display mate fidelity even though mating was initiated within the proper time frame. These observations of mate fidelity only when the partner's pregnancy was sufficiently advanced relative to the duration of the pairing suggest that mating must be both successful and timely. Thus, reproductive compatibility can influence mate fidelity. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many species, males fight one another for mates or resources. Fighting can vary among males, however, such that some males are highly aggressive whereas others are not. We observed that fighting was negatively associated with flight capability in the wing-dimorphic field cricket, Gryllus texensis. Long-winged males capable of flight had a significantly lower fighting propensity and displayed lower levels of aggression than short-winged, flight-incapable males in staged contests. Long-winged males no longer able to fly as a result of the histolysis of their flight muscles were more aggressive than long-winged males that had functional flight muscles, but were still less aggressive than short-winged males. Long-winged, flight-capable males were more aggressive after a brief flight just prior to an interaction with a rival, but only in contests with other flight-capable males. Flight capability and flight itself had no effect on the outcome of fights. Our results support the existence of an aggression flight syndrome in flight-dimorphic insects.

AB Although activity budgets have been studied extensively in ruminants, information on the plasticity of rumination among individuals is rare. Generally, time spent bedded is considered a proxy for time spent ruminating. Researchers rarely include measures of interindividual differences in the intensity and time spent ruminating. We explored individual variation in rumination behaviour in Rocky mountain bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis. We expected rumination to be a plastic behaviour affected by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as body mass, age, sex, reproductive status and environmental conditions. We investigated rumination behaviour based on (1) mean number of chews per bolus of food (chews/bolus), (2) mean number of chews per second per bolus (chewing rate) and (3) mean time spent chewing per bolus (bolus processing time) for sheep of known age, sex, body mass and reproductive status. Our results show that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affected rumination behaviour. Females tended to spend less time processing each bolus than males of similar body mass, resulting in a significantly higher chewing rate for females. There was no difference in chews/bolus between sexes. Environmental factors and group size also affected rumination behaviour: cold temperatures were associated with fewer chews/bolus; wind was associated with more chews/bolus. Sheep in larger groups had a slower rate of rumination than those in smaller groups. We conclude that rumination behaviour is very plastic and, therefore, that assumptions of uniform rumination rates across individuals may be misleading and may miss an important piece of ruminants' foraging ecology.

AB Animals create a wide variety of structures to deal with abiotic and biotic challenges. We evaluated an intriguing structure whose function has never been thoroughly tested. Specifically, we evaluated the hypothesis that the body-enclosing 'faecal case' created and lived in by the immature stages of Neo-chlamisus leaf beetles reduces their risk of predation. We especially focus on the case of N. platani, which is externally covered with host-plant trichomes, and includes a distinct trichome-filled chamber ('attic') in the case apex. Here, we separately evaluated the effects of case, trichomes and attic on each of several behavioural stages of predator attack using N. platani and N. bimaculatus larvae and pupae. Three generalist predators (crickets, soldier bugs and lynx spiders) that represent different feeding strategies were used in our individual-level repeated observation behavioural trials. Results strongly demonstrated that the faecal case itself greatly reduced predation risk for all combinations of beetle species, life history stage and predator. Additional evidence indicated that both trichomes and attics further and independently reduced predation risk. Variation in results among treatments was also informative. For example, the capacity of faecal case components to reduce predation sometimes varied markedly among predators and between larval versus pupal life stages. Patterns of predator behaviour provided no evidence that caseless larvae have alternative means of defence. This study further presents a rare example of the co-option of a physical plant defence (trichomes) by an herbivore. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The cognitive mechanisms by which an organism comes to employ an optimal response to a situation are of great interest in behavioural ecology, but the basis and form of these mechanisms have been little studied. One approach employs learning rules, which are mathematical expressions that calculate the value of the behavioural alternatives in an organism's repertoire based on past and present rewards to those alternatives. Previous work on these learning rules has examined the performance of rules to determine whether they can achieve evolutionarily stable optimums. However, not only has this work tested rules in isolation, but the parameter values chosen to test them have been few and chosen arbitrarily. Moreover, the environments in which the rules have been evaluated are unchanging, a condition that does not favour learning. In this study we extend simulation work on three learning rules (relative payoff sum, linear operator and perfect memory). We use a genetic algorithm to both estimate the optimal parameter values for each rule and place the rules in competition with each other in a foraging game with a changing environment. Our results confirm earlier findings that the relative payoff sum is an ES learning rule. However, the results go much further because they show that the form of the learning rule that qualifies as evolutionarily stable combines near inextinguishable producing with highly responsive scrounging. The relative payoff sum may provide a single rule that can account for the way an animal's ecology can come to affect its specific set of learning sensitivities.

AB The bright colours of nestlings' mouths are conspicuous when they beg. Three main hypotheses suggest that nestling mouth colour (1) increases detectability in dim ambient light, (2) signals health or quality, or (3) provides a means of offspring recognition. To distinguish these hypotheses, we manipulated both the flange colour (visual and UV spectrum) and the ambient light in the nest of three cavity-nesting species: a woodpecker and two passerines. Parents avoided nestlings with black-painted flanges to a greater extent in dim than in bright ambient light conditions, and the effect was most pronounced in the woodpecker, which had the deepest and darkest nest cavity of the three species studied. There was no difference in mass gain of nestlings with flanges painted white or yellow or with UV-block cream relative to controls, suggesting that neither UV reflectance nor carotenoid colour was a cue of nestling quality. These results support the detectability hypothesis and not the health-signalling or recognition function for bright flanges. Black-painted flycatcher nestlings were more disadvantaged in short trials (<3 h) than in longer trials (>3 h), and we developed a model to explain how nonvisual components of begging, such as vocalizations or movements, may become more important than visual cues as nestlings become hungrier and beg more intensively over time. Our results suggest that bright flanges in cavity-nesting birds evolved primarily so that parents can locate offspring in dim light, but competition among nestlings may lead to exaggerated brightness. Furthermore, other components of begging such as movements or vocalizations may temporarily override a disadvantage of dull mouth colour. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The vocal motor plan is one of the most fundamental and poorly understood elements of primate vocal production. Here we tested whether a single vocal motor plan comprises the full length of a vocalization. We hypothesized that if a single motor plan was determined at vocal onset, the acoustic features early in the call should be predictive of the subsequent call structure. Analyses were performed on two classes of features in marmoset phee calls: continuous and discrete. We first generated correlation matrices of all the continuous features of phee calls. Results showed that the start frequency of a phee's first pulse significantly correlated with all subsequent spectral features. Moreover, significant correlations were evident within both the spectral and temporal features, but there was little relationship between these feature classes. Using a discrete feature, 'the number of pulses in the phee call', a discriminant function was able to correctly classify the number of pulses in the calls well above chance based solely on the acoustic structure of the call's first pulse. Together, these data suggest that a vocal motor plan for the complete call structure is established at call onset. These findings provide a key insight into the mechanisms underlying vocal production in nonhuman primates. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Insects with facultative social behaviour permit direct examination of factors associated with the expression of division of labour: why do some females remain in their natal nest as nonreproductive foragers, while others disperse? The facultatively social halictid bee Megalopta genalis shows strong reproductive division of labour, associated with body size ( foragers tend to be smaller than queens and dispersers). We used M. genalis to test two hypotheses for the expression of worker behaviour: ( 1) queens suppress reproduction by subordinates, which then forage, and ( 2) small-bodied females are handicapped as reproductives, and therefore take on a foraging role to assist a more fertile relative ( the 'subfertility' hypothesis). We removed queens from 19 nests and found that the remaining foragers enlarged their ovaries and reproduced at the same rate as solitary reproductives from unmanipulated (nonremoval) nests. This observation suggests that queen dominance limited reproduction by subordinates, and that foragers were not handicapped reproductives. To investigate the effect of body size variation on reproductive rate in the absence of social interactions, we placed single, newly eclosed females into 31 observation nests. Body size was not correlated with reproductive output or with the females' tenure in the observation nests. Nor was there any correlation between body size and number of brood cells in 21 solitary-female nonremoval nests. Taken together these data show that small females were not inherently poor reproductives. We also found that ovaries of reproductive females from social groups were larger than those of solitary reproductives, suggesting that social structure shapes ovary development.

AB The assessment of emotional states in animals, particularly positive ones, remains a scientific challenge. We investigated differences in behavioural and physiological measures recorded in sheep, Ovis orientalis aries, during situations likely to coincide with negative, intermediate and positive emotional valence. Reactions of 15 sheep were observed during separation from group members ( negative valence), standing in the feeding area ( intermediate valence) and being voluntarily groomed by a familiar human ( positive valence). Several ear postures, relative eye aperture, cardiorespiration and body surface humidity and temperature were recorded continuously for up to 4 min in each experimental situation. Data were analysed using linear mixed-effects models, and correlations were calculated between ethophysiological measurements. Groomed sheep showed few ear posture changes, low proportions of forward ear postures, low relative eye aperture and a low variance in body surface humidity. The values of most of these measures increased linearly towards standing in the feeding area and further towards separation from group members. Conversely, groomed sheep showed high proportions of axial ear postures, long mean interheartbeat intervals and high heart rate variability, with values declining linearly towards the negative situation. In addition, behavioural and cardiac measurements correlated moderately to strongly. In conclusion, emotional valence in sheep could be differentiated by both behavioural and physiological measures. Based on our data, it may be possible to replace some physiological measures with observations of ear postures. The findings provide valuable insights for assessing both negative and positive emotion in animals, which can help to promote positive experiences in captive housing conditions.

AB Many prey species have evolved bitter-tasting toxins that effectively protect them from potential predators. While predators can learn to associate the taste of defended prey with the noxious effects of the toxins, it is unclear whether bitter tastes also function as deterrents. We explicitly tested the effectiveness of a nontoxic distasteful chemical as an antipredator defence. We gave four groups of European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, a sequential colour discrimination task, where one colour signalled undefended mealworms, Tenebrio molitor, and the other signalled defended mealworms that had either been injected with or coated with either a high or a low concentration of Bitrex solution ( a nontoxic bitter-tasting solution). Birds ate all of the prey presented in this way, but performed disgust responses after eating prey coated in Bitrex solution. Birds were then given a series of trials in which they received defended and undefended prey items simultaneously. Birds that received prey injected with Bitrex attacked similar numbers of defended and undefended prey, whereas birds that received prey coated in Bitrex ate significantly fewer defended than undefended prey. Birds given prey coated in a high concentration of Bitrex showed a stronger preference for undefended prey than birds given prey coated in a low concentration of Bitrex. Our experiment demonstrates that a nontoxic distasteful chemical can protect insect prey from predation, but only under very specific conditions.

AB In the field, phenotypic determinants of competitive success are not always absolute. For example, contest experience may alter future competitive performance. As future contests are not determined solely on phenotypic attributes, prior experience could also potentially alter phenotype-fitness associations. In this study, we examined the influence of single and multiple experiences on contest outcomes in the jumping spider Phidippus clarus. We also examined whether phenotype-fitness associations altered as individuals gained more experience. Using both size-matched contests and a tournament design, we found that both winning and losing experience affected future contest success; males with prior winning experience were more likely to win subsequent contests. Although experience was a significant determinant of success in future contests, male weight was approximately 1.3 times more important than experience in predicting contest outcomes. Despite the importance of experience in determining contest outcomes, patterns of selection did not change between rounds. Overall, our results show that experience can be an important determinant in contest outcomes, even in short-lived invertebrates, and that experience alone is unlikely to alter phenotype-fitness associations.

AB Vocal imitation can inform receivers about the social background of signallers because shared signals reflect learning experiences. Open-ended imitation can generate shared signals that indicate current social affiliation, whereas limited vocal plasticity in adulthood can permit signals to reflect an individual's origin. I examined the relations between vocal learning, signal sharing and social dynamics in red crossbills, Loxia curvirostra. Two levels of shared variation exist within crossbills' contact calls: discrete call variants distinguish ecologically diverged crossbill forms, and within these variants, some bonded pairs produce calls with nearly identical structures. Assessment of vocal and social behaviour of experimentally housed birds revealed that some adult crossbills converged on calls shared with companions of their own form, but no birds learned new, categorically distinct call variants. Also, while the process of call convergence within the bounds of discrete variants was associated with affiliation, birds that produced different contact call variants interacted less frequently and less amicably. These results suggest that call learning is limited in adult crossbills, generating calls with two levels of shared variation and multiple social functions: discrete contact call variants reflect birds' ecological forms, while pair-distinctive calls within those discrete variants reflect current social affiliation. Thus, a single social call concurrently reflects bonding among conspecifics of common origin and promotes the social isolation of ecologically diverged forms of red crossbills.

   CONTEXT
AB The concept of behavioural syndromes hypothesizes that consistent behaviours across various situations mediate important life history trade-offs, and predicts correlations among behavioural traits. We studied the consistency of behavioural responses across three ecological situations (exploration of an environment altered with a novel object, aggression towards conspecifics, risk taking) in male collared flycatchers. We developed behavioural tests that could be applied in the birds' natural habitat, thus not requiring the capture of animals. Across individuals, we found positive covariation between exploration, aggression and risk taking, but the magnitude of these relationships varied. Variation in behaviour was also related to capture probability. Exploratory and risk-taking individuals were more likely to enter a trap than individuals with averse characteristics. Moreover, with the trapped birds, there was an association between the time needed for successful capture and exploration, and we found stronger correlations between behaviours in comparison with effects calculated from the whole sample of individuals. These patterns were independent of territory quality, male age, condition and breeding experience. Consequently, behavioural responses to different ecosocial challenges are determined by individual-specific characteristics that are manifested in correlative behaviours. Hence, behavioural types may be potential subjects for reproductive and life history adaptations. Our results have important implications for field studies of animals, because they suggest that capturing protocols may not randomly sample the observed population.

AB Competition for fertile females determines male reproductive success in many species. The priority of access model predicts that male dominance rank determines access to females, but this model has been difficult to test in wild populations, particularly in promiscuous mating systems. Tests of the model have produced variable results, probably because of the differing socioecological circumstances of individual species and populations. We tested the predictions of the priority of access model in the chimpanzees of Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Chimpanzees are an interesting species in which to test the model because of their fission-fusion grouping patterns, promiscuous mating system and alternative male mating strategies. We determined paternity for 34 offspring over a 22-year period and found that the priority of access model was generally predictive of male reproductive success. However, we found that younger males had higher success per male than older males, and low-ranking males sired more offspring than predicted. Low-ranking males sired offspring with younger, less desirable females and by engaging in consortships more often than high-ranking fathers. Although alpha males never sired offspring with related females, inbreeding avoidance of high-ranking male relatives did not completely explain the success of low-ranking males. While our work confirms that male rank typically predicts male chimpanzee reproductive success, other factors are also important; mate choice and alternative male strategies can give low-ranking males access to females more often than would be predicted by the model. Furthermore, the success of younger males suggests that they are more successful in sperm competition. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The main benefit of grouping is reduced predation risk, while the main costs are thought to derive from competition and increased frequency of social interactions. While the benefits of grouping are well known, its costs have rarely been studied. We studied growth of nine-spined sticklebacks from two marine (high-predation) and two pond (low-predation) populations by rearing them either individually or in groups from hatching until they reached adult size. We found that living in groups had a strong ( up to 14%) negative effect on growth in fish from low-predation populations, despite the lack of constraints originating from resource limitation, predation, reproduction or parasites. Group living had no effect on the growth of fish from high-predation populations. We also studied willingness to shoal: fish from all populations showed strong shoaling behaviour. Our results suggest that the social cost of shoaling can be high, but individuals from high-predation populations seem to have adapted to minimize these costs better than individuals from low-predation populations.

AB The competitive group appears to be a major component of the mating system of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, bringing together a single female (nuclear animal or NA) and multiple males (escorts) that compete for physical proximity to her. We examined the relation of body size of the NA to the number of attending escorts and, separately, we determined the relation of a female's body size to the size of her calf. Using underwater videogrammetry in Maui waters during 1997-2002, we measured the body length of the NA in each of 42 competitive groups. We also measured the lengths of the mother and her calf in each of 92 mother-calf groups. The number of initial escorts in a competitive group was positively correlated with NA body length. Longer mothers were associated with longer calves, even after accounting for seasonal differences in calf length. We conclude that male humpback whales prefer to associate with larger females and that larger females produce larger calves. Theoretically, larger calves have a greater chance of survival than do smaller calves. The choice of a larger female may therefore increase the reproductive success of an escort that succeeds in mating. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The study of chemoreception by squamate reptiles has become integral to understanding many aspects of their behaviour. However, previous studies of snakes have concentrated on its importance in prey choice and few studies have examined its role in kin discrimination. We examined the role of chemoreception not only in prey selection by ingestively naive neonate smooth snakes, but also as a mechanism for discrimination between kin. We tested the responses of neonate smooth snakes to cotton-tipped applicators labelled with odours of potential prey species and control substances, both before and after their natal shedding events. Neonates tested prior to their natal shedding event were able to discriminate between potential prey species and an odourless control but not between potential prey and a pungent control. In contrast, neonates tested after their natal shedding event showed a significantly increased tongue-flick response towards the scent of nonkin conspecifics, lizard (Anguis fragilis and Zootoca vivipara) and mammalian prey (Mus musculus) compared to that towards both pungent and odourless controls. However, scents of invertebrate prey species and kin, while eliciting more tongue-flicks than the odourless control, did not elicit more than the pungent control. The apparent ability of smooth snake neonates to differentiate between kin and nonkin using chemoreception was confirmed during 'blind' trials. The mechanism by which kin discrimination occurs is discussed. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB True individual recognition (TIR), the ability to recognize conspecific individuals on the basis of identity cues, is required for the evolution of several social traits (e.g. the maintenance of dominance hierarchies). However, knowledge about the distribution and functional significance of TIR is scant in some vertebrate groups, such as reptiles. In this study we used a functional modi. cation of a habituation-dishabituation paradigm to investigate the existence and adaptive significance of TIR in a territorial lizard (Podarcis hispanica, Lacertidae). Males discriminated between individual rivals of similar characteristics (e. g. size, weight, familiarity) solely on the basis of their scent marks. Males also remembered the spatial location of scent marks and subsequently behaved more aggressively towards rival males that consistently marked in the core than on the periphery of their experimental terrarium. Together, these results suggest that, in this species, scent marks function to identify the potential threat posed by each individual neighbour, allowing resident males to allocate their aggressive behaviour accordingly. Our findings challenge the simplistic and commonly held view that 'dear enemy' phenomena in lizards are exclusively based on familiarity asymmetries, and support an alternative threat level hypothesis in which TIR may be more important than previously acknowledged.

AB During mate choice, females can assess male quality by sampling one male after the other or by paying attention to the outcomes of male-male interactions. The latter strategy, called eavesdropping, allows females access to information about males' relative quality and therefore reduces the time, energy and other costs associated with searching for a mate. For oscine females, information can be gathered both by listening to male-male singing interactions and by visually observing male-male interactions. To date, however, there has been no comparison of the subsequent behaviour of females according to the specific type of information (acoustic or visual) gathered from male-male interactions. In two successive experiments, we explored how female domestic canaries, Serinus canaria, use visual and acoustic information obtained from a male-male interaction to direct their sexual behaviour. We found that, whereas females preferred the overlapping song of a singing interaction, they avoided the winner of a physical contest over food. The function and range of signals used in these two types of male-male competition may account for this discrepancy. Timing of song during countersinging is the expression of ritualized dominance relationships using a long-range secondary sexual trait, whereas threat displays used in food competition are not secondary sexual traits and are potentially harmful at close proximity. The timing of song during countersinging seems to be a more important cue for females than dominance over food in determining their sexual behaviour.

AB We monitored the movements of a starved model predator, the carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius, in arenas containing test papers upon which beetles had previously walked and unexposed control papers. Significantly, beetles accumulated on the unexposed controls, indicating conspecific avoidance (i. e. behaviour designed to avoid locations previously traversed by individuals of the same species). This finding is novel and important because optimal Levy-fiight (scale-free) search patterns for the location of sparsely and randomly distributed prey resources can emerge from conspecific avoidance. This finding may account for the shortcomings of random-walk (scale-finite) models when used to predict large-scale movement and search patterns by extrapolating from observations made at small scales.

AB Little is known about the specific environmental cues that gravid females use to initiate nesting behaviours, especially in aquatic species that are restricted to nesting in terrestrial environments. I used 15 atmospheric and oceanic environmental variables to help explain the nightly variation in the number of loggerhead turtle nests laid and the proportion of emergences that resulted in a nest. The number of nests laid was related to principal components weighted heavily by rainfall (positive association) and tidal cycles (nesting occurred when tides were moderate), although the predictive power of the environmental variables was limited. In addition, a higher proportion of emerging females laid nests during nights associated with other factors, including temperature and maximum tidal cycles. Since rainfall is commonly associated with nesting in many turtle species, I also tested the hypothesis that nesting on nights during rainfall results in a lowered probability of nest depredation. However, I found no support for this hypothesis. The turtle's large body size makes it unlikely that nesting during rainfall slows evaporative water loss or makes it easier to dig nests by softening the sand, but there may be other reasons for associating nesting with rainfall events, for example locomotion may be more efficient in moist sand. Nesting female loggerhead turtles appear to use multiple environmental cues to guide their nesting behaviours, and may use different sensory processes to determine when the weather is suitable for emerging from the ocean, and subsequently whether the conditions are conducive for laying eggs.

AB Male humpback whales produce complex songs during the breeding season, yet the singing behaviour of males and whether songs function in male contests and/or through female choice are still poorly understood. We investigated song function by obtaining simultaneous observations of the positions and movements of singing and nonsinging whales in real time during their migration off the east coast of Australia. We collected movement data by acoustic tracking using a hydrophone array, land-based visual tracking and observations from a small boat. Of the 114 singers analysed, 66 ( 58%) associated with conspecifics. Singers were significantly more likely to join groups containing a mother-calf pair than other groups. Males started to sing after joining groups only if they consisted of a mother-calf pair not escorted by another male. Singers also associated longer and sang for a significantly greater proportion of time with mother-calf pairs than any other group type. Associating with mother-calf pairs has been shown to be a reproductively successful strategy for males. In contrast, whales that joined singers were usually lone males; these associations were brief and singers typically stopped singing in the presence of other males. This is the highest reported incidence in humpback whales of males singing when escorting females and supports an intersexual function of song in humpback whales. We suggest that males joining singers are prospecting for females rather than engaging in male social ordering and that singing may incur the cost of attracting competing males.

AB Results from a previous study, known as the 'Lake Experiment' ( Gould & Gould 1982, Animal Minde Human Mind, Berlin, Springer- Verlag, 269-298), suggest that honeybee, Apis mellifera, foragers may assess the locations advertised by the waggle dances that they follow and reject dances for 'implausible' locations that are unlikely to yield food. However, alternative explanations for these results, which do not require bees to use cognitive maps or to evaluate the 'plausibility' of potential food sources, have also been proposed. To address this ambiguity, we repeated the study and used video analysis of dance followers in the hive to determine whether they refused to respond to implausible dances for a feeder on a lake. We found that bees following lake dances were just as likely to leave the hive as bees following control dances for a feeder on land. Bees also took the same amount of time to leave the hive after following dances for both locations, which suggests that their motivation to leave did not depend on the plausibility of the dance they had followed. Contrary to prior findings, our results provide no evidence that honeybees assess the plausibility of information contained in waggle dances or reject dances for locations that are unlikely to yield food. Thus, we conclude that the original Lake Experiment should no longer be cited as evidence that honeybees possess cognitive maps, 'insight' or 'imagination'.

AB With respect to mate choice, females of many species discriminate between males on the basis of age. The adaptive significance of age-based mate choice is unclear, with various hypotheses making conflicting predictions. We examined the possibility of female preference in the fruit fly Drosophila pseudoobscura, a species where females gain no significant nutritional benefits from mating. Females were shown to prefer to mate with old males in two-male choice experiments and accepted old males faster than young males in single-male tests. Females mated to old males had a higher fecundity, possibly related to a transfer of more sperm and/or a larger volume of accessory gland proteins during the longer copulation durations experienced with old males, although these possibilities were not directly tested. Hence, females appear to derive direct benefits from preferring to mate with older males. In contrast, there was no evidence of mate preference for the sons of either old or young males when matched for age, indicating that the mating advantage of old males is not passed to their sons. These sets of experiments suggest that in D. pseudoobscura the benefit of age-based preference to females is increased fecundity due to greater investment per mating by older males.

AB Successful reproduction often involves complex communication, but signalling capabilities frequently differ between the sexes. Research on sexual communication in anuran amphibians has focused heavily on the advertisement call made by reproductive males, with less attention paid to the release signal that males (and some females) give in response to misdirected attempts at amplexus. In the cane toad the release signal consists of a mechanical component (vibrations of the body wall, given by both sexes) as well as an auditory call (apparently given by males alone). We investigated the cane toad release signal to ask: (1) do females call in a manner similar to that of males but at a frequency inaudible to human ears? and (2) what stimuli (acoustic or otherwise) induce males to terminate amplexus? Analysis of calls over a wide (4-100 000 Hz) frequency range confirmed that female toads are indeed mute. Acoustic playback experiments revealed that males were less likely to dismount if we prevented an otherwise vocal target animal from making a release call. However, adding a release call to an otherwise mute target did not initiate dismount. Instead, the cue eliciting male dismount appears to involve synchrony between the release call and some other factor (probably, vibration of the clasped animal). Sexual dimorphism in skin rugosity also may play a role in amplexus termination. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The distribution of food among altricial bird nestlings is the result of an interaction between parental feeding decisions and scramble competition between nestmates. Both young and parents can potentially be in control of the outcome of this interaction. In great tits, each parent feeds from a fixed location on the nest rim, thereby forcing nestlings to choose between the father's and the mother's location. It was previously found that hungry nestlings approached the female preferentially and were more likely to be fed, appearing as if females showed a stronger preference to feed hungry young than males. However, nestlings were free to move in that study, and the effects of nestling positioning could not be disentangled from those of parental food allocation decisions. Here, we experimentally divided broods into two halves and randomly assigned each half of the brood to one side of the nest cup where only one parent could feed them. One nestling in each half-brood was food deprived to manipulate short-term hunger state. Both parents showed a similar preference to feed the more hungry nestlings, suggesting that the previously observed difference was due to offspring positioning rather than active parental choice. Our study shows that food allocation is partially under nestling control and suggests that nestlings adjust positioning and begging behaviour to the profitability of a given position in the nest cup.

AB Colour patterns play an integral role in the signalling processes of many fish species. In particular, carotenoid- based pigments influence nuptial coloration patterns in ornamental fish. Less is known about the role of other dietary pigments in behavioural processes. We studied the effect of dietary pigments on skin pigmentation, growth and behaviour of male flame- red dwarf gourami. Groups of these fish were fed either a control diet or one of three different diets, Lucantin Pink, beetroot juice powder or Overseal Carantho powder, daily for 12 weeks. Mass and colour measurements were taken for each fish every 2 weeks. The addition of synthetic astaxanthin ( Lucantin Pink) significantly increased red coloration, whereas betalainbased ( beetroot juice powder) and anthocyanin- based ( Overseal Carantho powder) pigments did not affect skin colour. Fish mass increased across all diets and the addition of these dietary pigments did not significantly affect growth. At the end of the 12- week trial, fish from each diet treatment were used to determine female preference to male colour intensity and male social interaction. Females preferred to associate with males fed Lucantin Pink and, although clear social hierarchies were observed among groups of male fish, no significant effects of diet on social interaction were found. Fish fed the control, Lucantin Pink and Overseal Carantho powder diets showed a lightening in skin coloration following group activity and social interaction. However, skin colour and skin lightness of fish fed the beetroot juice powder diet were unaffected by periods of social interaction, suggesting a possible colour maintenance property of betalain- based pigments.

AB Animals that actively defend all or part of their home range for the exclusive use of members of their social group are considered territorial. Defended areas may contain resources such as dens or nests, key foraging sites, or sexual partners that vary in value by season. We investigated territoriality and the function of long-ranging barking sequences in a wild population of swift foxes, Vulpes velox. We monitored space use and barking behaviour and combined this with experimental acoustic playback during the mating season. Mated male foxes used barking sequences mainly inside or close to the boundary of the pair's home range core (50% kernel contour isoline of estimated home range). Similarly, male resident foxes responded more intensely with barking if a playback simulating intrusion by a rival occurred inside of the core compared to outside of it. However, it was common for home range cores to be partly overlapped by neighbouring home ranges and therefore we cannot arbitrarily de. ne 50% home range cores as territories. Still, pair home ranges had areas that were exclusive to the mated pair and their primary and secondary daytime sleeping dens were usually located inside these areas. These results suggest that the barking sequence is used in territorial defence and we conclude that at least male swift foxes are territorial in the mating season and they use a long-ranging acoustic signal in territory defence.

AB In oviparous species, mothers can optimize the incubation environments of their offspring by selecting nest sites with conditions conducive to embryonic development. Hence, maternal nest-site selection can enhance egg survival and offspring fitness. However, the challenge to a nesting female is complex because of trade-offs among relevant parameters (e. g. hotter nests may be drier) and seasonal shifts in ambient conditions. Moreover, the influence of nest conditions on offspring sex ratios adds another level of complexity for species with environmental sex determination. To elucidate these issues, we need field data on nesting behaviour that incorporate the multiple influences that operate under natural conditions. We radiotracked gravid jacky dragons, Amphibolurus muricatus, in open forest habitats of southeastern Australia to document the lizards' criteria for nest-site choice females selected sites with lower than average canopy cover, resulting in relatively warm nests throughout the prolonged nesting season. Although soil moisture levels decreased over this period and were strongly correlated with mean temperatures, female lizards were able to locate nesting sites that provided consistently moist (and increasingly warm) incubation conditions as the season progressed. Such sites apparently became more difficult to find later in the season, resulting in a higher incidence of test holes prior to nest excavation. Seasonal shifts in diel maximum temperatures also pushed the daily time of digging activity into the evening. Because jacky dragons have temperature-dependent sex determination, the seasonal shift in mean incubation temperatures of natural nests would generate seasonal shifts in offspring sex ratios in a direction likely to enhance maternal fitness.

AB Sharing food is costly, and animals rarely share food with unrelated individuals. Males may share food with females when females are fertile or when female nutrition will affect offspring. Such benefits are known for insects and birds, but not for mammals. This study examined the effect of female reproductive state ( ovarian cycling, pregnancy, lactation) on food sharing between mates in monogamous owl monkeys, Aotus spp. Male-female pairs of captive owl monkeys at the DuMond Conservancy ( Miami, FL, U. S. A.) were regularly observed feeding from October 2003 to November 2004. To determine the onset and duration of pregnancy, urine was collected from females and analysed for the progesterone metabolite pregnanediol-3 alpha glucuronide using enzyme immunoassay. Food transfers from females to males did not vary across reproductive state, and males did not transfer food most often to females when females could potentially become pregnant. Conversely, females most often begged for food when they were lactating, and males most often transferred food to females when their mates were lactating. Compared to males of polygamous species, male owl monkeys are relatively certain of paternity. In addition to providing infant care directly, male owl monkeys would benefit from ensuring that their mates receive adequate nutrition because it indirectly provides nutrition for offspring by enhancing the quantity and/ or quality of the mates' milk.

AB Animals may acquire information on potential breeding sites by prospecting, which allows future optimal selection of breeding territories. The reproductive success of conspecifics, as public information (PI), has been proposed as one of the cues that prospectors could gather and then use for future reproductive decisions. We experimentally decreased brood size in spotless starling nests to investigate whether this species gathers PI while visiting conspecific nests. We expected visiting frequency to decline with the experimental decrease in brood size because visitors are expected to prefer sites with high reproductive success and to spend more time at those sites to gain familiarity. Furthermore, the effect of the experimental manipulation was recorded at three different stages of the nestling period to establish the importance of the reliability of PI. Brood size decreased in direct relation to the manipulation and, consequently, parental feeding rates decreased too. Visiting frequency of starlings to conspecific nests was affected by the interaction between the experimental manipulation and the stage in the nestling period: visiting frequency increased from decreased to control nests at the end of the nestling period, not so strongly in the middle of that period and it was not affected by the manipulation at the beginning of it. This variation in visiting frequency seemed to be better explained by brood size than by parental provisioning rate. These results may be interpreted as spotless starlings visiting conspecific nests to gather PI, which seems to increase its informative value when its reliability does.

AB It has been suggested that social dynamics affect social learning but empirical support for this idea is scarce. Here we show that affiliate relationships among kin indeed enhance the performance of common ravens, Corvus corax, in a social learning task. Via daily behavioural protocols we first monitored social dynamics in our group of captive young ravens. Siblings spent significantly more time in close proximity to each other than did nonsiblings. We subsequently tested birds on a stimulus enhancement task in model-observer dyads composed of both siblings and nonsiblings. During demonstration the observer could watch the model manipulating one particular object (target object) in an adjacent room. After removing the model, the observer was confronted with five different objects including the former target object. Observers from sibling dyads handled the target object for significantly longer periods of time as compared with the other four available objects, whereas observers from nonsibling dyads did not show a preference for the target object. Also, siblings matched the model's decision to cache or not to cache objects significantly more often than did nonsiblings. Hence, siblings were likely to attend to both, the behaviour of the model (caching or noncaching) and object-specific details. Our results support the hypothesis that affiliate relations between individuals affect the transmission of information and may lead to directed social learning even when spatial proximity has been experimentally controlled for.

AB Studies from many different taxa have demonstrated that dominance rank greatly influences individual space use. While the importance of dominance among female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, was debated in the past, mounting evidence now shows that rank is very important. In particular, rank has been shown to influence body mass, foraging strategies, association patterns, and ultimately, reproductive success. In this study, we investigated how rank influenced female space use among chimpanzees, P.t. schweinfurthii, at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Analysing 10 years of data, we found that new immigrants used areas away from dominant females, and that subordinates had lower site fidelity. We also found that high-ranking females had smaller core areas and that this size difference was pronounced during periods of food scarcity when food competition is highest. These patterns suggest that dominant females outcompete subordinates, forcing them to settle elsewhere, range more widely, and shift their space use across time.

AB Animals with low energy budgets may attempt to deceive their opponents during contests by producing social displays that falsely indicate their physiological state. We used overnight laboratory experiments to examine the relation between physiological capacity and social behaviour in a nocturnal gecko. Velvet geckos, Oedura lesueurii, use loose surface rocks that vary considerably in temperature as diurnal retreat sites. At night males defend retreat sites and the outcomes of contests are resolved via physical duels. We manipulated a gecko's physiological state at night by allocating geckos to diurnal retreat sites with different thermal regimes. At night geckos from colder diurnal retreat sites were less mobile, and had poorer locomotor performance, than conspecifics from warmer diurnal retreat sites. We hypothesized that such differences in physiological capacity would be reflected in outcomes of territorial contests between pairs of adult males. However, geckos from colder diurnal retreat sites were just as likely to win nocturnal contests for a limited resource as were geckos from warmer diurnal retreat sites. This result may reflect differences in the behaviour of geckos with different thermal exposure. Geckos from colder diurnal retreat sites were significantly more aggressive during contests than conspecifics from warmer diurnal retreat sites. Thus, animals may attempt to deceive opponents by producing a social display that vastly overstates their current physiological state.

AB Foraging and vigilance are mutually exclusive for some foraging tactics but not others. Thus, in response to changes in predation danger, prey species with multiple foraging tactics may switch facultatively between them, allowing for differential levels of vigilance. Using data from focal observations collected over 4 years ( 2002-2004, 2006) in Shark Bay, Western Australia, we explored the use of two tactics, cropping and excavation, by dugongs, Dugong dugon, foraging under risk of predation by tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier. Overall, dugongs predominantly used the cropping tactic, which allows for regular visual scans, to harvest temperate sea grass species. Dugongs only used the excavation tactic, which precludes regular visual scans but allows individuals to access the nutritious rhizomes of preferred tropical sea grass species, in months when tropical species were most available ( February-May). However, during these months the time dugongs allocated to excavation was inversely related to shark abundance rather than the availability of these sea grass species. We conclude that use of foraging tactics by dugongs is sensitive to predation danger, and that individuals manage their risk of mortality via reduced use of a pro. table but potentially hazardous tactic when the likelihood of encountering predators is high. Excavating dugongs are more likely to disrupt sea grass meadow structure and promote succession than are those engaged in cropping. Thus, by altering the time dugongs devote to these alternative tactics, tiger sharks may exert an indirect effect on sea grass patch composition and structure and, ultimately, benthic communities.

AB Many traits of ant plants and their ant symbionts are thought to be coevolved, but there is little evidence for adaptation in these symbioses. We investigated the ant trait of worker attraction to, and consequent patrolling of, new plant shoots, and we tested two hypotheses to explain the maintenance of this trait. (1) New shoots chemically mimic ant brood or alarm pheromones ( a `sensory trap') and thereby elicit worker patrolling of vulnerable plant parts. ( 2) Worker attraction to new shoots is the result of selection on the ant to direct patrolling to the plant parts that maximize the capture of plant- provided rewards. As our model system, we used the ant plant Cordia nodosa and its protecting ant symbiont Allomerus octoarticulatus var. demerarae. Gas chromatography analyses suggested that compounds were shared between new leaves and Allomerus brood, and Allomerus workers were attracted to brood extracts of nonself colonies, findings that are consistent with the sensory trap hypothesis. However, patrolling Allomerus workers were attracted only to new leaves, whereas brood- tending workers collected from inside plant domatia (`nurses') were attracted to Allomerus brood rather than to new leaves. Only patrollers were attracted to new leaves significantly more than to mature leaves, and nurse workers were larger than patroller workers, which suggests that the behavioural differences reflect caste differentiation. Therefore, we reject the sensory trap hypothesis. Our results are consistent with the idea that worker attraction to new shoots is the result of selection.

AB When a female can mate with more than one male, males are thought to reduce intrasexual competition by prolonging mating, that is, mating longer than necessary for sperm release. Two principal hypotheses have been proposed to explain the advantage of prolonged mating. The extended mate guarding hypothesis suggests that with longer mating, the female is less likely to be inseminated by another male. The ejaculate transfer hypothesis suggests that with longer mating, more of the male's sperm are stored. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test these alternatives simultaneously by manipulating duration of mating and examining effects on sperm release, storage and female polyandry. We found support for the mate guarding hypothesis in the golden orb- weaving spider Nephila clavipes; the longer the mating with the first male, the lower the likelihood of the female copulating with another male. This was not due to influence on female receptivity but on the ability of subsequent males to couple. Inconsistent with the ejaculate transfer hypothesis was the observation that duration of mating with the first male did not linearly correlate with release or storage of its sperm. We suggest that prolonged mating does not result in sexual conflict in this species. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Animals commonly leave scent messages by depositing pheromones, faeces, or urine. The intensity of a chemical message may fade over time, but the 'intention' remains the same. We argue that house flies, Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae), require a message with evolving (sensu changing over time) information content. Gravid females reportedly deploy a pheromone that induces concerted oviposition so that many even-aged larvae ameliorate the resource, such as animal manure. However, continued oviposition by late-arriving females may result in age disparity and cannibalism of larval offspring. Thus, we predicted that house flies have a type of cue that evolves from oviposition induction to inhibition some time after eggs are deposited on a resource. Here we show (1) the existence of such evolving ovipositional cues, (2) the adverse fitness consequences that accrue from ignoring the inhibitory cues and (3) the mechanism by which these cues evolve. The evolving cues depend upon a key bacterial strain, Klebsiella oxytoca, which originates with female M. domestica and which proliferates over time on the surface of deposited eggs. At a threshold density of this strain, further oviposition is inhibited. By deploying such evolving cues, female M. domestica can visit an oviposition site just once and deposit cues that will mediate immediate oviposition induction followed by delayed inhibition, thereby ensuring conditions conducive for offspring development.

AB The female shield bug Parastrachia japonensis provisions its young by dragging fruit to its burrow. Field observations showed that the bug took a winding path when searching for a suitable fruit, but took the shortest route when homing to the burrow. Displaced homing bugs always walked straight towards the fictive burrow, suggesting that they use path integration to orient. After a homing bug neared the entrance of its burrow, it stopped and started beating the surface of fallen leaves with its antennae. To determine whether these bugs use navigational cues other than those used for path integration, when in the vicinity of the burrow, we blocked their sensory organs and presented them with their own burrows in a laboratory experiment. Although nearly all bugs whose eyes had been blocked found their burrows, the antennae-blocked bugs did not. Homing bugs encountering various experimentally manipulated burrows, such as those containing their own nymphs with an alien burrow's substrate or their own burrow's substrate with alien nymphs, entered burrows only if they were made of the original substrate. When we presented bugs with their own burrows along the homing route, they entered their burrows at every homing point, even at the earliest stage of the homing process. These results suggest that the chemical cues marked around a female's burrow can suppress the use of path integration, and that P. japonensis uses cues hierarchically to accomplish precise homing.

AB Comparative studies of vocal repertoires over the geographical range of a species can improve our understanding of the function and evolution of animal vocalizations. They may also help to elucidate relationships between populations, where genetic studies are missing or difficult to perform. We recorded male bearded seal vocalizations from four sites throughout their Arctic distribution. We measured 16 parameters for each vocalization and examined variability using classification tree analyses. There were four major call categories: trill, ascent, sweep and moan. Trills divided further into three subcategories: trills with ascent/plume, long trills and short trills. Not all call categories were present at all sites: the ascent occurred only in Alaska and western Canada, the sweep occurred only in Svalbard and in the High Canadian Arctic, and the trill with ascent/plume occurred at all sites except Svalbard. Geographical differences between sites were apparent in repertoire size as well as in vocal structure. Furthermore, an east-west gradient in structural similarities between call types was apparent. The vocal repertoire of bearded seals seemed to be relatively stable; for example, over a period of 16 years no calls were lost or added to the Alaskan repertoire. The most likely explanation for the observed vocal differences between sites is the geographical isolation of populations by physical distance. Other factors, such as varying ecological influences (e.g. adaptation to varying ice habitats) or sexual selection, may also contribute to vocal variability and result in the observed geographical variation.

AB Tightly coupled evolutionary associations between parasites and their hosts are well known. What is less well characterized is the behavioural specialization of parasites that exploit different hosts in different parts of the parasite's geographical range. Here we examine behavioural specialization among populations of a parasitoid fly, Ormia ochracea, that exploit different host species of crickets in different parts of the fly's range. We conducted a field experiment to compare phonotactic attraction of flies from Florida, Texas, California and Hawaii (U.S.A.) to the songs of their local host species of cricket versus their attraction to the songs of species of crickets utilized as hosts elsewhere within the flies' range. We found strong behavioural specialization of fly populations, with preferential phonotaxis towards the song of the local host species of cricket. These results suggest strong behavioural specialization of flies, but that specialization does not constrain or preclude the rapid adoption of novel hosts.

AB Researchers with diverse interests in topics ranging from the formation of dominance hierarchies and social intelligence to animal personalities have predicted specific, and often conflicting, relations between social rank, neophobia and learning ability. We investigated the relations between these variables in captive groups of wild-caught starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, adopting a multidimensional approach to social rank and neophobia. Both agonistic and competitive rank orders were determined for each group and we tested individuals in the absence of their groupmates for object neophobia, latency to feed in a novel environment and performance on an extractive foraging task. In each starling group, the fastest learners occupied the highest competitive ranks, supporting the hypothesis that cognitive ability is positively correlated with social dominance. Competitive rank orders, however, did not correlate significantly with agonistic rank orders. Situation-specific foraging neophobia was suggested: individuals showed consistency in their latencies to feed near a variety of novel objects, but no significant correlation was found between this measure of object neophobia and latency to feed in a novel environment. Starlings fastest to feed in the novel environment were fastest in solving the foraging task. We discuss the implications of these findings for researchers studying hierarchy formation in animal groups, social intelligence and animal personalities.

AB Among songbird species, the canary, Serinus canaria, is considered to be an 'open-ended' song learner because adults continue to change their syllable repertoire throughout their lives. However, it remains unclear whether the capacity to alter the syllable repertoire allows birds to acquire new song material to correct abnormal song characteristics that result from auditory isolation during development. To address this question, we reared males without any experience of typical adult conspecific song models from fledging to sexual maturity. They were then placed for at least 2 years in an aviary that included adult conspecific males. Discriminant function analyses on songs indicated that features describing the fine structure of syllables showed significant differences between isolation-reared and control birds. Analysis of syllable repertoires attributed differences to a higher proportion of multiple-element syllables in songs of isolation-reared males than in songs of control males. Isolation-reared birds were able to modify their syllable repertoire throughout their lives. However, the proportion of multiple-element syllables, instead of decreasing during the years spent in the aviary, continued to form a large part of the songs. The ability of isolation-reared canaries to change their repertoires failed to rectify, at least in large part, the syllable abnormalities caused by the lack of a song model during their first year of life. Therefore, new and previously acquired syllables might result from similar underlying processes that would set limits to the kinds of syllables produced in adulthood.

AB Selective predation may be an important proximate cause of the success or failure of invader species. Gammarus roeseli is an invasive amphipod, for which the causes of establishment in rivers where the native species, Gammarus pulex, predominates remain unstudied. Freshwater amphipods are important prey for numerous fish predators, but empirical evidence of lower predation rates on exotic prey is scarce. In laboratory experiments, we compared the susceptibility of G. pulex and G. roeseli to fish predation, determined the mechanisms influencing prey selection, and studied the interaction between behavioural and morphological defences. Fish predators (brown trout, Salmo trutta fario) preyed selectively on G. pulex, but not because of differences in attack or capture probability. The presence of spines in G. roeseli appeared to contribute to its underpredation. Differential prey selection in this case might therefore have resulted from the trout's reaction to an adverse stimulus. We found no significant difference in antipredator behaviour between G. pulex and G. roeseli. General behavioural differences were nevertheless found between species, with G. roeseli spending more time under shelters than G. pulex. However, microcosm experiments suggested that this difference was not important for differential predation. Antipredator behaviour may nevertheless be important for G. roeseli against other predators less sensitive to spines. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sexual selection theory predicts that signals reflecting the relative quality of individuals should be used in mate choice. Females could base their choice of copulation partners on male secondary sexual traits that honestly signal male age, as predicted by the age-based indicator mechanism. Studies have shown that female blue tits prefer older males and that aspects of dawn song reflect male quality, but it remains unknown whether dawn song characteristics correlate with male age. We compared dawn song characteristics of second-year (SY) and older (ASY) male blue tits (cross-sectional analysis), and tested for age-related changes within individuals (longitudinal analysis) and differential overwinter survival of SY males. We further investigated the relation between dawn song and paternity gain and loss. We found that ASY male blue tits began to sing earlier relative to sunrise than did SY males. This difference in the onset of dawn singing was due to age-related changes in individual performance rather than differential survival of individuals with varying expression of the trait. Males that began to sing earlier at dawn had more mating partners, and were more likely to gain extrapair paternity. Our findings suggest that the onset of dawn song can provide a simple mechanism for females to assess the relative quality of their mate and of neighbouring males. We propose that females use the onset of singing as a cue for their choice of extrapair partners. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mullerian mimicry, by definition, is the visual resemblance between two or more aposematic prey species. According to classical Mullerian mimicry theory, comimics draw mutual benefits from the resemblance because predators have to learn to avoid only one colour pattern. In contrast, the relatively untested quasi-Batesian mimicry theory suggests that, because of differences in unpalatablility, the less toxic mimic acts like a parasite on the more defended prey, decreasing its fitness. We tested predation pressures on artificial mimicry complexes in which comimics varied both in visual similarity and in taste. Both signal and taste were important for the survival of comimics. Predators learned to avoid two similarly conspicuous comimics differently when they were presented alone, suggesting that the signals were unequal. Despite the discrepancy in signal, imperfect visual mimicry did not increase the total number of comimics eaten, as suggested by the classical theory. Great tits, Parus major, learned to avoid highly unpalatable prey faster than mildly unpalatable prey. However, variation in palatability did not unequivocally increase the total mortality of models; instead, the effects depended on the signal of the prey. These results indicate that Mullerian mimicry dynamics may change depending on the configuration of mimicry complexes. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Despite the long history of research on cooperative breeding, few comparative studies have been undertaken to test hypotheses for the evolution and maintenance of delayed dispersal using data from both cooperative and noncooperative species. We tested predictions about demographic differences between cooperative and noncooperative species based on four hypotheses for the evolution of delayed dispersal: the ecological constraints hypothesis, the life history hypothesis, the broad constraints hypothesis and the benefits-of-philopatry hypothesis. We controlled for phylogeny and habitat by comparing sympatric populations of two Australasian treecreepers (Climacteridae): the cooperatively breeding brown treecreeper, Climacteris picumnus, and the pair-breeding white-throated treecreeper, Cormobates leucophaea, which has lost cooperative breeding despite phylogenetic conservation of the trait in most of the treecreeper lineage. Our data failed to support nearly every prediction of the constraints and life history hypotheses. The two species had similar levels of constraints and similar life histories, and any significant differences were in the opposite direction to those predicted. However, the cooperative species was characterized by significantly higher variance in reproductive success as a result of group size effects, supporting the benefits-of-philopatry hypothesis as an explanation for the maintenance of delayed dispersal. Our comparisons also suggest that the benefits parents derive from group living determine whether or not they tolerate offspring on the natal territory. We therefore propose an antipredator tactics hypothesis in which delayed dispersal will initially evolve or be lost in particular taxa depending on the relative costs and benefits of vigilance and active defence versus concealment-based antipredator tactics.

AB The monogamous beetle Parastizopus annaticeps (Tenebrionidae) constructs breeding burrows in the Kalahari Desert after rainfall, and shows extensive biparental care. However, occasional communal breeding has been reported, where the male shares the burrow with more than one female (ca. 5% of breeding burrows). We induced communal breeding in the laboratory by confining one male with two females in a small breeding cage. In 33% of these trios females stopped being aggressive towards each other and reared offspring communally. Larger females dominate smaller females, so we expected the incidence of communal breeding to be higher, and the reproductive skew to be lower, for equally sized females than for unequally sized females competing for the male. These predictions were not borne out: the incidence of communal breeding was similar in both situations and reproductive skew was independent of the (difference in) body measurements of the two females. The calculated binomial reproductive skew was in close agreement with the distribution expected from random sharing of maternity among the two females. Time spent in parental care per individual and (group) reproductive success of trios were not different from those of monogamous breeding pairs.

ID BIRD MIGRATION; BODY-COMPOSITION; TIME; FAT; LOADS; WHITETHROATS;

AB The fuelling behaviour of long-distance migratory birds is expected to have evolved to minimize a number of potential costs associated with migratory behaviour. Optimality models have generated unique and testable predictions for some of these costs, including time, energy and predation risk. By remotely weighing free-living reed warblers, Acrocephalus scirpaceus, attracted to supplementary food, I found that the relation between their fuel deposition rate and departure load approximated to the predictions of a time-minimizing model. While the results indicated that time minimization has been an important selective force, fuel deposition rates appeared constrained at times, indicating that high rates of foraging or energy turnover have been selected against. I suggest that the need to minimize foraging intensity-dependent predation risk may be the reason for fuelling rates not being maximized. The limited variation found in the fuelling durations of reed warblers is consistent with the hypothesis that fixed fuelling durations are the behavioural mechanism by which time minimization is achieved, although there was also some evidence to the contrary. These durations are expected to have been optimized with respect to the range of fuelling conditions typically encountered and the journey ahead.

AB Animals often cope with adverse events by releasing glucocorticoid hormones, which in turn promote increased energy assimilation. In captive animals, crowding also leads to increased glucocorticoid activity, probably because of increased levels of social competition. We investigated how group size and ectoparasite infestations affected endogenous levels of the glucocorticoid hormone, corticosterone, in colonial cliff swallows, Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, in southwestern Nebraska, U.S.A. Parasites were removed from some colonies by fumigating nests. Baseline levels of corticosterone in breeding adults varied significantly with whether parasites were present, colony size (measured by total number of active nests at a site) and nesting stage. Across all analyses, birds from fumigated colonies averaged significantly lower baseline levels of corticosterone. These levels in adults increased with colony size at nonfumigated sites, especially during the period when nestlings were being fed, but no relation or the opposite one was found for birds in fumigated colonies. Baseline corticosterone levels were unrelated to sex, age, body weight or testosterone levels in adults. Corticosterone concentrations tended to increase during a bad-weather event when food was scarce. Patterns in nestling and recently fledged juveniles were consistent with those in adults. The increased baseline levels of corticosterone in birds of larger colonies appear related to the larger number of parasites there. Higher levels of corticosterone probably facilitate increased allocation of time and energy to foraging and greater energy assimilation during challenging events such as bad weather, parasitism by blood-feeding bugs in large colonies and the period when young are becoming independent of their parents.

ID COMMUNAL HALICTINE BEE; PERDITA-TEXANA HYMENOPTERA; ANDRENIDAE;
   BENEFITS; BEHAVIOR
AB Communal sociality, involving cooperation among unrelated group members, occurs in all of the six families of bees. However, most communal species also occupy nests that persist over many generations. Why, then, do females not remain in their natal nests with their relatives? We examined how sex-biased dispersal contributes to maintaining low intragroup relatedness by documenting dispersal using microsatellite data in the communal halictine bee, Lasioglossum (Chilalictus) hemichalceum. The composition and genotypes of brood from nests excavated late in the reproductive season (late-season) were compared with those of adults from nests excavated from the same aggregation in early winter (post-season). Females left their natal nests if nests were large and if their brothers were present, demonstrating female-biased dispersal to avoid inbreeding in a social insect for the first time. Thus, the occurrence of within-nest mating in communal species, combined with strong selection against inbreeding in the Hymenoptera, appears to select for female-biased dispersal. This in turn results in a population-wide decrease in intracolony relatedness, thereby maintaining cooperation among nonkin in communal Hymenoptera.

AB Many male temperate zone passerines show a marked peak of singing activity before sunrise. The two main functions of this so-called dawn chorus are mate attraction and territory defence. We examined how seasonal patterns of different dawn song characteristics were related to mating status and to the breeding cycle of females in the common nightingale, Luscinia megarhynchos. We investigated two measures of song output: song rate and percentage performance time. We also calculated the proportion of 'whistle songs', a song category that is thought to be important in female choice. We predicted that if the main function of dawn singing in nightingales is to attract a social mate, then mated males should change their dawn singing behaviour after pair formation. In contrast, if dawn singing is mainly used in territory defence, we expected no difference in song traits between mated and unmated males throughout the season. We found that song rate and the proportion of whistle songs were low at the beginning of the season and did not predict future mating status. After arrival of females, all measures of dawn song performance remained largely constant throughout the breeding season, and we did not find significant differences in the seasonal variation between mated and unmated males. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that song at dawn is important to defend a territory throughout the breeding season. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Five-day-old chicks were trained in a delayed-response task requiring them to rejoin, after a delay of 10, 30, 60, 120 or 180 s, an object hidden behind one of two identical screens. In each of the 20 consecutive trials per chick, the object could be made to disappear randomly behind either screen. Two different goal objects were used: an artificial social companion or a palatable food item. In experiment 1, the screen behind which the goal had disappeared remained visible throughout the delay (the chick was confined behind a transparent partition). Under this condition, with both goal objects chicks proved capable of remembering and choosing the correct screen above chance level at all retention intervals; however, chicks were better at finding the social object than the food item. In experiment 2, chicks were confined behind an opaque partition that prevented them seeing either the correct or the incorrect screen during the delay. Chicks still scored well above chance level at all retention intervals even when they could not see the screens during the delay, although there was a slight decline in performance. Once again, the performance with the social attractor was better than with the food item, but overall above chance for both goal objects. These findings thus reveal that domestic chicks have striking abilities to maintain working memories of the location of biologically attractive objects that parallel or outperform those of most mammals, including primates.

ID TONIC COMMUNICATION; PREDATION; BEHAVIOR; MARMOT; EVOLUTION; SIGNALS;
   RISK
AB Repetitive alarm vocalizations of Richardson's ground squirrels vary in terms of the acoustic structure of their primary syllables and the inclusion of brief, lower-amplitude, frequency-modulated trailing elements we term 'chucks.' Chucks are included in calls of both males and females and increase in prevalence with the proximity of the caller to the alarm-evoking stimulus. Furthermore, chuck presence is not independent of primary syllable type: chucks follow primary syllables that have constant frequency and diminishing amplitude ('whistle'), but do not trail primary syllables with diminishing frequency and nondescending amplitude spectra ('chirps'). Playbacks to free-living squirrels of repeated alarm calls having whistle- or chirp-like primary syllables factorially combined with chuck presence or absence revealed that chirp-like syllables elicited greater vigilance from call recipients during signal propagation. The addition of chucks to the end of primary syllables of either type, however, increased initial vigilance duration and the proportion of time devoted to vigilance during and after signal reception. Chucks thus promote increased and lasting vigilance on the part of call recipients. Beyond enhancing vigilance, however, the inclusion of frequency-modulated chucks and chirps facilitates the orientation of receivers to the signaller. Multiple acoustic parameters of Richardson's ground squirrel alarm vocalizations thus interact to communicate information regarding several aspects of a predator encounter. Receivers use this information to their advantage, affording greater attention to calls that would be more readily located by predators, and hence are more costly for signallers to produce.

AB Chemical signals in aquatic systems are used to communicate social status and consequently alter aggressive behaviour. In addition, they may also function to influence the status roles of potential opponents or in part to predetermine the outcome of agonistic interactions between opponents. Here we examined whether exposure to social odours, in the absence of other sensory contact with a 'sender', alters subsequent agonistic behaviour in crayfish. Odour-receiver crayfish were exposed to one of four different odours from a 'sender' crayfish: odours from dominant (winner), subordinate (loser), or naive crayfish, or water from a tank that did not contain a crayfish (no social odour). 'Receiver' crayfish were exposed to one of the aforementioned odours on five consecutive days. After this extended exposure, the 'receiver' crayfish was allowed to interact with an effect-evaluator crayfish that had been isolated during the 5-day exposure period. 'Receiver' crayfish that were exposed to dominant (winner) odours behaved analogous to a subordinate role in that these animals lost the majority of their fights, but they also fought more intensely compared to the other treatments. Conversely, when crayfish were exposed to subordinate (loser) odours, their agonistic interactions were less intense and they subsequently won more encounters compared to the other treatments. These results may suggest that the receivers of the dominant odours had exhausted their chemical signal reserves by responding to the signal and therefore were obliged to increase their levels of visual/tactile responses. Because their chemical reserves were no longer sufficient to reinforce the visual displays corresponding to increased fight intensity, these animals tended to lose fights. In contrast, the receivers of the subordinate odours probably had sufficient chemical reserves to communicate chemically during agonistic encounters, and consequently, won more fights.

AB Prey can learn to recognize novel predators through the association of aversive stimuli (visual or chemical) paired with a predator cue (i.e. acquired predator recognition). Previous studies have demonstrated that a variety of prey can readily learn the identity of a single predator. In this study, we examined whether predator-naive glowlight tetras, Hemigrammus erythrozonus, could simultaneously acquire recognition of three novel heterospecific odours as predation threats, and whether this simultaneous learning confers a survival benefit. Tetras were conditioned to the odours of largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, convict cichlids, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, and comet goldfish, Carassius auratus, simultaneously, then subsequently tested 48 h later for learned recognition of each odour individually. Tetras were also tested for the recognition of yellow perch, Perca flavescens, a novel predator, to assess whether learned recognition is generalized. Tetras significantly increased antipredator behaviour when exposed to each of the conditioned predator odours and the nonpredator goldfish odour, but not to perch odour (i.e. not different from the distilled water control). These results demonstrate acquired recognition and not a generalization to novel predator odours. Subsequent staged encounters with live pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, predators showed that tetras conditioned to either sunfish odour alone or multiple odours increased survival over unconditioned tetras. These results are the first indication that prey possess the ability to learn the cues of multiple predators simultaneously, and that this multiple learning provides a survival benefit.

   EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; SELECTION; SURVIVAL
AB In cooperative societies, group members are expected to be punished for being lazy and so behaviours that exaggerate an individual's contribution to cooperation may be favoured by selection. In cooperative meerkats, Suricata suricatta, helpers vary in their level of care and, within breeding attempts, helpers can be categorized as 'generous' or 'lazy'. Lazy helpers were more likely to carry food to pups and then eat it themselves and lazy males received more aggression, supporting the idea that 'false feeding' could be an adaptive tactic used to exaggerate individual contributions to care. However, our results are also consistent with the more parsimonious idea that 'false feeding' occurs when individuals decide not to deliver food items after assessing the needs of pups relative to their own. Group members were not obviously deceived by 'false feeders' nor was 'false feeding' associated with any obvious benefit. In general, the frequency of 'false feeding' increased when the net benefits of feeding pups were likely to, be low. The frequency of 'false feeding' increased with rising food item value and with decreasing pup dependency on food provided by helpers. Female helpers (which feed pups more than male helpers and preferentially feed female pups) 'false fed' less than male helpers and 'false fed' male pups more than female pups. We suggest that there is little unequivocal evidence of deception by helpers over contributions to care in cooperative vertebrates and that 'false feeding' may occur where helpers adjust their decisions immediately before feeding young or where they are subject to conflicting motivations.

AB We recorded preferential use of the left and right monocular visual field in black-winged stilts, Himantopus himantopus, during predatory pecking and during courtship and mating behaviour in a naturalistic setting. The stilts had a population-level preference for using their right monocular visual field before predatory pecking; pecks that followed right-hemifield detection were more likely to be successful than pecks that followed left-hemifield detection, as evinced by the occurrence of swallowing and shaking head movements after pecking. In contrast, shaking behaviour, a component of courtship displays, and copulatory attempts by males were more likely to occur when females were seen with the left monocular visual field. Asymmetric hemifield use observed in natural conditions raises interesting issues as to the costs and benefits of population-level behavioural lateralization in wild animals.

AB We examined nest defence behaviour in relation to predator distance and type, and nest height in three closely related Acrocephalus warblers: moustached warbler, A. melanopogon, reed warbler, A. scirpaceus and great reed warbler, A. arundinaceus. We tested predictions of the dynamic risk assessment hypothesis for nest defence using experimental placement of three predator types (snake, stoat, harrier) 1 and 5 m from the nest. All species responded strongly to changes in predator distance, with less defence towards predators further from the nest. We found no interaction between predator type and distance. Nest defence was stronger at low nests to ground predators and at high nests to the aerial predator. There were combined interaction effects for predator type x nest height in relation to predator distance; for example, nest height was negatively related to nest defence to snakes, but only for snakes close to the nest. These results point to dynamic risk assessment and nest defence behaviour in Acrocephalus warblers.

AB Reports of postpartum parental care in squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) are rare and generally anecdotal. We investigated parental care in black rock skinks, Egernia saxatilis, from southeastern Australia. These lizards live in small family groups, with adults defending territories against conspecifics. juvenile lizards live within their parents' territory and may thus be protected from infanticide. In staged encounters in the laboratory, adults frequently attacked unrelated juveniles but not their own offspring, and the parent's presence significantly reduced the incidence of this infanticidal aggression. This protection arose not through specific 'parental' behaviours, but because adults tended to ignore juveniles when another (potentially threatening) adult was present. When two family groups were placed in the same enclosure, one family rapidly became dominant over the other. juveniles of the dominant family derived thermoregulatory and foraging benefits from their parents' status. Thus, some lizards do show postpartum parental care, and may thereby significantly benefit their progeny via reduced risk of infanticide and better access to thermal and nutritional resources.

AB Territorial aggression is a primary mode of population regulation among ants, and frequently leads to the formation of linear dominance hierarchies. However, few experimental studies have investigated the proximate mechanisms that underlie these hierarchies. In this study I examine the mechanisms underlying dominance relationships in interference competition for nest sites in a guild of acacia ants residing on Acacia drepanolobium. I show that (1) interspecific conflicts are fought as simple wars of attrition, with mortality ratios among combatant species approximating 1:1, (2) interspecific competitive outcomes, both within and between habitats, closely parallel differences in estimated average colony size among the four acacia ant species, and (3) experimental manipulation of colony size effectively reverses the dominance hierarchy. This is the first study to demonstrate experimentally that size asymmetries underlie dominance relationships in an entire guild of competitors. These results also highlight the contingent nature of ecological dominance in this community. Because dominance is dictated by characteristics of a trait shared by all ant species (colony size), interspecific competitive outcomes may vary if species differ in growth and/or mortality responses to factors such as disturbance or environmental conditions. Contingencies in competitive outcomes among these acacia ants may play an important role in promoting coexistence in this intensely nest-site-limited community.

AB Some gastropods can respond to waterborne chemicals released from predators and injured conspecifics with avoidance behaviour. We examined the avoidance response of the intertidal snail Littorina scutulata sensu lato to chemical cues from the predatory crab Hemigrapsus nudus, both from the Pacific coast of Canada, using two-choice laboratory experiments. Littorina scutulata s. l. from a site with H. nudus (Ross Islets) avoided water containing chemical cues from the predator, but snails from a site without H. nudus (Prasiola Point) did not. The avoidance behaviour of L. scutulata s. l. from the 'crab site' strengthened with increasing perceived predation threat. We found a risk hierarchy, with risk increasing from control sea water (no risk), to predator cues (low risk), to injured-conspecific cues (intermediate risk), to a combination of predator and injured-conspecific cues (high risk). This risk gradient seems logical, because the sole presence of predators does not necessarily represent an immediate predation threat, whereas predator and injured-conspecific cues together may indicate that predation is actually occurring nearby. These results are important for understanding the effects of chemically mediated predator-prey interactions on intertidal distribution patterns of littorinids.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES; MATE; NIGRICAPILLUS; PLAYBACK; BEHAVIOR;

AB A diverse array of bird species show a behaviour known as duet singing, in which mated pairs sing temporally coordinated songs. Several studies have shown that simulating territory intrusion with conspecific song playback evokes duet song from duetting bird species, but the adaptive significance of coordinated song during territorial defence remains unclear. The function of duetting is further obscured by our poor understanding of the roles of the sexes in territory defence among year-round territorial species. We developed a simple optimality model that predicts the conditions under which intersexual territorial defence is most likely to occur. We used male solo song and female solo song playback as well as a novel method called 'stereo duet playback' to test the predictions of the model and to explore the function of song initiation and song answering during territorial encounters. We conducted these experiments in the field on the black-bellied wren, a year-round territorial passerine. Birds of both sexes responded to all treatment types. Males initiated more songs during opposite-sex playback than during same-sex playback and both sexes were more likely to answer their mates' songs when mates were physically closer. We argue that the acoustic mate-guarding hypothesis does not adequately account for these results, and suggest that duetting during territorial encounters allows mates to identify one another, thus preventing intrapair aggression. As predicted by our model, females showed a strong same-sex bias in territory defence, whereas males approached playback of both sexes. Also in support of the model, males with dependent juveniles showed stronger intersexual territoriality than males not involved in a breeding effort.

AB In this study we sought to determine whether dog barks could be divided into subtypes based on context. We recorded barking from 10 adult dogs, Canis familiaris, of six breeds in three different test situations: (1) a disturbance situation in which a stranger rang the doorbell, (2) an isolation situation in which the dog was locked outside or in a room isolated from its owner and (3) a play situation in which either two dogs or a human and a dog played together. We analysed spectrograms of 4672 barks using macros that took 60 sequential frequency measurements and 60 sequential amplitude measurements along the length of the call. Statistical analyses revealed that barks are graded vocalizations that range from harsh, low-frequency, unmodulated calls to harmonically rich, higher-frequency, modulated calls. The harsh, low-frequency, unmodulated barks were more commonly given in the disturbance situation, and the more tonal, higher-pitch, modulated barks were more commonly given in the isolation and play situations. Disturbance barks were also longer in duration with more rapid repetition than the barks given in other contexts. Discriminant analysis revealed that dog barks can be divided into different subtypes based on context even within individual dogs, and that dogs can be identified by their bark spectrograms despite the context of the bark.

AB Many vertebrate species exhibit sensory and motor asymmetries. Laterality studies of tool use have focused on primates, where hemispheric asymmetries, manifested behaviourally in hand preferences, are thought to be associated with complex motor tasks. Here we report strong individual lateralization for tool use in birds. New Caledonian crows, Corvus moneduloides, hold stick tools with their bills while foraging, often with the nonworking end laterally positioned on one side of the head and the working end possibly positioned in the binocular field. We observed four wild crows to determine whether tools were consistently held on one side. All crows showed a significant preference (two right, two left). This preference was independent of any asymmetry in tool manufacture and held for artificial holes similarly accessible for tools held on either side. This is the first demonstration of lateralized tool use in a nonprimate. In addition, all 173 tools used unilaterally were held only on a crow's preferred side. Such pronounced individual laterality for tool use in natural conditions has previously been reported only in humans and chimpanzees. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Black-headed gulls, Larus ridibundus, produce clutches of three eggs, which contain high levels of maternal androgens in the yolk. These levels increase with laying order and the eggs hatch asynchronously. Experiments have supported the hypothesis that this within-clutch variation in maternal androgens mitigates the disadvantage of last-hatched chicks in sibling competition, by enhancing embryonic development and early posthatching growth. We hypothesized that these effects come about by the stimulating effects of maternal androgens on begging behaviour and competitive ability. In the field, we injected first-laid eggs of a clutch (which have a low androgen level) with either an androgen solution (T eggs) or vehicle (Oil eggs). We then created pairs of chicks hatched from Oil and T eggs, matched for egg mass and hatching date. Parent-chick interactions were recorded from observation hides. Chicks from T eggs hatched almost half a day sooner than those from Oil eggs. Furthermore, chicks from T eggs were more active during the first week after hatching, were more often the first to react to the approaching parent, begged more frequently, and obtained the larger share of food. We conclude that the enhancing effect of yolk androgens on growth in this species arises at least partly through androgen-mediated effects on the chicks' behaviour.

AB Of the numerous hypotheses advanced to explain the adaptive significance of play, several assert that social play increases social harmony, cementing alliances and reducing aggression between group members or littermates. These hypotheses are frequently cited, but their validity remains unknown. We examined the relation between social play and aggression in juvenile meerkats, Suricata suricatta, living in a wild population in the southern Kalahari Desert. We tested the hypothesis that social play reduces aggression, by examining rates of play, play partner choices, the structure of social play and rates of aggressive interactions during foraging. We found no relation between frequency of play and level of aggression, either between individuals or during the course of development. Pups that played together frequently were just as aggressive towards one another as pairs of pups that played infrequently, and play interactions had no subsequent effect on the likelihood of aggression. In contrast, aggressive interactions during foraging inhibited the subsequent likelihood of play, and high levels of aggression during foraging changed the structure of social play, with victimized pups avoiding play wrestling. We conclude that social play does not reduce aggression in young meerkats. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All tights reserved.

AB We performed two experiments in which we allowed a male fighting fish, Betta splendens, designated a bystander, to observe aggressive contests between pairs of male conspecifics. Another male (naive male) observed an empty tank or two nonaggressive males, depending on the experiment. Immediately after these observation periods, we allowed the bystander and naive male to interact in a neutral area. In both experiments, bystander males were dominant over naive males in a significant number of the encounters. Bystander males performed significantly more aggressive behaviours (displays, chases and bites) than did naive males. Differences in dominance were not due to chance differences in body size. These findings demonstrate that exposure to aggression between conspecifics increases aggressive motivation in bystander male fighting fish. We discuss briefly the implications of such social experience on the formation of dominance hierarchies.

AB Do predator-prey 'waiting games' where prey hide from potential predators have inherently unstable evolutionary outcomes, making it impossible to generate quantitative predictions about hiding times? Fiddler crabs, Uca lactea perplexa, respond to potential predators by retreating into their burrows. Time inside the burrow during unprovoked retreats during normal activity provides a 'null model' to test whether sex, tidal cycle and body size affect hiding time from potential predators. Using experimentally created predator-like stimuli we found that males hid for significantly longer than females, and larger crabs of both sexes also hid for longer. This differs from burrow use during unprovoked retreats, suggesting hiding time varies depending on the potential risk of predation on re-emergence. If risk prior to hiding predicts risk on emergence, the closer the proximity of a predator-like stimulus when first encountered the longer crabs should hide. We confirmed this experimentally (stimuli at 0.5 versus 2.5 m). Finally, we tested whether males hide for longer when a predator-like stimulus approaches them directly rather than tangentially. None of three pairwise comparisons was statistically significant, but crabs hid less as the angle of approach became more tangential. These results suggest prey can use stimuli prior to hiding to predict predation risk on re-emergence, but studies on predators are required to test this claim. Finally, theoretical models must explain why hiding time has a lognormal distribution and low variance such that a predator can predict when most prey will re-emerge. For example, 95% of crabs re-emerged within 2.3 min of hiding. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Males of many species compete for access to females. In order to avoid performing potentially costly agonistic behaviour for their entire adult lives, many group-living males use environmental cues to limit agonistic behaviour to times when it will be of most benefit. Long-finned squid, Loligo pealeii, live less than a year and aggregate in mixed- and single-sex schools. Adults participate in several spawning events, then die. During spawning events, males actively compete for females. Winning males pair with females, which subsequently lay eggs in communal sites on the ocean floor ('egg mops'). To determine whether males use sensory cues provided by egg mops to regulate agonistic behaviour, we conducted four laboratory experiments. We measured the agonistic responses of pairs of adult males before, during and after exposure to conspecific egg mops. In three experiments, egg mops were manipulated to provide differing sensory stimuli (tactile, water-borne, visual). The addition of conspecific egg mops to tanks of paired male squid dramatically increased agonistic behaviour above control levels within minutes. Male squid were first attracted to the egg mops visually, but contact with the capsules was necessary to increase agonistic behaviour. After initial contact, agonistic behaviour was almost continuous as long as egg mops remained present, even when squid touched the egg mops infrequently. Visual stimuli seemed important in maintaining elevated agonistic behaviour between egg mop touches. When egg mops were removed from the tank, measured agonistic behaviour declined within minutes. When egg mops were added to the tank while covered by an opaque and porous cover that allowed water-borne stimuli to circulate into the tank, squid did not approach the covered egg mop or show increased agonistic behaviour. This result suggests that water-borne stimuli are not sufficient to increase agonistic behaviour. It is unusual for male agonistic behaviour in any species to be increased by contact with fertilized eggs. In this species, however, egg capsules might signal that sexually mature, receptive females are about to lay eggs. Indirect evidence suggests that mating with a female immediately before she lays eggs increases male paternity. If this prediction is true, the presence of egg mops may indicate the optimal time for male squid to establish mating precedence through agonistic bouts.

ID BIRD MIGRATION; PREDICTIONS; FLIGHT; SPEEDS; MODEL; COMPENSATION;
   DIRECTION; SOUTH
AB We investigated the variation in concentration of orientation among nocturnally migrating passerine birds. Using tracking radar, we recorded flight tracks of birds during spring and autumn migration and, with the aid of concurrent wind recordings, we calculated heading directions. The concentrations of track and heading directions were compared between seasons and also between different categories of migrants that were defined by flight speed and wing beat frequency. Wind drift was a dominant cause of the large scatter of track directions, especially for autumn migration. When wind effects were compensated for, we found only small differences in the concentration of heading directions between different categories of migrants. This shows that between-group variation is not a major source of the overall variation in orientation when groups are distinguished on the basis of airspeed and wing beat frequency. Although the total concentration of heading directions was almost exactly the same for spring and autumn migrants, there was an element of partial compensation for wind drift in spring but not in autumn. When we removed the effect of this compensatory behaviour by considering situations with low wind speeds, the concentration of headings during spring tended to exceed that during the autumn. This suggests a more accurate orientation of the birds during spring than in autumn, when a large proportion consists of naive migrants on their first migratory journeys. The high concentration of heading directions of free-flying migrants are in clear contrast to the widely scattered distributions generally observed in orientation experiments with caged birds.

AB We investigated the interaction between individual experience and social learning in domestic dogs, Canis familiaris. We conducted two experiments using detour tests, where an object or food was placed behind a transparent, V-shaped wire-mesh fence, such that the dogs could get the reward by going around the fence. In some groups, two open doors were offered as an alternative, easier way to reach the reward. In experiment I we opened the doors only in trial 1, then closed them for trials 2 and 3. In experiment 2 other dogs were first taught to detour the fence with closed doors after they had observed a detouring human demonstrator, then we opened the doors for three subsequent trials. In experiment I all dogs reached the reward by going through the doors in trial 1, but their detouring performance was poor after the doors had been closed, if they had to solve the task on their own. However, dogs in the experimental group that were allowed to watch a detouring human demonstrator after the doors had been closed showed improved detouring ability compared with those that did not receive a demonstration of detouring. In experiment 2 the dogs tended to keep on detouring along the fence even if the doors had been opened, giving up a chance to get behind the fence by a shorter route. These results show that dogs can use information gained by observing a human demonstrator to overcome their own mistakenly preferred solution in a problem situation. In a reversed situation social learning can also contribute to a preference for a less adaptive behaviour. However, only repeated individual and social experience leads to a durable manifestation of maladaptive behaviour.

AB Fine-tuned discrimination abilities are a prerequisite for optimal diet theory (ODT) and the concept of nutrient regulation as alternative models of food choice. These abilities have rarely been determined, and neither has been applied to frugivorous consumers. We investigated nutrient choices of four tanagers (Tachyphonus cristatus, Dacnis cayana, Chlorophanes spiza and Cyanerpes nitidus) for different lipid or carbohydrate concentrations, and determined discrimination abilities by reducing in steps the difference between two foods ranging from 2.5 to 12%. Three species detected differences in sugar concentrations of only 1% and differences in lipid content of 2%. Hence, frugivorous tanagers were able to select the more rewarding food based on fine-scale differences in nutritional content. Tanagers also consumed more carbohydrates than proteins or lipids in isocaloric trials, but were indifferent to equicaloric solutions of 20% of either glucose or sucrose. In contrast to foods with low sugar contents, intake of foods high in lipids or carbohydrates was limited to a protein intake of 0.75 g/7 h. Lipid and carbohydrates were treated as though they were interchangeable nutrients for birds at low, but not at high, sugar concentrations. Furthermore, the tanagers discriminated foods containing the same amount of protein but differing in the type of protein. Preference for boviserine serum albumin (BSA) over casein was not related to moult. We supplemented the food consisting of casein with the essential amino acid cysteine to match cysteine concentrations of BSA. The birds then consumed more of the casein food than of the cysteine-supplemented casein food. Overall, the birds' consistent choices in the experiments with foods of different energy density are interpretable by both ODT and the nutrient regulation theory. However, only the latter accounts for the birds' choices of isocaloric foods differing in macro- or micronutritional content. Models of food selection should therefore focus on nutrient geometry and consumer-specific requirements.

ID MALLARD MATING PREFERENCES; SEXUAL SELECTION; ORNATE PLUMAGE; BEHAVIOR;
   CRITERIA; TRAITS; EVOLUTION; COLOR
AB Two processes that may be important in the evolution of multiple ornaments are (1) preference flexibility based on the distribution of local traits and (2) preferences for composite (versus partitioned) traits. To examine the occurrence of these processes we conducted three experiments measuring the mate preferences of California quail. We included analyses of composite traits as well as the partitioned traits (isolated patches of coloration) typically invoked in ornithological descriptions. In two experiments, in which the same pool of wild-caught females was presented pairs of males with natural versus experimentally exaggerated traits, the focus of mate choice shifted to the trait specifically exaggerated in that experiment. In a third experiment, in which females were presented males displaying natural plumage variation, females chose primarily based on a composite trait (as revealed using stepwise analysis). Composite traits were also found to be stronger predictors of female behaviour in one of the manipulation experiments. These results indicate that female California quail have active, flexible mate preferences for a variety of novel and extant traits and illustrate the importance of incorporating composite traits into the analysis of mate preferences.

AB This study on the nightingale, Luscinia megarhynchos, is the first to examine both nocturnal and diurnal singing activity of mated and unmated males throughout a species' entire breeding cycle. Nocturnal song was sung mostly by unmated males. After pair formation, males ceased nocturnal singing and resumed it if their mate deserted. These results strongly suggest that nocturnal song of unmated males functions to attract a mate. Diurnal singing activity before females settled was low and did not predict future mating status. However, unmated males showed a continuous increase in diurnal singing activity until the end of the breeding cycle, but diurnal singing activity of mated males decreased after the egg-laying period. Mated males resumed nocturnal song for, on average, 3 nights during egg laying by their mates. This second period of nocturnal song coincided with the peak of diurnal singing activity. Such a high male singing effort during egg laying might allow the female to adjust her reproductive effort to male quality, deter rival males (e.g. through honest announcement of the female's fertility) or attract females for extrapair copulations.

Seven females laid eggs in the nests of reed warblers, Acrocephalus scirpaceus, sedge warblers, A. schoenobaenus, and marsh warblers, A. palustris. We observed 53 nest visits, of which 26 involved egg laying. Cuckoos spent significantly more time within 50 m of the host nest on the laying day than on the 5 prelaying days. The vantage point used when parasitizing or visiting a nest was on average four times further from the nest than the closest possible vantage point, but there was a positive correlation between these two distances. Cuckoos spent on average 20 min observing host nests from their vantage points before they visited a nest. Comparison of cuckoos' visits to host nests with and without egg laying revealed no significant differences in the duration of visits or in other measures of behaviour. There was significant variation in behaviour between cuckoos, particularly in the time of day when eggs were laid in host nests. This variation can be attributed to the strong, but not absolute, host and habitat specificity of individuals. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A new colony of the slave-making ant Polyergus breviceps is initiated when a newly mated gyne invades a host nest and kills the resident queen. This process seems to result in chemical camouflage of the invading gyne and allows her to usurp the position of colony reproductive. Young, recently mated Formica gynes, however, are not attacked. To determine whether worker and/or immature presence is the basis for aggression, we placed eggs, larvae, pupae and workers from mature F. gnava queens with newly, mated F. gnava queens and observed the responses of introduced P. breviceps queens. Because no newly mated gyne was attacked, we tested newly mated F. gnava queens (1) once they had produced eggs, (2) when the offspring reached the larval, pupal and callow stages of development, and (3) every 2 weeks until aggression ensued. Eventually all F. gnava queens were attacked but only 29 weeks after having mated. Thus, although offspring are the ultimate benefit from attacking an established F. gnava queen, P. breviceps queens detect mature queens using another time-dependent feature that is reliably indicative of reproductive status. The similarity of host queen hydrocarbon profiles, often correlated with reproductive status in other ant species, suggests that other compounds reflect queen fecundity and produce a kairomonal effect, or that another cue signals host queen and colony suitability. Our findings indicate P. breviceps gynes have evolved to respond aggressively to a host gyne cue that appears long after mating, preventing attacks on gynes without the workers necessary for colony founding.

AB Newly mated queens from the polygyne (multiple-queen) form of S. invicta show a weight polymorphism that correlates with their genotype at the protein locus Gp-9. Although this variation in weight might be expected to translate into variation in the ability of queens to initiate new colonies using stored energy reserves, a systematic examination of the colony-founding ability of newly mated polygyne-derived queens of different weights has never been reported. Here I compare the ability of monogyne-derived queens (Gp-9(BB) M), heavy polygyne-derived queens (Gp-98(BB) P), and light polygyne-derived queens (Gp-9(Bb) P) to initiate their own colonies using only stored energy reserves. Most measurements of the ants' abilities yielded the following scale of competency: Gp-9(BB) M>Gp-9(BB) P>Gp-9(Bb) P. Surprisingly, most mated polygyne-derived queens of even the lighter genotype were capable of rearing considerable numbers of workers in isolation. This ability may be enhanced substantially in the field if such queens cooperate in initiating new nests (pleometrosis). These results are concordant with the growing body of work that implicates a simply inherited genetic polymorphism for the control of a complex social trait in this ant, and they indicate that the modes of reproduction in polygyne fire ants may show considerable diversity.

ID BRAIN LATERALIZATION; CUTTLEFISH; ORIGINS; ANIMALS; SQUID
AB The lateralization of sensory and motor functions has been recently demonstrated in various groups of vertebrates. We examined lateral asymmetry of eye use in Octopus vulgaris by behavioural methods. Octopus vulgaris uses monocular vision almost exclusively and can move its eyes independently. The amount of binocular vision is small because the eyes are on the sides of the head. We tested eight octopuses in two conditions (one with and one without moving stimuli) where the use of the eye for frontal vision could be determined unequivocally. Data were recorded on videotape. All animals showed a preference for one eye (five left, three right). There was no correlation between eye use and the animal's direction of movement. Pigmentation of the ventral side of the arms tended to be most intense on the side of the preferred eye and the body was most pigmented on the side of the eye currently in use. We found no sex differences for visual lateralization. Pigmentation of the ventral side of the arms was lighter in females than in males. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Female mating status may affect reproductive success in avian polygynous mating systems through a combination of differences in female parental quality and status-dependent male assistance in parental care. Traditionally the literature has emphasized male assistance, neglecting evidence for consistency in female parental quality independent of mating status or repeatability in status. We studied the effects of male assistance on breeding success and its association with female mating status in a population of the polygynous spotless starling, Sturnus unicolor, during 3 years. Nestling provisioning by males improved the fledging success of late (mostly second) but not early (mostly first) broods. Reproductive success of females was affected mainly by female maternal quality: (1) primary and secondary females did not differ in output for early broods and in seasonal output despite a greater male assistance at primary nests; (2) monogamous females were more successful despite receiving no more help than other females; and (3) primary and secondary females had different clutch sizes before male assistance in parental care could operate. Female mating status was not significantly repeatable within seasons or between years. Females who changed status between years were as successful when rearing broods as secondary females as they were as primary or monogamous females. Breeding success (proportion of eggs resulting in fledglings) and clutch size were significantly repeatable between years for late but not for early clutches. Performance showed no strong association with female age or condition. Female breeding success seems to be weakly affected by male assistance in this sedentary, colonial species, and more dependent on inherent differences between females.

AB A number of studies have focused on the spread of foraging innovations within animal populations, but only rarely have individual dispositions of becoming innovative been considered. With two groups of individually marked, hand-reared greylag goslings we investigated hormonal and behavioural correlates related to the individual's ability to perform operant tasks. During individual tests 6 weeks after hatching, goslings were given small food containers covered by lids. In the following winter the sibling groups were tested in a social set-up at a food dispenser, which the geese could activate by pulling a flap. We analysed individual faecal samples collected at 2, 6 and 12 weeks of age, and also after the individual tests, for excreted corticosterone and testosterone metabolites by enzyme immunoassay. During the individual test, 18 of 23 individuals learned to remove the lids. These 18 birds excreted higher faecal corticosterone concentrations than their respective controls 2 weeks after hatching. At the food dispensers, only four males became food producers; all the others scrounged. These four were in the group of 18 that were successful in the individual test and again tended, although not significantly, to have higher faecal corticosterone 2 weeks after hatching than the scroungers. In one of the groups, excreted corticosterone increased and excreted testosterone decreased after the individual test. Goslings successfully removing lids at 6 weeks raised their faecal corticosterone to a significantly greater extent than the unsuccessful individuals. Our results suggest that becoming an innovator may be contingent upon individual coping styles. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

   SIGNIFICANCE
AB We presented territorial male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, two stationary dummies simultaneously, each simulating an equally gravid female. Both dummies featured the head-up orientation indicative of a sexually receptive female but differed in more subtle aspects of posture. In one dummy the back and tail were moulded in a relaxed straight posture and the other was moulded with the raised tail and concave back posture (lordosis), which mating tests revealed to be a strong predictor of spawning readiness in females. Males courted both dummies but directed more to the lordosis posture. Male sticklebacks thus recognize and respond appropriately to relatively subtle features of female posture in addition to other cues such as the head-up angle and dorsal barring reported in earlier studies. Physiological or morphological constraints may make the lordosis posture a reliable, and hence relatively honest, indicator of spawning readiness in females. Males may therefore enhance their fitness by preferentially courting females that assume this posture. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID HEMIPTERA; BEHAVIOR
AB The nymphs of the West African assassin bugs Paredocla and Acanthaspis spp. disguise themselves with a cover of dust, sand and soil particles ('dust coat') and additionally pile a 'backpack' of larger objects, such as empty prey corpses and plant parts, on their abdomen. We investigated the effect of this conspicuous camouflage in interactions of the bugs with ants, their main prey, as well as in encounters with their own predators. Experiments with three ant species showed that the dust coat impedes chemical and tactile recognition of the nymphs by ant workers and thus may serve to increase their hunting success. The backpack appeared to play only a minor role in this context. In arena experiments with three potential predators (spiders, geckos and centipedes), camouflaged nymphs were significantly more likely to survive than denuded bugs. Here the observed effect was mainly attributable to the backpack, which enhanced the concealing effect of the dust coat and confused visually orienting predators. In addition, in the case of an attack, it could be shed to distract the enemy while the bug escaped, thus functioning in a similar manner as a lizard's tail.

AB Japanese macaques reside in large, mixed-sex social groups in which various reproductive strategies of both sexes operate simultaneously. This report represents the first study combining behavioural and genetic data to examine the interaction of male and female reproductive strategies in primates (N=15 adult males, N=15 adult females, Yakushima Island, Japan). During one mating season, socially dominant males monopolized most female matings. Furthermore, the six offspring sired by troop males were more likely sired by higher-ranking males than lower-ranking males. Nontroop males sired three additional offspring in the troop. Lower-ranking troop males avoided direct competition with higher-ranking males by engaging in sneak copulations with females outside of the presence of other males. Also, females expressed mate choice behaviour towards multiple males of various dominance ranks. Thus, the female strategy of attempting to mate with multiple males conflicted with the mate-guarding strategy of high-ranking males. Despite some female mate choice for mid- and low-ranking males and alternative male mating tactics by subordinate males, high-ranking males were able to monopolize most, but not all, within-troop mating and paternity. This result was due in part to the low number of females mating at the same time. The mean number of females displaying mating behaviour per day was 2.42 (range 1-5), and higher-ranking males more successfully monopolized females on days when fewer females were mating. The number of females mating simultaneously influences the outcome of reproductive conflicts between the sexes. (C) 2001 The Association for the study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In birds, the time immediately after oviposition has been assumed to be particularly favourable for an insemination to fertilize eggs. Based on this assumption, Thornhill (1988, Verhandlungen der Deutschen Zoologischten Gesellschaft, 81, 145-154) suggested that a particular vocalization, the postoviposition cackle, of female fowl, Gallus gallus, signalled a peak in fertility, which incited male sexual behaviour and resulted in females copulating with the most dominant males. It may therefore benefit females by indirectly selecting for competitive copulation partners. We tested this hypothesis in a free-ranging population of feral fowl. Contrary to the hypothesis, we found that: (1) postoviposition cackling was associated with a significantly lower probability of a female obtaining a copulation; and (2) males did not respond any differently to the experimental playback of the postoviposition cackling and a control call. These results are consistent with the period immediately after oviposition being an unfavourable time for an insemination to fertilize eggs. One function of postoviposition cackling may thus be to avoid the costs of sexual harassment by signalling to males a particularly unsuitable time for fertilization.

ID STATISTICAL POWER ANALYSIS; P-VALUES; PERMUTATION; VARIANCE; SAMPLES
AB Behavioural studies are commonly plagued with data that violate the assumptions of parametric statistics. Consequently, classic nonparametric methods (e.g. rank tests) and novel distribution-free methods (e.g. randomization tests) have been used to a great extent by behaviourists. However, the robustness of such methods in terms of statistical power and type I error have seldom been evaluated. This probably reflects the fact that empirical methods, such as Monte Carlo approaches, are required to assess these concerns. In this study we show that analytical methods cannot always be used to evaluate the robustness of statistical tests, but rather Monte Carlo approaches must be employed. We detail empirical protocols for estimating power and type I error rates for parametric, nonparametric and randomization methods, and demonstrate their application for an analysis of variance and a regression/correlation analysis design. Together, this study provides a framework from which behaviourists can compare the reliability of different methods for data analysis, serving as a basis for selecting the most appropriate statistical test given the characteristics of data at hand.

ID SIZE SELECTION; BODY-SIZE; RECRUITMENT; HYMENOPTERA; COLOMBICA; SYSTEM
AB Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain how colony-level foraging performance of leaf-cutting ants can be maximized when workers harvest leaf fragments of a size that does not maximize their individual performance. Each mechanism predicts that ants will adjust the size of leaf fragments between starting a foraging bout and establishing full traffic between the nest and foraging site, but the two models predict shifts in opposite directions. I examined fragment sizes at the start of daily foraging in five field colonies of Atta cephalotes in Costa Rica and detected an obvious shift in only one case. More shifts were detected when the small and large ends of the worker body size range were considered separately, but the direction was inconsistent among colonies. I also examined the role of returning laden workers in recruitment of nestmates by intercepting all laden workers for the first 2 h of foraging, and measuring the effect on the arrival of recruits at the foraging site. In two cases, the flow of recruits was not diminished by the interception of returning workers. The results suggest that neither mechanism correctly and consistently accounts for load size selection by leaf-cutting ants. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In two experiments, we compared milk intake (assessed by weighing calves before and after suckling) and milk production (by hand milking hinds) in Iberian red deer both when calves sucked their mothers together (group-suckling experiment) and when mother and offspring were isolated (isolation-suckling experiment). In both experiments, the general lactation curve for calves increased to a peak and then decreased (type I, standard lactation curve in mammals), whereas the curve for hinds decreased from the start (type II). However, in the experiment on group suckling, calves ingested 17.2% more milk than that produced by their mothers from weeks 6 to 20. In both isolation- and group-suckling experiments, hinds showed an overproduction of milk decreasing from weeks 1 to 5. This decreasing overproduction coincides with a similar trend in calf mortality reported in the literature and might thus be aimed at ensuring calves have sufficient nutrients when mortality is highest. In addition, allosuckling observations in the group-suckling experiment showed an inverse relationship between milk production and percentage of allosucking attempts. Allosucking attempts were also more frequent after the milk overproduction period. Both findings suggest that allosuckling is a response to compensate for a reduced maternal milk supply.

AB The Trivers-Willard hypothesis (TWH) predicts that a mother will treat a son or daughter differently depending on her ability to invest and the impact of her investment on offspring reproductive success. Although many studies have investigated the hypothesis, few have definitively supported or refuted it because of confounding factors or an inappropriate level of analysis. We studied maternal investment in sons and daughters in feral horses, Equus caballus, which meet the assumptions of the TWH with a minimum of confounding variables. Population level analyses revealed no differences in maternal behaviour towards sons and daughters. When we incorporated mare condition, we found that sons were more costly to mares in good condition, whereas daughters were more costly to mares in poor condition, although no differences in maternal behaviour were found. However, since the TWH makes predictions about individual mothers, we examined investment by mares who reared both a son and a daughter in different years of the study. Mares in good condition invested more in their sons in terms of maternal care patterns, costs to maternal body condition and costs to future reproduction. Conversely, mares in poor condition invested more in daughters. Therefore, with an appropriate level of analysis in a species in which confounding variables are minimal, the predictions of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis are supported.

AB Initial responses of naive individuals to critical environmental stimuli provide important information about the innate contribution to behaviour, and subsequent responses to the same stimuli may show the role of experience in mediating those initial responses. To test the role of these factors, I measured initial patch choices and giving-up responses of just-emerged, naive, second-instar crab spiders, Misumena vatia, on several hunting sites they encountered after leaving their natal nests. In follow-up tests I measured the effects of these experiences on subsequent patch choice decisions. The choice of hunting sites is a vital decision at all stages of the life cycle for sit-and-wait predators such as Misumena. In their initial tests these spiderlings remained more frequently on goldenrod (Solidago spp.) flowers than on green or yellow goldenrod buds, a preference they retained through tests run on 5 consecutive days. Individuals on green and yellow buds shifted sites more quickly and frequently than those from flowers, and made most of these moves to flowers, which attracted many more prey than did buds. These differences were not affected by age, energetic condition, or loss of information over the period of the experiment. Once spiderlings moved from buds, they showed a high, increasing tendency to move from buds in subsequent runs, those from flowers showed a consistently law tendency. These results suggest that spiderlings retain their innate behavioural patterns through the second instar, put that experience also plays a modest role in patch choice at this stage.

AB The rate at which parents deliver energy to their brood is an important factor in avian reproduction because poor condition caused by malnutrition may reduce the offspring's survival to breeding. Models of central place foraging predict that nesting parents should optimize their prey delivery rate by minimizing travelling distances and by selecting patches where the gain per unit cost is high. I investigated the allocation of searching time amongst food patches in the home ranges of breeding great tits, Pants major, and blue tits P. caeruleus, by radiotracking. The density of locations in individual trees was positively correlated with prey biomass within trees and negatively with the distance of the trees from the nest. These two factors explained 52% of the variance in the allocation of the birds' search time. In rich patches, food was reduced considerably within 20 m of the nests; and the birds' travelling distances increased significantly during the nestling period. In parallel to foraging selectively in rich resources near the nest, the birds continually sampled the trees in their territory. The average surplus search time due to resource exploration was 1.52 times (range 1.25-1.99) the expected search time if the birds had exclusively used the most profitable patch. Despite considerable effort in patch sampling, the overall search time per unit prey was 30% better than expected by an equal use of trees. The results suggest that foraging tit parents come close to the maximum rate of prey delivery possible in a given patch distribution. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   EVOLUTION; BROOD
AB Because workers in colonies of eusocial Hymenoptera are more closely related to sisters than to brothers, theory predicts workers should bias investment in reproductive broods to favour reproductive females over males. However, conflict between queens and workers is predicted. Queens are equally related to daughters and sons, and should act to prevent workers from biasing investment. Previous study of the ant Pheidole desertorum showed that workers are nearly three times more closely related to reproductive females than males; however, the investment sex ratio is very near equal, consistent with substantial queen control of workers. Near-equal investment is produced by an equal frequency of colonies whose reproductive broods consist of only females (female specialists) and colonies whose reproductive broods consist of only males or whose sex ratios are extremely male biased (male specialists). Because natural selection should act on P. desertorum workers to bias investment in favour of reproductive females, why do workers in male-specialist colonies rear only (or mostly) males? We tested the hypothesis that queens prevent workers from rearing reproductive females by experimentally providing workers with immature reproductive broods of both sexes. Workers reared available reproductive females, while failing to rear available males. Worker preference for rearing reproductive females is consistent with queens preventing their occurrence in colonies of male specialists. These results provide evidence that queens and workers will act in opposition to determine the sex ratio, a fundamental prediction of queen-worker conflict theory.

AB Sexual characters may reveal the quality of a potential mate, including the mate's level of infection with parasites. Females that prefer males with low levels of infection or no infection may benefit in several ways. Direct benefits may include avoidance of infection, acquistition of larger nuptial gifts or enhancement in fecundity due to differences in male fertility. Females may also benefit indirectly by producing offspring that are more resistant to infections. We measured female preference for odours produced by male grain beetles, Tenebrio molitor, that were either infected by a tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta, or uninfected. This parasite is not transmitted directly between conspecifics. Females were attracted to odours of all males, but they were less attracted to those from parasitized males. To the contrary, females were preferentially attracted to infected females. Males did not show any biased attraction to odours from infected and uninfected male beetles. Females that mated with highly infected males produced fewer offspring than females mated to uninfected males, indicating parasitic infection inflicts multiple costs to males. These results are consistent with models of parasite-mediated sexual selection. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Studies of several bird species have shown that coloured leg bands may affect a male's success in mate attraction and/or mating competition. From a colour band experiment in the field, we have previously reported that male bluethroats, Luscinia s. svecica, with blue and orange bands (BO males) guarded their mates less intensely at the peak of female fertility, and spent more time advertising for additional mates, than males banded with non-BO colours. These responses indicated that BO males experienced less threat to their paternity than did non-BO males, possibly mediated through an increased attractiveness. Here we present paternity analyses of the broods from the field study and test whether there were differences between the two male groups in within-pair or extrapair paternity. There were no significant differences between the two groups of males in paternity, suggesting effective male protection of paternity. However, extrapair paternity was infrequent in the 2 years of the field experiment; hence, the power in detecting effects on paternity does not allow a definitive conclusion on this issue. We also conducted an aviary experiment in which females were given the choice between a BO male and a non-BO male, to test whether females had preferences for particular colour bands. Females did not associate more with BO males, as would have been expected if these males were mote attractive in social mate choice. Our results suggest that the effects of colour bands on social mate choice and paternity are, at best, weak. (C) 2000 nle Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Studies of inbreeding and outcrossing have traditionally concentrated on matings within populations. The influence of geographical origin on mate choice in animals from different populations has received less attention. We investigated whether planorbid snails mated preferentially within their own population or with snails from other populations. Snails from three Biomphalaria Pfeifferi strains and three B. glabrata strains were allowed to mate with conspecifics in the laboratory. We recorded their matings at night using time-lapse video. When they could choose between sympatric and allopatric snails, Biomphalaria snails significantly preferred the former: snails of each population mated more often with sympatric than with allopatric snails. This tendency to avoid outcrossing may indicate that, in some species, local adaptations can be more valuable than genetic novelties. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated the dynamics of sperm transfer and the potential conflict between sexes over mating opportunities in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris L. We recorded copulation duration in flight cages and manipulated copulation time by separating mating pairs. Sperm transfer and filling of the spermatheca were measured by dissecting queens at different time intervals after the onset of mating. On average, copulations lasted 37 min but most sperm were transferred into the female genital tract within the first 2 min. Sperm reached the spermatheca after 30-80 min. Males transferred a sticky gelatinous product of their accessory glands, the 'mating plug', to the female within 10-30min of the onset of copulation. Hence the duration of the copulation matched the time required to deposit the plug fully. A likely function of the plug is to prevent backflow of sperm, but by artificially transferring mating plugs we showed that the plug also decreased sperm transfer into the female's spermatheca for at least. 4h and possibly for much longer (8 h or more). Increased mating costs arising from male selfishness may prevent females from seeking further matings. This may help to explain why females of B. terrestris seem to be mostly singly mated in the field, even though, in experiments with artificially inseminated queens, higher sperm diversity increases reproductive output. This is the first report of a mating plug for the Bombini but similar devices are known from two other tribes of the Apidae, the Apini and Meliponini.

AB We used noninvasive, infrared phototransducers to record continuously the heartbeat of common mussels, Mytilus edulis, experiencing successive phases of interaction with the predatory gastropod Nucella lapillus, from initial threat to attack and consumption. Coupling physiological monitoring with behavioural analysis allowed us to investigate in detail the responses of mussels to predation threat. Compared to values of normal feeding activity, heart rate increased significantly when mussels were in the presence of effluent from dogwhelks. When attacked by dogwhelks, mussels increased their heart rate further, together with the rate of valve gaping. Considering the heart rate as a reliable estimator of respiratory function, these cardiac responses might be a mechanism to compensate for increased energy demand in order to cope with predation hazard. If so, the theoretical importance of trading off energy balance against risk of predation is supported by our results. Cardiac and behavioural responses varied throughout the attack according to the penetration method adopted by dogwhelks. When mussels were attacked through a drilled hole, heart rate tended to increase and periods of cardiac pausing appeared close to the point of death. In contrast, mussels attacked by penetration between the valves showed decreasing heart rate throughout the attack, together with relatively earlier cessation of valve gaping and appearance of cardiac pausing. These differences clearly support the hypothesis that dogwhelks penetrating between the valves are able to induce muscular paralysis of prey by injecting toxins.

AB Females of some Old World primate taxa advertise their sexual receptivity with exaggerated sexual swellings. Although a number of hypotheses have been proposed, the function of this conspicuous trait remains unsolved. This review updates information on the phylogenetic distribution of exaggerated swellings and identifies aspects of the morphology, physiology and behaviour of species with this conspicuous trait. Some of these patterns represent new information, while other patterns have been previously identified, but not in ways that control for phylogeny. This review shows that exaggerated swellings are correlated with some features that serve to confuse paternity certainty among males, while other features tend to bias paternity towards more dominant males. Hypotheses for the evolution of exaggerated swellings are then, reviewed and critically evaluated. Individually, no single hypothesis can account for all the patterns associated with exaggerated swellings; however, a combination of different hypotheses may explain the contradiction between confusing and biasing paternity. I suggest that exaggerated swellings can be viewed as distributions representing the probability of ovulation (the graded-signal hypothesis). In the context of this probabilistic model, exaggerated swellings enable females to manipulate male behaviour by altering the costs and benefits of mate guarding, so that dominant males tend to guard only at peak swelling, but females can mate with multiple males outside peak swelling to confuse paternity. This hypothesis makes testable predictions for future comparative and observational research. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A focus-on the reproductive contributions of males displaying alternative life histories has neglected the role of size-dependent peripheral males in salmonine mating systems. We documented mating behaviour of brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, including observations of spawning, over two breeding seasons to determine the mating costs of peripheral males to dominant males (kleptogamy) and females (egg cannibalism). For males and females, the mating costs of peripheral males were substantial because more than half (56%) of all observed brook trout spawnings involved peripheral males. Males that paired with large females experienced a greater incidence of kleptogamy due to increased numbers of peripheral males present. Large males face a conflict when mating in that they prefer to spawn with large females; however, these same females attract numerous males against which the dominant male cannot defend. From paternity studies, we estimated that males that had peripheral males participate in spawning may fertilize, on average, equal numbers of eggs compared to males spawning solely with a smaller female. Females that paired with relatively smaller males had significantly more eggs eaten by peripheral males than females that paired with relatively larger males. Latency to spawn by females increased when paired with a relatively small male, and resulted in females obtaining a larger spawning partner. The observed patterns of size-assortative mating, kleptogamy and cannibalism are discussed in relation to mate choice for this population of brook trout.

AB Wild baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, give tonal, harmonically rich vocalizations, termed grunts, in at least two distinct, behavioural contexts: when about to embark on a move across an open area ('move' grunts); and when approaching mothers and attempting to inspect or handle their young infants ('infant' grunts). Grunts in these two contexts elicit different responses from receivers and appear to be acoustically distinct (Owren et al. 1997, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 101, 2951-2963). Differences in responses to grunts in the two contexts may, then, be due to acoustic differences, reflecting at least a rudimentary capacity for referential signalling. Alternatively, responses may differ simply due to differences in the contexts in which the grunts are being produced. We conducted playback experiments to test between these hypotheses. Experiments were designed to control systematically the effects of both context and acoustic features so as to evaluate the role of each in determining responses to grunts, In playback trials, subjects differentiated between putative move and infant grunts. Their responses based only on the acoustic features of grunts were functionally distinct and mirrored their behaviour to naturally occurring move and infant grunts. However, subjects' responses were in some cases also affected by the context in which grunts were presented, and by an interaction between the context and the acoustic features of the grunts. Furthermore, responses to grunts were affected by the relative rank difference between the caller and the subject. These results indicate that baboon grunts can function in rudimentary referential fashion, but that the context in which grunts are produced and the social identity of callers can also affect recipients' responses.

AB The song of many bird species is relatively constant in form, yet each bird has more than one son type, making it an excellent model for studies of the mechanisms underlying switching between behaviour patterns. The chaffinch is a good example. Males sing with eventual variety, repeating each song type in the repertoire a few times before switching to another type. The mechanism triggering these switches is not known. We investigated long continuous recordings of spontaneous singing by six wild males to test two hypotheses: (1) that a maximum number of repetitions limits bout length; or (2) that a switch occurs after a song type bout reaches a maximum duration ('time window'). Strong evidence was found for a temporal limitation: song type bouts with many repetitions were delivered only at a fast rate, whereas bouts consisting of few songs were delivered either fast or slow.

ID LAMPROLOGUS-BRICHARDI; BROODCARE HELPERS; FISH
AB We estimated the energy expenditures resulting from helping behaviour in the cooperatively breeding cichlid N. pulcher by measuring the metabolic rates directly associated with specific social and territory maintenance behaviours of individual pair males and females, and their helpers, in a respirometer. In pair males, pair females and helpers, routine metabolism was raised on average 4.4, 3.8 and 3.6 times, respectively, during agonistic behaviour. Helpers spent 3.3 and 6.1 times routine metabolism, respectively, on submissive behaviour (tail quivering) and digging. These estimates of energy expenditure were combined with laboratory time budgets, obtained previously, to calculate behavioural time-energy budgets for pair members and helpers. Both groups spent on average 98.5% of total metabolism on routine and standard metabolism. With regard to the energy expended on specific behaviours, pair males invested almost exclusively in intrafamily agonistic behaviour, while pair females and helpers shared the investment in territory maintenance and direct brood care. The behavioural energy budget of helpers was strongly determined by their submissive behaviour. This serves to maintain the social status of the helpers within the family hierarchy and may therefore be regarded as 'paying for staying', which may also be true for direct brood care and other helper duties. We conclude that the substantial energy expenditures associated with helping behaviours are probably partly responsible for the reduced growth rates of helpers. This is the first study in which energy expenditures associated with specific helping behaviours have been measured in brood care helpers, and it provides the first estimate of total behavioural energy expenditure in a cooperatively breeding fish.

AB Females of several acoustic insects and anurans have recently been shown to orient preferentially to the leading of two identical male calls presented in close succession. We studied this phenomenon via two-choice phonotaxis trials in the neotropical katydid Neoconocephalus spiza and found that females avoided male calls occurring during an interval beginning immediately after the onset of a leading call. This avoidance occurred whether or not the following call was overlapped by the leader, indicating that the mechanism of preference for leading calls may represent a psychoacoustic precedence effect rather than simple call masking. We also found that females preferred leading calls as long as the amplitude of the following call was not more than 2 dB higher than the leader. Under certain circumstances, preferences for leading calls remained when females were presented with a sequence of four calls. Thus, preferences for leading calls probably influence a male's attractiveness and mating success: in complex natural choruses: females are expected to orient towards males producing leading calls regardless of call length (and the probability of overlapping a following call), when the leading call is up to 1.5 times as distant as a follower, and when succeeded by multiple followers. We suggest that female preferences for leading male calls represent sensory biases that originated in contexts unrelated to sexual selection. None the less they currently play an important role in sexual selection and influence individual male signalling behaviour, and thus chorus structure.

AB Brighter red three-spined stickleback, Gasterostetus aculeatus, males have been shown to be preferred by females in the laboratory but in the field, these males did not receive more eggs. Instead, they had heavier eggs in their brood. We investigated the hypothesis that sexual selection for red coloration in male sticklebacks acts through mate choice by preferred males, who can afford to be choosy, for high-quality females which lay heavier eggs. We assume here that heavier eggs provide a direct fitness advantage. In simultaneous choice tests males were presented with two females differing in size. The number of zigzags directed to and the time spent orienting to each female were measured. After the test the females laid eggs, which we counted and weighed. Bigger (i.e longer and heavier) females laid significantly more and heavier eggs than smaller females. For all 23 males pooled together, the preferred female was the bigger of the two in 17 cases, laid more eggs in 18 cases,but laid heavier eggs in only 13 cases. When bright and dull males were analysed separately, we found that bright but not dull males spent more time oriented to the bigger female, and to the female that laid more eggs. Females preferred by bright males tended to lay heavier eggs than nonpreferred females, although this result was not quite significant. We conclude that in nature this preference for bigger females results in brighter males receiving on average heavier eggs. Assuming higher survival of bigger offspring, we propose that this can explain how brightness can be sexually selected in spite of brighter males not receiving more eggs.

AB In the field, recently probed flowers of borage, Borago officinalis, typically contained little or no nectar (and hence were relatively unrewarding), whether probed by a bumblebee, Bombus spp., worker or a honeybee, Apis mellifera. However, a nectar-collecting bee was likely to reject a recently probed flower only if the previous visitor was a conspecific (honeybees) or congener (bumblebees); the effect Was especially marked in honeybees. Honeybees rejected more than 80% of flowers probed by conspecifics less than 20 s previously, but less than 20% of flowers probed by bumblebees less than 20 s previously. Only if the previous bee was a conspecific or congener did the probability of a bee probing a flower increase with the time since the last probing visit. Otherwise, the probability of a bee probing was independent of the time elapsed since the last visit. Bees' reactions to flowers whose nectar content had been manipulated independently of prior visits suggested that bees were repelled from flowers by species- or genus-specific chemical cues deposited by previous bees. Laboratory studies elsewhere have reported that honeybees are repelled from artificial feeders by volatile bee-deposited chemicals. My results constitute strong evidence that such cues are used by nectar-collecting honeybees in the field, and also suggest that bumblebees respond to similar cues. Calculations show that the ability to detect recently visited flowers may help bees to make a foraging profit; especially when bee densities are high. Thus, bee-deposited chemicals may confer information and economic advantages to foraging alongside conspecifics or congeners. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Handicap signalling: when fecundity and viability do not add up
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTER; PRINCIPLE; SELECTION; HONESTY; TRAITS; CHEAP
AB It is widely accepted that a requirement for honest handicap signalling is that higher-quality signallers pay lower marginal costs for advertising. This is a simple, powerful principle, but it is correct only if the fitness effects of fecundity and viability are strictly additive. Additivity would not be expected from most life history models. The general criterion for honest handicap signalling is that higher-quality signallers must have higher marginal fitness effects of advertising. This might result from higher benefits rather than lower costs. The general criterion implies the existence of a ridge on the fitness surface for two correlated characters, quality (or viability) and advertising. This has important implications for the design of experiments. Critical tests of the handicap hypothesis should establish that signallers of different quality are on a rising fitness ridge because of different cost-benefit trade-offs. The further question of whether receivers are maximizing their fitness requires additional experiments because handicap signalling does not require that the receivers maximize their fitness, only that they return benefits to signallers as an increasing function of the size of the signal. If receiver preferences are exaggerated by sensory bias or indirect selection, the resulting exaggerated signals may be consistent with the handicap principle.

DT Article
ID PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT; TREE SWALLOWS; NEED; WATER; SIZE
AB This study presents data relevant to the hypothesis that the energy expenditure associated with begging influences the signalling of need by nestling birds. We used open-circuit respirometry to measure the energy costs of resting, begging and non-begging activities in nestling house wrens, Troglodytes aedon, ranging in age from 1 to 11 days post-hatching. Across all ages, begging caused a 27% increase in metabolism above resting rates. The metabolic rate during begging was not related to begging vigour. However, more vigorous begs were longer and so required a greater total energy expenditure. We analysed videotapes of broods for nestling behavioural time budgets which were combined with the metabolic data and data on growth at different ages to generate daily energy budgets. Over a 24-h period, the cumulative energy allocated to begging was slight, ranging from 0.02% of the energy budget in younger nestlings (3 days old) to 0.22% in older ones (10 days old). In contrast, non-begging movements accounted for 2 and 9% of the daily energy budget of younger and older nestlings, respectively. Relative to daily growth, the energy allocated to begging was equivalent to 0.05% (younger nestlings) and 2.3% (older nestlings) of the energy sequestered in new tissue, whereas the values for non-begging activities were 5.1 and 96.8%, respectively. These results suggest that the energetic cost of begging is not likely to have a substantial role in influencing communication of need by nestlings.

AB The territorial damselfly Platycypha caligata (Odontata: Chlorocyphidae) has a courtship behaviour where males wave the white anterior surface of all six laterally enlarged tibiae at females. I experimentally altered this white tibial surface using black paint to determine the effect on male behaviour of a 25% reduction in area, or an increase in asymmetry between the left and right side of the body. I collected behavioural data on courtship, mating and fighting for males already holding territories. Neither a reduction in the area nor an increase in asymmetry of tibial whiteness affected male mating rate, courtship rate or fighting behaviour. These manipulations also had no significant effect on the daily presence at the study site. Males whose tibial whiteness was experimentally removed also showed no decrease in mating rate or change in fighting behaviour while territorial. The complete removal of tibial whiteness did, however, lead to a significant reduction in daily presence, possibly due to a reduced ability to acquire or hold a territory. There was no relationship between natural levels of asymmetry in tibial whiteness and mating rate, courting rate or fighting behaviour for males with territories. However, the natural area of tibial whiteness was significantly positively related to both mean male mating rate and copulation duration for territorial males. This result suggests that a phenotypic correlate of area of tibial whiteness, probably body size, is sexually selected through female choice among males that already hold territories.

AB All tiger salamanders, Ambystoma tigrinum, entering a small pond in New York state were given radio-implants and tracked throughout breeding to determine whether reproductive behaviour in nature differs from that described in laboratory studies. I formed an extended model of adult reproductive behaviour that included male and female strategies and differential use of habitat components in the breeding pond, and then tested four key predictions regarding adult movement using the sequence of positions of all salamanders between pond entry and exit. An unexpected, female-biased sex ratio during most courtship activity led to departures from the predicted behaviour, but in all other respects the behaviour of the males and females followed from the predictions. Apparent mate scanning in clear water, and weather assessment in pond-edge shallows just prior to emergence, are new indications for caudate amphibians.

   BEHAVIOR; NEED; PATERNITY; MODELS
AB The evolutionary conflict over the amount of resources transferred between a parent and its offspring may be resolved by honest signalling of 'need' by offspring and parental investment in relation to signalling level. In birds, biparental care is the norm and evidence that male and female parents differ in their investment pattern in individual offspring is growing. In an experiment on great tits, Parus major, we investigated how and why parents differ in food allocation when responding to similar chick signals, which supposedly uniquely reflect the chick's nutritional condition. Nestling hunger level was manipulated by food deprivation and hand-feeding. Subsequent filming revealed that parents fed from significantly different locations on the nest and thereby forced chicks to choose between them when competing for favourable positions. Deprived nestlings approached, and fed ones retreated (or were displaced by siblings) from, positions near the female. No such behaviour was observed towards the male. Females allocated more feeds than males to the food-deprived nestlings. The results are discussed in terms of nestling competition for access to 'begging patches'. By varying their 'begging patch' value, parents may exploit competitive inter-sibling dynamics to influence the outcome of competition among chick phenotypes (e.g. 'need', size, sex). Parent birds may thereby exert considerable control over the information content of chick begging behaviour. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many animal species, locomotion is frequently interrupted by brief pauses. This intermittent locomotion is usually considered a mode of prey search, but other possible functions include reduced detection or attack by predators and improved endurance. We tested the hypothesis that pauses also serve to improve vigilance for predators in two species of sciurid rodent. Videotaping animals travelling between food-collecting and food-hoarding sites revealed that numerous short pauses comprise 5-38% of the time spent 'moving' in grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, and 0-41% in eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus. In this situation, search for food items did not occur, and pausing did not reduce the total time spent as a moving stimulus for predators. It also appeared that speed while running was too slow and the pauses too brief to provide an endurance advantage. As predicted by the vigilance hypothesis, both species spent more time pausing when moving away from forest cover (presumably towards areas of higher risk) than when travelling back towards forest cover. In control trials within forest cover, squirrels did not differ in time pausing when approaching and leaving patches, but chipmunks paused more when approaching patches than when leaving them. We conclude that one function of pausing in squirrels is to improve anti-predator vigilance. The occurrence of pausing by chipmunks did not match a priori predictions of the vigilance hypothesis. Because it also failed to match predictions of previous alternative hypotheses, we suggest that studies are needed to examine whether the risk of attacks by conspecifics and predators is higher for chipmunks approaching than leaving food patches in forest habitat.

AB This study demonstrates that invertebrate acoustic signals can provide information about male phenotypic attributes, and that females can use this acoustic information in mate choice to select a phenotypically superior mate. I investigated the relationships between a male acoustic sexual signal, the phenotype of the signaller, and the female response to signal variation. I recorded and analysed the calling songs of male house crickets, Acheta domesticus. The analyses showed that chirps convey information about male size. With the exception of amplitude, the mean number of pulses per chirp was the best predictor of male size. I performed a laboratory tape-playback experiment to determine female preference during phonotaxis. Females preferred tapes playing the chirps of large males, specifically chirps with a greater number of pulses per chirp. Selection on the female preference is discussed.

AB Zebra finches have previously been found to have preferences for particular colours of both natural and artificial traits among opposite sex conspecifics. For example, in some studies female zebra finches preferred males wearing red leg bands to orange-banded and unbanded birds and rejected light green-banded males. In other studies, females also preferred males with red beaks to orange-beaked males. However, several authors have failed to replicate these results. We show that females may fail to show a colour preference because of the absence or removal of ultraviolet light under experimental conditions. In mate-choice trials, females observing males through filters that transmitted ultraviolet preferred red-banded males but where females viewed males through ultraviolet-blocking filters, no such preference was observed. Further investigation revealed that the lack of a colour preference when ultraviolet was absent was probably due to the change in overall appearance of the bird, rather than the change in appearance of the rings themselves. This work highlights the importance of proper consideration of the sensory capabilities of animals in experimental design, particularly with regard to the role of ultraviolet light in avian colour perception.

ID CENTER HYPOTHESIS; BIRDS
AB Experiments have demonstrated that socially acquired information influences both where Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, look for food and what foods they eat. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether rats could also use information acquired from conspecifics to determine when food had become available. Naive rats introduced either into colonies that had been trained to come to a feeding site when food was made available there or into colonies lacking such training. The former naive animals began to feed on introduced food with significantly shorter latencies than did the latter. Naive rats tended to leave a shelter they shared with others and travel to a feeding site after interacting at the shelter with a returning successful forager, but not after interacting there with a returning unsuccessful forager. Furthermore, naive rats that had been trained to eat a food, but not naive rats trained to avoid eating the same food, left shelter and went to a feeding site after interacting in the shelter with a returning forager that had eaten the food that naive rats had been trained either to eat or to avoid. All results were consistent with the view that naive colony members could learn that food had become available at a familiar feeding site by interacting with colony members that had recently eaten there.

AB Lactating female baboons, Papio cynocephalus, often maintain close associations with particular males. There are at least three proposed benefits of 'friendships' to females: (1) male protection against potentially infanticidal males; (2) male protection against harassment by dominant females; (3) male attachment to an infant that develops into future care of juveniles. These hypotheses were examined in a population of chacma baboons, P. c. ursinus, in which male infanticide accounted for at least 38% of infant mortality. Almost all mothers of young infants formed strong bonds with one or two males with whom they had copulated during the cycle in which they conceived their infants. Females were primarily responsible for maintaining friendships during lactation, but they terminated these relationships if their infants died. In playbacks of females' screams, male friends responded more strongly than control males. They also responded more strongly to the screams of female friends than to the screams of control females. Following an infant's death, however, male friends responded less strongly than control males to the same females' screams. Finally, male friends responded more strongly than control males to playback sequences in which female screams were combined with the threat vocalizations of a potentially infanticidal alpha male, but not when female screams were combined with the threat calls of a non-infanticidal male or the alpha female. Both observations and experiments suggest that the benefits of friendships to females derive from the protection of their infants against infanticide.

AB Mating and reproductive outcomes are the product of the potentially conficting strategies of breeding males and females. In a captive group of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata fuscata, behavioural, endocrine and genetic data were combined to assess the independent effects of male-male competition and female mate choice on mating and reproductive success. Males were ranked by social dominance and by their attractivity to females. Computer simulation and logistic regression analyses showed that male attractivity had a stronger effect than male dominance on both mating and reproductive outcome. Although male dominance and attractivity both significantly predicted mating success during fertile periods, only male attractivity significantly predicted actual male reproductive success. These results provide evidence that female mate choice can be a stronger determinant of mating and reproductive outcome in this species when male and female strategies are in conflict. The lack of a consistent correlation between male dominance rank and reproductive success in this species may be accounted for in part by female mate choice of socially subordinate males. Sires who were observed to mate with the mother during her fertile period were more likely to be socially dominant than sires who were not observed to do so. This observation suggests the existence of alternative mating strategies by subordinate males, which may also contribute to the lack of a consistent correlation between male dominance rank and reproductive success in this species.

AB Path integration is a process that enables a moving animal to memorize the location of the starting point of its outward path relative to its current position by continuously processing motion-related information collected en route (route-based information). There has been no evidence, however, that path integration could be used by a swimming animal, even in aquatic or amphibious species. I conducted water maze experiments to test whether rats, Rattus norvegicus, can rely on path integration while swimming, in order to return to a hidden escape platform after circular outward paths ranging from 60 degrees to 300 degrees. Rats proved able to perform the task in a few days. No systematic errors in the distribution of return directions could be observed. In contrast, there was a fairly large random error (about 55 degrees), which, surprisingly, did not depend on the outward path length. Comparison with walking rats could not be made because of the lack of published data. However, results for walking hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus, showed that their random errors are slightly smaller than those made by swimming rats. Such large errors are likely to prevent rats as well as hamsters (and presumably any swimming or walking mammal) from using path integration over long outward paths.

AB The effects of experience on prey and prey-patch choice were compared between two species of marine predatory crabs. The blue crab, Callinectes sapidus Rathbun, is highly mobile and forages in a variety of estuarine and lagoonal habitats. The Atlantic mud crab, Panopeus herbstii H. Milne-Edwards, is smaller and less mobile and is found mostly in oyster reefs and on shelly bottoms. In the laboratory, crabs were offered a choice between two prey types (juvenile hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria Linne, and juvenile oysters, Crassostrea virginica Gmelin) following a preliminary phase in which crabs were trained to feed on clams only, oysters only or a mixture of the two prey types. In field enclosures, crabs were offered a choice between patches of juvenile hard clams located in an inter-tidal salt marsh and in an adjacent unvegetated inter-tidal flat after they were trained to feed in either one of the two habitat types. Both in the laboratory prey-choice and the field prey-patch choice experiments, blue crabs modified their foraging behaviour depending on previous experience. The effect of experience on their foraging behaviour did not diminish after 24 hours. Experience had no significant effects on the foraging behaviour of mud crabs. Differences in the ecological contexts (e.g. in the variability of prey quality and availability) in which the two species forage may explain the greater effect of experience on the blue crab foraging behaviour, although alternative explanations cannot be ruled out.

AB The white-nosed coati, Nasua narica, lives in large social groups, called bands, and displays a variety of complex cooperative behaviours. These behavioural patterns, such as coalition support, may influence the ability of an individual to gain access to limited resources and have attracted theoretical attention because they may be maintained by reciprocal altruism. To better understand the mechanisms influencing cooperation, coalition dynamics and time individuals spend away from the band, the relationship between kinship and specific social behaviours was assessed. The genetic relationships of individuals from six coati bands were estimated by measuring the similarity of multilocus DNA fingerprints. Results showed that coati bands primarily consist of highly related individuals. The variance in relatedness was high, however, and four bands contained some individuals that were unrelated to other band members. Males who monopolized access to band females during the breeding season did not sire most offspring. Unrelated individuals spent more time away from the group than did band members with close relatives in the band. Moreover, unrelated individuals received more aggression from band members and received less coalition support than did individuals with close relatives in the band.

AB Primate long-distance calls have typically been interpreted as communication signals between conspecific groups (the 'resource defence hypothesis'), but their potential role as anti-predator alarm calls has received comparably little attention. Male diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana diana, in the Tdi forest of Gate d'Ivoire often utter long-distance calls, either spontaneously or in reaction to a variety of stimuli, including predators and non-predators. The present study focuses only on predation contexts and provides evidence for communication to both predators and conspecifics. Males called only in response to predators whose hunting success depends on unprepared prey, that is, leopards and crowned hawk eagles, but not in response to pursuit hunters, such as chimpanzees and humans, which can pursue the caller in the canopy. Calling was regularly combined with approaching the predator. Both observations suggest that male long-distance calls are used to signal detection to the predator ('perception advertisement hypothesis'). Analysis of male long-distance calls given to leopards and eagles showed that they differed according to a number of acoustic parameters. The two call variants were played to different diana monkey groups; conspecifics responded to them as though the original predator were present. We conclude that, in addition to their function in perception advertisement, diana monkey long-distance calls function as within-group semantic signals that denote different types of predators.

AB Clark's nutcrackers, Nucifraga columbiana, pinyon jays, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus, scrub-jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens, and Mexican jays, A. ultramarina, differ in their dependence on cached seeds in their natural environments. The hypothesis that these species differ in their long-term ability to remember the locations of caches was tested in the laboratory. Birds recovered caches 10, 60, 150 and 250 days after making them. All species performed at levels better than chance overall, but scrub-jays and Mexican jays performed with modest accuracy at all time intervals. Nutcrackers and pinyon jays performed very accurately with 10- and 60-day intervals but not after longer intervals. These results corroborate the species differences in spatial memory that have been observed in previous studies. The performance of scrub- and Mexican jays can, however, be interpreted either as the rapid forgetting of most information or as the long-term retention of a small amount of information. Therefore it cannot be concluded that these four species differ in their long-term spatial memory abilities. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Polygyny appears to be beneficial for males, yet comprises less than 20% of all pair bonds formed by male willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus. This study tested whether polygyny was costly to males. Polygynous males defended larger territories than monogamous and unpaired males and were more likely to be adults than males of other pairing status. Pairing status changed throughout the life of some males. Naturally polygynous males were in better body condition in the early part of the breeding season than other male types, and unpaired territorial males had the lowest condition. Naturally polygynous males had a tendency to lose the least amount of body mass over the season. Naturally polygynous and monogamous males had larger combs than males of other pairing status. Polygynous males had higher reproductive success, similar survival and similar future reproductive success compared with monogamous and unpaired territorial males. Even in years of high clutch predation, and accounting for higher levels of extra-pair paternity in the clutches of polygynous males, naturally polygynous males were more successful than other male types. A group of experimentally polygynous males (i.e. they became polygynous because of a male removal experiment) had similar reproductive success to naturally polygynous males, but lower overwinter survival than other male types. These results suggest that naturally polygynous males were older and 'better' than other males and this allowed them to defend larger territories and attract more than one female. Males that became polygynous only as a result of our experiment, however, appeared to suffer costs from this increased breeding effort. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID PACIFIC TREE FROGS; NEOTROPICAL TREEFROG; MATE SELECTION; FEMALE CHOICE;
   CRICKET FROG; BEHAVIOR; CHORUSES; TERRITORIALITY; ADVERTISEMENT;
   AMPLITUDE
AB Male Pacific treefrogs, Hyla regilla, use advertisement and encounter calls to regulate inter-male spacing within breeding choruses. Encounter calls are produced when the advertisement calls of a neighbour exceed a threshold amplitude. These 'aggressive thresholds' are plastic: males resume advertisement calling (accommodate) to repeated presentation of advertisement calls at amplitudes 4 dB above their aggressive threshold. A male's aggressive threshold for the advertisement call is positively correlated with the maximum amplitude of advertisement calls of neighbours, measured at the focal male's position. The aggressive thresholds of males for the encounter call, however, are not significantly correlated with the maximum call amplitude of their neighbours. The present study tested whether this disjunction results from males not having recently experienced supra-threshold encounter calls, or from fu;ed aggressive thresholds for this call. Playback of encounter calls to males in the field showed that males generally accommodated within 2 min when calls were 4 dB above their aggressive thresholds for this call, but accommodated more slowly, and sometimes moved, at 8 dB above threshold. A second study tested whether accommodation to the encounter call elicits parallel elevations of a male's aggressive threshold to; the advertisement call. Playback of encounter calls at supra-threshold levels caused the aggressive threshold of males to increase 15 dB for the encounter call but only 2 dB for the advertisement call. These two call types are spectrally highly similar; therefore, selective accommodation cannot result from sensory adaptation in the periphery. Plasticity of aggressive thresholds, like plasticity of aggressive signalling, may be important in balancing the costs and benefits of aggressive behaviour.

AB Experimental evidence has shown that brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, display pairing preferences for their native population. Here, the question of whether social experience affects such preferences was tested. Four groups of juvenile female and male cowbirds from a South Dakota population were housed either with adult birds from the same population or with adult birds from an Indiana population. The Indiana population is from a different subspecies from the South Dakota population, and adult Indiana cowbirds display communicative behaviours that are different from adult South Dakota cowbirds; the communicative cultures of the two populations thus are distinct. The pairing and mating patterns of the juvenile females and males were assessed during their first two breeding seasons. In the first year, 71.4% of the pairings that occurred in a testing aviary were between unfamiliar birds of the same cultural background. In the second year of testing, after another winter of social experience with adults of their respective cultures, 86.2% of the pairings, and 77.3% of the copulations, that occurred were between birds of the same cultural background. These data demonstrate the learning of population-specific courtship and mating patterns in cowbirds, and are among the strongest experimental data to date indicating assortative mating in birds based upon social experience.

   POPULATIONS; MUSCULUS; DOMINANT
AB Previous work has shown that dominant male mice, Mus musculus, are usually attracted to scent-marked areas while subordinates avoid them. In this study, the responses of subordinates were highly variable, and the idea that the probability of intruding onto a scent-marked substrate depends on their competitive ability was tested. Subjects were kept in dominant/subordinate pairs of males and tested with scent marks of an unfamiliar male. Subordinates who were large in relation to their dominant partners were more likely to choose a scent-marked substrate in a Y-maze choice against a blank substrate; relatively small subordinates were more likely to avoid scent marks. Males that chose scent marks also tended (P=0.08) to be more often involved in escalated contests with their dominant partners. Body size is known to affect the outcome of fights between strangers and these results could be explained if relatively large subordinates are (1) more likely to be able to defeat the resident of a scent-marked area (and thus benefit from its resources) and (2) if large subordinates pose a greater threat of a dominance reversal to their dominant partners than would a relatively small subordinate.

AB This study was designed to investigate the relative effects of seed perishability and handling time on the caching preferences of grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, and to test the predictions for caching behaviour that follow from these two hypotheses. Free-ranging squirrels were presented with acorns from two oak subgenera, Erythrobalamus and Leucobalanus, that vary in perishability (due to germination schedules) and handling time (due to acorn size). In six separate caching experiments, individual squirrels were sequentially presented with two acorn types, so that each paired treatment varied in handling time and/or perishability. Caching responses were recorded for each acorn, along with eating and caching times. Squirrels consistently consumed acorns of high perishability and cached acorns of low perishability, without regard to handling time. This result suggests that the perishability of seeds exerts a greater influence than handling time on the grey squirrel's decision to cache acorns.

AB The blue-gray gnatcatcher, Polioptila caerulea, is one of the smallest regular hosts of the brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater. Gnatcatchers typically raise none of their own young when parasitized, yet anti-parasite behaviours have not been reported. A blue-gray gnatcatcher population in which pairs often desert nests when parasitized by cowbirds was studied to examine the success of a desertion response and to determine factors that stimulate desertion. Of 83 gnatcatcher nests, 76% were parasitized; of nests parasitized during the egg-laying stage, 45% were deserted. Desertion occurred independently of the timing of the parasitism event during the breeding season and the number of cowbird eggs laid per nest. All cowbird eggs laid after the completion of the gnatcatcher's egg-laying stage were accepted. Parasitism rates were lower late in the breeding season, and nesting success of unparasitized nests was higher. Pairs that deserted often obtained cowbird-free clutches, allowing them to raise gnatcatcher young. Nest desertion appears to be a means of avoiding parasitism and increasing fitness. The nest desertion response was inconsistent, but it cannot be explained by the adaptiveness of acceptance or by the possibility that blue-gray gnatcatchers are in transition between being accepters or rejectors of cowbird parasitism. Nest desertion by blue-gray gnatcatchers appears to be a generalized response to a disturbance at the nest induced by cowbirds. The cue that elicits the desertion response remains unclear.

AB This study assessed whether keas, Nestor notabilis, are able to cooperate in an instrumental task. Seven birds of a captive group were tested in group situations and in dyads. At least two individuals had to manipulate an apparatus to obtain food but only one participant was rewarded. One bird had to push down a lever to enable another one to collect food from a box. The distribution of the two different roles was clearly dependent on hierarchy. The higher ranking individual always obtained the reward and each bird changed its role according to dominance status. Owing to the non-linear hierarchy in the group, each bird participating in cooperative interactions had at least one submissive partner. Therefore, in group situations the reward was distributed symmetrically and cooperation was persistent. II! dyadic test situations, three individual keas aggressively manipulated their respective subordinate partners to open the apparatus. Their dominance status enabled them to force cooperation.

AB Associations between male sexual rest and litter sex ratio have been reported in Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, but the direction of the effect has been inconsistent. Female rats were paired with either a male that had copulated to satiety three weeks previously or a male that had copulated within the previous four days. Females were paired during both a cycling oestrus and a postpartum oestrus. Sex-ratio biases were only observed in litters conceived during a cycling oestrus. Litters sired by rested males had higher sex ratios than litters sired by unrested males. This relationship was mediated by differences in the timing of mating events, including length of post-ejaculatory interval and the time at which effective mating was-completed. Sex ratio was negatively associated with time of mating completion, replicating earlier findings. Only litters that had fewer pups at birth than at implantation showed the relationship between sex ratio and rest-mediated mating behaviour. These litters were not smaller than litters without loss, however. Post-implantation loss was more likely to occur when uterine horns were crowded, suggesting that this type of sex-ratio biasing occurs in the context of adaptive litter reduction. This association between paternal behaviour, paternal condition and offspring sex ratio prompts the hypothesis that females use the timing of mating behaviour to evaluate heritable traits that might affect male mating success, and then adjust offspring sex ratio to maximize offspring reproductive success.

TI Memory for flowers in rufous hummingbirds: Location or local visual

AB Rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, remember locations of flowers. They avoid flowers they have emptied recently and those they have found to be empty. In contrast, after one brief experience they return to flowers they have left with food remaining. To determine whether hummingbirds primarily use spatial or colour/pattern cues to return to previously visited flowers, two field experiments were performed. In the first, subjects fed from a reward flower and on their subsequent return had to choose between visual cues that were dissociated from spatial cues. The birds showed a marked preference for returning to the correct location of the previously visited flower and not to the flower bearing the appropriate colour/pattern. The second experiment involved a delayed-matching-to-location task in which the subjects fed from, but did not deplete, a focal flower and on return had to choose between the focal flower and a new distractive flower. The latter was presented at three different distances from the focal flower and was either the same or different in colour to the focal flower. Subjects most often chose the focal flower when the distractive flower was of a different colour, whereas performance was poor when it resembled the focal flower. However, a significant interaction between the colour and distance of the distractive flower suggests that the hummingbirds were able to discriminate between focal and distractive flowers under both conditions, but that they employed different foraging tactics according to the colour of the distractive flower in the choice phase.

   EVOLUTION; MORTALITY
AB The Patagonian breeding colony of southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, of Peninsula Valdes, Argentina is characterized by long, continuous, homogeneous and spacious beaches. Reproduction in this colony occurs at the lowest group densities reported for the species. The availability of ample space resulted in the dispersion of reproductive females along 160 km of coastline, with a range of 0-300 reproductive individuals per km. Females grouped together in small harems (median=11 females, range 2-122, N=432), and individual distance between females was one to two female body lengths. Body contact within the harem was rare. Consequently, agonistic interactions (AIs) between females and female aggression (Ag) towards alien pups occurred infrequently (median rate=4 AIs/female per 100 h and 1 Ag/pup per 100 h, respectively). Pup mortality rate was low for an elephant seal rookery (3.5% for 3487 pups). Most dead pups were stillborn, and only three of 38 pups whose cause of mortality could be determined died from trauma or starvation following mother-pup separation. Female dispersal allowed many males to have access to females. About 45% of all males of reproductive size in the colony (about 1000 individuals) had a harem. Most adult males mated with receptive females. Low-density breeding conditions benefited female reproductive success through an increase in pup survival. Female dispersal resulted in small harem size, however, and limited the potential for polygyny. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB This study compared snail habitat use in Michigan lakes that contain a predator, the molluscivorous pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, with snail habitat use in adjacent lakes lacking pumpkinseeds. Snails in lakes with pumpkinseeds used the covered portion of standardized substrates more often than did snails in lakes lacking pumpkinseeds. The hypothesis that covered habitats provide a refuge from fish predation was experimentally tested by stocking Physella into artificial pools and manipulating the presence of cover and pumpkinseeds. After 3 days, survivorship of Physella was 15-fold higher in pools containing a covered habitat. To test for the existence of chemically mediated predator avoidance behaviours in Physella, they were exposed to water that had been in contact with (1) pumpkinseeds and (2) crushed conspecifics. Physella did not change their habitat use when exposed to water that had been in contact with pumpkinseeds, but increased their refuge use two-fold over controls when exposed to water that had been in contact with crushed conspecifics. The effects of habitat structure on the type of predator avoidance response used by Physella was tested by exposing them to mortality risk in wading pools with and without covered habitats. Physella did not move to the surface in response to mortality risk if a covered habitat was available, but in the absence of a covered habitat they responded to mortality risk by moving to the water's surface. Possible consequences of flexible behavioural choices by snails for population and community-level processes are discussed. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

   FEMALES; POPULATION; PISCES; MALES; FISH
AB Reproductive behaviour and reproductive success in a marine fish, the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, were affected by changes in the sex ratio. When the sex ratio was male biased (six males:three females), aggressive male-male interactions were more frequent per individual than in a female-biased situation (three males:six females). Accordingly, in the female-biased treatment females interacted more with each other than in the male-biased treatment. There was no difference between treatments in male interactions towards females, nor in female interactions towards males. Controls, with even sex ratios at two different densities (three or six of each sex), did not differ from each other in intra- or inter-sexual interactions. This shows that the differences in intra-sexual behaviour, found in males as well as females, were caused by the sex ratio and not by density. In the male-biased treatment and in the unbiased controls, nest-building males were larger than non-building males, whereas in the female-biased treatment there was no difference in size between builders and non-builders. Thus, our experiments show that a change in sex ratio changes competition for mates, and that individuals adjust their reproductive behaviour to the current sex ratio.

AB Monogamy is thought to be prevalent in bird species because of the role of male parental care, Evolutionarily stable strategies for biparental cooperation provide a behavioural mechanism for the maintenance of monogamous relationships, under which any shortfall in one parent's work rate is predicted to be partially compensated for by its partner. Both parents should invest more effort when there are more young. These predictions were tested simultaneously using tail-weights to reduce the visit rates of female members of pairs of orange-tufted sunbirds, Nectarinia osea, feeding broods of two or three chicks. Prior to the manipulation and in unmanipulated control pairs, females provisioned at a greater rate, removed proportionally more faecal sacs and spent longer at the nest, whilst males showed greater nest guarding effort. As predicted by game theory, males with tail-weighted females compensated incompletely for their partners' lower provisioning rate. Males failed to nest guard when provisioning at high rates, implying an important trade-off for biparental cooperation. Larger broods were fed at a greater rate by both parents. Visit rates per chick decreased in experimental nests and in larger broods, and this was reflected in lower chick growth rates. Greater chick growth rates per visit in control nests and larger broods suggest that they received superior load sizes and/or quality of prey. These results concur with previous studies of parental responses to partner effort, and further reveal the behavioural flexibility in provisioning and nest guarding strategies in a species with predominantly female care.

TI DNA FINGERPRINT SIMILARITY BETWEEN FEMALE AND JUVENILE BROWN-HEADED
   COWBIRDS TRAPPED TOGETHER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID DISPERSION; BEHAVIOR
AB This DNA fingerprinting study investigates whether females of the brood parasite brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater, associate with their own juvenile offspring at feeding sites more often than would be expected by chance. Cowbirds lay their eggs in the nests of a variety of host species and, as far as is known, leave them to the care of foster parents. Using baited walk-in funnel traps, 36 adult female-juvenile pairs (or trios) of cowbirds were trapped. Blood samples were collected from these individuals to conduct DNA fingerprinting analyses, calculate similarity indices, and to compare S-values for the 11 comparisons of juveniles and the females with which they were caught with S-values of random pairings of juveniles and the females in adjacent gel lanes with which they were not caught. Overall band-sharing was significantly higher for the individuals trapped together than for the random pairings. These associations between juvenile cowbirds and their mothers could occur as a result of female cowbirds monitoring the development of their young in the nests where they have laid. Alternatively, nestling cowbirds in the nest could become familiar visually and vocally with a female parent that is frequently present in their territory and could follow her when she departs for feeding grounds. In either case these data suggest that adult cowbirds associate with juveniles, in some cases their own offspring, and that offspring may learn to function as cowbirds in part from this association.

AB The foraging decisions that individuals make within groups should depend on the information available to them. An aviary experiment was conducted to examine whether a starling's, Sturnus vulgaris, decisions either to approach and feed from (scrounge) or to avoid the patches exploited by a partner bird are influenced by the information the partner provides. Both the type of information a subject could recognize and the point at which this information became available during the partner's exploitation of a patch were manipulated. Information concerning the quality of a patch was available in the form of a concealed colour cue and from the behaviour of the partner bird. The foraging environment was manipulated such that colour cues were either present or absent, and provided either correct or incorrect information concerning the presence of food. When cues corresponded with past foraging experience, test subjects responded selectively and profitably to the patch exploitations of the partner; they scrounged from a higher proportion of profitable patches than control birds, which lacked the ability to recognize colour cues. Test subjects also arrived more quickly at profitable patches that the partner bird discovered than did control birds; and consequently, were able to obtain more food at each food patch scrounged. Finally, test subjects avoided scrounging when the partner discovered empty patches and thus saved foraging time. Responding selectively to public information, therefore, allows an individual to compete more effectively for resources within a foraging group.

   DIRECTIONAL EXTRAPOLATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This experiment examined whether macaques could use purely spatial characteristics of a food distribution as cues to organize their search. Five captive male long-tailed macaques were tested individually and presented with three food piles (cues) of decreasing visibility, spaced at l-m intervals along an invisible directional line. The line changed its location and orientation in space on each trial. After the macaques had found the cues, they inspected other places which were (1) on the same terrain on which they found the cues (a sandfield), (2) on the extension of the invisible line through the three cues and (3) in the direction in which the visibility of the cues decreased. The macaques appeared to extrapolate from the variation in the visibility of the cues and from the position of the cues relative to one another to new potential food sites. An ability to predict food locations based on the distribution of previously found food can be expected to improve a macaque's foraging success in natural patches. The present study indicates a close connection between foraging tendencies and event perception in macaques.

AB Juvenile walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, use group foraging, mediated by local enhancement, when searching for prey that are clumped in time and space. Local enhancement occurs when fish are attracted to the site where another fish has discovered food. Experiments were conducted to determine whether fish forage as individuals when food is widely dispersed in time and space. When acclimatized to dispersed food, juvenile walleye pollock foraged as individuals and did not respond to the food discovery of others. Some fish appeared to aggressively defend areas of their tank, a behaviour not seen in fish foraging for clumped food. In a second experiment, examining the role of prior experience in fish foraging, fish were first acclimatized to clumped food and then suddenly switched to dispersed food. Fish continued to use group foraging, mediated by local enhancement, with no change over 20 food discovery events. These results indicate that social aspects of fish foraging strategies are flexible, but are also influenced by prior experience with resource distribution.

AB The relationship between paternity and male parental behaviour was investigated in an eastern population of red-winged blackbirds. Data collected over four seasons revealed substantial variation in paternity and the frequency of male provisioning. The feeding of nestlings by males increased non-linearly with the age of the nestlings but did not differ within or between seasons. Average relative provisioning by males to individual nests was not associated with the proportion of nestlings sired by the territory owner (determined through multi-locus DNA fingerprinting), either in a bivariate analysis or a multivariate analysis with those variables found to be associated with male parental care in other studies of red-winged blackbirds. Males provisioned significantly less frequently at nests of order females, but paternity was not associated with female age. The later in the season a female settled, the higher her mate's paternity in her brood, yet male provisioning was not associated with female settlement date. Estimated total provisioning by males (sum of all feeding trips over ah nests in each male's territory) was not associated with average paternity in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Total provisioning by males was positively associated with the number of days in the season the male had a brood in a bivariate test, but not with male age, the number of females nor male condition in either bivariate or multivariate analyses. The lack of a relationship between paternity and paternal effort fits predictions of recent theory on the potential effects of reduced paternity on paternal behaviour given (1) the lack of consistent patterns of paternity among nests of different order, time of season and male and female age and (2) generally weak associations between possible behavioural cues about paternity and actual paternity.

AB Mating behaviour can be expected to reflect a compromise between the conflicting interests of the two sexes. Adults of the water strider, Aquarius remigis, mate many times over a period of several months, and males often remain mounted for several hours following sperm transfer. Conflict between the sexes is indicated by both pre-mating and post-mating struggles. To determine the relative influence of males and females on the frequency and duration of mating, 548 mating interactions were videotaped in the laboratory and an additional 140 interactions were observed under more natural, field conditions. Mating attempts were initiated by males, but most of these attempts were resisted by females. The duration of pre-mating struggles initially increased and then declined as the number of mating attempts increased, suggesting possible mate assessment by females at low levels of harassment, but convenience polyandry at higher levels. Long pre-mating struggles were associated with unsuccessful matings. Matings that were long enough to allow sperm transfer were characterized by short pre-mating struggles and long post-mating struggles. Post-mating struggles invariably resulted in the male being dislodged. Depriving males of mates for 7 days prior to the trials increased the number of mating attempts and the durations of the pre- and post-mating struggles, but did not significantly influence the frequency or duration of mating. These results confirm male incentive to increase the frequency and duration of mating, but indicate that female resistance effectively limits both parameters.

AB The mechanism of aggregation behaviour of sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, in response to fright stimuli simulating an aerial predator was investigated. The results provide evidence for the hypothesis that during aggregation individual fish minimize the approach time to a conspecific (time minimization hypothesis). The first experiment investigated how the approach time depends on the body orientation of a fish and on the initial distance to a conspecific. These data were interpolated and used in experiment 2 to predict the approach behaviour of individual fish in particular model constellations involving three fish whose positions were controlled with the help of glass cylinders. In the final experiment, the hypothesis of time minimization was tested on freely aggregating shoals. Fish at the shoal periphery started the aggregation process significantly earlier than central conspecifics and over 95% of the focal fish approached their nearest neighbour in time as predicted by the model.

TI INTERSPECIFIC TERRITORIALITY OF NORTHERN HARRIERS - THE ROLE OF
   KLEPTOPARASITISM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Territorial female northern harriers, Circus cyaneus, often evicted species of intruding raptors larger than themselves from their territories, but never species smaller than themselves. Contrary to the hypothesis that aggressive responses serve primarily to reduce exploitative competition, responses by harriers to larger raptor species seldom occurred during hunts by these intruders. However, harriers responded frequently to larger raptor species when these species intruded while harriers  were actively hunting, supporting the hypothesis that aggressive responses serve primarily to reduce interference competition in the form of kleptoparasitism of harriers'' prey by larger raptor species. The lack of defence by harriers against smaller intruding raptor species apparently resulted from harriers'' abilities to kleptoparasitize these intruders. Hence, whether or not a territorial harrier responded agressively to an intruding raptor species depended on the size of the harrier relative  to the size of the intruder, which in turn influenced its ability to kleptoparasitize or to be kleptoparasitized.

TI TOWARDS THE MAP OF THE HOMING PIGEON
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behaviour of pigeons, Columba livia, homing from diferent sites was used to generate a geographical map based on empirical data. With the help of cluster analysis, release sites were grouped into clusters of sites according to similarities in the initial orientation of the pigeons when released. These similarities in initial orientation were assumed to reflect similarities in the information of the map component. The initial orientation of samples of pigeons was characterized by the length of the mean vector and the angular deviation of the mean vanishing direction from the home direction. According to this analysis the map information is distributed in distinct patches extending over several tens of kilometers. Exposing pigeons to air collected within one of these patches but releasing them after anaesthesia of their olfactory mucaose at a site opposite to the home loft within a different patch resulted in disorientation. This experiment, however, yielded significant differences between control and experimental pigeons within only two out of four distinct patches. This suggests that the map has an airborne component. Parts of the map, however, based on other physical cues. How these ''landmarks'' could be used for navigation even when the perception of one or the other component has been eliminated is discussed.

TI RELATIVE PITCH RECOGNITION IN WHITE-THROATED SPARROWS,
   ZONOTRICHIA-ALBICOLLIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB White-throated sparrows maintain a species-specific constant pitch interval (ratio of the higher to the lower frequency) during the pitch change between the first note (phrase 1) and the remaining notes (phrase 2) of ascending song. The interval may be an important source of relative pitch information about pitch change and thus, species identity over the broad absolute pitch range of white-throated sparrow songs. This study assessed the contribution of pitch interval perception, while controlling the absolute pitch of the notes. Using one phrase from each of four birds (A, B, C and D), two songs (AB and CD) with normal pitch intervals were created, such that phrases B and C were at the same absolute pitch. These same phrases were used to construct a third song with a reduced interval (CB) and a fourth song with an increased interval (AD). In playback tests, songs with normal pitch intervals elicited significantly more approach and song responses than songs with either  reduced or increased intervals. The results suggest that white-throated sparrows are sensitive to the relative pitch features in conspecific song, independent of the absolute pitches of the song phrases.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Detailed observation of 60 individually labelled young workers of the ponerine ant Ectatomma tuberculatum during the first 45 days after emergence indicated that behavioural specializations appear progressively according to an individual''s age. A comparison of control ants and isolated young workers, deprived of early social contact for a fixed interval at different post-emergence ages, revealed the existence of a sensitive period during which social stimuli affect the establishment of behaviour related to brood care. This sensitive period may involve two phases: a ''permissive'' period, during the first 2 days of social contact, and a ''stabilization'' period, during the subsequent 2 days.

TI DECEPTIVE COMMUNICATION IN ASYMMETRIC FIGHTS OF THE STOMATOPOD
   CRUSTACEAN GONODACTYLUS-BREDINI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When fighting for ownership of cavities, newly moulted stomatopods, Gonodactylus bredini, bluffed opponents by producing meral spread threat displays, even though their soft condition prevented them from delivering or withstanding blows. Newly moulted stomatopods adjusted the frequency of bluffing according to the relative size of their opponent, apparently in response to the risk of probing. Newly moulted residents were more likely to threaten and less likely to flee when facing intruders  that were 15% smaller than when facing intruders that were the same size or 15% larger. Bluffs by residents inhibited escalation by intruders and increased the probability of successful cavity defence. This effect was strongest when the intruder was smaller than the resident. When stomatopods fought twice in the laboratory, they often modified their fighting behaviour according to the nature of their first encounter. However, no evidence was found that intruders developed scepticism towards the  meral spread threat display after successfully evicting a bluffing resident. Furthermore, newly moulted animals did not decrease their use of the bluff following unsuccessful attempts to deter intruders.

TI ARE DIFFERENCES IN SONG RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSORTATIVE MATING BETWEEN
   SUBSPECIES OF THE GRASSHOPPER CHORTHIPPUS-PARALLELUS (ORTHOPTERA,
   ACRIDIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Chorthippus parallelus parallelus and C. p. erythropus mate assortatively in the laboratory. Previously it had been assumed that differences in the songs of the males would be responsible for this assortment. However, in the present study, C. p. erythropus females continued to mate assortatively, and readily, with males that had been made dumb by the removal of their wings. Furthermore, this assortment broke down, and matings occurred less readily, following the removal of the antennae  of both sexes. With C. p. parallelus the converse applied, i.e. assortment continued after the antennae were removed and mating occurred less readily in the absence of song. This implies that a substantial degree of differentiation (a change in the main channel of communication) has occurred between the mate recognition systems of these subspecies without leading to speciation.

TI SPLITTING BEHAVIOR INTO BOUTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When considering splitting behaviour into bouts, it is best to display the data in log frequency rather than in log survivorship plots. While the latter has the advantage of simplicity, the former has the advantage that the data points are independent of each other, so that a non-linear curve-fitting procedure, such as NLIN in SAS, can be applied. Traditional analysis of variance can then be used to decide whether the behavioural events are split into bouts, and least-squares estimates and  standard errors can be calculated for each parameter of the fitted model. These estimates can be used in Slater and Lester''s (1982 Behaviour, 79, 153-161) formula to calculate the best criterion interval to use in splitting behaviour into bouts. Average bout length and number of bouts are, however, best estimated directly from the model''s parameters.

TI PARENTAL CARE IN AN UNUSUAL ENVIRONMENT - METOPAULIAS-DEPRESSUS
   (DECAPODA, GRAPSIDAE), A CRAB THAT LIVES IN EPIPHYTIC BROMELIADS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The adaptive value of parental care was studied in the Jamaican bromeliad crab Metopaulias depressus which passes its entire life-cycle in epiphytic bromeliads. For breeding, females choose large plants with above median water volumes. Larvae are released into a nursery axil water reservoir and pass through an abbreviated development (9-10 days). The young crabs remain in the nursery and are tended for about 8 weeks. Maternal care consists of three major behavioural components. (1) Females  create a nursery by clearing a leaf axil of all leaf litter and organic debris except for snail shells, which are retained. These manipulations in the nursery may improve the dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide balance of the axil water, and change the pH from acid to neutral. (2) Breeding females defend the young in the nursery against predators, mainly damselfly nymphs and spiders. (3) Mothers feed their young with prey (snails, millipedes) caught on the bromeliad and carried into the nursery. In a field experiment orphaned broods suffered significantly greater mortality, grew more slowly and gained less weight than mothered broods. Hence, parental care significantly benefits the female''s fitness by increasing offspring survival and growth. Delayed dispersal of young crabs results in the formation of family groups, consisting of a mother with her offspring from several different breeding seasons. Metopaulias depressus is the first decapod known to prepare a nest structure, to defend and feed its young and to live in family groups.

TI HOW ANIMALS USE THEIR ENVIRONMENT - A NEW LOOK AT KINESIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The aim of this paper is to show how animals can orient themselves in relation to a stimulation gradient or exploit patchy environments using simple kinetic mechanisms. From a new look at klinokinesis and orthokinesis, the properties of these two mechanisms were determined and their respective contributions to the phenomenon of animal aggregation in the most suitable areas of the environment were specified. When movement regulation is a function of variations in the stimulus intensity, klinokinesis can be seen as an elementary spatial orientation mechanism, whereas orthokinesis seems to have no biological application. In contrast, when movements regulation is a function of the value of stimulus intensity, klinokinesis and orthokinesis can both be seen as elementary space-use mechanisms. Some examples of applications of the models are given. In particular, it is suggested how klinokinetic and orthokinetic models can formalize the ''area-restricted'' searching behaviour exhibited by many foraging animals. Finally, the place of klinokinetic and orthokinetic mechanisms in the framework of a general theory of spatial orientation and space use in animals is discussed.

TI KIN RECOGNITION AND MATE CHOICE IN MICE - FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF MATING
   WITH KIN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Breeding pairs of full sibling, half-sibling, first cousin, second cousin and unrelated CFLP laboratory mice were established and allowed to produce litters. The degree of relatedness between parents had a significant effect on both liter size (number of pups) and aggressiveness of male offspring, with litters of less closely related parents being larger at birth and post-weaning, and the male offspring of second cousins showing the highest frequency of aggressive behaviour. There was no effect of parental relatedness on pup morality, weight, growth rate or (male) competitive rank but rank among male offspring was significantly correlated with body weight. Previously reported sex differences in kin preference during intersexual interactions are interpreted in the light of these results.

TI A MUTANT STRAIN IN DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER THAT IS DEFECTIVE IN
   COURTSHIP BEHAVIORAL CUES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experience-dependent modification of courtship behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster has been previously reported; males that have courted fertilized females thereafter avoid courtship with virgin females for 2-3 h. We report that this modification is dependent upon a behavioural interaction between a courting male and fertilized female. Behavioural comparisons of males of the mutant strain Don Giovanni (dg) and normal males imply that fertilized females release a conditioning cue in response  to male courtship. (1) The normal behaviour modifying capacity of fertilized females is dependent upon copulation. Females fertilized by dg do not effectively modify male courtship. (2) dg males are deficient in causing fertilized females to release a conditioning cue; fertilized females which are courted by dg males do not induce modification of behaviour. (3) The behaviour of dg males can be modified if the fertilized females they court have been first courted by normal males. These defects  were mapped to the y-cv interval of the X-chromosome.

TI KIN RECOGNITION IN THE ANT RHYTIDOPONERA-CONFUSA .2. GESTALT ODOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two models have been proposed for the transfer of genetically determined colony odour pheromones in social insects. The ''Gestalt'' model suggests a complete transfer of pheromones amongst all nestmates whereas the ''Individualistic'' model suggests no significant odour transfer with nestmates bearing individually distinct odours. In experiments with the ant Rhytidoponera confusa, colonies showed significantly more aggression (12% aggression) towards nestmates that had been kept in cages with  non-nestmates than they did to nestmate controls (0% aggression). Colonies also showed significantly less aggression against non-nestmates that had been kept with nestmates in a separate cage (84% aggression) than they did to non-nestmate controls (100% aggression). A second experiment indicated that workers can absorb colony-specific odours from the nest materials of other colonies. However, whilst both experiments indicated a partial Gestalt component to the colony odour (ca. 28%), the  Individualistic component seemed to be more important (ca. 72%).

TI FOOD SHORTAGE INFLUENCES SIBLING AGGRESSION IN THE BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, the first-hatched chick sometimes eliminates its brood-mate in the first few weeks, when food is short. To test the hypothesis (based on descriptive data) that sibling aggression increases with food deprivation and intensifies when the senior chick''s weight is 20-25% below potential, both chicks'' necks were taped to inhibit ingestion and behaviour was compared with controls. Under deprivation, pecking increased, rising steeply when seniors were at roughly the proposed weight threshold; begging increased, with seniors possibly suppressing begging of juniors; and in young broods (less than 6 weeks old) the senior chick''s feeding advantage increased from 37 to 57% more attempted parental feeds than its sibling during deprivation. Pecking rates were more than three times higher in young broods than in old broods, where differential feeding was absent, and the effect of food deprivation on pecking increased with age in the first 6 weeks and subsequently declined with age. These age-related changes may be partly due to developmental improvement in walking ability, enabling older juniors to evade aggression. When deprivation ended, pecking, begging and feeding tended to return to baseline values, implying a reversible mechanism. The aggressive tendency of the senior chick appears to be influenced by the amount of food delivered to the brood, an effect possibly mediated by the chick''s nutritional condition or hunger.

TI INTERSPECIFIC ASSOCIATIONS OF DIANA MONKEYS, CERCOPITHECUS-DIANA, IN
   SIERRA-LEONE, WEST-AFRICA - BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OR CHANCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The advantages of interspecific associations are invoked frequently without first testing the null hypotheses: (1) observed associations occur by chance, and (2) when associations do occur, the organism''s behaviour is unaffected. During a study of two groups of Diana monkeys on Tiwai Island, Sierra Leone, the duration and frequency of interspecific associations were recorded along with behavioural and ecological data. Interspecific associations occurred in 36.6% of the samples from one group and 89.5% of the samples from the other. Predicted values of association based on null hypothesis 1 were generated using both Waser''s gas model and computer simulation based on species density and group spread. For interspecific associations of Diana monkeys with the six other species of forest monkeys resident on Tiwai Island, only associations with olive colobus, Procolobus vesus, could not be accounted for by random events (i.e. exceeded null model predictions). For both study groups, associations were non-random with respect to their range use. The frequency of different behavioural categories of Diana monkeys was not independent of association status, but both varied with time of day. No significant relationship between interspecific association and behaviour was found for either study group, when controlling for time of day. The effects of random processes must be considered before biological significance is attributed to interspecific associations.

TI LATE SPRING ARRIVAL AND DULL NUPTIAL PLUMAGE - AGGRESSION AVOIDANCE BY
   YEARLING MALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The hypothesis that a late spring arrival and a dull nuptial plumage can aid yearling male passerines in avoiding aggression from territorial adult males was tested. Adult male black-headed grosbeaks, Pheucticus melanocephalus, were presented with three types of conspecific models: (1) adult male, (2) yearling male with bright plumage, and (3) yearling male with dull plumage. Models were associated with a song playback and were presented at (1) the time of adult male arrival and territory establishment, and (2) 2 weeks later at the time of yearling arrival and settlement. Test males were more aggressive toward all model types during early presentations than during late presentations. In addition, adult models elicited more aggression from territorial males than bright yearling models, which elicited more aggresion than dull yearling models. The hypothesis that a large spring arrival may be due to energetic constaints imposed on the winter grounds was also addressed by comparing the arrival chronology of yearling males at two sites 25 km apart and separated by 550 m of elevation. Yearling male grosbeaks arrived at the high elevation site 8 days later than they arrived at the lowland site. It seems unlikely that the 8-day delay was caused by insufficient energy to travel only 25 km. These observations support the hypothesis that both a dull nuptial plumage and a late spring arrival aid yearling males in avoiding adult aggression. They are not in accord with the hypothesis that late spring arrival is due to constraints on the wintering grounds that prevent yearling males from migrating as early as adult males.

TI THE TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF MATING IN INSECTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Review
AB This paper tests for a relation between the frequency of mating in female insects and when mating takes place in the female''s life. Published evidence of about 180 species are assembled; these are reduced, by cladistic inference, to 25 probable independent trails of a comparative hypothesis that the timing and frequency of mating are related. The evidence supports the hypothesis: mating in monandrous species tends to take place immediately after the female emerges as an adult, but it tends to  take place after a period of maturation in polyandrous species.

TI MATE CONFLICT AND MALE-BEHAVIOR IN A SOLITARY WASP, TRYPOXYLON
   (TRYPARGILUM) POLITUM (HYMENOPTERA, SPHECIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Among Hymenoptera there is an evolutionary or genetical conflict of interest between males and females over the sex of their offspring. Since males develop from unfertilized eggs, they are not related to their mates'' sons. In most species there are few opportunities for males to interact with females, but in the pipe-organ mud-daubing wasp, Trypoxylon politum, and a few other species, males guard females'' nests during provisioning. They chase away parasites and ants and defend their position from conspecific males. Just prior to oviposition, males engage in an unusual sequence, repeatedly holding, pulling and copulating with the female. Despite the fact that males spend days sitting in nests, females lay large numbers of unfertilized, male eggs. The results suggest that males do not influence female sex-allocation decisions directly nor do they choose nests destined to contain daughters. However, females provide daughters with more food and a male guard may indirectly enhance the chance that the female will lay a fertilized egg through his effect on female provisioning efficacy. Comparisons with other species sugest that nest guarding evolved as a mating strategy and secondarily acquired a defensive function.

TI SEXUAL SELECTION FOR SPATIAL-LEARNING ABILITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sex differences in spatial learning have been thought to be universal among mammals, but their adaptive significance has been neglected. Spatial-learning skills are hypothesized to evolve in proportion to nagivational demands, and it is predicted that sex differences in spatial ability will evolve only in species where range expansion contributes differentially to the reproductive success of males and females. This prediction was tested via field studies of ranging behaviour and laboratory studies of spatial ability in two congeneric rodent species whose mating systems differ. Radiotelemetric studies showed that, in a polygynous species (meadows voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus), males expanded their ranges only during the breeding season and only when they attained full reproductive status. Females showed neither response. This suggests that range expansion was a male reproductive tactic. In contrast, a monogamous congener (prairie voles, M. ochrogaster) showed no sex differences in ranging, regardless of reproductive status. This probably reflects the relative inability of monogamous males and females to benefit from increased exposure to members of the opposite sex. When subsequently tested in a series of seven symmetrical mazes, subjects from the field studies exhibited the predicted sex-by-species patterns of spatial ability: only meadow voles showed consistent male superiority on these spatial tasks.

TI ANTI-SOCIAL AND SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR OF ADOLESCENT YELLOW-RUMPED CACIQUES
   (ICTERINAE, CACICUS-CELA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In an individually marked population in southeastern Peru, males and females of the polygynous, colonial yellow-rumped cacique delayed successful breeding until they were 3 years old. Adolescent (2-year-old) females competed for nest sites, built nests, laid fertile eggs, incubated, and sometimes fed nestlings, but always abandoned nests before they fledged young. Females that completed nests during their adolescent years were also more successful in establishing nest sites the following year. Adolescent females that failed to establish nest sites and those that lost nests to predators tended to leave the study area altogether. By attempting to nest early, adolescent females may facilitate future nesting attempts by forming coalitions with other females and assessing nest site quality in an area. Adolescent males, on the other hand, avoided aggressive interactions with other males, but were very aggressive towards adult females and fledglings. Adolescent males attacked females in  nests, chased females to and from the colony, pecked and mounted recent fledglings, and, rarely, pulled nestlings out of nests. This harassment resulted in the death of nestlings and fledglings and was energetically costly to females, which often fought adolescent males while defending their young. Adolescent males preferentially harassed nestling-feeding females, avoided egg-laying females and were never observed attempting to mate with females. Adult males rarely interfered during any of  these interactions. Such anti-social behaviour may function as a way of practicing adult behaviour, as a means of eliminating future competitors, or may be an epiphenomenon of rising hormone levels and therefore of no adaptive significance.

TI EVIDENCE AGAINST THE CONTINUITY VERSATILITY RELATIONSHIP IN BIRD SONG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A relationship between the continuity and versatility with which birds sing appears to be accepted in the literature. Several authors have predicted such a trend on the basis that relatively continuous singing would lead to the listener''s habituation, unless successive songs were different. In this paper a series of tests involving both within- and between-species comparisons of New World warblers (Praulinae) were performed, but these tests produced no consistent evidence for the predicted  relationship. Futhermore, re-analyses of other work showed that some previous claims of support are unreliable. Thus these new data, and the re-examination of previous work, suggest that a relationship between continuity and versatility should be considered neither general nor predictable.

TI CALLERS AND SATELLITES IN THE NATTERJACK TOAD - EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE
   DECISION RULES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male natterjack toads, Bufo calamita, sometimes called to attract females and sometimes behaved as silent satellites, attempting to intercept females attracted by callers. Small males with low intensity calls most frequently adopted the satellite tactic and preferred to parasitize the loudest callers. Because body size and call intensity were highly correlated with male mating success, small males with weak calls were at a reproductive disadvantage, and probably achieved greater success by  exploiting the displays of larger, louder males than by calling themselves. The behaviour adopted by individual males in a given situation was predicted by a game theory model which assumed that males used an evolutionarily stable decision rule when choosing between alternative mating tactics. However, the model provided close agreement with observed behaviour only when it assumed that males have imperfect information about the behaviour of competitors. It is concluded that male toads adopt a  conditional strategy which depends on their attractiveness to females. By switching between mating tactics appropriately, males maximized expected mating success within the constraint of the information available to them. The decision rule of the model qualitatively corresponds to a proximate mechanism that males appeared to use when switching between tactics. The model offers insights into the behavour of other species in which males display in groups to attract females.

AB The relative degree to which size and prior residence in one female prawn, Palaemon elegans, contributed to success in forcing other females to flee was determined. When pairs of prawns were placed in isolated test aquaria, larger prawns easily displaced smaller ones and residents repelled newcomers. Stalemates were most frequent and the struggles more likely to escalate where the contestants were similar in both respects. Prior residence was less important than greater size in conferring success.

TI TIME CONSTRAINTS AND PREY SELECTION IN COMMON SHREWS SOREX-ARANEUS L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Any decision an animal makes about a course of action costs time so that time itself can be regarded as a constraint on the options open to the animal at any moment. Using common shrews, Sorex araneus L, searching for two types of prey (profitable and unprofitable) on a grid, some of the predictions of a model proposed by Lucas (1985) to take account of the effect of time constraints on diet selection were tested. The predictions of the model as it applies to bouts in which a predator can  take several prey items and for which the duration is known to the predator in advance of foraging were partly supported. Shrews were unselective during short (3- and 6-min) bouts but selective during long (9-min) bouts. Selectivity increased towards the middle of 9-min bouts but remained low throughout 3- nd 6-min bouts. In contrast to the predictions of classical optimal foraging theory, but in keeping with those of Lucas'' (1985) time constraint model for known-time, multi-prey bouts, prey selection was influenced by encounter rates with both types of prey. In all three bout lengths, the proportion of both types of prey taken on encounter decreased with time into a bout. However, there was no evidence that selectivity decreased towards the end of a bout as a function of time remaining as predicted by the model. Discriminant function analysis suggested that variables related to current intake during a bout, rather than the amount of time left, determined whether or not prey were taken on encounter. The results are interpreted in terms of satiation and changing behavioural priorities with time into a bout.

TI MATE DESERTION AND REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT IN THE SNAIL KITE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Trivers'' (1972) mate desertion model was tested by relating measures of reproductive effort for snail kites, Rostrhamus sociabilis, to the sex of the deserting parent. Deserters incubated, brooded and chased potential predators as frequently as did non-deserting mates. Only provisioning of nestlings differed significantly between deserters and their mates, correctly predicting which individual deserted at all nests. Reduced feeding by deserters became established within the first 2 weeks  after hatching. Cluster analysis sorted three of four nests deserted by males into one cluster and the other male-deserted nest, which was deserted later in the nesting cycle than all others, clustered with non-clustering nests. Daily energy expenditure was measured throughout the nesting cycle to estimate reproductive effort: at three of four nests, deserters expended less energy than their mates prior to desertion, but in one case, cumulative energy investments did not predict which mate  should have deserted. Differences in reproductive effort between mates may have predicted which mate deserted becasue (1) cumulative reproductive effort is a good indicator of the costs and benefits of desertion, and (2) deserters may assess the potential for deserting by testing their mate''s abilities to care for the young. The influence of other factors affecting the costs and benefits of mate desertion decisions by snail kite parents is also discussed.

TI INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOR AND THEIR STATISTICAL CONSEQUENCES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Some elementary points concerning the statistical consequences of individual differences in behaviour are discussed. Various ways are suggested of taking individual differences into account when designing experiments. True individual differences are represented by the within-group variability that remains after the effects of measurement error have been excluded. Thus, mere variability in data does not necessarily demonstrate that true individual differences are present. Individual differences  have two important effects. First, statistical power is reduced, which means that true effects are more difficult to detect. Second, statements about groups may be untrue for all individuals in the group and, conversely, group characteristics may be difficult to infer from measurements of individuals. Some simple tactics for coping with individual differences in experimental data are outlined: (1) obtaining repeated outcome scores for each subject; (2) obtaining a baseline score for each  subject prior to the experimental treatment; (3) a combination of 1 and 2; and (4) using a longitudinal design, i.e. obtaining a series of scores across time for each subject. Each of these tactics also has the merit of providing additional information about the nature of the response to the treatment. A fifth tactic is to increase the sample size. Finally, some possible disadvantages of a sixth tactic, that of matching experimental and control subjects, are pointed out.

TI THE EVOLUTION OF LEKS THROUGH FEMALE CHOICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It is generally acknowledged that female preferences for mating in large groups of displaying males could cause the evolution of leks. Recent hypotheses differ on what selective advantage would accrue to females with such preferences, but they agree on the need for some such advantage if these preferences are to select for larger lek sizes. A model developed here, adapted from models of female preferences for individual male traits, shows that female preferences for larger leks can evolve and be maintained without any direct selective advantage. Like the individual choice models, it also demonstrates a number of arbitrary or non-adaptive features inherent in such systems. Most notably, instead of a single optimal outcome, there may exist a curve of possible equilibria. These equilibria can be stable or unstable depending on the nature of the female preferences.

TI QUEEN AGGRESSION, PLEOMETROTIC ADVANTAGE AND BROOD RAIDING IN THE ANT
   VEROMESSOR-PERGANDEI (HYMENOPTERA, FORMICIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Co-founding Veromessor pergandei queens tended brood equally throughout colony foundation. With the appearance of foragers, however, queens began to fight, resulting in an increase in queen death rate. Worker aggression towards queens occurred only after queen fighting began and was directed only to queens damaged during fights. Starting V. pergandei colonies raided brood from nearby nests; workers exhibited nest fidelity during such raids. Colonies started by multiple queens opened 9 days  earlier than those started by single queens and were more successful at brood raiding. Queens and workers of defeated, brood-raided colonies abandoned their nests and joined/invaded victor nests. Brood raiding in this and similar species may be a consequence of territoriality and the clumped distribution of starting nests. Colony foundation by multiple queens, pleometrosis, may be an evolutionary response to brood raiding.

TI SCROUNGING PREVENTS CULTURAL TRANSMISSION OF FOOD-FINDING BEHAVIOR IN
   PIGEONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Living in groups should promote the cultural transmission of a novel behaviour because opportunities for observing knowledgeable individuals are likely to be more numerous in this condition. However, in this study pigeons who shared the food discoveries of others (scroungers) did not learn the food-finding technique used by the discoverers (producers). Individually-caged pigeons prevented from scrounging easily learned the technique from a conspecific tutor. When caged pigeons obtained food from the tutor''s performance, most naive observers failed to learn. In a flock, scroungers selectively followed producers. In individual cages, scrounging during the tutor''s demonstration was equivalent to getting no demonstration at all. This effect of scrounging did not interfere with subsequent acquisition of the food-finding behaviour when scrounging was no longer possible.

TI PREDATOR PREY INTERACTIONS AMONG FISH AND LARVAL AMPHIBIANS - USE OF
   CHEMICAL CUES TO DETECT PREDATORY FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Gravitational flow-through systems were used to determine whether larvae of two-lined salamanders, Eurycea bislineata, and Cope''s grey treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, use chemical cues to detect predatory fish. Eurycea larvae were attracted to water conditioned with food, showed no response to water conditioned with green frog, Rana clamitans, tadpoles, and avoided water conditioned with a dangerous predator, the green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus. Hyla tadpoles exposed to water conditioned with green sunfish spent significantly more time in refuges than did controls exposed only to water. In a comparable experiment performed at a natural breeding site, Hyla tadpoles significantly increased refuge use when exposed to water conditioned with fish. These data suggest that amphibian larvae use chemical cues in their natural habitats to minimize predation risk from fish.

TI OLFACTORY DISCRIMINATION OF PLANT VOLATILES BY THE EUROPEAN STARLING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Passerine species that re-use nest sites often incorporate fresh green vegetation into their nests, a behaviour consistent with the possibility that some birds may use chemical properties of plants to counteract the selective potential of parasites and pathogens. We tested adult starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) for their physiological capacity and behavioural ability to detect and discriminate between volatiles emitted from plant material. Multi-unit electrophysiological recordings from olfactory  nerves of adults indicated that strong responses were reliably elicited by volatiles from six plant species. After pairings of plant volatiles with gastro-intestinal malaise, birds exhibited conditioned avoidance in behavioural experiments, and made all possible pairwise discriminations between volatiles of the various plant species. Bilateral olfactory nerve cuts prior to conditioning abolished the ability to acquire avoidance, suggesting that olfactory cues mediated the response to plant species. These and previous results suggest that starlings use volatile cues to discriminate and choose between plants used in nest construction.

TI JUVENILE HELPING IN THE MOORHEN, GALLINULA-CHLOROPUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a 3-year study of the moorhen, Gallinula chloropus, some chicks from first broods stayed on their natal territory once they had reached independence, and helped to rear their younger, second brood, siblings. Juvenile dispersal was constrained by habitat saturation, and first brood young were forced to stay on their natal territory. Juveniles that hatched early in the year were forced to stay longer, and helped more than those that hatched late. The total feeding rates to broods with and  without juvenile helpers were the same, but parents with helpers induced their feeding rates relative to parents without helpers. Pairs with helpers (= pairs attempting second broods) reared more chicks per nesting attempt than pairs rearing chicks at the same time of year without helpers (= pairs attempting first clutch renests). This was true both for all clutches, and for hatched clutches only, even when controlling for parental quality, territory size and seasonal effects.

TI SHARED AND UNSHARED PARENTAL INVESTMENT, PARENT OFFSPRING CONFLICT AND
   BROOD SIZE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Taking as our starting point Trivers'' (1974) account of parent-offspring conflict, we develop models of the influence of brood size on the optimal level of parental investment (PI) in the whole brood for parent and offspring, and on the magnitude of conflict between them. A modification of Trivers'' model is proposed. In general, the benefit of an act of PI to an offspring in a brood of size N is (N + 1)/N times the benefit to its parent. Therefore as brood size increases, offspring benefit approaches parental benefit, and this is because an increasing proportion of the offspring''s benefit is being gained through siblings, to which offspring and parent are equally related. A distinction is drawn between ''shared'' and ''unshared'' types of PI. When PI is shared the total benefit accruing is not directly gained by all offspring but is shared amongst them (e.g. food brought to the young). In contrast, unshared PI can simultaneously benefit some or all of the brood (e.g. types of anti-predator defence). For shared investment, PI and conflict are predicted to increase with blood size. Two models of unshared anti-predator defence are described. If the predator characteristically takes the whole brood when it strikes (e.g. altricial nestlings) PI is predicted to increase and conflict decline with brood size, although this effect is inhibited or even reversed for high risk defence tactics because of the higher cost to larger broods if the parent dies. When the predator takes a single  offspring (e.g. precocial birds) the parent''s optimum PI is independent of brood size, the offspring''s optimum PI declines in larger broods and conflict again declines with brood size. The parent is commonly expected to win the conflict over anti-predator care. Predictions concerning PI levels gain support from existing data, largely for birds, but evaluation of those for conflict must await the collection of new data. The distinction between shared and unshared investment is applicable to  altruistic behaviour in general.

TI SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR, FORAGING EFFICIENCY AND HABITAT UTILIZATION IN A GROUP
   OF TROPICAL HERBIVOROUS FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In this study schooling and solitary behaviour in a group of tropical herbivorous fish were compared. Three species of acanthurids are common herbivores on the coral reef off the coast of Belize, Central America. In the high spur and groove habitat, individuals of all three species of fish were seen exhibiting both solitary and schooling behaviour. Individuals commonly moved in and out of schools. Solitary fish foraged primarily in the groove microhabitat and received attacks more frequently from territorial herbivorous competitors (promacentrids). The schooling fish foraged more frequently in the spur microhabitat and in pomacentrid territories, but received fewer attacks from territorial pomacentrids. Paired-choice feeding trials indicated that the algal turfs from the spur microhabitat were greatly preferred. Solitary individuals also visited cleaning stations more frequently. At cleaning stations, juvenile labrids removed trematodes from the acanthurid''s skin. The mixed-species schooling appears to be a means by which acanthurids can forage in a microhabitat on a preferred resource while circumventing the territoriality of a herbivorous competitor. The solitary behaviour allows individuals to visit cleaning stations more frequently.

TI IDENTIFICATION OF PATERNAL HALF-SIBLINGS BY CAPTIVE BELDING
   GROUND-SQUIRRELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability of yearling Belding''s ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) to discriminate their familiar (reared together) siblings, unfamiliar (reared apart) paternal half-siblings, and unfamiliar unrelated conspecifics was investigated. During paired-encounter tests in an arena, pairs composed of siblings were significantly less agonistic than pairs composed of half-siblings or unrelated ground squirrels, regardless of the sex of the interactants. In turn, pairs composed of half-siblings  were less agonistic than those composed of unrelated individuals, but differences were significant only for female-female pairs (half-sisters compared with unrelated females), not male-male or male-female pairs. Thus, Belding''s ground squirrels distinguished familiar (siblings) from unfamiliar conspecifics (paternal half-siblings and unrelated animals). In addition, females distinguished their paternal half-sisters from unrelated females, a discrimination that cannot be explained by the simple ''familiarity'' which results from being reared together, since paternal half-sisters did not associate with each other pre- or post-natally. The sophisticated discriminations made by females in captivity parallel the social favouritism directed toward some categories of closely related females (but not males) in the field, although the spatial and temporal coexistence of free-living paternal half-sisters and their social relations have not yet been described.

   MICROTUS-PENNSYLVANICUS, THE PINE VOLE MICROTUS-PINETORUM AND THE
   PRAIRIE VOLE MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Paternal care in microtines has been studied infrequently and few studies have compared patterns of direct and indirect paternal investment. The paternal behaviour of three vole species, the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), the pine vole (M. pinetorum) and the prairie vole (M. ochrogaster) was examined in a semi-natural setting. Prairie and pine voles were found to exhibit high levels of paternal care. Prairie vole males contributed the most direct care by remaining in the natal nest for long periods of time in contact with the pups. Pine voles contributed less direct care than prairie voles as they spent less time in the natal nest with their offspring. In addition, both prairie and pine vole males were observed to groom their pups and retrieve them back to the nest area. Prairie vole males also engaged in such indirect forms of care as nest construction and maintenance, while pine voles provided indirect care in the form of tunnel construction and food catching.  Meadow vole males were the least paternal of the three species and rarely engaged in either direct or indirect care. These findings support predications that M. pennsylvanicus is promiscuous and that male and female meadow voles occupy separate territories. They are also consistent with studies which indicate that prairie and pine voles are monogamous and have a structured social organization with members interacting closely with one another.

TI INFANTILE BEHAVIORAL REACTIVITY TO ESTROUS CHEMOSTIMULI IN NORWAY RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Probing, a pre-attachment component of rat suckling behaviour, is normally elicited by odours found on the dam''s nipples. These odours are structurally similar to odours implicated as adult sexual signals. We investigated the origins of behaviour reactivity to female sexual chemosignals, as expressed by the probing of infant Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) to various non-maternal stimuli, including sexually-receptive and non-receptive females. The ontogeny and plasticity of differential  reactivity were examined in four experiments. Experiment 1 demonstrated that pups at 3, 7 and 10 days of age were more likely to probe into oestrus females than into either dioestrous or ovariectomized females, males, or a clean towel. Furthermore, this bias became extreme by day 10 when pups limited their probing almost exclusively to oestrous females. In addition, whereas 3- and 7-day-old rats probed relatively indiscriminately, 10-day-olds focused their probing into the oestrous female''s nipple and vaginal regions. We found responsiveness to oestrous females to be under chemosensory control, as ineffective stimuli often came to elicit probing after contact with effective stimuli (experiment 2). The bias toward oestrous chemostimuli is not initially dependent on postnatal experience with the dam, as newborns delivered by Caesearan section probed only into oestrous females (experiment 3). Finally, by day 10, selective reactivity is dependent on suckling experience; pups reared  with dams whose nipples and vaginas were scented daily with citral only rarely probed into oestrus females at day 10, but probed readily if the oestrous females were citral-scented (experiment 4).

TI WHEN FORAGERS DISCOUNT THE FUTURE - CONSTRAINT OR ADAPTATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Foraging currencies based on average rates of energy gain often fail to predict observed behaviour when an animal must choose between a smaller, more immediate reward and a larger, more delayed reward. We review experiments demonstrating that a forager''s choice may depend on the ratio of reward sizes, the difference in pursuit times, and the magnitude of the average pursuit time. The most telling result is that of Green et al. (1981), who showed that forager''s prefer the smaller, more immediate reward when both pursuit times are relatively small, but they perfer the larger, more delayed reward when both pursuit times are relatively large. This paper proposes a new theoretical explantation by modifying a standard economic model for discounting future rewards. Our model of a variable time bias specification can explain the observed, temporally inconsistent preferences. Discounting future rewards might be an adaptive response to uncertainty in an animal''s natural environment, but we cannot reject the possibility that preference for immediacy is a behavioural constraint on foraging efficiency.

TI LIFETIME MATING SUCCESS IN THE DAMSELFLY COENAGRION-PUELLA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Lifetime mating success of male azure damselflies (Coenagrion puella) was measured in a natural population. The major determinant of mating success is the number of days a male spends at the breeding site, which is mostly determined by a male''s adult lifespan. Long-lived males have a higher mating rate than short-lived males, and daily mating rate increases with age up to 6 days, then falls. Large males live longer, but have a lower daily mating ratre than small males. These effects of size  are very weak, accounting for no more than 2% of the daily variance in mating success. The only overall effect of size on lifetime mating success is that males at both extremes of the size distribution are more likely to fail to mate. Chance differences in the number of females encountered are sufficient to account for the remaining variance in mating success. The weather is also shown to have a major effect on mating success. We draw attention to the ways in which it may be misleading to draw conclusions about the action of sexual selection from studies of daily, rather than lifetime, reproductive success. We provide evidence to support the view that variance in male reproductive success is neither evidence for sexual selection, nor a measure of its intensity.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID GROUP-SIZE; PREDATION RISK; TIME BUDGETS; FLOCKING; SPARROWHAWKS;
   RESPONSES
AB Evidence from captive flocks of blue tits (P. caeruleus) suggests that following the appearance of a predator, socially dominant individuals are likely to wait until subordinate members of their flock resume feeding before doing so themselves. After a model sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) was flown over captive flocks of blue tits at a feeder, there was a significant negative correlation between sequence of return to the feeder and status within a linear dominance hierarchy. During this period, birds increased the proportion of their time budgets devoted to scanning for predators. During periods of danger, high-ranking individuals are able to be more cautious than are low-ranking individuals, possibility because their ability to control food resources reduces the energetic costs of their extra caution.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Upon the rare occasions that wild toque macaques (M. sinica) discover a large quantity of food in their natural forest environment they give distinctive calls. The durations of feeding bouts and the rates of feeding are significantly greater at sites where food calls are given than at sites of the same food types where no foods call are given. The calls designate a new location of a large quantity of any 1 of several food types. Dispersed group members hearing the call immediately run to the  site of the call and feed there. Food calls are semantic signals (or symbols) that evoke the same response (rapid direct approach) as seeing the external referent of the calls (a source of abundant food) itself would. Food calls convey information about the presence of an edible food source, its quantity and location in the environment. Food calls appear to be related to, but are distinct from, contact calls which function to maintain group cohesion.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB The hissing Madagascar cockroach, G. portentosa, has a prolonged and complex courtship involving signals in several sensory modalities. Courtship was described for 13 pairs of cockroaches and the frequencies and sequencing of 16 behavioral units were analyzed. Particular attention was paid to the function and interactions of acoustic, chemical and tactile components. Posturing and sound production by males, and antennation by both males and females, seem to be important in courtship. Courtship in G. portentosa, rather than depending on a rigid sequence of behaviors determined by a series of discrete releasers, seems to be quite flexible, using behavioral monologues by both sexes as a means of achieving transitions from 1 stage of courtship to the next.

TI EFFECT OF THE ODOR OF VAGINAL SECRETION ON NON-COPULATORY BEHAVIOR OF
   MALE HAMSTERS (MESOCRICETUS-AURATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male hamsters were exposed to female vaginal secretion (in the absence of the female). When subsequently tested with females, their behavior was determined by whether the test female matched or did not match the vaginal secretion. Less time was spent with mismatching females and less sniffing and licking was directed towards them. The effect of vaginal odor was present up to 3-4 h after the last contact with the secretion. The number of encounters with the vaginal odor and the spacing between them was important in determining the response to mismatching females. Contact with the vaginal secretion as opposed to its volatile components alone was necessary for the discrimination to occur. Discussion centers around the role of the vomeronasal organ and possible physiological pathways underlying the effect.

TI THE LATERALIZATION OF FEAR BEHAVIOR IN THE MALE DOMESTIC CHICK - A
   DEVELOPMENTAL-STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male chicks (G. domesticus L.) showed an early peak for fear responses at around day 5, followed by a trough and then a marked and sudden rise from day 8 to day 10; a small peak was probably present at day 2. The main features of this complex time-course, which is confirmed both by earlier studies and by 2 independent series of experiments reported, are associated with changes in the properties of and relationship between the systems fed by right and left eyes (RES and LES). Chicks tested with 1 eye covered showed marked differences between these systems. On day 5, right/left differences in the effectiveness of red and violet lit beads in the evocation of fear responses appear to be caused by differences between RES and LES in the assessment of novelty. This in turn reflects right/left differences in the way in which visual information is categorized, which probably also affect other important features of the early development of fear behavior in the chick. Following day 5, RES  became progressively less fearful and LES somewhat more fearful up to a sharply-timed transition on day 9, which was followed by simultaneous depression of fear responses in monocular chicks and elevation in binocular chicks. Both changes can be explained by increased coupling between RES and LES at the time of transition.

TI A METHOD FOR ASSIGNING CARDINAL DOMINANCE RANKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Dominance hierarchies are widely described in nature. Commonly, an individual''s ordinal rank is used as a measure of its position in the hierarchy and its priority of access to resources. This use of ordinal ranks has several related drawbacks: it is difficult to assess the magnitude or the significance of the difference in degree of dominance between 2 individuals; it is difficult to assess the magnitude or the significance of the difference in degree of dominance between 2 individuals; it is difficult to evaluate the significance of differences between dominance matrices based on different behaviors or on the same behavior at different times and it is difficult to use parametric statistical techniques to relate dominance rank to other quantities of interest. A method for assigning cardinal dominance indices is described that does not suffer from these drawbacks. This technique is based on the Bradley-Terry model from the method of paired comparisons. This model can be reinterpreted in terms of dominance interactions and a simple iterative technique for computing cardinal ranks is described. Methods are described on how to evaluate whether the rank differences between individuals are significant and whether differences in the cardinal hierarchies based on different behaviors or the same behavior at different times are significant. How to generalize the method to deal with behaviors that sometimes have ambiguous outcomes, or behaviors for which the rank difference between a pair of individuals affects the rate of interaction between them is shown.

TI A NEW LOOK AT THE FEATURES OF MALLARD COURTSHIP DISPLAYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The courtship displays of ducks are prime examples of fixed action patterns. Early attempts to link the apparent stereotype to an exceptionally low variability in particular features, such as duration, failed, and cast doubts on the concept of stereotyped behavior. Single frame analysis of the courtship displays the mallard (Anas plathyrhynchos L.) confirms the variability of duration, but shows that other features combine to sharply delineate tracks in a conceptional feature space. The features ''height of bill-tip above waters level'' and ''height of tail-tip above water level'' are sufficient to define the most common displays of the drake (head-flic, head-shake, grunt-whistle, down-up, head-up-tail-up, bill-dip, nod-swimming) as space curves in a 2-dimensional feature space. This result supports the original claim that stereotypy is a valid feature of certain types of complex behavior.

AB Caged, isolated granivorous birds feed in frequent brief bouts from which it is difficult to define a meal. This pattern has been viewed as a fundamental difference between the feeding behavior of avians and mammals. This pattern of feeding is an artifact of the test situation. When the cost of access to food (foraging cost) is increased, chickens (Gallus gallus) exhibit the same pattern of feeding and the same functional relations between foraging cost, meal frequency and meal size as mammals.

AB Fifty movie films of house sparrows (P. domesticus) foraging on an experimental grid were analyzed. The location and orientation of each bird was recorded; sex of the individual was determined in about 2 of every 3 cases. Flock size exhibited a weak inverse relationship to ambient temperature, although aggression was rare in the experimental patch. The frequency of males in foraging groups exceeded the frequency of males in the local population. Within a given flock size, nearest neighbor distances did not differ significantly between male-male and male-female pairs. Average nearest neighbor distance was inversely related to flock size. Solitaries oriented away from safety and toward a source of disturbance. Orientation of an individual within a larger group was more variable than that of a solitary, and the orientation of nearest neighbors indicated a significant tendency to keep each other in view.

TI RELATIONSHIP OF CHIN SPOT SIZE TO DOMINANCE IN THE BLACK-CHINNED
   MOUTHBROODING CICHLID FISH (SAROTHERODON-MELANOTHERON)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Aggressive interactions of male S. melanotheron were studied to determine the communicative value of chin spot size in relation to dominance. The effects of residency and size on the aggressiveness of this fish were determined. Two-factor analysis of variance was used for frequencies of each modal action pattern for residency and size. Residency played a major role in the outcome of an agressive interaction; size had little effect. Dominance of each experimental fish was calculated using Barlow et Ballin''s (1976) dominance index. A chin spot ratio was obtained by dividing the chin spot area by the total surface area of the individual fish. Simple linear regression was conducted to determine if dominance and chin spot size were correlated and a positive linear relationship was found between the 2 variables.

AB Individuals in foraging groups of wedge-capped capuchin monkeys, C. nigrivittatus, are organized in consistent and predictable configurations. An individual''s position relative to other animals and proximity to neighbors influences its capture success (when foraging for invertebrates), access to fruiting trees and time spent in vigilance (a measure of its vulnerability to predators). The dominant male and female and animals tolerated by this female occupy the advantageous center-front positions. The positions of other animals depend on their respective age-sex classes, and are discussed relative to the risk of predation and foraging requirements of the different age-sex classes.

TI BEHAVIORAL-ASPECTS OF PREDATION BY JUVENILE ATLANTIC SALMON (SALMO-SALAR
   L) ON PARTICULATE, DRIFTING PREY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A recirculatory flume tank simulating a simplified stream environment was used to study the feeding behavior of juvenile Atlantic salmon (S. salar L.), 5.1-9.4 cm in fork length (from tip of snout to fork of tail), on artificial particulate prey passively drifting in the water current. Changes in feeding behavior at 2 different times of the year and when fish were presented with prey of different sizes are described and quantified. Responsiveness to food was greatly reduced in autumn compared to summer. The maximum distances at which prey elicited a response decreased in autumn to 40% of the summer value, and the maximum distances which fish traversed in order to capture prey decreased by 80% over the same period. During the peak growing season the response to a range of prey sizes from 0.013 to 0.102 times fish fork length was directly related to prey size and was accounted for on the basis of visual theory alone. Capture distances were closely related to fixation distances. Maximum capture distance increased to a peak value for prey of between 0.025 and 0.069 times fork length, while larger prey were never captured and the smallest prey rarely evoked a response. Prey size selectivity also operated after capture, through rejection vs. retention of the prey.

LA English
DT Article
AB Courtship behavior and songs of 6 Zaprionus spp. [Z. tuberculatus, Z. sepsoides, Z. mascariensis, Z. ghesquierei, Z. ornatus and Z. koroleu] show differences not only between species but also between sexes. Courtship behavior differs from that in the related genus Drosophila. In most species, males produce 2 song types which may alternate or be repeated. Singing occurs during courtship displays, mounting, after copulation and briefly during male-to-male interactions. Females produce a loud whine and body rocking movements in refusal but have a species-specific pulsed song produced during normal courtship which differs from the conspecific male song. One species produces an irregular male song but a regular female song. Sex-specific songs may have selective advantages but pose problems for the sensory template hypothesis.

AB Dominance in groups of 3 male mice was assessed in the following ways: the observation of attack and submissive behaviors, the counting of tail wounds, competitive access to water after deprivation, tube dominance, territorial aggression and access to female mice. Those mice assessed as dominant following behavioral observation had fewer tail wounds, fought more in the territorial aggression test and showed more interest in sexually receptive females. Correlations of the measures (and subsequent factor analysis) produced no evidence of an underlying dimension which could be labeled dominance.

TI MATING-BEHAVIOR AND MATING SUCCESS IN WOODFROGS, RANA-SYLVATICA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mating behavior of woodfrogs was investigated in a woodland pond in southeastern Michigan [USA]. Males became sexually mature 1 yr before females and outnumbered females by 5.6 to 1 at the breeding site. Males employed searching behavior to obtain mates. Yearly male mating success varied from 0-2 matings, and larger males had a greater probability of mating than smaller males. The mating season lasted less than 10 days. Most egg masses were deposited in 1 m2 of a 256 m2 pond. Experimental introduction of egg masses to the breeding site indicated that presence of eggs was sufficient to stimulate egg deposition. The influence of selection for synchronous sexual receptivity in females, communal egg deposition and delayed female sexual maturation on male mating behavior and variation in male mating success is discussed.

TI THE ESTABLISHMENT AND REVERSIBILITY OF SPECIES AFFINITIES IN DOMESTIC
   SHEEP AND GOATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The establishment and reversibility of cross-species attachments were studied in sheep and goats taken from their mothers at birth and reared in same-or cross-species pairs until 12 mo. of age. Species affinities were determined at 8-9 mo. of age by time spent proximate to stimulus herds of sheep and goats housed in separate enclosures within a larger pasture. Sheep reared with goats spent significantly more time with the stimulus goats than did controls (sheep reared with sheep). Goats reared with sheep spent a significantly greater percentage of time with the stimulus heep than did control goats. At approximately 13 mo. of age the sheep were segregated from the goats in separate pastures and were retested, as before, for species affinities after 34-90 days of exposure to conspecifics. Experimental subjects demonstrated a significant reversal of species preferences. The reversal was more complete for subjects housed for 57-90 days in same-species groups than for those tested after 34-56 days of exposure to conspecifics. Species affinities of sheep and goats are basically learned and relatively long-standing cross-species social attachments can be reversed by approximately 60-90 days of same-species cohabitation.

TI HOPKINS HOST-SELECTION IN NASONIA-VITRIPENNIS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR
   SYMPATRIC SPECIATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The operation of the Hopkins host-selection principle in the host-selection behavior of the parasitoid wasp N. vitripennis on 3 dipteran host species was tested. In order to determine whether larval conditioning influenced adult ovipositional preference, the parasitoids were reared on and then offered choices between host species in 2 pairwise combinations, Phormia regina/Phaenicia sericata and P. regina/Musca domestica. Hopkins host-selection was evident in the latter combination only. Preference for a given host is not reinforced by conditioning over several generations. The conditioning was not strong enough to serve as a primary isolating mechanism in the speciation process as suggested by Thorpe (1938, 1945), though it could be important as a secondary isolating mechanism.

TI CELESTIAL ORIENTATION BY THE LARGE YELLOW UNDERWING MOTH, NOCTUA-PRONUBA
   L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A portable semi-automatic flight monitor is described that permits continuous recording of the orientation of flying but tethered moths under field and other conditions. In light winds the compass orientation of tethered large yellow underwing moths, N. pronuba, is independent of wind direction. On moonlit nights the moon''s azimuth is used as an orientation cue. On starlit nights, in the absence of the moon, stellar orientation using stars about 95.degree. from the pole star is strongly implicated. There is no compensation for the shift of these celestial cues during the night. In a darkroom or when their eyes are painted over, N. pronuba are disorientated. A model of the mechanism of nocturnal moth migration is presented.

TI POSTNATAL EFFECTS OF PRENATAL SOUND STIMULATION IN THE GUINEA-PIG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pregnant guinea pigs were stimulated with a natural sound alien to their species. Postnatally the response of their young to this sound was compared with that of unstimulated controls. All young were tested with a series of the alien sounds followed by a series of guinea pig calls. Heart rate changes showed that prenatally stimulated young responded less to the alien sounds than did controls, while both groups responded equally to guinea pig calls. Response of controls diminished during daily test sessions and over the 5 test days and comparison with an older control group showed that this was due to repetition of the stimulus. The response of prenatally stimulated animals probably had waned before birth.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A useful methodology for judging the personality of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthi) is demonstrated. Observers rated the chimpanzees on a forced-choice rating scale which yielded measures on 8 emotion dimensions. The rating scale, Emotions Profile Index, is derived from a theory of personality which stresses the adaptive significance of emotions at all evolutionary levels. This method has theoretical generality, having been successfully applied previously to humans, baboons and dolphins. Observers were able to rate chimpanzees with reasonable reliability. Sex differences in personality were evident in this chimpanzee sample. Dominance rank correlated with certain emotion dimensions.

TI LOCOMOTION AND SHELL-RIGHTING BEHAVIOR IN ADULT AND JUVENILE
   APORRHAIS-OCCIDENTALIS (GASTROPODA STROMBACEA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Differences in behavior between adult and juvenile A. occidentalis are related to age-dependent changes in shell morphology and habitat. Juvenile snails right their shells by pulling with the propodium, and do not kick at the substratum until the expanded outer lip of the adult shell has formed. Locomotion of juveniles is by arhythmical crawling, with leaping taking place only during excape from predators. Adult snails leap during both normal and escape locomotion. The importance of the outer lip in stabilizing the shell during leaping locomotion is presented. Escape reactions of A. occidentalis are similar to, but slower than, those reported in the literature for species of stombids. Most of the basic locomotory and shell-righting behavior patterns seen in the highly specialized Strombidae are observable in the more primitive A. occidentalis. The use of the operculum in locomotion and shell righting, although characteristic of the Strombidae, is not found in A. occidentalis. The behavior of Aporrhais is discussed in relation to evolution within the superfamily Strombacea.

TI KINDS OF ACTIVITIES CORRELATED WITH SINGING PATTERNS OF YELLOW-THROATED
   VIREO
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Each of 8 male yellow-throated vireos [Vireo flavifrons] used a consistent selection of up to 8 different song forms that were constructed from a limited number of components and uttered in patterned sequences. Males observed in more than one kind of activity, e.g., patrolling boundaries, foraging away from the nest, approaching the nest, or remaining in its vicinity had consistent singing patterns peculiar to each. Most song forms of each male were shared with other males; there were numerous similarities among the males in the singing patterns correlated with different activities. Differences in their selections of song forms may have resulted largely from differences in their individual circumstances, and did not correlate with behavior in ways that were contradictory among the males.

TI DESCRIPTIVE AND FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS OF A STEREOTYPED PATTERN OF
   LOCOMOTION AFTER TARGET TRACKING IN A PREDATORY INSECT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Aeschna cyanea M. larvae react to the disappearance of a moving prey with backtracking and turning movements, the frequency and intensity of which are directly proportional to the insect''s previous tracking time. These movements also appear during a prolonged presentation of a prey, so that the insect will back and turn away from this stimulus. Backing-turning is shown in the same form and under identical conditions by larvae of the last 4 instars and therefore seems to play a consistent role in the insect''s predatory life. The occurrence of this pattern of locomotion in a variety of experimental and semi-natural situations suggested that it fulfills the following functions: to stop the larva''s unsuccessful attempts to catch a rapidly escaping prey, and to diminish the probability of further encounters with an unattainable prey after its momentary disappearance.

TI FORAGING MOVEMENTS AND HOMING IN LIMPET PATELLA-VULGATA L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In 2 populations of P. vulgata in the Isle of Man [England] foraging activity is restricted to daytime high waters, with about 75% of the population foraging on any one day. Movement commences as the tide covers the limpets, and they travel an average of 0.4 m from their home sites to which they return at least an hour before the falling tide exposes them again. The mean speed on the outward and return journey is around 0.60 cm min-1, and during the intervening browsing period about 0.08 cm min-1. This behavior contrasts with that of the same species Alderney, where foraging is limited to nocturnal low waters; there is possibly a geographical trend in behavior. P. vulgata, especially in the Isle of Man, is one of the more mobile limpets.

TI TASTE SENSITIVITY IN EMBRYO OF DOMESTIC-FOWL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two experiments were carried out to investigate the sense of taste in embryos of the domestic fowl. In the 1st, 4 taste substances, NaCl, HCl, glucose and SOA [Sucrose-octa-acetate], were diluted with distilled water and the response was compared with that to distilled water alone. No significant effects of taste were found. In the 2nd experiment 5 taste substances, HCl, fructose, NaCl, KCl and quinine, were diluted with fluids normally imbibed by the embryo:amniotic and/or allantoic fluid taken from other eggs. These solutions and distilled water were compared with egg-fluid alone. A highly significant effect of the 5 solutions was found showing that the taste system becomes functional before time of hatching. Distilled water produced an unexpectedly large response in the embryo; possible reasons for this are discussed.

   SPERMOPHILUS-COLUMBIANUS-COLUMBIANUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Field observations and films of laboratory encounters were used to describe and quantify behavior in a population of Columbian ground squirrels. Activity correlated with ambient temperature. Feeding, the most frequent behavior, decreased during mid-day; other behavioral patterns increased. Squirrels nearly always seemed alert, even during other behavioral patterns. Three of 7 vocalizations indicated alarm. Possible adult scent-marking never exceeded 1% of above-ground activity and decreased seasonally. Juvenile play was frequent; yearling play became more aggressive and was replaced by aggression by mid-season. Adult aggression rarely involved contact; aggression was most frequent during breeding and lactation among males and females, respectively. The behavior of this population was similar to that observed in other populations of the same and other sciurids. Most differences cannot be explained without ecological investigation of the other populations.

DT Article
AB The effect of extirpation of various parts of the reproductive system on the mating behavior of H. pomatia was studied. The integration of the sequence of activities in the mating behavior was not affected by any of the extirpations performed. It is concluded that the sequence is mainly controlled centrally. The simultaneousness of the performance of dart shooting behavior and the initiation of a new bout of mating activity was independent of the presence of the dart. Mating activity was decreased by mechanical stimulation of the duct of the bursa copulatrix and increased by extirpation of the digitiform glands. It is concluded that the mating behavior cycle is caused by both the mechanical effects of dart shooting and copulation.

TI BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF GULLS ATTRACTION TOWARDS PREDATORS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many species of birds and mammals are attracted towards some of their natural predators, often without overt aggression. The biological function of this predator attraction was studied in a colony of herring gulls [Larus argentatus] and lesser black-backed gulls [L. fuscus], with the aid of predator models. More birds flocked above the predator model when it was presented together with a dead gull; also the birds did not land as close to a predator with a dead gull as they did to a predator alone. Having seen a predator with a dead gull had a clear effect on the distance at which birds later avoided that particular predator on the ground when it was presented to them alone. Predator-attraction enables animals to collect information about a potential enemy; in this information the experience of conspecifics with the predator is taken into account; subsequent behavior of the animals depends partly on this information. The increase in the avoidance distance with respect to a predator with a dead bird may be an adaptation to carnivores'' habit of surplus killing.

AB Ring doves of both sexes sit on young squabs after hatching in much the same manner as they sit on eggs before hatching, but it is demonstrated that the preferred stimulus varies with the state of the animal. A simultaneous squab-egg choice test was given on days 1, 4, 10, and 13 of incubation and on the day following hatching in normal reproductive cycles of experienced and naive male and female ring doves. Naive doves were more likely than experienced doves to choose eggs throughout the cycle (P < 0.005) and, overall, eggs were more likely to be chosen during early incubation and squabs posthatching (P < 0.005).

AB The development of nesting habitat recognition and preferences in herring gull chicks was studied as a function of habitat and social stimuli. The test procedure consisted of relocating chicks 20 m from the nest and observing their movements. Results indicate that herring gull chicks exhibit a preference for the nest site area during the 1st week post-hatch, and this preference wanes after the 1st week until fledging. Chicks of all ages showed a preference for vegetation similar to that of the nest site area. Nest site preferences are ecotypically controlled. Vegetation characteristics, landmarks and the presence of other chicks were among the cues used to recognize the nest site.

AB The effects of drought periods on the behavior of a tropical lizard (A. aeneus) were measured. The number of lizards active at study sites and display frequencies varied inversely with days since fainfall. Animals that were artificially watered during a drought drank and showed an immediate recovery to prior, non-drought display levels. Rainfall records indicate that drought periods of the duration studied here are frequent in the natural habitat.

TI LEAPING AND OTHER MOVEMENTS IN SOME CARDIID BIVALVES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The movements of burrowing and of recovery from deep burial are compared for Laevicardium crassum. Cardium echinatum. and C. edule. L. crassum and C. echinatum also perform leaping movements in response to contact of a starfish with the mantle edge and these movements are also described. Burrowing in all these species involves integrated cyclic movements, in which the active stage is that of contraction of the pedal retractor muscles. Similar cyclic movements are involved in recovery from deep burial, but here the active stage is that of protraction and straightening of the foot. Leaping movements are also cyclical, the active stage again involving protraction and straightening of the foot. The 3 species differ in the timing of the various stages of the digging, recovery and leaping cycles, as well as in the number of repetitions comprised in a single period of activity and these differences are related to shell form.

TI PRIOR KILLING EXPERIENCE AND SUPPRESSIVE EFFECTS OF PUNISHMENT ON

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of punishment on mouse-killing by rats was studied in 20 rats that had only the minimum killing experience necessary to show that they were reliable killers, and 20 rats that were given more extensive killing experience before punishment. Half of the rats in each group were presented 1.0 ma shocks contingent upon killing and the others were punished with 2.0 ma shocks. After punishment the rats underwent recovery tests. Punishment suppressed killing in all 4 groups, and the experienced killers continued to kill longer after the institution of punishment and resumed killing sooner after punishment was discontinued than did relatively inexperienced killers. Neither the effect of punishment intensity nor the intensity x experience interaction was statistically significant.

TI STEREOTYPIES IN CAGED CANARIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two common repetitive stereotypes in caged canaries are described. Stereotyples were counted in 5 min. observation periods. A test series consisted of 12 of these observation periods, 1 on each of 12 successive days. Cage size, duration of confinement, and the sex of the birds were found to exert no effect on stereotypy levels. Opportunities for social interaction with other canaries did reduce stereotyping frequencies, although interaction with another species (Lonchura striata) exerted no effect. Changes in stereotypy levels can be effected by providing opportunities for alternative activity, but the development of stereotyples results from factors related to early rearing conditions.

TI MATING BEHAVIOUR OF EWES AND ITS EFFECT ON MATING EFFICIENCY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The phenomena of ram attractiveness to ewes and the migration of ewes in estrus to rams were examined in 2 experiments involving ovariectomized ewes. Ewes did not migrate to tethered rams when free rams of free aproned rams were available. The number of ewes migrating was also sharply reduced when ewes were distracted by penned rams even when these rams were out of visual contact. Migratory activity of estrous ewes was seasonal with little activity in the spring/early summer period of 2 successive years (P<0.01). Where rams were tethered, the dose-response line to estradiol benzoate (ODB) for ewes was less steep than when rams ran free with the ewes (P<0.01). Significantly fewer ewes bred with more than one ram when the rams were tethered than when they were free. No mating preferences for certain breeds were detected among either rams or ewes. The significance of these results in relation to mating management of sheep is discussed.

TI COLOUR DISCRIMINATION IN GOLDFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Goldfish were trained to discriminate between blue, green, and red painted panels, which varied greatly in brightness. The stimuli were chosen in such a way that the discriminations could not be solved in terms of brightness. All the discriminations were easily learned by the fish in spite of the large brightness differences. The results also suggest that the goldfish has a preference for blue, since the blue-green discrimination was learned significantly faster when blue was the positive stimulus than when green was the positive stimulus. The finding that green can be discriminated from both blue and red shows that color vision must be at least trichromatic in this sp.

TI SIMPLE CONDITIONING IN HONEY BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Bees trained to feed at a dish within an enclosure in the laboratory were subsequently conditioned to arrive at the dish in response to a neutral stimulus alone (simple discrimination conditioning). Stimuli used successfully as neutral cues included air movement, onset of light, and even smoke, which normally results in bees re-entering the hive. Repetition of these experiments with various controls permitted a determination of the speed of conditioning and of extinction. Some of the conditioned bees would not proceed directly to the dish but would stop on their way, expose the Nasanov gland, and apparently direct the odor from this gland back toward the hive entrance by fanning. This odor presumably served as communication to other, inexperienced, bees.

TI ANALYSIS OF BREED DIFFERENCES IN MAZE PERFORMANCE IN DOGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The subjects were 222 puppies of 5 pure breeds, tested at 13 weeks of age on a 6-unit T maze especially designed for dogs. 127 were chosen for a special statistical study. Thirteen different performance measures based on time and error scores were subjected to analysis of variance. Ten of these measures showed significant differences attributable to breeds. In general, basenjls performed better on the first day than other breeds. Beagles made the best overall performance, and sheltles the poorest. Eleven factors thought to influence performance, including size and sex as well as several variable factors in the social and physical environment, were statistically analyzed in the same way. Eight of these showed significant differences between breeds. The effect of the same "background variables" upon the maze performance scores was then studied by analysis of covarlance. All but one showed low but significant correlation with the performance variables. Some of the background variables themselves have a true hereditary basis, particularly those involving size and confidence. When the variance due to correlation wth background variables was removed, 6 of the performance variables still showed significant differences between breeds. The tendency to form or not form stereotyped habits appears to be a trait directly to the central nervous system and one little affected by background variables. Other measures of performance appear to reflect either motivational traits or patterns of behavior characteristic of the breed.

TI EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLEXITY ON STEREOTYPED BEHAVIOURS OF
   CHILDREN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six children, classified as autistic and showing marked stereotyped movements, were observed in 4 environments of increasing complexity. These environments were: empty room, empty room + box of blocks, room + blocks + passive adult, room + blocks + active adult. Stereo-typies increased with environmental complexity, except where there was intervention from the adult. Stereotypy and block-manipulation increased at the expense of body-manipulation and fixture-manipulation. It is suggested that the level of stereotypy in these Ss [subjects] is related to a chronically high level of arousal. EEG [electroencephalogram] findings are offered as supportive evidence for the latter. Stereotypies in these Ss may serve to maintain arousal within acceptable limits. The results are discussed in relation to findings from animal studies.

AB Measurements of consummatory and appetitive feeding and drinking behavior in the Barbery dove (Streptopelia risoria) indicate that thirst (a) decreases during the first 2 days of food deprivation and (b) increases above normal during recovery from food deprivation. The evidence for (a) is the rate of water intake declines during the first 2 days of food deprivation; hungry doves work no harder than satiated doves to obtain water; appetitive drinking response time is the same for hungry and satiated doves; is greater in birds deprived of food and water, than it is for birds deprived only of water. The evidence for (b) is: doves which drink more than normal on a particular day during recovery from food deprivation, tend to eat more and vice versa; birds which have food available during recovery from water deprivation drink more than birds which have no food available; the calculated water loss is greater in birds which have food available during recovery from water deprivation; birds deprived of water during the first 24 hours of recovery from food deprivation subsequently drink more than birds given normal 24 hours water deprivation; the response time for an appetitive drinking performance is less than normal during recovery from food deprivation.

However, high levels of obesity were reached. The addition of small oral incentives produced new bouts of overeating and rapid weight gain. Excessive responsiveness to highly palatable foods is not the cause of hypothalamic hyperphagia but oropharyngeal sensations determine the rate and duration of the overeating and are essential for maximum levels of obesity.

AB The visual complexity of a habitat can play a significant role in the outcome of interactions between predators and prey. We currently assume that predators should maximize their foraging success by foraging in habitats where prey are easier to detect and search times are lower. Mesopredators, however, have to detect prey (as a predator) while also avoiding detection by their own predators (as prey). The predicted trade-off between foraging success and perceived predation risk for mesopredators is likely to be affected by the visual complexity of their surroundings, although this remains to be tested. Using two immersive augmented-reality experiments, we tested whether risk aversion and foraging success of a model mesopredator (individual three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus) changed in habitats with differing visual complexity. Despite being motivated to forage, individuals consistently preferred to associate with regions of higher complexity. However, contrary to our predictions, sticklebacks also had higher foraging success in these habitats. This appeared to be driven by increases in exploration and foraging in visually complex habitats, changing their likelihood of encountering prey. Our findings highlight how environmental visual complexity alone can induce a behavioural shift in mesopredators from risk-averse behaviours to those associated with exploration and foraging, ultimately changing where and when predators choose to hunt while mitigating predicted trophic trade-offs.

AB Animal behaviour changes as individuals mature and these changes may affect not only average behaviour, but also behavioural variability within and between individuals. This could apply to escape behaviour, as behavioural variability might be particularly advantageous in predator-prey interactions, and prey individuals can adhere to different escape strategies. It is not yet known, however, if behavioural variability (unpredictability) is marked early in life, if it arises with time and how stable it is throughout ontogeny. We analysed the escape behaviour of the steppe grasshopper, Chorthippus dorsatus, using burst experiments repeated multiple times across four life stages. We quantified three aspects of escape behaviour and analysed the data using a multivariate double-hierarchical generalized linear model. Interindividual differences in average behaviour increased across life stages, resulting in an increase in population level variability. Unpredictability, however, remained relatively stable both within and across individuals. About 1.7-4.6% of the total phenotypic variance was explained by individual differences in unpredictability. Further, 2-6.5% was explained by differences between bursts of observations, such that interindividual differences in unpredictability explained a maximum of 11% of the total variance in escape behaviour at a given time. Our results indicate a stability of the unpredictability level in grasshopper escape behaviour, and that intraindividual variance in unpredictability is low, but that the overall magnitude of individual differences in escape behaviour increases with age.<br /> (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Social bonds are crucial to many animal species. To maintain these bonds, individuals must be able to differentiate the identity of conspecifics. Pair-bonding primates, in general, maintain close bonds with their selected mate. Little is known about visual preferences of pair-bonded primates. To characterize visual preference for images of familiar and unfamiliar faces, we assessed visual attention in coppery titi monkeys, Plecturocebus cupreus. Coppery titi monkeys, like many other pair-bonding species, show a behavioural partner preference when placed in a partner preference paradigm and maintain greater durations of physical proximity to their pair mate compared to an unfamiliar stranger. Using a previously validated noninvasive eye-tracking method, we investigated whether titi monkeys display visual partner preference. We presented adult titi monkeys with 10 static slides showing two conspecific faces side by side: either (1) their partner's face and a stranger's face, or (2) two strangers' faces. Face side was counterbalanced, and slide presentation order was randomized, across all subjects. We present five looking-behaviour outcome measures for a study of 40 titi monkeys. We found no evidence of a visual preference for still photographs of one's pair mate, but we did find that age, pair tenure and parenting experience predicted looking behaviour. Animals with longer pair tenures spent more time looking at facial images. Younger animals looked at the screen for the first time faster, spent less time looking and looked fewer times at the stimuli compared to older animals. Parenting status positively predicted fixation count, total visit duration and visit count, such that parents with more experience looked at the stimuli longer and more times than animals without parenting experience. This study is the first to characterize social looking in a pair-bonded monkey. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Consistent behavioural responses of individuals (i.e. personality) have been linked with reproductive output and success across a range of taxa. In species with biparental care, the behavioural compatibility of breeding partners may also affect reproductive output, perhaps because it allows greater pair coordination during breeding attempts. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pairs of greylag geese are assortatively paired for personality, and whether these traits within pairs affect reproductive output. We used repeated behavioural assays in the field to quantify three personality traits: activity (focal observations), boldness (flight initiation distance) and aggressiveness (response to mirror image). We assessed their correlation with three measures of reproductive output (clutch size, hatching success and fledging success). All three personality traits were significantly repeatable; however, we found no evidence that pairs within the flock routinely assortatively paired for any trait, regardless of the pair bond duration. Nevertheless, there may still be fitness benefits associated with pair compatibility. Pairs in which the partners were similar in average boldness had higher hatching success, although this trend was not found for clutch size or fledging success. These results suggest that the benefits of having similar predator defence strategies within pairs differ across the breeding cycle, resulting in no overall selection for assortative mating for boldness.

AB Animal sociality, the extent and manner in which conspecifics associate with each other, ultimately affects an individual's survival and reproductive success. It is shaped by the spatiotemporal configuration and composition of the social units (e.g. individual, pair, group) in a population. Here, we assessed the formation and structure of social networks of a presumed nonsocial species with individual-based movement data of 153 GPS-marked brown bears, Ursus arctos. We explored changes in the frequency of dyadic associations in relation to distinct seasonal patterns (i.e. mating, hyperphagia and hunting seasons) that affect bear behaviour. We found seasonally distinctive frequencies in brown bear associations throughout their active period and that reproduction was the main driver for associations in the population, that is, the highest frequency of associations occurred during the mating season and male -female dyads during the mating season included the majority (73%) of observed associations. We also observed dyadic associations during the hyperphagia and hunting seasons, but found no significant changes in frequency during these seasons. In addition, we found that social structures during both the mating and nonmating periods were nonrandom, that is, dyadic associations occurred more often than expected. Animal sociality is commonly viewed as a classification of social versus nonsocial, but our results suggest that it is rather a dynamic continuum primarily influenced by variation in a species' spatiotemporal configuration (i.e. seasonal movements, social unit structure) and demographic composition (i.e. age, sex). Our results also support the contention that studies focusing on animal sociality should include a sociospatial perspective, as both components are tightly linked. Since sociality can affect individual fitness, and vice versa, advancing the knowledge on assumed 'solitary' species is paramount for the conservation and sustainable management of their populations.

AB Details in birdsong parameters convey information about fitness, quality and motivational state of the signaller. Perception of these song details may affect decision making of receivers in territorial defence and mate choice. Whether the message in the song is perceived or not may have major consequences for the birds' reproductive success. Consequently, birds may suffer fitness consequences from masking by other sounds in the environment. We conducted two different playback experiments to test whether song consistency, a sexually selected performance trait expressed in the temporal and spectral parameters of song, is perceived under different noise conditions. In the first experiment, we found that blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, are less able to assess the performance levels of song, but still detect the song stimuli under experimentally high broadband noise levels. Blue tits also responded with more songs overall, independent of song stimulus variation to playback of song stimuli under noisy conditions. When song stimulus variants were exposed simultaneously with a narrow band of noise in the second experiment, blue tits showed reduced capacity to discriminate only when the band of noise overlapped in frequency with the song. Results from this experiment support the notion that it is indeed the masking, rather than nonauditory effects of noise that cause the change in behaviour. Overall, our results show that there are noisy conditions that do not affect detection but still affect perception of information in the detailed structure of songs. Not being able to respond appropriately to songs that differ in performance level is likely to have negative fitness consequences and contribute to a detrimental impact of anthropogenic noise on individuals and populations.

AB Mate-guarding behaviour is thought to beneficially increase paternal share by lowering sperm competition. It is likely to be a plastic response that changes with the density of rivals in the surroundings. A recent study showed that the Parthenium beetle, Zygogramma bicolorata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), exhibits mate-guarding behaviour through prolonged mating duration. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the flexibility of this behaviour when rivals were present. A pair of Z. bicolorata were placed in the physical presence and chemical cues of rivals of both sexes at different densities, and their precopulatory behaviours (time to commencement of mating, latent period, mate-guarding duration and reproductive output) were noted. We hypothesized that population densities of rivals of both sexes would influence the mate-guarding behaviour and reproductive outputs. Our results revealed that population density has significant effects on precopulatory parameters and reproductive outputs. Mateguarding duration decreased in the physical presence of rivals, while it increased in the presence of chemical cues. In the physical presence of rivals, mate guarding probably decreased due to the repeated harassment of the focal pair, especially the male partner, by the rivals in the experimental arena. However, reproductive outputs (fecundity and percentage egg viability) were increased in both the physical presence and chemical cues of males and females. Hence our results clearly support the previous observation of mate-guarding behaviour through prolonged mating duration in the Parthenium beetle, and show its plasticity.

AB Animal-built structures that function in mate attraction can be constrained in signal expression by the availability of building materials in the environment and the male's ability to find them as well as the ability to construct the structure itself. As part of their courtship display, male great bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus nuchalis, use hundreds of grey-white objects to create a bower court. Males arrange these objects to create a positive size-distance gradient, the evenness of which generates a forced perspective visual illusion that is associated with mating success. However, a range of differently sized objects are required to build a high-quality gradient, and it is unclear how local object availability and male ability to place objects in the correct location (i.e. building ability) affect gradient quality. To disentangle these effects, we provided males with a standardized set of court objects after removing their original objects. If gradient quality is associated with male building ability, we predicted that the quality of the gradient constructed with the standardized set of objects would be positively correlated with the male's original gradient quality. Contrary to our predictions, males that built high-quality gradients in their original court did not build high-quality gradients when given a standardized set of objects. We conclude that the bower court may not be a reliable signal of male building ability, and that object availability and/or male ability to locate appropriate objects explains some of the observed variation in gradient quality.

AB Shelter is an important resource, serving as protection from rivals, predators and environmental stressors. The physical dimensions of a potential shelter are an important factor that can affect decisions about potential shelter options. Animals must select a shelter that they can fit into and use as a refuge, but beyond that, do they show fine-scale preferences based on shelter dimensions? This question has been actively studied for species whose shelter use is closely connected to their life cycles, such as obligate shell dwellers and nest-inhabiting species. However, preferences and decision making for temporary shelters has received less attention. We tested whether three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a common laboratory model, exhibit preferences in shelter use (actively entering and spending time within a shelter) between shelters with different dimensions. We used PVC tubes of different dimensions as shelters and conducted a simultaneous choice assay where individual fish were presented with each of three tubes available for use as shelter. The fish showed a clear preference, using larger diameter shelters more frequently than either of the other two options. There was no difference in the number of nonsheltering visits fish made or time to enter a shelter across tube sizes, which suggests an active selection by the fish rather than passive bias. There was no difference in duration of time spent within a shelter, suggesting that despite these preferences, actual benefit derived by the fish may be decoupled from the shelter dimensions. Our results offer opportunities for future research that addresses longer term questions in both behavioural ecology and welfare. What drives the preference for larger diameter tubes, and are there are long-term benefits to shelter with preferred dimensions? Certainly, our results suggest that housing sticklebacks with larger diameter shelters may be a simple and convenient means to improve welfare. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Collective behaviour in animals that move in three dimensions can often be explained by simple interaction rules. For animals that rely on active sensing, such as echolocating bats, sensing and following conspecifics may be challenging in dense groups, yet the flight behaviour of individuals in dense bat groups remains poorly studied. Here, we investigate the rules guiding collective behaviour in a species of echolocating bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) during evening exodus from a cave. Using high-resolution thermal imagery, we tracked the flight coordination and wing beat phase of bats flying together. We found that bats aligned and responded strongest to individuals flying in front of them. Additionally, they responded to conspecifics much slower than predicted if they were using an intermittent sensorimotor strategy to sense leader position and movement.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Habitat selection has profound consequences for individual fitness, but how do animals decide where to settle? The natal habitat preference induction (NHPI) hypothesis proposes that individuals choose habitats that exhibit similar environmental cues to those experienced in early life. In this study, we first examined juvenile movements and dispersal and then tested the NHPI hypothesis in the monk parakeet, Myiopsitta monachus, an invasive species that nests primarily in pine or palm trees in our study site. Juveniles were observed ranging extensively, but we found no relationship between ranging distances prior to dispersal and subsequent natal dispersal behaviour. As predicted by NHPI, we found that dispersed individuals displayed a significant preference for nesting in their natal tree type in their first year, irrespective of tree availability. The probability of changing tree type was not influenced by individual dispersal distance, the proportion of the natal tree type available or natal tree type. We found that adult birds undertaking breeding dispersal also showed a preference for the same tree type they dispersed from when making nest site selections, demonstrating that preferences can be maintained by adults during breeding dispersal movements. Finally, conspecific breeding success did not differ between palm and pine tree nests, and so did not provide a useful source of public information regarding the suitability of the two nesting substrates. These results contribute to our understanding of the drivers of habitat selection in both adults and juveniles and have implications for our understanding of dispersal patterns and range expansion in this worldwide invasive species.

AB Coevolutionary relationships between parasites and their hosts can lead to the emergence of diverse phenotypes over time, as seen in Ophiocordyceps fungi that manipulate insect and arachnid behaviour to aid fungal spore transmission. The most conspicuous examples are found in ants of the Camponotini tribe, colloquially known as 'zombie ants'. While the behaviours induced during infection are well described, their molecular underpinnings remain unknown. Recent genomics and transcriptomics analyses of Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani have identified several highly upregulated biomolecules produced by the fungus during infection of Camponotus floridanus. Among them is an ergot alkaloid related to the mycotoxin aflatrem, known to cause 'staggers syndrome' in cows. Staggering, defined as unsteady movements side to side, is also observed in C. floridanus ants during late-stage infection. To test whether aflatrem-like compounds could be responsible, we injected healthy ants with aflatrem and recorded their behaviour for 30 min. Using both the automated object-tracking software MARGO and manual behavioural quantification, we found that aflatrem reduced ant activity and speed and increased staggering behaviours. To examine underlying transcriptomic changes, we performed RNA-seq on the heads of aflatrem-injected ants, keeping in step with previous transcriptomic work on Ophiocordycepsmanipulated ants. We identified 261 genes that were significantly dysregulated in the aflatrem-injected ants compared to sham-injected controls. When compared with RNA-seq data from Ophiocordycepsmanipulated ants, we found that both groups shared 113 differentially regulated genes. These included sensory neuron membrane protein genes, several odorant-binding protein genes and musculoskeletal genes such as titin and obscurin. Together, these results indicate that aflatrem-like compounds significantly affect neuromuscular and sensory function in C. floridanus. The conservation of staggers phenotype between C. floridanus and Bos taurus suggests that behaviour-manipulating strategies exhibited across the Tree of Life may be more similar in approach, if not widely different in application, than we realize.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Difference in male and female motivation to mate can be attributed to conflicts over investment in gametes and offspring. While such motivations are relatively straightforward in separate-sexed species, they may become intertwined in simultaneous hermaphrodites. Such organisms produce both types of gametes and each sperm donor is also a sperm receiver. For the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, male motivation has been shown to become temporarily low after having donated sperm. Moreover, previous studies indicated that being inseminated can be costly for the sperm recipient's reproductive success because accessory gland proteins transferred in the ejaculate can temporarily lower female and male reproductive success. In addition, potential sperm recipients have been found to exhibit behaviours that suggest that they try to avoid being inseminated. Such behaviours could be motivated via the sperm -receiving, female role in this pond snail. To test this, we experimentally eliminated this species' male role using a simple surgical procedure, thus creating 'feminized' snails. We subsequently observed mating behaviour and quantified egg laying and hatching success as a proxy of female reproductive success. Although we did not find an effect of feminization on hatching success, we did find a significant decrease in the occurrence of 'biting' behaviour in feminized individuals compared to sham-operated and control snails. Although biting has been proposed to be a female behaviour, it is likely dictated via the male role because feminized hermaphrodites showed less biting, possibly because they no longer had to defend their paternity success. The other prominent recipient behaviour, 'crawl-out', was not eliminated when performance of the male role was surgically removed, which suggests that this behaviour is female role motivated. The species and experimental approach used enabled us to disen-tangle sexual motivations of a simultaneous hermaphrodite and show that not all behavioural compo-nents have the same motivational basis.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity but it is also associated with costs such as exposure to parasites or reduced life span. Black soldier flies, Hermetia illucens, are a suitable model to investigate the trade-offs between reproduction and longevity as they largely rely on their larval resources and do not have to feed as adults. Here, we investigated the influence of mating status on adult longevity. We found that females had shorter longevity than males, but the intersexual difference in life span was reduced through mating which increased female but decreased male longevity. This suggests a cost of mating for males, while female longevity increased, likely via nutrients transferred by males during copulation (sensu nuptial gifts). We also investigated the transparent abdominal 'window' of adult black soldier flies, the fullness of which may be a proxy for both age and mating status. Window fullness decreased with age in unmated males whereas unmated females maintained high fullness until they were older. Additionally, mated females mostly had full windows while those of mated males were mostly empty. Our findings have not only expanded our understanding of resource allocation in this species, but they also harbour great potential for applicability in the industrial sector given the extensive use of black soldier flies in organic waste management.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Foraging specialization, whereby animals exploit only a minor fraction of the population's foraging home range or trophic niche, may arise as a response to increasing levels of intraspecific competition. This phenomenon may be particularly frequent in colonial species, when individuals breed in large aggre-gations and are constrained to exploit shared foraging areas surrounding the colony site where competition for access to food resources may be high. Foraging specialization may be driven by indi-vidual foraging site fidelity, occurring whenever individuals consistently target specific foraging sites, which may differ from those used by other colony members. We assessed the extent of foraging specialization in a colonial breeding raptor, the lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni, by estimating the repeatability of foraging movement patterns of 45 GPS-tracked individuals during both incubation and nestling rearing. We found that the consistency of individual movement patterns was generally higher during nestling rearing than during incubation. Nestling-rearing individuals, but not incubating ones, travelled along relatively consistent routes when targeting foraging grounds and tended to target the same foraging areas throughout the tracking period. In colonial birds, and likely in altricial species more generally, an increased individual foraging site fidelity during nestling rearing versus incubation may result from increased energy demands due to frequent nestling provisioning in addition to self -provisioning. By consistently exploiting previously visited foraging sites that are likely to be rewarding, nestling-rearing birds might indeed increase their foraging efficiency, shortening food -searching time and maximizing their foraging effort. In addition, the use of distinct foraging areas may reduce intraspecific competition for food, thus buffering an important cost of coloniality.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While a growing body of literature has shown that tourism provisioning can influence the behaviour of wildlife, how physiological state might be related to the nature and magnitude of these effects remains poorly understood. Physiological state, including reproductive and nutritional status, can have profound effects on an individual's behaviour and decision making. In the present study, we used multiple physiological markers related to reproductive (testosterone, 170-oestradiol and progesterone), metabolic (corticosteroids) and nutritional ecology (stable isotopes and fatty acids), integrated with ultrasonography and passive acoustic telemetry to explore the possible relationship between physiological condition and space use of tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, exposed to dive tourism provisioning. Large, nongravid female tiger sharks, with higher plasma steroid levels (i.e. testosterone, 170-oestradiol, relative corticosteroid), enriched delta N-15 and elevated nutritional status (in terms of fatty acids) spent proportionally more time at food provisioning sites compared to conspecifics. Testosterone levels also were positively correlated with the proportion of time spent at provisioning sites. Based on these results, we speculate that physiological condition plays a role in shaping the spatial behaviour of female tiger sharks within the context of food provisioning, whereby larger individuals, exhibiting higher testosterone levels and elevated nutritional status, show selective preferences for provisioning dive sites, where they outcompete conspecifics of relatively smaller size, lower testosterone levels and depressed nutritional state. While more studies are needed to explore whether sharks are making these decisions because of their physiological state or whether spending more time at provisioning sites results in altered physiological state, our findings highlight the importance of considering animal life stage, endocrine regulation, and nutritional condition when evaluating the biological impacts of provisioning tourism.

AB Diverse animals visit flowers but not all engage in pollination, and only behaviours involving stigmal contact result in successful pollination events. Ethological indices developed for sociobiological contexts (caste evolution) have unrealized potential to provide insights on pollination services but have not been applied in this context before. In the present study, we characterized foraging behaviours as functional traits, which allowed us to predict whether ecosystems services are robust to species-specific trait loss. We aimed to (1) document the variety, duration and frequency of on-flower behaviours, (2) determine which taxa engage in stigmal contact and (3) investigate vulnerabilities of pollination service to loss of pollinator taxa. We used video recordings to document on-flower behaviours of animals visiting a single apple cultivar (Malus domestica var. 'Pink Lady'), which removed confounding factors to enable a robust assessment of functional pollination behaviour. We adapted division of labour statistics (designed to assess caste-specific behavioural task fidelity within social insect colonies) to investigate taxon-specific foraging behaviours within this assemblage of pollinators - a novel application. An ethogram of 11 behaviours was derived from 19,518 min of observations (2350 visits; 19 taxa). Most (53%) flower visits involved stigmal contact (termed 'contact visits'), but the percentage of contact visits varied between taxa. We introduce division of foraging behaviour (DFB) indices - which imply the focal pollinator assemblage consists of a mix of behaviourally generalized and specialized taxa with a slight bias towards specialization: division of taxa into behaviours DFBYjX = 0.59; division of behaviours into taxa DFBXjY = 0.76. Simulated extinction of taxa from this insect assemblage significantly shifted DFBYjX in four instances. These qualitative assessments of behavioural traits imply moderate functional redundancy in pollination services provided by 11 insect taxa to a model plant, even under simulated extinction events, suggesting pollination services may be somewhat resilient to animal-plant network disruptions in this Australian agroecological study system.

AB In animal societies, individuals may take on different roles to fulfil their own needs and the needs of their group. Ant colonies display high levels of organizational complexity, with ants fulfilling different roles at different timescales (what is known as task allocation). Factors affecting task allocation can be at the individual level (e.g. physiology), or at the group level (e.g. the network of interactions). We focus on group level processes by exploring the relationship between interaction networks, task allocation and task switching using a previously published data set (Mersch et al., 2013, Science, 340(6136), 1090-1093) tracking the behaviour of six Camponotus fellah colonies over 41 days. In our new analyses, our goal was to better explain the noisy process of task switching beyond simple age polyethism. First, we investigated the architecture of interaction networks using node (individual) level network measures and their relation to the individual's task - foraging, cleaning or nursing - and whether or not the ant switched tasks. We then explored how noisy information propagation was among ants, as a function of the colony composition (how many ants carried out which tasks), through the information-theoretic metric of 'effective information'. Our results show that interaction history is tied to task allocation: ants that switched to a task were more likely to have interacted with other ants carrying out that task. The degree to which interactions related to task allocation, as well as the noise in those interactions, depended on which groups of ants were interacting. Overall, we found that colony cohesion was stable even as ant level network measures varied more for ants when they switched functional groups; thus, ant colonies maintained a high level of information flow as determined by network analysis, and ant functional groups played different roles in maintaining colony cohesion through varied information flows.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Across group-living taxa, males act aggressively towards outgroup males because they represent a threat to reproduction with ingroup females. This intergroup aggression can entail agonistic coalition formation between group members, is typically associated with higher testosterone levels and prevents extended associations between members of different groups. However, in a few species, including humans, groups can interact peacefully, allowing the exchange of resources and information. To better understand how social relationships are manifested between groups and the involvement of males in these relationships, we investigated behavioural and endocrine correlates of male strategies during intergroup encounters in bonobos, Pan paniscus. We found that, despite overt intergroup aggression, males rarely engaged in coalitionary attacks against outgroup individuals and their testosterone levels did not rise during intergroup encounters. Also, males sacrificed the time available to affiliate with ingroup individuals and actively affiliated with outgroup individuals, especially outgroup males. The paucity of cooperative group defence and high levels of intergroup affiliation suggest that male bonobos play a role in maintaining tolerant intergroup relationships. We discuss how our findings relate to the establishment of male-male social relationships beyond the group level in other species.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many group-living animals perform complex and precisely coordinated acoustic and visual displays to signal coalition cohesion or quality. The temporal coordination of such displays is important but matching the type and magnitude of movements may also act as a signal. If so, the relative size of signallers, or signalling structures, could affect their ability to match movements and the perception of matching by receivers. We studied morphology and display in Australian magpie-larks, Grallina cyanoleuca, to assess the importance of wing length and matching of movements during duets that include both movement and song. Partners with more similar wing lengths were less likely to divorce, and in response to audio playback, they were more efficient at cooperative territorial defence. By contrast, dissimilar partners did not produce the movement type that revealed wing lengths. Audiovisual experiments with a robotic pair confirmed that duet displays in which individuals matched their movements were more threatening than those in which the type or magnitude of movement differed. Furthermore, matching by the amplitude of wing movement was more threatening than matching by the angle of motion. Overall, we conclude that movement matching during cooperative duets increases the efficacy of communication and is likely to be enhanced by the similarity in size of signalling structures.

AB We investigated factors leading to variation in social complexity or 'social systems' among plateau pika family groups within a contiguous local population across 2 years. Plateau pikas are small, diurnal, nonhibernating, sexually monomorphic lagomorphs that occupy family home ranges on open alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Expression of the social organization, social structure, mating system and parental care system in plateau pikas did not follow expectations from traditional ecological or evolutionary explanations. Variability in plateau pika family group size and the transitions of group size between years allowed us to investigate potential advantages and disadvantages of group living. Evidence that group living served to protect pikas against predation was weak. Although social huddling could have minimized thermoregulatory costs during the extremely cold Tibetan winters, there was no correlation of overwinter survivorship among pika families of different sizes. There was no apparent group-living benefit with regard to foraging, and the occurrence of cohesive social families on the flat, continuous meadow contradicts the hypothesis that sociality is related to patchiness of critical resources. Cost of maintaining burrows appeared unrelated to group size. Most interactions between pikas occurred within family groups and were affiliative (99% of adult interactions; 97% of adult-juvenile interactions), and most interactions between adult males of different family groups were aggressive (96% of interactions). Matings were primarily within families (88% of copulations). Pikas also possess a complex vocal repertoire that enhanced interactions within social families. Demographic constraints associated with variable overwinter survivorship appeared to be the dominant precondition that produced a given family size and mating system type, coupled with selective dispersal by some pikas before the start of the breeding season. Paternal care enhanced juvenile survival, and thus led to an equalization of reproductive success among adults in families with different mating combinations.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding the effects of environmental conditions in cooperatively breeding species helps reveal the nature of evolutionary forces leading to this type of social system. In particular, environmental variability may affect demographic processes such as mortality and dispersal which can ultimately define the finescale genetic structure of cooperatively breeding populations, including direct and indirect fitness opportunities for individuals. We investigated the population genetic structure and dispersal patterns of obligately cooperative white-winged choughs, Corcorax melanorhamphos, exploring within-group relatedness and genetic differentiation among groups sampled over several years of above average rainfall. We compared our results with data from a previous study in the surrounding area, conducted during a drought period. White-winged chough groups showed similar significant genetic differentiation among groups during both drought and nondrought periods. However, we found female-biased dispersal during abundant rainfall years, which contrasts with the previous study conducted during a drought. We also examined differences in genetic structure in the present study, between groups breeding in suburbs versus native woodlands, finding higher within-group relatedness in woodland birds. Dispersal was female biased in both suburban and woodland habitat but subadult females in suburban habitat were more likely to disperse than adult females. We suggest that higher mortality in chough populations (both during a drought and in suburban habitats) led to more breeding opportunities, resulting in higher dispersal, and reflecting lower group stability. Our study suggests ecological conditions are important drivers of social structure in a cooperatively breeding bird, which are likely to be impacted by environmental change, including climate and urbanization.

AB The frequency of divorce in pair-bonding species should vary not only with the fitness costs of separating from suboptimal mates, but also with the opportunities for finding alternatives of higher quality or compatibility. Such opportunities should be more commonplace in group-living species, especially the fission-fusion groups that typify many social vertebrates. Here we tested the hypothesis that greater fluidity of the social environment results in higher divorce rates by altering flock composition of captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, soon after birds paired. Twelve flocks (10 males and 10 females per flock) were established in breeding aviaries and observed until 80% of birds in each flock paired. After removing birds that did not pair, flock composition was manipulated to achieve either a more fluid environment (by exchanging half the pairs between flocks) or a less fluid one (all pairs remained in their original flock); flock size was then restored to 20 birds by adding four new, unmated individuals. Following manipulation of group composition, some birds divorced and remated and, as predicted, most such instances (9 of 10 divorces) occurred in the higher fluidity treatment. Remated pairs took longer to initiate clutches and produced fewer offspring than stable pairs, supporting the idea that divorce has short-term costs. In the premanipulation phase of the experiment, members of pairs that subsequently divorced engaged in high levels of courtship/pairing activity, but they appeared not to resolve nest site selection. These findings support the behavioural incompatibility hypothesis as a driver of divorce. Results suggest that incidence of divorce in natural populations could be significantly higher than typically reported, given that shifts in mate affiliation relatively soon after pairing are seldom investigated. Findings also indicate that caution should be exercised regarding use of frequency of affiliative behaviours to quantify pair bond formation and strength. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Strategies that mitigate predation, whether proactive or reactive, can nevertheless impose significant 'nonconsumptive' costs on prey species. Here we used data from two wild vervet monkey, Chlorocebus pygerythru,s groups to assess whether the detection of predators affected their subsequent behaviour to the detriment of their short-term foraging effort. Encounters with the three predator classes present at our study site were frequent and there was evidence that animals were more likely to shift to predatorfocused vigilance, which was modulated by alarm call intensity, but not predator type, in the hour following detection. Nevertheless, and against expectation, there was no detectable shift in overall levels of vigilance, which remained low, interindividual distances, travel bearing and, consequently, effort put into foraging. We consider this surprising imperturbability by our study groups in the context of population group size, as our groups are large and have correspondingly lower levels of individual vigilance, as well as in terms of the constraints imposed by small, overlapping territories and frequent predator encounters. Finally, we advocate for increased consideration of the responses of the predators themselves to detection by their prey. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Lethal gang attacks, in which multiple aggressors attack a single victim, are among the most widespread forms of violence between human groups. Gang attacks are also frequent in some other social mammals, such as chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, wolves, Canis lupus, spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, and meerkats, Suricata suricatta. So far, species in which gang attacks have been observed share one or more of these socioecological features: territoriality, fission-fusion, cooperative breeding or coalitionary bonds. However, the scarcity of data in other taxa makes it challenging to determine whether one/all of these socioecological features is necessary and sufficient to drive the evolution of gang attacks. Here we describe the first reports of intergroup gang attacks in the crested macaque, using data on three groups collected over 13 years, with the joint observation times for the three groups summing to 37 years. Crested macaque gangs attacked outgroup conspecifics when aggressors were numerically superior to victims. Adult females were the most frequent age/sex category to attack outgroup conspecifics. The victims were mostly adult females and infants. We propose that coalitionary bonds, hostility towards outgroup individuals and the ability to estimate numerical odds may suffice to trigger intergroup gang attacks when the conditions favour an imbalance of power between victims and attackers.

AB Social animals must carefully track consequential events and opportunities for social learning. However, the competing demands of the social world produce trade-offs in social attention, defined as directed visual attention towards conspecifics. A key question is how socioecology shapes these biases in social attention over evolution and development. Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and bonobos, Pan paniscus, provide ideal models for addressing this question because they have large communities with fission -fusion grouping, divergent sex-based dominance hierarchies and occasional intergroup encounters. Using noninvasive eye-tracking measures, we recorded captive apes' attention to side-by-side images of familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics of the same sex. We tested four competing hypotheses about the influence of taxonomically widespread socioecological pressures on social attention, including intergroup conflict, dominance, dispersal and mating competition. Both species preferentially attended to familiar over unfamiliar conspecifics when viewing the sex that typically occupies the highest ranks in the group: females for bonobos, and males for chimpanzees. However, they did not demonstrate attentional biases between familiar and unfamiliar members of the subordinate sex. Findings were consistent across species despite differences in which sex tends to be more dominant. These results suggest that sex-based dominance patterns guide social attention across Pan. Our findings reveal how socioecological pressures shape social attention in apes and likely contribute to the evolution of social cognition across primates.

AB The traditional view of sex roles and sexual selection emphasizes the evolution of male ornaments as a result of female mate choice and male-male competition. Female ornaments are now receiving more attention, although their roles in mating decisions are still less well understood, especially considering cases in which colourful ornaments are expressed by both sexes. In this study, we analysed whether female skin coloration (luminance and redness of the face and hindquarters) influenced male mate choice and sexual behaviours in relation to intracycle (cycle phase), intercycle (number of consecutive cycles, conceptive nature of the cycle) and interindividual (age, social rank, weight and parity) variation in a captive social group of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata. Males did not preferentially choose darker/redder females. Moreover, males did not appear to use female skin coloration to apportion their mating efforts on the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle or during cycles that led to conception, or to discriminate between females. Collectively, our results suggest that female skin coloration may not have been sexually selected in this species and that males mated regardless of such variation across females. To our knowledge, our study is among the few to report a lack of male choice for female coloration in a species where both sexes display ornamentation. Our findings provide novel insights on the role and evolution of female coloration in sexual signalling and mating decisions. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Signalling plays an important role in mediating social interactions in many animal species. For example, during approaches certain species produce ?greetings?, which can take the form of vocal or visual signals, which reduce the probability of aggressive interactions and/or facilitate affiliation when approaching each other. However, in species where greetings comprise both vocal and visual signals, little is known about how the vocal component relates to the visual component or, in species with fission-fusion dynamics, to the time spent together by the dyad in the same subgroup prior to the approach. Similarly, in species with several acoustic variants of greeting calls, it is unclear whether different variants have different functions. We looked at the production of two acoustically distinct greeting call variants, lowfundamental frequency pant grunts and high-fundamental frequency pant barks, during approaches between two individuals in five communities of wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, in Uganda and Ivory Coast. More specifically, we explored the relationship between greeting call production and (1) aggressive and submissive interactions during the approach and (2) preceding and subsequent proximity levels between the involved individuals. Calls were more likely to be produced during aggressive interactions and were associated with postures and gestures linked to submission; these patterns were stronger when the utterance contained a pant bark rather than a pant grunt alone. The production of greeting calls was more likely soon after party fusion and was negatively related to subsequent proximity levels between the caller and receiver. These results expand our knowledge of greeting calls and imply that these calls might be used to re-establish dominance relationships after a period of separation, and that the function of these calls can be modulated by their specific acoustic variants and by visual signals that often accompany them.

AB Play fighting can originate from different behavioural systems, including aggression and affiliation and can have a competitive and/or cooperative nature. Domestic pigs engage in vigorous play fighting that strongly resembles real fighting in motor patterns from their first days of life and heavier subjects usually win agonistic contests. Here we tested whether play fighting in piglets could be a substitute for real fighting and predicted that, if so: (1) play invitations would be more successful when not involving possibly dangerous body contact (Prediction 1); (2) piglets would preferentially play with similar-sized mates, easier to outcompete (Prediction 2); (3) play fighting and real fighting outcomes (winner/loser) and social networks would largely match (Prediction 3). We videorecorded three litters of preweaning piglets housed at the ethical farm Parva Domus (Turin, Italy) and analysed the play, aggression and suckling sessions. Sociomatrix and social network analyses were also used to compare play fighting and real fighting. Our findings confirmed all predictions, as they showed that piglets engaged in play fighting when the danger of being harmed was lowest (no-contact invitation patterns; Prediction 1) and their chance of winning was highest (similar weight players; Prediction 2). During the preweaning period, play fighting decreased as real fighting increased and just after suckling time declined, with piglets consistently winning/losing both playful and real fights and possessing comparable network centrality values in both play fighting and real fighting networks (Prediction 3). Although the mechanisms underlying the competitive nature of play fighting remain to be determined, this study provides evidence that it can be a harmless replacement for real fighting (possibly mediated by the oxytocin consumed via maternal milk). This study also points towards the more extreme hypothesis that play fighting is a different form of aggression that includes elements of play.

DE animal personality; collective behaviour; conformity; experimental
   housing; sociability; social environment; social plasticity; variance

AB The social niche hypothesis theorizes that repeated social interactions between group members is an important mechanism for generating consistent individual differences in behaviour. However, such frequent interactions also have the potential to mask or suppress behavioural differences if individuals conform towards a group behavioural norm (i.e. the social conformity hypothesis) by either synchronizing their behaviour or shifting their behaviour towards that of influential group members. Both of these predictions hinge on the notion that social feedback among group members plays a key role in modulating consistent behavioural variation; thus, in the absence of such feedback, it could be expected that such consistent variation will be reduced. Here, we investigated how a 1-month housing with a stable social group, as opposed to being socially isolated, affected consistent individual differences in the shoaling tendencies of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aceluteus. Specifically, we repeatedly tested the tendency of individual sticklebacks to shoal with conspecifics before and after their social experience. In support of the social conformity hypothesis, we observed a four-fold increase in among-group differences, but no change in among-individual differences, in the shoaling tendencies of sticklebacks housed in groups. A post hoc analysis revealed that the increase in among-group differences may have been driven by the most ?social? pretreatment group member. Conversely, fish that were housed in isolation, expressed a notable, albeit nonsignificant, decrease in individual shoaling variation and repeatability. This decrease in shoaling variation corresponded with an increase in the average shoaling tendencies of solitary fish post-treatment, suggesting that solitary fish converged towards a similarly high level of shoaling tendencies post-treatment. For both treatment groups, however, we found amongindividual positive correlations in pre- and post-treatment shoaling tendencies, suggesting that individuals may inherently differ in their shoaling tendencies, but that the social environment plays an important role in mediating the expression of these differences. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Prosocial motivation has been suggested to facilitate the initiation and maintenance of cooperative interactions, as well as the evolution of social systems reliant on helping behaviour and social coordination. Previous comparative research on the link between prosociality and cooperation has been limited, however, by the absence of directly comparable measures of these traits among the same individuals. In the present study, we therefore examined intraspecific variation in prosociality and cooperative behaviour within a captive colony of group-living, cooperatively breeding common marmosets to provide a direct experimental test of these hypothesized benefits. We measured prosociality using a group service food-provisioning paradigm, and we assessed mutually beneficial dyadic cooperation with the loose string coordinated pulling paradigm. In addition, we also investigated the effects of individual social tolerance and partner choice, which have previously been identified as key factors promoting prosociality and cooperation among primates. As predicted, successful cooperation in the loose string paradigm was positively associated with prosociality, as well as with social tolerance and partner choice. These effects were independent of age, sex, personality, food motivation and learning across experimental sessions. Our results therefore suggest that prosocial motivation, social tolerance and partner choice can each facilitate mutually beneficial cooperation and social coordination in marmosets, supporting the hypothesized role of these mechanisms in the evolution of cooperative behaviour among primates.

AB Vocalizations often contain both 'dynamic' information, related to short-term fluctuations in the individual's emotional states, and 'static' information, related to long-term attributes such as age, sex, weight and body size which define an 'individual vocal signature'. While both types of information may be of functional value to receivers, dynamic information requires acoustic versatility, while static information depends on acoustic stability. Here we investigated whether an individual vocal signature is present across the vocal repertoire of the bonobo, Pan paniscus. First, the analysis of the acoustic structure of its five most common tonal vocalizations emphasized the highly graded structure of its repertoire. We then evaluated the reliability of identity information across these call types. The results show that, while all call types supported information related to identity, the reliability of these vocal signatures was not consistent along the graded vocal continuum. Caller identity was strongly encoded at one end of the acoustic gradation (high-hoot) and decreased from bark, soft bark, peep-yelp to peep calls. Strikingly, the reliability of the individual signature thus decreased from calls used in high-arousal contexts to those used in low-arousal contexts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an acoustic gradation that codes for 'dynamic' information can be accompanied by variation in the 'static' information that supports vocal individuality.

AB Kleptoparasitism is a foraging strategy where one individual steals a procured food item from another individual. Individual kleptoparasites can optimize their foraging strategy by targeting more profitable hosts or by modifying their behaviour to expend less energy than they would by foraging independently. Herring gulls, Larus argentatus, kleptoparasitize Atlantic puffins, Fratercula arctica, by intercepting adults as they return to their burrows with fish for their chicks. While this system has been studied extensively, much remains unknown, particularly from the herring gull's perspective. We tested predictors of herring gull host choice and the probability of success during kleptoparasitic attacks by conducting 73 30-minute focal samples of individual herring gulls at a breeding colony in Newfoundland, Canada. We recorded each puffin that approached the focal gull, categorizing them according to prey type carried, whether or not they landed, and whether or not they were attacked. For those puffins that were attacked, we also noted whether the gull succeeded in obtaining prey. Herring gulls did not attack puffins at random, but, rather, preferentially attacked puffins that carried larger prey, had already completed their landing, and landed closer to and/or in front of the gull. Gulls tended to be more successful at stealing a puffin's food when they attacked landed puffins and made physical contact with the puffin, but not when the puffin landed closer to them or when they were oriented towards the puffin. These findings suggest that herring gulls optimize their kleptoparasitic foraging strategy by targeting more profitable hosts. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain mechanisms of personality formation. Several theoretical models predict that interactions between intrinsic state and behaviour gradually increase, or sometimes decrease, individual variation across ontogeny. However, these models should be empirically tested with a simple study system. Here, I investigated whether state differences in energy intake promote consistent behavioural differences in clonal geckos. I controlled food supply of two groups (high-energy or low-energy intake) and evaluated their life-history traits and behavioural traits throughout ontogeny. The high-energy group grew faster and laid eggs earlier than the low-energy group. Geckos at several age classes exhibited consistent individual differences in risk boldness, foraging boldness and activity. However, significant behavioural change was detected only in risk boldness; individuals in the high-energy group maintained boldness over their lifetimes, whereas individuals in the low-energy group changed to being shy at early stages and returned to being bold at later stages. These results imply that behaviours do not change gradually, but drastically, in response to energy intake, suggesting that personality formation does not represent simple divergence with ontogeny. Because predation risk and food availability change across an individual's lifetime, the state-dependent safety model could explain divergence and convergence of risk boldness in geckos at different life stages. The present study highlights the importance of a 'life-stage specific' effect of energy state on behaviour for personality formation. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Female-female competition for mates can be as intense as male-male competition, but it has received little attention until recently. Typically, such competition is expressed as context-dependent aggressive encounters between individuals of the same species within a complex social environment. Unlike male competition, in cases of sexual parasitism, female competition includes important heterospecific interactions. We explore how competitor body size and species influence female-female aggression in a sexual-unisexual mating system where heterospecific females compete for males of the sexual species. Specifically, we examined whether (1) the size and species of female competitors and (2) the sex and species of an audience influence female-female aggression in sailfin mollies, Poecilia latipinna. We found that competitor body size had a secondary effect on the amount of aggression a female performed when compared to the species of her female competitor. Female sailfin mollies were more aggressive towards conspecifics than they were towards Amazon mollies, Poecilia formosa, especially in front of a sailfin molly male and female audience. These results demonstrate that the social environment greatly influences how females regulate their aggressive behaviours, and they highlight not only the role of female competition for males, but also the importance of understanding the impact of the social environment on female competition.

AB Mate preference based on relatedness may evolve in response to costs and benefits of inbreeding avoidance. Whereas mating with closely related individuals can have negative fitness consequences due to inbreeding depression, it may simultaneously be favoured by inclusive fitness benefits. Variation in the fitness payoff shaped by benefits of inbreeding may even lead to preference for mating with kin. We investigated this hypothesis in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola, a cooperative species in which reproduction occurs among siblings within the group, premating dispersal is lacking and infrequent encounters with unrelated individuals result in homozygous genetic lineages. We tested whether female mate choice is influenced by male relatedness by pairing females with males that differ in the degree of genetic relatedness, namely nest members, non-nest members from the same population and non-nest members from allopatric populations. We recorded premating (male rejections, latency to mating) and mating (copulation duration and interruptions) behaviours. Females showed no preference for partners on the basis of their relatedness during the premating phase, as frequencies of rejections and successful matings did not differ markedly in encounters with nest and non-nest members. This suggests that selection on discriminatory mechanisms may be weakened or lost in species with inbreeding tolerance and in which relatedness between interacting individuals is very high and variance in relatedness extremely low. Unrelated males from the geographically distant population experienced longer copulations than males from the same population. We interpret this finding as depicting a possible scenario of a between-population reproductive barrier or functional incompatibility, which may be the mechanism causing lower fitness in between-population crosses previously documented in these populations.

AB The advantages of group living are partially offset by the cognitive challenges associated with maintaining social boundaries. These challenges can give rise to recognition mechanisms that adaptively integrate information across multiple sensory modalities. The valley carpenter bee, Xylocopa varipuncta, nests in dead wood in large aggregations of up to several dozen nests. This study investigates the proximate mechanisms by which returning foragers quickly and reliably identify their own nest entrance within a high-density nesting site. We manipulated long- and short-range visual cues associated with nest entrances, removed chemical cues on the inside of nest entrances and added chemical cues from foreign conspecific bees. By measuring the effect of these manipulations on nest search time and search accuracy, we assessed the importance of visual and olfactory sensory modalities in allowing carpenter bees to locate their nests within aggregations. Our results support the hypothesis that both visual and olfactory cues can facilitate nest localization. Removal of nest olfactory cues did not significantly disrupt homing, suggesting that olfactory information may not be necessary for nest localization when visual information is available. However, the addition of olfactory cues from unfamiliar conspecific bees actually aided nest localization rather than disrupting it, suggesting that bees may use generalized species odour cues for homing. Due to intense nest site competition within aggregations, nest localization may have important social implications for maintenance of high-density nesting.

AB Colour signals are often made up of a number of colour patches. The position of these patches within a pattern has the potential to influence signal conspicuousness, especially if viewers attend to local rather than global aspects of the colour pattern. If local contrast is important, then signal efficacy should be highest when highly contrasting patches are adjacent; if local contrast is not important, contrasting colours can be anywhere in the pattern. We tested whether global or local colour patch contrast influenced the attractiveness of male guppies, Poecilia reticulata. We assessed contrast on both global and local scales using two methods. The first, overall pattern contrast, estimates the global pattern contrast without accounting for which colours are adjacent. The second, boundary strength analysis, accounts for local contrast by estimating the contrast intensity (Delta S) and contact lengths between adjacent patches. We tested behaviour under three different light environments: blue, broad spectrum (control) and red to modify visual contrast. The light environment had a significant effect on all measures of colour pattern contrast. The male overall pattern contrast measures did not affect female preferences under the three light environments. The coefficient of variation (CV) of chromatic Delta S was the only measure to show a significant effect on female preferences. Females favoured males that displayed high variation in local contrast (high CV of Delta S, independently of the light environment). Therefore, variation in local visual contrast appears to be more important than overall pattern contrast in guppies, regardless of the light environment.

AB Understanding how animals learn is crucial to interpreting animal behaviour. Flower-visiting insects, such as bees and parasitoids, are excellent animal models to study visual and olfactory learning, including memory phenomena. The diversity of resources flower-visiting insects exploit predisposes them to learn and remember the colours, shapes and odours associated with rewarding experiences (e.g. flowers), allowing them to focus on the most rewarding resources. Recent research has shown that nectar-living microbes release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to overall flower scent. Nevertheless, little is known about the extent to which nectar microbiota mediate insect learning of floral preferences. In this study, we investigated whether VOCs produced by nectar microbes serve as a learning cue to parasitoids and how long any developed preference is maintained. Experiments were performed using the generalist aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi and three nectar yeasts, including the nectar specialist Metschnikowia reukaufii and the generalist species Hanseniaspora uvarum and Sporobolomyces roseus. Results showed that naive parasitoids had an innate preference for nectar fermented by the nectar specialist M. reukaufii, but not by the other two yeasts which had either a neutral (H. uvarum) or deterrent (S. roseus) effect. When parasitoids were conditioned with yeast-fermented nectar, they were strongly attracted to their odours 2 and 24 h after conditioning, but not after 48 h. Furthermore, when parasitoids were conditioned to one yeast-fermented nectar, they also showed increased attraction to other yeast-fermented nectars. This generalization suggests that their learning ability may have broader ecological consequences. However, this generalized response to other yeast VOCs lasted for only 2 h. We conclude that parasitoids show conditioned responses to the scent of yeast-fermented nectar, and yeasts, therefore, may play an important but understudied role in shaping their foraging behaviour.

AB In social animals, affiliative behaviours bring many benefits, but also costs such as disease risk. The ways in which affiliation may affect the risk of infectious agent transmission remain unclear. Moreover, studies linking variation in affiliative interactions to infectious agent incidence/diversity have speculated that disease transmission may have occurred, rather than revealing that transmission did occur. We address these gaps using the phylogenetics of commensal gut Escherichia coli to determine whether affiliative grooming and huddling social networks mediated microbial transmission among rhesus macaques. We collected behavioural and microbial data from adult macaques across a 12-week period that was split into two 6-week phases to better detect dyadic transmission. We reconstructed undirected social networks from affiliative interactions and reconstructed microbial transmission networks from the pairwise phylogenetic similarity of E. coli pulsotypes from macaques within and across adjacent sampling events. Macaque E. coli pulsotypes were more phylogenetically similar to each other than to environmental isolates, which established a premise for socially mediated transmission. Dyadic grooming and huddling frequencies strongly influenced the likelihood of E. coli transmission during the second data collection phase, but not the first. Macaques that were more central/well connected in both their grooming and huddling networks were also more central in the E. coli transmission networks. Our results confirmed that affiliative grooming and huddling behaviours mediate the transmission of gut microbes among rhesus macaques, particularly among females and high-ranking individuals. The detectability of socially mediated E. coli transmission maybe partially masked by environmental acquisition in males, or by high frequencies of interactions in captivity. Predicting the potential transmission pathways of gastrointestinal parasites and pathogens, our findings add to current knowledge of the coevolutionary relationships between affiliative behaviour and health and may be used to identify 'superspreader' individuals as potential targets for disease control strategies.

AB Body size is a key determinant of male fighting ability and reproductive success in many animal species, but relationships between these variables have only rarely been examined in group-living animals in which body size often correlates with dominance rank. We examined the relationships between body size (crest height, back breadth and body length), dominance rank, alpha male tenure length, number of adult females and patterns of aggression in 26 wild adult male mountain gorillas, Gorilla beringei beringei, living in multimale groups. A composite measure combining crest height and back breadth (variables were highly correlated and combined into a crest-back score), but not body length, significantly correlated with dominance rank, alpha male tenure length and number of adult females per group. The alpha male had the largest crest-back score in six of the seven groups, and in the majority of dyads the male with the higher crest-back score was higher ranking. The frequency (and intensity on mating days) of aggressive contests was higher between males close in rank. Additionally, aggression occurred more frequently when the initiator was larger than the recipient. Our results suggest that factors other than body size are likely to influence dominance rank, but large size helps males attain and retain high dominance rank, probably leading to greater reproductive success. Further studies on how the timing and intensity of male-male competition influences life history trade-offs between investment in secondary sexual characteristics, body condition and survival may explain variance in lifetime reproductive success within and between species.

AB The predation and dispersal of seeds by scatter-hoarding animals is one of the most studied processes in the context of animal-plant interactions. Seed management by these animals has been traditionally approached at the population level: the patterns documented in the field are assumed to be similar for all individuals of the population and the variability within the population is considered to be random noise. However, little is known about to what extent this variability responds to different and consistent behaviours between individuals. The aim of this study was to analyse the individual variation and consistency in behaviour of scatter-hoarding rodents within a population. As our model we used the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, a key disperser of holm oak acorns, Quercus ilex, which, in turn, suffers high predation pressure by the common genet, Genetta genetta. In two sets of laboratory experiments, we compared the variance and consistency in behaviours and acorn management due to individual differences with that due to manipulation, using genet scents, of the perceived predation risk. Genet scents reduced the activity (i.e. time out of the refuge) in all wood mice, but the differences and consistency in activity between individuals accounted for most of the variance. Also, mice showed different and consistent stress or relaxed behaviours. Most of the variance in seed management variables, such as dispersal distance and seed size selection, was explained by consistent differences between individuals across scent treatments. The increase in stress behaviours and decrease in relaxed behaviours were positively related to dispersal ability (i.e. longer distances and larger acorns). Our study highlights the importance of considering the individual component of behaviour in scatter-hoarding rodents. This fine-scale level, largely overlooked in the ecological framework, will help to increase our understanding of seed management by scatter-hoarding animals.

AB Several studies have shown that sexual experience can alter a male's mating behaviour to increase his future mating success. One explanation is that experienced males are better at courting females and inducing them to mate. Experienced males might also be better at identifying higher quality mates, although fewer studies have tested for this benefit. In both cases, however, these potential benefits of sexual experience might be partially offset by the energetic costs of courting and mating, which tend to reduce a male's subsequent ability to invest in sexually selected traits, and thereby reduce his future attractiveness and mating success (i.e. hasten the onset of reproductive senescence). Here we used the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, to test whether sexual experience elevates male mating success. We housed recently matured males either with full mating access to females (experienced males) or in the visual and olfactory presence of females with which they could not mate (naive males). We then measured the strength of male mate choice for larger, more fecund, females, male mating behaviour (time spent chasing females and the number of copulation attempts) and insemination success. Experienced and naive males did not differ significantly in their mating behaviour and there was no effect of sexual experience on the likelihood of mating or on the number of sperm inseminated (although experienced males had a tendency to be less successful when performing gonopodial thrusts). Experienced males in two-choice trials were, however, significantly more likely to 'inspect' both females and had a significantly stronger preference for larger females. Finally, we measured male immune response and growth to test for any costs of the increased mating effort that is concomitant with greater experience. Experienced males had significantly slower postmaturation growth and a significantly weaker immune response than naive males. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Data reduction analyses such as principal components and exploratory factor analyses identify relationships within a set of potentially correlated variables, and cluster correlated variables into a smaller overall quantity of groupings. Because of their relative objectivity, these analyses are popular throughout the animal literature to study a wide variety of topics. Numerous authors have highlighted 'best practice' guidelines for component/factor 'extraction', i.e. determining how many components/factors to extract from a data reduction analysis, because this can greatly impact the interpretation, comparability and replicability of one's results. Statisticians agree that Kaiser's criterion, i.e. extracting components/factors with eigenvectors >1.0, should never be used, yet, within the animal literature, a considerable number of authors still use it, even as recently as 2018 and across a wide range of taxa (e.g. insects, birds, fish, mammals) and topics (e.g. personality, cognition, health, morphology, reproduction). It is therefore clear that further awareness is needed to target the animal sciences to ensure that results optimize structural stability and, thus, comparability and reproducibility. In this commentary, we first clarify the distinction between principal components and exploratory factor analyses in terms of analysing simple versus complex structures, and how this relates to component/factor extraction. Second, we highlight empirical evidence from simulation studies to explain why certain extraction methods are more reliable than others, including why automated methods are better, and why Kaiser's criterion is inappropriate and should therefore never be used. Third, we provide recommendations on what to do if multiple automated extraction methods 'disagree' which can arise when dealing with complex structures. Finally, we explain how to perform and interpret more robust and automated extraction tests using R. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Behavioural tendencies vary consistently among individuals and this variation is known as personality. Previous studies have found that personality traits measured through standardized behavioural tests predict trappability (i.e. 'trap happy' versus 'trap shy'). However, the nature of this relationship is unclear since it has been explored only within single species and never across environments. This is problematic because trappability is a labile characteristic that can vary between seasons, environments and years. It is essential to understand this link because there is great potential for the use of trappability as a proxy for personality. For example, if trappability reflects personality, this would allow researchers to extract personality data from long-term capture-mark-recapture data sets. To clarify this relationship, we designed a large-scale field experiment to measure personality and trappability in five small mammal species and across four distinct forest types. With an open field test, we quantified behaviour in 189 deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, 170 southern red-backed voles, Myodes gapperi, 42 American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, 58 woodland jumping mice, Napaeozapus insignis, and 87 northern short-tailed shrews, Blarina brevicauda. We identified personality in all five of our target species, and through mixed-effects modelling we found that personality traits did not predict different aspects of trappability. Furthermore, trappability was not a repeatable measure (i.e. animals that were trap happy in one session were not necessarily trap happy throughout the trapping season). Our results suggest that trappability cannot be used as a proxy for personality. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many species of songbird, individuals sing multiple song types, some of which are shared with their neighbours. Individuals may also share syntactical rules that govern the transitions between different song types, but few studies have attempted to study this kind of sharing. Progress has been inhibited by a lack of statistical tools to compare song-type transitions among individuals. We present a straightforward method for comparing song transitions based on Markov transition matrices. The method calculates the number of mutually preferred song-type-to-different-song-type transitions found in the song sequences of two birds, then assesses whether that number is significantly greater than would be expected if the two birds ordered their songs independently of one another. We applied this method to song sequences from five songbird species. All pairwise comparisons among male Cassin's vireos, Vireo cassinii, showed significant similarity in song transitions, as did a minority of comparisons among Adelaide's warblers, Setophaga adelaidae, and one pair of marsh wrens, Cistothorus palustris. In contrast, dyads of rock wrens, Salpinctes obsoletus, and rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, did not share song-type transitions at levels exceeding chance. Interterritory distance was not significantly related to our measure of song transition similarity in any of our study species. These results provide evidence that interindividual similarity in song-type transitions is a trait that varies considerably among species. We discuss the potential drivers of similarity in song transitions, but note that assessing its evolutionary breadth will require a larger sample of species. The application of our method to additional species will provide a more comprehensive understanding of signal use and vocal interaction in songbirds.

AB The existence of widespread male same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) is puzzling: why does evolution allow costly homosexual activity to exist, when reproductive fitness is primarily achieved through heterosexual matings? Here, we used experimental evolution to understand why SSB occurs in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. By varying the adult operational sex ratio across 82-106 generations, we created divergent evolutionary regimes that selected for or against SSB depending upon its function. Male-biased (90:10 M:F) regimes generated strong selection on males from intrasexual competition, and demanded improved ability to locate and identify female mates. By contrast, Female-biased regimes (10:90 M:F) generated weak male-male competition, and relaxed selection on mate-searching abilities in males. If male SSB functions through sexually selected male-male competition, it should be more evident within Male-biased regimes, where reproductive competition is nine times greater, than in the Female-biased regimes. By contrast, if SSB exists due to inaccurate mate choice, it should be reduced in Male-biased regimes, where males experience stronger selection for improved mate finding and discrimination abilities than in the Female-biased regime, where most potential mating targets are female. Following these divergent evolutionary regimes, we measured male engagement in SSB through choice experiments simultaneously presenting female and male mating targets. Males from both regimes showed similar overall levels of mating activity. However, there were significant differences in levels of SSB between the two regimes: males that evolved through male-biased operational sex ratios located, mounted and mated more frequently with the female targets. By contrast, males from female-biased selection histories mated less frequently with females, exhibiting almost random choice between male and female targets in their first mating attempt. Following experimental evolution, we therefore conclude that SSB does not function through sexually selected male-male competition, but instead occurs because males fail to perfectly discriminate females as mates.

AB From a cognitive point of view, management and knowledge of social relationships is thought to be very challenging. Because of ecological and demographic constraints, relationships are likely to be prone to variation and hence need constant updating. Social network analysis is a potential tool to quantify the information that needs to be processed. However, despite the growing number of studies on social networks, few have focused on their dynamics and how they evolve across time. Here we present one of the rare studies that tests the influence of demographic variation on social relationships' stability through temporal analysis. Using field data collected on three wild groups of vervet monkeys, Chlor-ocebus aethiops, we first analysed the relationships' stability by running correlations between 3-month periods. Then, we investigated how natural demographic variation changed individual centralities (eigenvector) and strength of dyadic relationships within both grooming and proximity networks over a period of 2 years. In vervets, females are philopatric, while males emigrate from their natal group. Thus, we tested whether changes in demography had more influence on network centrality measures and relationship strength in females and their juveniles than in males. Correlations between periods yielded no evidence that predictability of future relationship quality declined with time from current relationship quality. In addition, male immigration was mostly responsible for increases in the core group members' centrality while male emigration had the opposite effect. Regarding dyadic relationships, we found inconsistent patterns that varied with respect to how age/sex and immigration/disappearance affected the network studied (grooming versus proximity). Our findings support the idea that social networks are dynamic structures that vary through time. Similar analyses on other species are needed to investigate which network features emerge as candidates responsible for variation in the complexity with which individuals keep track of relationships.

We aimed to determine whether members of small social groups, using the southern bamboo lemur, Hapalemur meridionalis, as a model, gain rank-related benefits. We first established a dominance hierarchy through a network-based analysis of win-loss interactions, which showed that adult females maintained social dominance within their groups, similar to many strepsirrhine species. To address whether dominant individuals gained rank-related benefits, we then explored how social dynamics may permit access to resting huddles, which provide a physiological benefit. Social thermoregulation, i.e. huddling, is a behavioural energy conservation mechanism, and among many mammals is a direct response to decreasing ambient temperatures. As such, huddling behaviour may have evolved among social animals because of its potential direct and indirect benefits. To examine the effect of dominance rank within small social groups on huddling inclusion, we used generalized linear mixed-effects models to predict the likelihood of huddling occurring during resting bouts from climatic (e.g. temperature, precipitation), social (e.g. affiliation, dominance rank, grooming) and reproductive (e.g. access, infant protection) variables. We found that lower temperatures, especially during shorter resting bouts, increased the likelihood of huddling. Grooming between partners with a high discrepancy in rank increased huddling. Additionally, huddling increased during the reproductive season, potentially offering greater opportunity for males to gain favour with sexually receptive females, and when new-borns were present, providing essential thermal maintenance and potential antipredator protection to infants. Together, our results suggest that even in small social groups, females gain rank-related benefits by controlling access to huddles, i.e. the intrinsic benefits of social thermoregulation.

AB The win-shift versus win-stay distinction supposes that foraging animals use one of two movement rules when searching for food: win-stay to return to locations where they previously found food and win-shift to avoid locations where they previously found food. Win-shift and win-stay rules describe, for example, the behaviour of rats foraging in a radial arm maze, the behaviour of animals in delayed matching and nonmatching to sample tasks, and the behaviour of nectarivorous birds feeding on depleting and replenishing nectar sources. The present study investigated whether black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, searching for food use win-shift and win-stay rules in response to different reward contingencies. Chickadees first searched multiple spatially dispersed sites for food hidden randomly in these sites, then after several minutes returned to find these sites replenished in the win-stay condition, or empty and other sites baited in the win-shift condition. Birds performed no better than chance at returning to baited sites in the win-stay condition or avoiding previously baited sites in the win-shift condition. Instead, chickadees used preferred search patterns regardless of the win-shift or win-stay contingencies they experienced. Search sequences, however, showed greater stereotypy under win-stay than under win-shift conditions even though the locations of baited sites were determined randomly. Chickadees are year-round residents in relatively small home ranges and may forage using well-established movement rules that, in our experiments, led to neither win-stay nor win-shift behaviour. The stereotypy of search does, however, appear to be influenced by win-stay and win-shift foraging outcomes. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Group-living animals use social information when making patch-joining/scrounging decisions. However, the extent to which they use finder's share (i.e. amount of food eaten in a patch before other individuals arrive) as a cue when making these decisions is unknown. It is likely that the removal of finder's share decreases patch attractiveness to scroungers. However, it is unclear how large a finder's share must be to reduce attractiveness, or how this varies with food availability. To answer these questions, we recorded the patch-joining decisions of dominant goats, Capra hircus, when presented with a choice between an artificial patch where finder's share had been removed by a subordinate patch holder (producer), and one where the patch holder had just started eating. We used time spent feeding by a patch holder (10, 30, 60 and 120 s) as an index of finder's share size, and tested this using three food availabilities (40 g, 100 g and 300 g). At low (40 g) and intermediate (100 g) food availabilities, scrounging goats avoided the finder's share patch once the patch holder had fed for >= 30 s (i.e. 25% and 17% of the food removed, respectively). However, at the highest food availability (300 g), these goats continued to join the finder's share patch even after the patch holder had fed for 120 s (18% removed). Ultimately, our results indicate that goats weigh up both food availability and the finder's share when making scrounging decisions. Nevertheless, finder's share removal was less important in patches with more food. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Offspring born to related parents often have lower fitness than those born to unrelated parents, a phenomenon termed inbreeding depression. While many species have been shown to rely on pre- and/or postcopulatory mate choice to avoid inbreeding, such research has focused largely on polyandrous rather than monandrous species. The absence of postcopulatory mate choice in monandrous species suggests that precopulatory mate choice should play a more important role in inbreeding avoidance. We used a monandrous wolf spider, Pardosa astrigera, as a model system to investigate whether (1) male spiders respond differently to sibling and nonsibling females; (2) female spiders respond differently to sibling versus nonsibling males; and (3) inbreeding affects females and their offspring. Male courtship behaviour was similar for sibling and nonsibling females; although females were less likely to mate with siblings, over half did mate successfully with them. Sibling-mated females produced fewer offspring from the first egg sac and fewer total offspring, but inbred offspring survived longer in a range of environments than their outbred counterparts. This suggests that the fitness costs of reduced fecundity in sibling-mated females may be offset by higher offspring survivorship. Our results highlight the importance of considering both parent and offspring fitness when addressing the costs of inbreeding, and are the first to document the impact of inbreeding on sexual behaviour and reproductive fitness in a monandrous spider.

AB The study of how animals respond to risk has had a strong influence on our understanding of animal behaviour. By risk, we refer to a situation where organisms must exploit a resource with an unstable quality. Animals may have different risk preferences: they may be risk seeking (e.g. prefer a gamble of 2 or 4 versus a safe bet of 3), risk averse or risk insensitive. Among invertebrates, bees are the most studied group in terms of risk preference. However, in eusocial insects such as bees and ants, the unit of selection is the colony. Thus, the risk preference of eusocial animals is best understood at the level of the group. More broadly, many group-living animals must make consensus decisions between options with varying risk. However, to our knowledge no study has yet set out to examine risk preference during collective decision making by groups. This study aimed to address this gap. Colonies of the ant Lasius niger were given access to two feeders, one offering a fixed 0.55 M sucrose solution and the other alternating every 3 min between 0.1 M and 1.0 M. Colonies almost always (26/28 trials) made a collective decision. While there was a small tendency for the variable feeder to be chosen if it initially offered 1 M sucrose, broadly speaking the fixed or variable feeders were equally likely to be chosen. Ant colonies thus showed risk neutrality during collective foraging decisions. Unexpectedly, and contrary to the classical understanding of pheromone-based collective decision making, the choice of feeder was only very weakly influenced by the initial quality of the variable feeder. We propose that risk preference during collective decision making by groups is a woefully understudied topic, and worthy of future work in both recruitment-based and nonrecruiting decision-making systems.

AB Individual animals differ consistently in their behaviour, thus impacting a wide variety of ecological outcomes. Recent advances in animal personality research have established the ecological importance of the multidimensional behavioural volume occupied by individuals and by multispecies communities. Here, we examine the degree to which the multidimensional behavioural volume of a group predicts the outcome of both intra-and interspecific interactions. In particular, we test the hypothesis that a population of conspecifics will experience low intraspecific competition when the population occupies a large volume in behavioural space. We further hypothesize that populations of interacting species will exhibit greater interspecific competition when one or both species occupy large volumes in behavioural space. We evaluate these hypotheses by studying groups of katydids (Scudderia nymphs) and froghoppers (Philaenus spumarius), which compete for food and space on their shared host plant, Solidago canadensis. We found that individuals in single-species groups of katydids positioned themselves closer to one another, suggesting reduced competition, when groups occupied a large behavioural volume. When both species were placed together, we found that the survival of froghoppers was greatest when both froghoppers and katydids occupied a small volume in behavioural space, particularly at high froghopper densities. These results suggest that groups that occupy large behavioural volumes can have low intraspecific competition but high interspecific competition. Thus, behavioural hypervolumes appear to have ecological consequences at both the level of the population and the community and may help to predict the intensity of competition both within and across species.

AB The distribution and connectivity of marine populations are largely dependent on biophysical factors affecting pelagic larval dispersal between spawning at adult spawning sites and settlement to juvenile nursery habitats. Behaviour and swimming ability of pelagic larvae are increasingly understood to influence patterns of dispersal, but it is unclear which sensory cues are involved and when during ontogeny these abilities first develop. Here we studied the early ontogenetic development of responses to olfactory cues from coastal and estuarine waters in larvae of two temperate estuarine-associated fish species, Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata, and mulloway, Argyrosomus japonicus, to determine when olfaction begins to influence dispersal. Olfactory responses to habitat-associated cues were not present when larvae first transitioned from nonswimming to swimming (indicated by flexion of the notochord), but emerged after ca. 7 days in a species-specific manner that was consistent across different cohorts. Based on general additive models (GAMs), age (in days posthatch) best explained the ontogenetic pattern in both species. The emergence of chemotactic responses coincides with an exponential increase in swimming endurance reported for these species. This suggests the existence of ontogenetic milestones during larval development that, once reached, trigger active influence on dispersal. Salinity and pH did not influence choice behaviour after these ontogenetic milestones; however, the presence of cues generated by seagrass harvested from the estuary habitat elicited strong responses in fish larvae consistent with species-specific habitat preferences, indicating an important role for aquatic vegetation in driving these behaviours.

AB Reproductive effort is an important aspect of life history as reproductive success is arguably the most important component of fitness. Males tend to compete for access to females and, in the process, expend their energetic capital on mate searching, male-male competition and courtship rather than directly on offspring. Red-sided garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, are an exceptional model for studying energetic costs of courtship and mating as they fast during the spring mating season, which segregates the cost of energy acquisition from the cost of courtship and mating. However, measuring an individual male's metabolic rate during courtship is complicated by the fact that male courtship behaviour in red-sided garter snakes is dependent on both the detection of a female sexual attractiveness pheromone and on facilitated courtship (i.e. vigorous courtship is only exhibited in the presence of other males). Thus, traditional techniques of placing a mask over the head of individuals would prevent male courtship behaviour, and single animals placed in a flow-through chamber would not yield ecologically realistic levels of courtship, which are only seen in the context of a mating aggregation in this species. Because of these difficulties, we placed groups of males in a flow-through metabolic chamber together with a single female whose respiratory gases were vented outside the chamber to yield a whole-group metabolic rate during competitive courtship. We also measured the standard metabolic rates (SMR) of the males individually for comparison with active metabolic rates. Conservative estimates of peak group metabolic rates during courtship are 10-20 times higher than resting group metabolic rate, which was 1.88 times higher than SMR. These measurements, coupled with the fact that these males are aphagous during the breeding, indicates that costs of courtship may be high for males and has implications for the male mating tactics in this system.

   PARADIGM
AB An ability to deceive conspecifics is thought to have favoured the evolution of large brains in social animals, but evidence that such behaviours require cognitive complexity is lacking. Tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.) have been documented to use false alarm calls during feeding in a manner that functions to deceive competitors. However, comparative evidence suggests that the production of vocalizations by nonhuman primates is largely underpinned by emotional mechanisms, calling into question more cognitive interpretations of this behaviour. To determine whether emotional states are plausibly necessary and sufficient to proximately explain deceptive alarm call production, we examined the association between self-directed behaviours (SDBs), as a proxy for anxiety, and the production of spontaneous false alarm calls among tufted capuchins. Specifically, we predicted that if anxiety is necessary for the production of false alarms, then individuals that produce spontaneous false alarms should exhibit more SDBs in those contexts in which they call. If anxiety is also sufficient to explain the false alarm call production, then we predicted that individuals that call more in a given context would show higher rates of SDBs in that context, and that high rates of calling would be temporally associated with high rates of SDBs. Our results support the contention that states of anxiety are necessary for an individual to spontaneously produce false alarms, but that such states are not sufficient to explain patterns of calling. The link between anxiety and deceptive calling thus appears complex, and cognitively based decision-making processes may play some role in call production.

AB Olfactory communication is the primary mode of communication for many mammals, yet research on this form of signalling is still largely descriptive in most species. Thus, despite the apparent importance of scent marking in the social lives of wild felids, experimental studies directly investigating the function of olfactory communication are lacking. We conducted scent presentation experiments to investigate whether wild African lions can discriminate another lion's social group and sex from a sample of its urine. Our results indicated that lion urine has the potential to signal depositor sex and social group, and that lions can use urine to discriminate males from females and residents from nonresidents. The response of lions to urine was also dependent on both the sex and age of the subject receiving the presentation. Female lions responded less frequently to urine from resident females than to either nonresident females or resident males. Males responded more strongly to urine from resident males than resident females, but did not appear to differentiate urine from nonresident and resident females. Observations of flehmen and further scent-marking responses from lions provide additional evidence that lion urine functions in scent marking. These results establish that urine scent-marks contain sufficient information for receivers to discriminate the sex and social affiliation of the signaller, and demonstrate the functional relevance of scent marking in African lions.

AB Increased human-induced environmental changes and global warming alter bird migration timing and routes. Recently, many Holarctic species, including white storks, Ciconia ciconia, were reported to overwinter at higher latitudes, closer to breeding grounds. We aimed to understand the causes and implications of this phenomenon by examining bird survival and behaviour during overwintering in Europe versus Africa. We compared GPS and body acceleration data of 54 juvenile (first-year) white storks that originated from the same European natal population and overwintered in Europe or Africa. All six juveniles that overwintered in Europe survived through their first year, which was significantly higher than only 38% of the 48 overwintering in the species' traditional grounds in Africa. During overwintering, storks in Europe differed from those in Africa by (1) reducing movement and foraging range, (2) spending less time flying and more time resting, thus using less energy (estimated from overall dynamic body acceleration) and (3) reducing foraging effort, while relying more on anthropogenic resources (landfills and agricultural areas). Timing affected overwintering site as juveniles that overwintered in Europe hatched and started migrating later. We emphasize, however, that late hatching by itself did not yield a survival benefit as not all late juveniles curtailed their migration. We suggest that wintering in Europe was less demanding compared to Africa which may explain the increased survival of juveniles that wintered in Europe. Our findings correspond to the general increase in the European wintering population of white storks, and shed light on the contemporary trend of shortened bird migration; a phenomenon with potentially broad ecological implications.

AB Nest materials used by animals can have profound effects on developing offspring. They can modify the bacterial and parasitic environment of the nest, and can influence parental investment through sexual signalling processes. In spotless starlings, Sturnus unicolor, green plants and feathers are known nest materials with such functions. The aim of our study was to experimentally assess their influence on nestlings' telomere length and attrition, which are good predictors of their survival prospects. In a full-factorial experiment, we explored these effects in two different populations, together with the potential effects of hatching date, ectoparasitism, bacterial environment and nestling growth. Telomere length and attrition largely depended on population identity and hatching date. After correcting for these effects, the addition of feathers resulted in higher rates of telomere attrition. The addition of plants did not affect nestling telomeres in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of green plants resulted in longer telomeres. Feather pigmentation also did not affect telomere length or attrition in general, but did in interaction with location: in Hueneja, the experimental addition of unpigmented feathers resulted in nestlings with longer telomeres and lower attrition rates. Moreover, prevalence of staphylococci on the skin of 8-day-old nestlings was negatively related to telomere lengths of fledglings. Taken together, these results suggest a direct link between nest material composition and nestling telomere length and dynamics. This relationship could be partially mediated by the antimicrobial and/or antiparasitic properties of nest materials or by sexual signalling processes. We discuss possible roles of maternal effects, parasites, immunity and nestling growth in explaining these experimental effects. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Rats, mice and other rodents are well-known for their ability to solve complex spatial tasks, such as learning to negotiate complicated mazes. This ability might be an adaptation for the fossorial habit that characterizes most rodents, but the scarcity of data from other taxa prevents us from confirming this hypothesis. We tested guppies, Poecilia reticulata, for their ability to navigate a maze consisting of six consecutive T-junctions. Guppies learned to solve the complex maze, and both the number of errors and the time to exit significantly decreased during the training period, which consisted of 30 trials over 5 test days. Guppies reached 68% correct responses on the first day of training and they exceeded 80% correct responses by the last day of training. We found no difference between a condition in which colour cues made each T-junction distinct from the others and a condition with no such cues. In contrast with the male advantage in spatial tasks previously observed in guppies, we found a small but significant female advantage in complex maze learning. Our work suggests that the ability to learn complex mazes is not a prerogative of those species that inhabit burrow systems such as mice and rats, but it might be common in vertebrates.

AB The potential for populations to undergo adaptive evolution depends on individual variation in traits under selection and how multiple traits are correlated. While fitness relates to the performance of animals in the wild, most of the research on evolutionary potential of behavioural traits has used captive or mesocosm settings, especially with aquatic organisms. We investigated the individual level consistency (personalities) and correlations (behavioural syndromes) of fitness-related behavioural traits displayed by a harvested marine fish in the natural environment, and the potential of such individual level behaviour to constrain adaptive evolution. For this, we acoustically tracked 303 individuals of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, over a period of 3 years from two populations in southern Norway. We then estimated repeatability and correlations between four behavioural traits: diel vertical migration, activity, home range and dispersal. Average autonomy was estimated as a measure of the potential of the observed behavioural syndromes to constrain evolution. We found a moderate to high individual consistency in all behavioural traits (mean repeatability 0.41, range 0.22-0.66) suggesting that they reflect fish personalities. Also, behavioural traits were structured into behavioural syndromes, where one population displayed a more integrated behavioural syndrome (all the four traits correlated) than the other (only home range and dispersal correlated). In both populations, the magnitude of these behavioural syndromes could potentially constrain evolution, as revealed by average autonomy values significantly below 1. Our study provides strong empirical support to the idea that natural and human-induced selection on behavioural traits can indeed drive adaptive evolution, and, further, that such evolutionary responses may be constrained by the correlational structure among multiple traits.

AB Mate choice is essential in most animals, as a good choice of mating partner largely determines reproductive success. Much evidence shows that olfactory cues play an important role in mate choice. However, the integration of chemical, visual and acoustic cues, often used when both partners meet, makes it hard to test whether olfaction alone can mediate reproductive decisions. Interestingly, several invertebrates have adopted a mating system where males deposit their sperm (packed in spermatophores) in the environment for females to pick up with no visual contact between the sexes. In this case the male cue is conveyed by the spermatophore only. Earlier studies on a species with indirect sperm transfer, the soil arthropod Orchesella cincta, showed that, even in these animals, female choice exists. In this study, we tested whether chemical cues provided by the spermatophores mediate this female choice. Chemical analysis of spermatophore extracts revealed that (Z)-14-tricosenol is the main compound in the male spermatophores and this compound attracted females in olfactometer bioassays. Our finding suggests that (Z)-14-tricosenol is thus a pheromone component, which is sufficient for female attraction. This is the first report of a spermatophore-associated sex pheromone in a species performing indirect sperm transfer. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although the number of studies documenting animal personalities has increased over the last decade, ecological validations of animal personality traits remain relatively rare in the behavioural ecology literature. I examined whether wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, were consistent in their responses to diverse novel objects, and tested whether experimentally assayed boldness predicted the number of times individuals were observed inspecting naturally occurring snakes at close range. Boldness was repeatable across three novel object tests, and boldness scores were correlated with the number of snake inspections. An additional novel object, a toy lizard, elicited antipredator behaviour and was reclassed as a potential predator stimulus; both novel object boldness and the number of snake inspections predicted approach of this item. Age-sex class differences in boldness and in predator approach and inspection were found to be highly consistent across these different contexts. Subadult males were bolder than adult females and had higher snake inspection counts. These age-sex differences fit well with expected variation in risk-reward ratios of exploratory risk-taking behaviour considered within a life history framework for this species. The results of this study provide a crucial ecological validation of using novel object tests to assay boldness in a wild primate. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The concept of social dominance has been used in a plethora of studies to assess animal behaviour and relationships between individuals for nearly a century. Nevertheless, a standard approach does not yet exist to assess dominance in species that have a nonlinear or weakly linear hierarchical structure. We amassed 316 published data sets and show that 73.7% of the data sets and 90.3% of 103 species that we reviewed do not have a strongly linear structure. Herein, we present a novel method, ADAGIO, for assessing the structure of dominance networks. ADAGIO computes dominance hierarchies, in the form of directed acyclic graphs, to represent the dominance relations of a given group of animals. Thus far, most methods for computing dominance ranks assume implicitly that the dominance relation is a total order of the individuals in a group. ADAGIO does not assume or require this to be always true, and is hence more appropriate for analysing dominance hierarchies that are not strongly linear. We evaluated our approach against other frequently used methods, I&SI, David's score and Elo-rating, on 12 000 simulated data sets and on 279 interaction matrices from published, empirical data. The results from the simulated data show that ADAGIO achieves a significantly smaller error, and hence performs better when assigning ranks than other methods. Additionally, ADAGIO generated accurate dominance hierarchies for empirical data sets with a high index of linearity. Hence, our findings suggest that ADAGIO is currently the most reliable method to assess social dominance in gregarious animals living in groups of any size. Furthermore, since ADAGIO was designed to be generic, its applicability has the potential to extend beyond dominance data.

AB Being choosy can allow animals to find and identify the best resources or safest locations to rear offspring. Despite these benefits, individuals vary in the degree to which they are choosy. One explanation is that choosiness represents a costly form of offspring investment and is part of a suite of life history trade-offs. We examined trade-offs between choosiness and fecundity in the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. To test the prediction that choosiness is negatively correlated with fecundity, we presented female cabbage white butterflies with an array of host plant leaves that varied in nutrient content and conspecific density. Butterflies preferentially laid eggs on leaves with higher nutrient content and fewer conspecific models. In addition, butterflies that were choosier with regard to plant nutrition also tended to be choosy in terms of conspecific density. Choosy females were less fecund, with fecundity measured as the sum of eggs laid over 3 days plus all remaining mature eggs in their abdomen. These results are consistent with the idea that life history trade-offs include investment in costly behavioural traits that require time and energy, such as choosiness or cognition.

AB Female social dominance over males can only be found in a small number of mammalian species, but is unusually concentrated among Malagasy lemurs. Three major hypotheses are currently discussed to explain this phenomenon, namely the energy conservation hypothesis, sleeping site hypothesis and ancestral lemur condition hypothesis. Since proximate determinants of female dominance have rarely been studied, this study aimed to investigate the influence of factors connected to these hypotheses, focusing on sex-specific differences in energy requirements and group composition in two closely related nocturnal lemur species. More specifically, the effects of species, season and age on agonistic behaviour and the expression of female dominance were tested, while the effects of individuality, body mass, breeding experience and habituation were controlled. Seasonal variations in intersexual dominance relationships were investigated in captivity in grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus, a prominent female-dominant species, and Goodman's mouse lemurs, Microcebus lehilahytsara, whose agonistic behaviour was studied for the first time. Data were collected during a series of encounter experiments between one male and one female (15 dyads of M. murinus and nine of M. lehilahytsara) during the reproductive and nonreproductive seasons. Moderate female dominance was expressed in both species with females winning the majority of conflicts year round, independently of context. However, effects of season and species were found in conflict rates, in the probability for females to win conflicts, and in the number of dominant females. Moreover, the age difference between dyad partners and the breeding experience of females influenced whether conflicts were decided in favour of males or females. It can be concluded that female dominance probably represents an ancestral trait in mouse lemurs and it is proposed that its evolution might have been driven by sex-specific energetic constraints prevailing in the species-specific ancestral habitats, and may moreover be influenced by the species-specific social organization.

AB Phenotypic plasticity allows individuals to adjust reproductive timing in response to variation in the environment but little is known about how other factors, such as habitat quality, social environment and experience, may influence adjustments in the timing of breeding. We evaluated intrinsic (female age), environmental and social factors influencing laying date plasticity and assessed the effect of laying date on reproductive success in a population of grey jays, Perisoreus canadensis, over nearly four decades (1978-2015). Grey jays rely on stored food during their late-winter nesting season, a unique life history context to study plasticity in reproductive timing. Overall, females tended to lay eggs earlier in response to higher prelaying temperatures and advanced laying date at similar rates over their lives. Male age interacted with both temperature and female age to influence laying date. Females mated to older males were more likely to breed earlier at lower temperatures than females mated to younger males but there was little effect of male age under warmer conditions. Similarly, younger females mated to older males were more likely to breed earlier than younger females mated to younger males but there was little effect of male age when females were older. Across all years, earlier laying relative to other breeders in the population led to higher probability of nest success and summer survival for dominant juveniles. Our results suggest that individual females adjust laying date in response to temperature and provide the first evidence that male experience plays an important, and probably underappreciated, role in how females adjust their timing of breeding over their lives and with respect to annual variation in the environment.

AB Prey often modify their behaviours to diminish predation risk, but the persistence of such behavioural changes are not well understood. We investigated the effects of predation risk in the aquatic mollusc Aplysia californica to determine whether various natural aversive stimuli alter the expression of feeding behaviour (i.e. bites) over short-term (15 min), intermediate-term (2 h) and long-term (24 h) periods. Aplysia were presented with a variety of natural aversive stimuli that are indicative of predation risk, including exposure to the spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus (a natural predator), the blue crab Callinectes sapidus (a novel predator), and the defensive secretions ink and opaline that are normally released by Aplysia when attacked. Feeding was significantly suppressed immediately after Aplysia were exposed to ink but not to opaline. Additionally, several stimuli, including exposure to lobsters, ink, opaline and attacks from crabs, suppressed feeding, but only for a short time (i. e. 15 min) after the end of the stimulus. No single-exposure treatment elicited intermediate (2 h) or long-term (24 h) changes in feeding, and multiple exposures to ink did not induce long-term feeding suppression. Thus, changes in feeding behaviour in response to predation risk cues appear short-lived in Aplysia, unlike feeding suppression after electric shocks that suppress biting behaviour over longer periods. Since Aplysia possess chemical defences to defend against consumers, it is perhaps unnecessary or too costly to maintain feeding suppression after risk subsides.

AB The evolution of sociality is often accompanied by nutritional conflicts and the evolution of mechanisms to resolve them. The foraging behaviour of eusocial animals such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, is generally considered to be largely regulated by the colony nutritional state. Previous work based on the information primacy hypothesis has however found that honeybee foragers explore (sample resources) and exploit (consume resources) in accordance with their individual nutritional state. We therefore hypothesized that individual and colony nutritional states differ in their influence on individuals of different behavioural phenotypes such as dancers and followers, who are akin to producers and scroungers, respectively. This leads to the prediction that these two behavioural groups will differ with respect to their exploration-exploitation trade-off and in terms of how they prioritize individual and colony nutritional states. We tested our predictions by creating a mismatch between individual and colony nutritional states. Our results show that dancers and followers do not differ in their levels of exploration and exploitation, but dancers are more responsive to colony nutritional state than are followers with regard to managing their exploration-exploitation trade-off. We discuss these results in the context of how these two behavioural phenotypes may differ in their sensitivity to the different nutritional pathways regulating worker behaviour in a eusocial colony and the evolution of sociality in general.

AB An ecological trap occurs when animals prefer to settle in poor-quality habitats even though alternative high-quality habitats are available. Thus, to find evidence of a trap one must show (1) a habitat preference and (2) a mismatch between the settlement decision and reproduction or survival. However, demonstrations of traps in the wild are currently limited because the misleading cues have to be identified and are usually difficult to manipulate experimentally. Places where humans transform habitats, such as urbanized areas, are particularly prone to this ecological phenomenon. Here we tested whether the size of a human-made structure (artificial cavities) can induce maladaptive breeding responses via an ecological trap mechanism in an urban secondary-cavity nesting bird, the great tit, Parus major. Previous studies showed that great tits prefer to breed in large cavities; cavity size is thus used as a cue in nest site selection. Reproductive investment in great tits has also been shown to be influenced by the breeding cavity size. However, this behaviour can only be adaptive if cavity size matches the quality of the breeding habitat. This is not necessarily the case in urbanized environments where natural habitat has been removed or breeding habitat modified. We performed a cavity choice experiment, providing an opportunity for great tits to choose between three cavity size options, and monitored their subsequent breeding attempts. We found that urban great tits preferred the largest artificial cavities for breeding when they could choose between small, medium-sized and large cavities. Individuals from the largest cavities also invested more in egg production, yet had a lower fledging success than those from medium-sized cavities, experimentally showing a trap mechanism in free-living animals. With this study, we shed light on maladaptation associated with human-transformed habitat. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In vertebrates, brain functional asymmetries are widespread and increase brain performance. Some species of fishes are known to have brain asymmetries; however, little information is available on brain lateralization in coral reef fishes and the impact this could have during the recruitment phase. In this study, soldierfish, Myripristis pralinia, at the larval and juvenile stage recognized conspecifics through visual cues. Larvae with the ablation of either the right or left telencephalic hemisphere lost the attraction towards conspecific cues. In contrast, juveniles with the ablation of the right ( but not left) telencephalic hemisphere still displayed a preference towards conspecific visual cues. These results suggest the left telencephalic hemisphere is responsible for the lateralization process used in the visual recognition of coral reef fish juveniles. The determinism of lateralized perception of conspecifics during fish ontogeny may be a consequence of genetic factors, linked with the metamorphosis processes and/or environmental factors such as predation at recruitment.

AB Optimal foraging theory makes clear predictions about the benefits of maximizing energetic returns per unit of foraging effort. However, predictions become less clear when animals belong to symbioses that would be destabilized by such foraging decisions. For instance, leafcutter ants are dominant herbivores in Neotropical ecosystems that harvest fresh vegetation and convert it into compost used to cultivate specialized fungus for food. Individual foragers have long been assumed to supplement their fungal diets by harvesting liquid nectar outside the symbiosis, although this has not been demonstrated in the field, and would probably destabilize the fine-tuned farming systems. By dissecting liquid storage organs in foragers of four sympatric Panamanian leafcutter ant species we found that liquid foraging is not a general strategy in the field. Moreover, while over 40% of these foragers returned to their nests without leaf fragments, these unladen ants were not more likely to carry liquids. Instead, we found support for a newly formulated 'lunchbox hypothesis' because most workers exited nests for foraging trips with midguts full of liquids that were depleted (assimilated and transferred to hindguts) if workers returned with a leaf fragment in the field or transported a load in laboratory experiments. Thus, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of external nectar foraging, these results provide a novel mechanism promoting symbiotic stability, as fungi provide fuel for foragers to harvest more substrate for fungal crop production.

AB Delayed dispersal of offspring from the natal territory is an important process in the evolution of cooperative breeding. Ecological constraints such as habitat saturation can promote delayed dispersal. Thus far, the role of predation risk in the evolution of cooperative breeding systems has received less attention, although it is understood as an important ecological factor shaping dispersal patterns and social structure in animals. To bridge this gap, we analysed group structure and dispersal patterns of helpers within a population of the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus obscurus. We conducted behavioural observations for a period of 3 months at two study sites within this population, which differed in predation risk and availability of unoccupied space. Furthermore, by combining field observations with molecular analyses, we assessed group structure to unravel the dispersal patterns of helpers. At the high predation risk location, we found that helpers (1) had a lower dispersal propensity, (2) dispersed shorter distances and (3) were generally larger. Furthermore, molecular analyses and body size measurements suggest that helpers may stay longer in the natal territory under high predation risk than under low predation risk. Groups contained more helpers in the high predation risk site, which indicates that high predation pressure leads to delayed dispersal of helpers. Unoccupied potential dispersal areas were larger in the high predation risk site, suggesting that habitat saturation did not account for the dispersal patterns. Our results suggest that predation pressure is the main factor limiting the dispersal of helpers in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish N. obscurus, and might be overlooked in other studies focusing on the evolution of cooperative breeding systems.

AB Humans and animals show cooperative behaviour, but our understanding of cooperation among unrelated laboratory animals is limited. A classic test of cooperation is the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game, where two players receive varying payoffs for cooperation or defection in repeated trials. To determine whether unrelated rats cooperate in the IPD, we tested pairs of rats making operant responses to earn food reward in 25 trials/day. The operant chamber was bisected by a metal screen with a retractable lever and pellet dispenser on each side. When levers extended, rats had 2 s to respond. Mutual cooperation (Reward) delivered three pellets each, mutual defection (Punishment) provided no pellets, and unilateral defection (Temptation) gave five pellets to the defector, while the partner (Sucker) received none. In eight pairs of males (RM-) and females (RF-), cooperation was defined by withholding a response. In seven pairs of RM+ males, cooperation was defined by responding on the lever. In males, food restriction significantly inhibited both cooperation and pellets received. There was no effect of dominance status. Males and females made similar numbers of responses under ad libitum feeding. However, neither food restriction nor dominance status affected responses in females. Rats were subsequently tested for reciprocity in 24 alternating trials/day. A response on the lever within 5 s delivered three pellets to the partner. Females made significantly more responses for their cage-mate than males. Responses within pairs were significantly correlated for males, but not for females. For both sexes, responses declined significantly when paired with an unfamiliar partner who never reciprocated ('bad stooge'). These results demonstrate that rats working for food show cooperation in IPD and direct reciprocity. Their responses depend on food availability and responses of their partner.

AB Avian brood parasites lay their eggs in the nests of other species, imposing high costs on their hosts. In theory, this should select for the evolution of defences against parasitism in hosts, yet eviction of parasite eggs or chicks is absent in many host species. One such host is the yellow-rumped thornbill, Acanthiza chrysorrhoa, the primary host of the shining bronze-cuckoo, Chalcites lucidus, in Australia. Here we tested whether the lack of egg and chick rejection in yellow-rumped thornbills has led to the evolution of alternative defences against brood parasitism. We provide evidence that this host has evolved two types of frontline defences. First, yellow-rumped thornbills responded to the presence of a cuckoo mount near the nest with mobbing behaviour and by occupying their dome-shaped nests, potentially as a means of blocking the small entrance hole. Second, we show that brood parasitism imposes directional selection for early breeding on the yellow-rumped thornbill and that yellow-rumped thornbills show a concomitant shift in their breeding phenology, breeding earlier than both congeneric and sympatric species. Our results highlight the importance of studying apparently defenceless hosts in order to identify alternative defence strategies. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Interspecific patterns of space use in mobile animals have been the subject of considerable study, with allometric slopes often varying between 0.63 and 1.36. Both the slopes and intercepts of these relationships have been typically related to the energetic requirements of the focal animal, in relation to the amount of energy available in the environment. However, other explanations for these patterns are possible, including the ability of the focal animal to move about and/or defend a home range. To provide insight into this issue, we investigated the allometry of patch defence in convict cichlids, Amatitlania siquia, in a laboratory setting while controlling for energetic requirements. By manipulating the distance between two patches of food (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 95 cm), we estimated the maximum diameter of an ephemeral territory for 15 dominant fish that differed in body size by almost 40-fold. As expected, dominant fish were less able to defend and monopolize the food as the distance between the patches increased. Furthermore, larger fish were able to defend larger territories than smaller fish. The allometric slope of 1.18 in our study was remarkably similar to the interspecific slopes of home range or territory size in the literature for a broad range of vertebrate taxa. While there are likely multiple causes for the interspecific patterns of space use, our results suggest that the mobility of the defender is just as likely an explanation as energetic requirements.

AB Parasitic infection or tissue consumption by parasitoids typically leads to several phenotypic alterations in hosts, including distinct changes in behavioural, morphological, or life history traits. Some of these changes may not result solely from host responses, but actively induced changes by parasites/parasitoids to manipulate the host to acquire some benefit (e.g. parasite/parasitoid survivorship or dispersal ability). Field experiments investigating the effects of host behavioural alterations on parasite or parasitoid survivorship and the mechanisms involved in these changes are important for confirmation of behavioural manipulation. In the present study, we examined web design modification in the host spider species Cyclosa fililineata and Cyclosa morretes, which are attacked by the polysphinctine ectoparasitoid wasps Polysphincta sp. nr. purcelli and Polysphincta janzeni, respectively. We tested whether changes in orb spider web design (1) result from nutritional restrictions imposed by parasitoids and (2) increase the chances of adult wasp emergence from the cocoon. Furthermore, we describe changes in web design consistent with parasitoid larval development. Results, for both spider species, showed that web design modifications occurred only during the night preceding host spider death, and that modifications involved a reduction in the number of spirals and radii of orb webs. Food restriction did not generate web design modification, suggesting that observed changes in host behaviour resulted from direct actions of parasitoid larvae rather than as a by-product of nutritional deficiencies. Rain events were the major factor causing web rupture and subsequent parasitoid mortality. Modifications in web design reduced the frequency of web ruptures, increasing parasitoid adult emergence, and thus survivorship probability, during the pupal stage. These results confirm that web modifications by spiders are adaptive to parasitoid wasps. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maternal stress can have long-term negative consequences for offspring learning performance. However, it is unknown whether these maternal effects extend to the ability of offspring to apply previously learned information to new situations. In this study, we first demonstrate that juvenile threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, are indeed capable of generalizing an association between a colour and a food reward learned in one foraging context to a new foraging context (i.e. they can apply previously learned knowledge to a new situation). Next, we examined whether this ability to generalize was affected by maternal predator stress. We manipulated whether mothers were repeatedly chased by a model predator while yolking eggs (i.e. before spawning) and then assessed the learning performance of their juvenile offspring in groups and pairs using a colour discrimination task that associated a colour with a food reward. We found that maternal predator exposure affected the tendency of offspring to use social cues: offspring of predator-exposed mothers were faster at copying a leader's behaviour towards the rewarded colour than offspring of unexposed mothers. However, once the colour-reward association had been learned, offspring of predator-exposed and unexposed mothers were equally able to generalize their learned association to a new foraging task. These results suggest that offspring of predator-exposed mothers might be able to overcome learning deficits caused by maternal stress by relying more on social cues.

AB Anthropogenic noise of variable temporal patterns is increasing in both marine and freshwater systems. Aquatic animals often rely on sounds for communication and orientation, which may therefore become more difficult. Predator-prey interactions may be affected by masking of auditory cues, sound-related disturbance or attentional interference. Here, we investigated the impact on both predator and prey for zebrafish, Danio rerio, preying on water fleas, Daphnia magna. We experimentally raised ambient sound levels in an aquarium and tested four sound conditions that varied in temporal pattern: continuous, fast and slow regular intermittent and irregular intermittent, which we compared with ambient sound levels with no extra exposure. We found no effects on water flea swimming speed or depth but there was an increasing number of individual zebrafish with an increased number of startle responses, especially to the intermittent sound treatments, which was also reflected in a significant increase in zebrafish swimming speed, but not in any change in zebrafish swimming depth. Discrimination in attacking edible water fleas or inedible duckweed particles was low for the zebrafish and unaffected by sound exposure, but foraging was affected in two ways: intermittent sounds delayed the initial acceleration response and all treatments caused a rise in handling error. These insights confirm that elevated sound levels, and especially intermittent conditions, may affect predator-prey interactions. Our results apply to laboratory conditions but call for outdoor studies that go beyond single-species effects. If acoustic impact of human activities extends to multiple species and their interactions, natural sound conditions may turn out to be important for the stability and dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.

AB The ability to discriminate among individuals, or among classes of individuals, can provide animals with important fitness benefits. Although several mechanisms for discrimination are possible, most require animals to show stable phenotypic variation that reflects their identity or their membership in a particular class (e.g. sex, mate, kin). For territorial animals that rarely interact physically, vocalizations could serve as long-distance signals that facilitate discrimination. In this study, we tested whether the territorial rattle vocalizations of North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, are repeatable, and whether they could hence provide the basis for multiple types of discrimination. We measured four structural features from two rattles from each of 76 marked squirrels. All four features were repeatable, which is consistent with territorial rattles being individually distinctive. We then conducted a playback experiment to determine whether squirrels use rattles for discrimination. Specifically, we tested whether squirrels discriminate between the rattles of neighbours and non-neighbours, and kin (coefficient of relatedness, r >= 0.25) and non-kin (r < 0.125). Following a 2 x 2 factorial design, we broadcast a rattle from a non-neighbouring nonkin individual to 15 subjects, from a neighbouring nonkin individual to 14 subjects, from a non-neighbouring kin individual to 11 subjects, and from a neighbouring kin individual to 13 subjects. Subjects did not discriminate between the rattles of neighbours and non-neighbours, but did respond differently to the rattles of kin and nonkin. Specifically, squirrels were significantly more likely to produce a rattle of their own in response to the broadcasted rattles of nonkin versus the broadcasted rattles of kin. This result demonstrates that red squirrels can use territorial vocalizations for kin discrimination. It also suggests that they are more tolerant of territorial intrusions by kin.

AB Cognitive mechanisms underlying the choice of movement patterns between resource sites for nonhuman primates are not well understood. Specifically, the influence of landscape features on decision making and spatial memory of naturally ranging animals has not been explicitly investigated. We evaluated three models of bearded capuchin monkey, Sapajus libidinosus, movement decisions that incorporated varying degrees of landscape and memory influences, and we conducted a field experiment using a novel call-back technique to test these influences. The movements and spatial decisions of the monkeys were modelled between temporal stop points and spatial change points during natural travel using straight-line path, a minimum-resistance path and landscape-perceiving path models. For these movement models, resistance was calculated as the inverse of habitat suitability, a surface based on the natural movement patterns of the study group. Of the three models, natural travel most closely resembled the straight-line path model in its landscape resistance, but not in its geometry. This result indicates that while the monkeys travel in zones of low resistance, they do not minimize distance or landscape resistance between travel nodes. When monkeys were called to an artificial resource site using the call-back experiment, their travel was more linear and higher in landscape resistance. The limited quantity and high quality of the food resource in the artificial resource sites may have influenced the nature of the monkeys' travel in these experiments. We present the advantages and challenges of the call-back method of experimental analysis of animal movement and we conclude that future analyses of spatial cognition should include consideration of landscape context.

AB Female mate preferences, male mate preferences and male-male competition can all potentially play roles in promoting speciation by sexual selection. The orangethroat darter, Etheostoma spectabile, is a sexually dichromatic fish in which males compete for access to females. We quantified male and female responses to conspecific versus heterospecific fish under normal light, dim light and blue light, the last of which impaired colour perception. We found that behavioural isolation was likely mediated primarily by male behavioural discrimination against heterospecific fish, with females showing no evident mate preferences. Furthermore, male aggression towards conspecific rivals was reduced in blue light, suggesting that the evolution of male coloration may contribute to speciation through male-male interactions.

AB In animals, interspecific interference competition is often associated with their aggressive behaviour. The intensity of interspecific aggression and the outcomes of interference competition between closely related species might be substantially modified by copying of vocal signals used in territory defence. Here we tested the hypothesis that song convergence observed in a secondary contact zone of two songbird species, the common nightingale. Luscinia megarhynchos, and the thrush nightingale, Luscinia luscinia, might be an adaptive response to interspecific interference competition. These species are morphologically and ecologically very similar. However, the thrush nightingale is slightly larger and several lines of evidence indicate its competitive dominance. In the secondary contact zone most thrush nightingales incorporate common nightingale song types in their repertoires. Using playback experiments, we evaluated the strength of nonvocal aggressive responses of both species to conspecific and heterospecific stimuli. The species did not differ in aggressive responses to a heterospecific stimulus, suggesting that competitive dominance is not associated with higher interspecific aggressiveness in nightingales. Interestingly, while the common nightingale reacted significantly more aggressively to the conspecific than the heterospecific stimulus, the thrush nightingale showed similarly strong responses to both stimuli. We suggest that this similar level of interspecific and conspecific aggression in the thrush nightingale results from mixed singing of this species in sympatry, as males may not distinguish con-specifics from heterospecifics by song alone. Our results are consistent with the concept of convergent agonistic character displacement. According to this theory, vocal convergence might be adaptive in species that overlap broadly in resource use, as it leads to better distinction of territory boundaries between the species and thus reduces the level of interspecific competition.

AB Theory predicts that males should be choosier when encountering potential mates simultaneously rather than sequentially because there is no opportunity cost. Consequently, when mate encounter rates vary across space and time males might benefit from plasticity in mate preferences to match prevailing social conditions, preferring high-quality mates when females are encountered frequently and showing no preferences when females are encountered rarely. Here we investigated how encounter type (i.e. simultaneous or sequential) alters male mate preferences for female size in the mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki. We found that male mosquitofish attempted to mate with a relatively large female significantly more often than a relatively small female when presented with two females simultaneously. In contrast, males showed no such preference when sequentially presented with two females. Further, males attempted more copulations with absolutely larger females irrespective of encounter type. Despite these behavioural patterns, however, neither male insemination success nor the number of sperm transferred was influenced by female size or the encounter type. Our results provide support for the prediction that male mate choice is stronger during simultaneous choice encounters, but suggest that insemination success in G. holbrooki is partly under female control.

AB In many species, specialized defence traits and strategies are crucial for surviving enemy attacks or securing resources. In numerous social insect lineages, a morphologically and behaviourally distinct soldier caste specializes in colony defence, with larger foragers typically engaging most in the aggressive defence of the colony against external threats. We hypothesized, however, that specialization in aggression could show vastly different patterns in the context of the defence against small intranidal parasites that prey on brood. This is because we expected that small, intranidal nurse workers could be better suited to defend against these parasitic myrmecophiles (=ant associates) due to their better matching size, high encounter rate and the high task switching costs that would occur if foragers had to carry out this task. Here, we present data that support this hypothesis from a study on specialization in defence against two parasites in the red wood ant Formica rufa. In particular, we show that small workers displayed the strongest aggressive behaviour towards the parasitic rove beetle Thiasophila angulata and the spider Thyreosthenius biovatus, and present evidence that small workers were better at preventing brood predation than larger workers. In addition, there was worker task specialization in defensive behaviour, with nurses and workers at nest entrances being more aggressive towards T. angulata than extranidal foragers. We argue that this context-dependent specialization in aggression and nest defence was likely to be important in favouring the pronounced worker polymorphism observed in both this and other ant species and discuss our findings in relation to models for the evolution of division of labour and caste polymorphism in insect societies.

AB Long-lived animals across a range of taxa display substantial social complexity that often includes hierarchical modularity of their social structures. A complete understanding of how their social systems function is achieved by understanding not only how individuals interact with each other, but also how their social groups relate to one another. Here, we examine social relationships across two levels of the hierarchical social structure of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus. Using an unparalleled data set of nine social units collected across a 6-year study (2005-2010), we calculate social differentiation (0 when relationships are completely homogeneous, and greater than 1 when there is considerable diversity among the relationships) to focus on the diversity of social relationships between the fundamental level of social structure, the unit. We contrast these patterns by comparing patterns between individuals within these units. Social relationships within units are diverse, with a mean social differentiation (S) +/- SE of 0.80 +/- 0.05 among adult females and 0.91 +/- 0.05 when calves are included. Social differentiation was also high between units (1.11 +/- 0.06). In addition, we identified long-term patterns of association between units that appear consistent over time, in two cases across more than a decade. Among the nine units, there were three strongly bonded pairs. Social preferences create complexity and diversity in the types of relationships formed at multiple levels of sperm whale social structure and across various timescales. Individuals show preferences for each other across hours, days and years; units form strong long-term bonds across decades; and vocal dialects mark social segregations between sperm whale cultures across generations.

AB Studies investigating the same paradigm but employing different methods are often directly compared in the literature. One such paradigm used to assess behavioural flexibility in animals is reversal learning. Commonly, these studies require individuals to learn the reward contingency of either solid objects presented on the ground or images presented on a touchscreen. Once learned, these contingencies are swapped. Researchers often refer to trials required to reach learning criteria from different studies, to compare the flexibility of different species, but rarely take methodological differences into account. A direct evaluation of the validity of such comparisons is lacking. To address this latent question, we confronted kea, an alpine parrot species of New Zealand and known for its behavioural flexibility, with a standard reversal learning paradigm on the touchscreen and a standard reversal learning paradigm with solid objects. The kea required significantly more trials to reach criterion in the acquisition and the reversal on the touchscreen. Also, the absolute increase in the number of trials required for the reversal was significantly greater on the touchscreen. This indicates that it is not valid to compare learning speed across studies that do not correspond in the addressed methodology. Taking into account the kea's ecology and explorative nature we discuss stimulus abstraction (limited depth cues and tactile stimulus feedback) and the spatial relation between reward and stimulus on the touchscreen as possible causes for decreased inhibition in this condition. Contrary to the absolute increase in number of trials required for the reversal, the increase in relation to the acquisition was greater with solid objects. This highlights the need for further research on the mechanisms involved causing methodology-dependent differences, some of which we discuss, in order to increase the validity of interpretations across studies and in respect to the subject's ecology.

AB Neuromodulators have been shown to influence behavioural response in a context-dependent manner. To understand the nature of this effect we presented honeybee foragers with a foraging choice problem and fed them octopamine, its antagonist (mianserin), or simply sucrose (treatments). The test situation caused bees to deal with both cost variable (effort or work to reach the reward) and reward variable (sucrose molarity) problems simultaneously, where cost was varied by altering stamen length. High work (cost) was paired with a high reward, and low work was paired with a low reward, using blue versus white flowers as a colour cue. Regardless of treatment, roughly a third of the control bees maximized energy gain by choosing high-reward/high-work flowers (energy maximizers), but another third of the foragers consistently chose flowers that minimized work and consequently minimized reward (work minimizers). The remaining foragers seemed unable to solve the reward-cost problem and showed high fidelity to a flower colour (colour constant) even though doing so resulted in a change in cost and reward between experimental test phases. Ingestion of octopamine or its antagonist did not alter the frequency of each type of response in the forager population. However, error rate was altered in bees following energy maximization or work minimization strategies when ingesting octopamine or its antagonist. Although octopamine and mianserin affect the behaviour of honeybees, they do not appear to determine the foraging strategy of individuals. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Consistent individual differences in behaviour observed within a population are termed 'personality'. Studies of personality typically test subjects in isolation, ignoring the potential effects of the social environment, which might restrict the expression of individual behaviour via conformity, or enhance it by facilitation. The Gouldian finch, Erythrura gouldiae, exhibits polymorphism in head colour (red or black) which is related to different personalities: black-headed birds are bolder and less aggressive than red-headed birds. As such, this species provides a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of the presence of a social partner on the expression of individual behaviour. Using two behavioural tests that reflect individual 'boldness', exploration of a novel object and time taken to return to feeding following a predator threat, we show that Gouldian finches adjusted their behaviour according to the personality of their partners: where a bird's partner was bolder, it became bolder; where a bird's partner was shyer, it became shyer. This social conformity effect was reduced, however, for black-headed birds paired with red-headed partners in the novel object test; in keeping with previous research findings, bolder individuals were less plastic in their responses. Since variation in personality can promote group cohesion and improve the functioning of social groups in a variety of contexts, we hypothesize that head colour could act as a cue, facilitating preferential associations with those of similar or dissimilar personalities in large mobile flocks of Gouldian finches.

AB Reproductive traits often evolve rapidly, and some suggest that behavioural traits, in particular, can diverge faster than morphology, resulting in sexual isolation between populations/species. An earlier study of a Neotropical dung fly, Archisepsis diversiformis (Diptera: Sepsidae), reported anecdotally that two central American populations that were approximately 500 km apart (Costa Rica and Panama) differed in male courtship behaviour despite being morphologically similar. Here, I present results of an in- depth study designed (1) to test whether these two populations show qualitative and/or quantitative differences in mating behaviour and morphology, (2) to test whether individuals from either population show some degree of reproductive isolation and (3) to characterize population variation in a particularly fast evolving mitochondrial gene fragment, cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI), to estimate genetic differences between the two populations. Despite similarities in overall courtship, I identified behaviours that were clearly population specific, and report that both populations showed strong premating isolation in one- on- one crosses. However, after extended exposure in mass-container group crosses, individuals did produce adult F1 offspring, suggesting that isolation is incomplete. Surprisingly, morphometric analyses indicated that these two populations differed significantly in sexually monomorphic adult wing shape but differed only moderately in sexually dimorphic male forefemur shape, and not at all in male genital clasper shape. Finally, both populations were genetically similar, forming a single, monophyletic cluster with low uncorrected pairwise distances (COI threshold < 1 %), suggesting that marked behavioural differences between both populations have evolved quickly but without complete isolation.

AB All species perceive sensory stimuli from the environment through dedicated sensory modalities, and respond with appropriate behaviours designed to maximize fitness and reproductive success. In most mammalian species, information regarding sex, age and other species-specific social and reproductive characteristics is conveyed by pheromones, which are detected by the vomeronasal and olfactory systems. Traditionally, pheromone signals have been thought to possess intrinsic rewarding meanings and to trigger 'innate' hardwired social behavioural responses. In contrast, odorants are considered to possess mostly neutral reward value, but may induce approach or avoidance behaviours as a result of experience or through conditioning following pairing with stimuli that possess intrinsic rewarding properties. This review describes studies demonstrating that innate behavioural responses, with particular emphasis on reproductive responses mediated by pheromonal signals, are actually flexible and substantially influenced by past experience and associative learning. These attributes allow the animal to assign new motivational incentives to pheromones associated with social and reproductive behaviours, thus providing adaptive ability to cope with unique changes in internal and external environmental conditions. We argue that responses to pheromones are far more easily modified by experience than would be expected from hardwired innate responses, and that the behaviours they elicit are chiefly plastic and sensitive to modification throughout life by sensory-mediated emotional experience.

AB An emerging question in animal behaviour is whether and how behavioural plasticity will enable organisms to adjust to human-induced, rapid environmental changes that affect breeding conditions. Adaptive behavioural plasticity in response to changing resource conditions will depend on the sensitivity of the neuroendocrine system to food stimuli and on constraints in the mechanisms mediating the expression of reproductive behaviours. We tested the hypotheses that food availability mediates plasticity in androgen and corticosterone (CORT) responses, and that circulating concentrations of these hormones in turn mediate investment into competing mating and parental behaviours in a migratory songbird. We provided supplemental food to black-throated blue warblers, Setophaga caerulescens, breeding in habitats with natural low and high food abundance. The effects of supplemental feeding were most pronounced in food-poor habitat. During their social mates' fertile stage, fed males sang less near their nest sites, had lower plasma androgen and CORT levels, and had higher residual mass than control males. Fed males benefited indirectly from their mates' access to supplemental food because fed females provided more parental effort than control females. Fed males did not increase their own parental effort. Our results suggest that fed males increased mate-guarding effort over extrapair mate attraction while their social mates were fertile and invested additional resources into territorial defence or self-maintenance during the parental stage. These findings reveal plastic patterns of covariation among endocrine parameters and mating behaviours, but not parental behaviours, in response to food supplementation. These responses enabled individuals to adjust their reproductive effort rapidly to changes in resource conditions. Our findings suggest that adaptive reproductive investment in response to environmental change is unlikely to be constrained by the hormonal mechanisms underlying the mediation of competing mating and parental behaviours.

AB Antipredator defences of aquatic animals depend on various environmental parameters. We studied behavioural responses of a Ponto-Caspian invasive bivalve, the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, to conspecific alarm cues. We hypothesized that mussels would change their locomotion and aggregation in response to alarm signals. We also hypothesized that body size, light, substratum quality (suitable or unsuitable for attachment) and inclination would affect mussel defences. Changes in horizontal movement of mussels exposed to the alarm substance depended on light. In the presence of crushed conspecifics illuminated mussels (all sizes) moved longer distances than control individuals, whereas in darkness their reaction was the opposite. The response of small mussels was the strongest. Furthermore, the alarm substance reduced upward relocations of all size groups on an inclined surface but at the same time stimulated their downward movement. Large and medium mussels (but not small individuals) exposed to alarm signals formed aggregations more often than control individuals. This effect was only exhibited on sand, unsuitable for mussel attachment. Mussels were generally more clumped on sand than on hard substratum, suggesting that they did not prefer conspecific shells as attachment sites when alternative substrata were available. All responses of mussels to alarm cues tended to be stronger in light, which is an indirect indication of danger. Our study shows that the responses of the zebra mussel to conspecific alarm cues are not limited to activity reduction, as previously thought. They are adjusted to particular environmental conditions and may also involve increased locomotion when relocation to a safer site gives a better chance of survival.

AB Alterations of host behaviour in response to parasitism are widely documented. Modified host behaviour is considered an adaptive manipulation when it is induced by and provides a clear benefit to the parasite. Variability in the response of host organisms to parasitic manipulations can result in some hosts being more suitable than others if failure to induce a behaviour has fitness costs for the parasite. Individuals of the European bumblebee Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera, Apidae) that are parasitized by the endoparasitic larvae of a conopid fly (Conopidae, Diptera) bury themselves in soil just before death. This behaviour, which is of little consequence to the dying host, improves the survival and fitness of the parasitoid. In this study, we examined whether a parasitoid conopid fly, Physocephala tibialis, can successfully induce self-burial or 'grave-digging' behaviour in three bumblebee host species (B. bimaculatus, B. griseocollis and B. impatiens). Self-burial behaviour was expressed in all three host species, but at a far lower rate (17.4%) in B. griseocollis than in the other two species, which showed nearly equal rates of self-burial when parasitized (similar to 70%). Bombus impatiens and B. bimaculatus are more closely related to each other than to B. griseocollis, suggesting that genetic relatedness may influence host responsiveness to the parasitoid. We also found that larger hosts produced larger fly pupae, and that larger pupae generated bigger adult flies. In parasitoid literature, host suitability is often discussed in the context of receptiveness to oviposition and physiological resistance to infection. We posit that the ability to induce an important behavioural response influences host competency as well, and that host susceptibility to behavioural manipulation could have implications for selection.

AB The evolution of many animal colours is thought to be driven by selection from visually guided predators. Yet research has largely focused on large vertebrate predators such as birds while ignoring smaller, terrestrial invertebrate predators. This is despite clear evidence that small invertebrate predators are important regulators of prey densities in a variety of ecosystems. Jumping spiders are small voracious predators that feed on a wide variety of prey in the field. They are capable of colour discrimination, but little is known about whether they attend to the colour of their prey during foraging. We examined colour biases by offering Habronattus pyrrithrix jumping spiders arrays of artificially coloured juvenile crickets. We found that field-collected H. pyrrithrix showed populationwide colour biases; across age and sex categories, attack rates were lowest on red and yellow prey (colours commonly used as warning colours) and highest on blue prey. We retested the same individuals after they were housed for several weeks in the laboratory and found that their colour biases had weakened to statistically undetectable levels. We also found that colour preferences in individual spiders were not consistent over time, suggesting that the populationwide colour biases that we observed were not simply driven by consistent preferences of a subset of individuals. Finally, we tested colour preferences in a separate group of nave, laboratory-raised spiders and found similar biases favouring blue prey, with low attack rates on red, yellow and green. Our study provides the first evidence that both experienced and nave jumping spiders show colour biases when foraging and suggests that these biases may result from both innate and learned components. We argue that more attention to such understudied predators may provide a more holistic and accurate understanding of the suite of selective pressures that drive the evolution of prey colour patterns, particularly in small invertebrates.

AB Grouping behaviour is widespread in animals. One important reason for grouping is the reduction of individual predation risk; the larger a group, the greater the protection for the individual. Fishes, in particular, have become a model taxon in experimental research to study proximate and ultimate causes of grouping. Accordingly, numerous studies have so far demonstrated that fishes prefer to shoal with larger groups. Thus far these studies have usually examined small groups, with up to 20 individuals. However, in nature groups are often much bigger (up to several hundreds of individuals), and theory predicts that benefits, for example due to dilution effects, decline exponentially with increasing group size. Furthermore, discrimination might be absent because of limited cognitive ability. Thus, it is essential to test whether the findings from small groups also apply to large groups. Here, we examined group size preferences in the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a small fish that forms large shoals in nature. In five experiments, subadult sticklebacks were given the choice between two shoals differing in group size (numerical contrasts: 15 versus 60, 20 versus 60, 30 versus 60, 40 versus 60 and 50 versus 60). Test fish on average preferred the larger group; this preference was stronger in the beginning of the respective trial and decreased over time. Moreover, preferences for the larger shoal decreased with decreasing group size differences, implying context-dependent preferences. We found significant discrimination up to numerical contrasts of 40:60. Our results are in accordance with the findings of shoal size discrimination in small groups and with optimality hypotheses, but might also reflect the impact of cognitive constraints.

AB Aggression can generate anxiety, create uncertainty about its aftermath and jeopardise social relationships. Postconflict interactions serve as conflict management strategies to mitigate these consequences. Whereas postconflict interactions are well characterized in many animals, their functions are still insufficiently investigated. Four functional hypotheses have been proposed: stress reduction, relationship repair, self-protection and benign intent. We aimed to test these hypotheses in females of a tolerant macaque species, the crested macaque, Macaca nigra, under natural conditions, for three postconflict interactions: reconciliation, affiliation and aggression with third parties. Our results provide meaningful contrasts compared with findings in other species. We found no evidence that aggression had consequences for individuals' behavioural indicators of anxiety, although it increased the likelihood of secondary aggression with third parties. There was little evidence for the stress reduction hypothesis as the occurrence of any of the three postconflict interactions investigated had little effect on the measured behavioural indicators of anxiety. Conflict and dyad characteristics also had limited influence on anxiety. The relationship repair function was only partly validated: dyads with stronger bonds or that exchanged more support did not reconcile more often, but dyads with attributes related to the symmetry, stability and predictability (i.e. security) within relationships did. Patterns of initiation and directionality of postconflict interactions in this study population suggest that reconciliation may constitute the signalling of appeasement and benign intent. Furthermore, we found that aggression towards third parties may serve as a source of self-protection and reassertion of the females' social status. The distinctive pattern of postconflict management strategies revealed in wild female crested macaques appears to be related to their typically tolerant social style. These results demonstrate the usefulness of concomitantly studying aggression, postconflict interactions and their functions, to understand conflict management strategies comprehensively, while taking into account the level of social tolerance characterizing the studied society.

AB Nature's most striking, complex and innovative colour signals are generated via selective reflectance from optical nanostructures (rather than selective absorbance by pigments), a phenomenon known as structural coloration. These colours reach their height of visual brilliance as sexual signals, a context in which they also express both great functional innovation and high evolutionary lability. However, owing to a historical preoccupation with pigments, we know relatively little about the evolutionary causes and consequences of innovation in structurally coloured sexual signals, especially in exemplar arthropod taxa. In this study we addressed the possibility that species differences in intraspecific mating preferences may contribute to visual and functional variation in structural coloration. We contrasted mate preferences and signal properties between two closely related butterfly species (Hypolimnas alimena and Hypolimnas bolina) that possess male-elaborated structural coloration. Hypolimnas bolina offers a valuable comparative basis because females are known to prefer highly bright and limited-view ultraviolet markings, which males generate via complex nanoscale surface multilayer arrays. Male H. alimena, by contrast, display less bright and weakly iridescent dorsal blue, arising from a simpler surface micro-architecture. In two separate experiments, we found that female H. alimena did not distinguish between males spanning a graded range of 0.25-1.4x natural peak brightness. Only once the dorsal blue was completely obscured did male mating success suffer. Furthermore, a sample of wild phenotypes indicated greater variance for signal brightness in male H. bolina than H. alimena, but no difference in peak hue (i.e. signal colour). These results supported a priori predictions, and are consistent with a scenario whereby directional female preference has driven male signal exaggeration in H. bolina, but not its less ornamented close congener.

AB Individuals exhibiting a high level of cognitive ability may also exhibit more elaborate traits and so gain higher levels of mating success. This suggests that selection may act on cognitive performance through mate choice. Studies investigating this relationship have tended to focus on single cognitive tasks, or tasks that are closely related to existing natural behaviours, and individuals are frequently tested in captive conditions. This can introduce test artefacts and may tell us more about selection on specific display behaviours that we imagine being particularly cognitively complex, rather than a general cognitive ability. We tested free-living male spotted bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus maculatus, that exhibit elaborate sexual displays which appear to be cognitively demanding. We describe a method for testing individuals in the wild, without the need for constraint or captivity. We looked for evidence of a general cognitive ability in males by assaying their performance in a series of novel tasks reflecting their natural bower-building behaviour (bower maintenance) or capturing more abstract measures of cognitive ability (colour and shape discrimination, reversal learning, spatial memory and motor skills). We related performance in these tasks to their mating success. An individual's performance in one task was a relatively poor predictor of performance in any other task. However, an individual's performance across tasks could be summarized by a principal component which explained a level of total variance above which has previously been accepted as evidence of a general cognitive ability. We found no relationships between an individual's overall performance, or performance in any single task, and mating success. Our results highlight the need for further investigation of whether selection on cognition in bowerbirds is exerted through mate choice. We offer this as an example of how classic cognitive tasks can be transferred to the wild, thus overcoming some limitations of captive cognitive testing.

AB Males of many species prefer females that are more fecund, novel and/or sexually receptive. Males assess the desirability of potential mates using female morphological traits, including size and sexual coloration, or olfactory cues. However, few studies have directly examined how female behaviour influences male mate choice, which is surprising because males often respond strongly to female behaviours. We examined factors influencing male preference using the eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, a species with a large repertoire of behavioural displays. Males were presented with two tethered females in a paired choice test, and we measured the time that males spent associating with and courting (shuddering to) each female. We recorded female behaviour, including approach to and retreat from the male, sidle-hopping (a rejection behaviour) and pushups. Males associated more with females that (1) approached and retreated from them, (2) did not sidlehop and (3) had relatively higher body condition. Likewise, males shuddered more to females that approached and retreated from them. Approach and retreat behaviours may advertise a female's readiness to mate, as these behaviours can heighten male interest, suggesting that males may be most likely to invest in courtship once females indicate their willingness to mate. Neither the female's pushup behaviour nor her snout-vent length influenced a male's tendency to associate with or court her. These results provide evidence that female behaviour has an important influence on male courtship behaviour. Incorporating measures of female behaviour into future studies on male mate choice may be illuminating and provide a greater ability to predict male preference.

AB A sand-dwelling Mediterranean ant, Cataglyphis cursor, recently was discovered to engage in two new forms of rescue behaviour, behavioural patterns that require would-be rescuers to recognize what, exactly, holds nestmates in place. That is, when sand digging and limb pulling, two well-known forms of rescue in ants, did not result in release of victims ensnared with nylon thread and partially buried beneath the sand, rescuers next began to transport sand away from the snare and to direct their behaviour to the snare in particular, biting and tugging at the snare itself. To determine whether these new forms of precisely directed rescue behaviour, as well as their exclusive delivery to nestmates, as in C. cursor, were characteristic of other ants occupying similar ecological niches, we conducted experiments with five sand-dwelling Mediterranean ant species: Cataglyphis floricola, Lasius grandis, Aphaenogaster senilis, Messor barbarus and Messor marocanus. Our experiments revealed the full range of rescue behaviour, including snare biting and sand transport, in two species, C. floricola and L. grandis. Both species directed rescue exclusively towards nestmates, treating other individuals, even conspecifics, with aggression, thus highlighting the ants' discriminative capacities. Differences in the performance of rescue behaviour between these and the remaining species mirror differences in their ecology, including the threat of predatory antlions. Finally, because this precisely directed and exclusively delivered rescue behaviour in ants resembles behaviour that has been labelled empathy in rats, our results demonstrate that what can appear to be complex, cognitively motivated behaviour might come about through much simpler mechanisms.

AB Animals living in dynamic foraging environments are subject to trade-offs between exploiting current resources and exploring alternative resources. Social insects face the additional challenge of redistributing an often large foraging force among multiple patches in the absence of leadership or centralized control. We used comparative, field-based techniques to study the dynamic performance of five ant species. We also investigated how the number of ants involved in the decision-making process influenced feeder exploitation and dynamic performance. Colonies were offered two feeders that differed in quality. After 30 min, the feeders changed quality; the challenge for the colonies was to reallocate foraging effort following the swap. We predicted that colonies that invested heavily in exploiting the high-quality resource would have difficulty reallocating foragers following the quality swap. We also predicted that larger foraging groups would have stronger exploitation intensity and better dynamic performance than smaller groups. Overall, we found evidence for a trade-off between exploitation and flexibility such that species that tended to focus strongly on high-quality resources had relatively poor dynamic performance. Contrary to our prediction, we found no evidence that the number of ants influenced dynamic performance. The number of ants did, however, influence exploitation intensity such that colonies with fewer foragers tended to allocate a greater proportion of ants to the higher quality feeder than larger colonies. Our results highlight the factors that influence how species respond to the exploration-exploitation trade-off when faced with short-term fluctuations in the foraging environment.

AB Where a maternal trait influences the fitness of sons or daughters, mothers would be expected to bias the sex ratio towards the sex whose fitness they are more able to increment. In many polygynous species, maternal characteristics affect the fitness of sons more than that of daughters, but, in meerkats, variance in female reproductive success exceeds variance in male reproductive success and maternal rank affects the success of daughters more than sons. Dominant females would therefore be expected to produce an excess of daughters, a reversal of the hypothesis' usual predictions. In a long-term data set, despite a strong effect of maternal rank on daughters' success, we found no indication that dominant females produce female-biased litters. Offspring sex ratios did not deviate significantly from equality, and were also unaffected by maternal mass, age or number of previous litters produced in the same season. We suggest that potential advantages to both mother and offspring of producing and developing in mixed litters may result in the adaptive maintenance of an equal offspring sex ratio.

AB Helpers in cooperatively breeding species may assist in a number of cooperative activities, such as nest building, incubating, babysitting and feeding of offspring. In addition, individuals may engage in sentinel behaviour and other forms of vigilance, which benefits other group members not only by reducing the risk of predation, but also by allowing them to reduce their own vigilance. It remains unclear, however, whether these vigilance behaviours are selfish, and the benefits to other group members simply an unselected by-product, or whether they are forms of cooperation, and the benefits to group members a selective force favouring the behaviour. In meerkats, Suricata suricatta, both female and male helpers were more likely to perform sentinel behaviour after dependent pups had started joining the group on foraging trips. In addition, female helpers performed more bipedal vigilance and found less food when pups were in the group. These results suggest that sentinel behaviour and bipedal vigilance represent forms of cooperation in meerkats. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sexual segregation among vertebrates is a common phenomenon, usually assumed to be associated with sexual body size dimorphism and explained by differences in habitat use or social behaviours. Various hypotheses explain sexual segregation in terms of social or habitat factors. The factors controlling sexual segregation are as yet unclear and the hypotheses put forward to explain it have generated contradictory results, indicating that different mechanisms can be involved. We analysed the three components of sexual segregation (i.e. social, spatial and habitat) in a red deer, Cervus elaphus, population of a Mediterranean-type mountainous environment. We also examined age-and offspring-related segregation. Aiming to understand the role of social interactions and habitat preferences for red deer segregation, we used 5 years of direct observations of animals. Adult males and sexually active females showed complete segregation during the year except in the rut and autumn seasons, showing that a red deer tends to be aggregated with its peers outside the reproductive period. The results suggested that red deer segregated not only by sex, but also between age classes, indicating that sexual segregation hypotheses need to explain more than differences between sexes. Furthermore, both social behaviour and habitat preferences contributed significantly to sexual segregation, indicating that this phenomenon results from different choices made by males and females with respect to security and food availability in their living areas and dissimilar social behaviour of different sexes and age classes.

AB Movement behaviour plays an important role in many ecological interactions. As animals move through the environment, they generate movement patterns, which are a combined result of landscape characteristics and species-specific behaviour. Measuring these ranging patterns is being facilitated by technological advances in collection methods, such as GPS collars, that are capturing movement on finer spatial and temporal scales. We propose the use of a novel spatiotemporal analytical framework (ST-BBD), based on the beta-binomial distribution (BBD) model, to measure small-scale aggregation in animal movement data sets, including two simulated and three collected primate data sets. We use this approach to distinguish different habitat uses of three primate species (red colobus, Procolobus rufomitratus, black howler, Alouatta pigra, and spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi) and quantify their specific use of the landscape in space and in time, using a parameter of the BBD that measures the variation in sites visited on a landscape. We found that estimates of aggregation in habitat use were higher in the frugivorous spider monkey, compared to the more folivorous howler monkey, and that in the red colobus, aggregation in site visits was dependent on group size and food availability. Applications of this framework to animal movement data could be useful in understanding ecological systems where habitat use is an important factor, such as the relationships between hosts and parasites, or parent plants and seed dispersers.

AB Change is fundamental to all social systems. Temporal dynamics are critical in understanding how relationships form and change over time but rarely are studied explicitly in animal groups. Social network approaches are useful in describing association patterns and provide promising tools for investigating the dynamics of change in social structure but have rarely been used to quantify how animal associations change over time. In this study, we describe and test a framework for temporal analysis of social structure. We propose an analytical framework of methods that integrates across social scales and comparatively analyses change in social structure across multiple types of social association. These methods enable comparisons in groups that differ in size and are flexible to allow application to weighted and unweighted networks, where ties can be directed or undirected, and relationships can be symmetric or asymmetric. We apply this analytical framework to temporal social network data from experimentally formed captive groups of monk parakeets, Myiopsitta monachus, to both evaluate our analysis methods and characterize the social structure of this species. We compared dynamics of dyadic network formation, ego network formation and global network stabilization patterns across neutral, affiliative and agonistic associations. We found that social structure of captive monk parakeets formed and stabilized over a short period, but patterns differed by social association type. We also found evidence for consistency in the temporal dynamics of formation and stabilization of social structure between replicate social groups. Our analysis methods successfully identified change in social structure that corresponded well with qualitative observations. This framework is likely to be useful in characterizing patterns of temporal dynamics in social structure in longitudinal data in wide variety of social systems and species.

AB There is increasing evidence that birds use chemical cues in different contexts, and this is changing the traditional view that birds are the only largely olfaction-free vertebrates. We performed a choice experiment to examine whether male house finches exhibit any preferences for the sex of conspecifics when only their chemical cues are available. When exposed during the breeding season to the scent of a male and a female, males appeared to respond indiscriminately to both odours. However, when we analysed a posteriori the choices of males in relation to their relative quality, males with worse quality than scent donor males avoided the male-scented area, whereas males with better quality moved towards the male-scented area. Our results suggest that in the context of mate choice/competition for mates, house finches may obtain information via olfaction to assess the quality of rival males.

AB The processes underlying reproductive isolation, and the traits involved, are the subject of considerable debate in evolutionary biology. Studying the costly sexual interaction of species in secondary sympatry, a phenomenon known as reproductive interference, can help to shed light on past and present isolating mechanisms, as well as the implications of sympatry for individual fitness. We investigated the roles of two sets of traits, genitalic and behavioural, in reproductive isolation and interference in two species of Australian neriid flies, Telostylinus lineolatus and T. angusticollis. Surprisingly, although these species differ markedly in male but not in female genitalia, we found evidence that genital morphology resulted in asymmetric reproductive isolation: T. lineolatus males could transfer sperm to T. angusticollis females, but T. angusticollis males were unable to transfer sperm to T. lineolatus females. However, neither type of cross produced any viable hybrids. Behavioural responses also contributed asymmetrically to both reproductive isolation and reproductive interference. Males pursued both conspecific and heterospecific females. Females of both species discriminated against heterospecific males, but T. lineolatus females exhibited stronger discrimination than T. angusticollis females. Curiously, T. angusticollis males both fought and attempted to copulate with T. lineolatus males, resulting in reduced mating success for T. angusticollis males with conspecific females. Our findings show that both genitalic and behavioural traits can play important roles in reproductive isolation, but the consequences of interspecific divergence in these traits can be surprisingly complex, resulting in asymmetric effects on many aspects of interspecific interactions.

AB Various game theory models have been used to explain animal contests. Here we attend to the presumed cognitive abilities required by these models with respect to information gathering and consequent decision making. Some, such as the hawk/dove game and self-assessment models require very limited cognitive ability. By contrast, the broadly accepted sequential assessment model requires that contestants know their own abilities and compare them with information gathered about their opponent to determine which has the greater resource-holding power. However, evidence for assessment of relative abilities is sparse and we suggest that this complex ability is probably beyond most animals. Indeed, perceptual limitations may restrict information about an individual's own displays and thus preclude comparison. We take a parsimonious view and conclude that simple summation of causal factors accounts for changes in fight motivation without requiring mutual evaluation of relative abilities.

AB Multiple mating often imposes direct fitness costs on females but can provide indirect benefits such as enhanced genetic diversity and offspring quality. The costs and benefits of multiple mating have been investigated extensively in separate-sex species but less so in simultaneous hermaphrodites, despite being highly relevant given their flexible resource allocation and ability to compensate for costs experienced in one sexual role by gains in the opposite role. At high mating rates, the promiscuous hermaphroditic pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis experiences depressed female fecundity mediated by seminal fluid compounds. By experimentally manipulating mating opportunities, we tested for effects on female reproductive investment over 10 weeks. As expected, continuous access to mating partners resulted in decreased female investment, in terms of both total number of eggs (fecundity) and egg mass dry weight. Total investment in offspring increased over time for all treatments but was significantly less pronounced in treatments with continuous access to partners, and this was irrespective of partner identity. Investment per offspring was positively correlated with higher mating rates across treatments. Thus, multiple mating resulted in higher investment in egg masses at low than at higher mating rates. In contrast, at higher mating rates the investment per egg was higher. We conclude that, in L. stagnalis, mating multiply can severely impact female reproductive success and, although we cannot entirely exclude reallocation of resources to the male function from this study, we argue that this is probably the result of sexual conflict caused by previously identified seminal fluid components.

AB Group living confers a variety of benefits to individuals, particularly in predator detection and defence. Hamilton's selfish herd hypothesis (Hamilton 1971, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 31, 295-311) posits that individuals come together to reduce their own risk of predation, and numerous studies have shown that predators affect both the grouping and spacing patterns of their prey. We suggest that this hypothesis is also useful for understanding group responses to a very different threat: that posed by nonbreeding, potentially infanticidal males. In such cases, males may act as a predator-like force on the grouping patterns of breeding individuals. We hypothesized that nonbreeding males, like predators, can affect the spacing patterns of conspecifics. Specifically, we examined the effect of bachelor males on both the grouping and spacing patterns of gelada, Theropithecus gelada, reproductive units. First, we demonstrated that the number of bachelors was positively correlated with the number of animals in a group. Second, and more importantly, we found that bachelors exerted an acute pressure on the spacing of individuals; as bachelors approached, breeding individuals moved closer to their nearest neighbours. By approaching other breeding individuals, reproductive males and females may dilute the costs of associating with bachelor males. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Migrants' responses to varying meteorological and magnetic conditions and their consequent costs in terms of energy and time are crucial for the understanding of the spatial principles guiding migration. Until now, studies of birds' phenotypic responses to environmental conditions and estimated costs of migration in terms of energy and time have focused on single sites and have rarely followed individuals along entire migration routes. We used individual-based light level geolocators to track birds' daily phenotypic responses to the environmental conditions experienced along a 30 000 km migration between Alaska and Africa. In autumn, departures of northern wheatears, Oenanthe oenanthe, were highly dependent on low temperatures and light winds but there was no such apparent dependence in spring. Migration was 1.4-times faster in spring than in autumn. There was an unexpected shift in the ratio of migration: stopover time towards less stopover time in spring, reducing spring's total energy costs for migration with respect to distance covered by nearly 50% in comparison to autumn. Despite strong changes in declination during migration, offering near-experimental conditions, birds did not navigate exclusively along any major compass course. In contrast to expectations, these high-Arctic migrants did not follow great circle routes; their hypothetical energetic benefit (ca. 20% for flying) might be insufficient and conditions for orientation too unfavourable to favour its evolution.

AB Interpopulation variation in territorial aggression can reflect differences in life history or competitive environments. Life history theory predicts that males with more opportunities for future reproduction should avoid risk-taking behaviour to minimize the cost of current reproduction, whereas competitive environments should favour higher aggression to defend limited resources. Additionally, male aggression can be modulated by familiarity with competitors to be either lower (dear enemies) or higher (nasty neighbours) towards neighbours. We conducted a territory intrusion experiment using neighbour-stranger songs to examine how territorial aggression differed in two populations of orange-crowned warblers, Oreothlypis celata, breeding in California and Alaska. The California population breeds at very high densities and has a higher annual survival relative to the Alaska population, which breeds at significantly lower densities and has a lower annual survival rate. We found that California males showed higher amounts of territorial aggression in response to simulated territory intrusions than did Alaska males, supporting the hypothesis that competitive environments, as indicated by breeding density, rather than life history, shape geographical variation in levels of aggression. Both populations discriminated between song stimuli of neighbours and strangers, but California males responded more strongly towards neighbours, whereas Alaska males responded more strongly towards strangers. We discuss these results in light of the mechanisms for overall aggression and neighbour-stranger discrimination. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB There is ongoing debate about which sensory mechanisms are critical for animal navigation over long distances. We tested whether magnetoreception associated with the front of the head is involved in navigation by homing pigeons. We attached small, but strong, rare-earth magnets atop the ceres of experienced homing pigeons and released the birds under sunny conditions. In releases distributed over a wide range of distances and directions, the mean vanishing directions of birds carrying magnets were consistently (91% of releases) shifted to the right of controls carrying brass weights. The right shift appeared within a few minutes after release and was reproducible over consecutive years. The magnet's effect was sustained (82%) in birds released repeatedly at one site and was larger (73%) for a North-up than for a South-up orientation of the magnet in releases (88%), where the North-up and South-up groups of experimental birds were right-shifted relative to their controls. We discuss several possible nonnavigational and navigational explanations for the magnet's effect on the pigeons' vanishing direction. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Interactions between the components of a multiple-signal sexual display can be complex, and previous work has shown that alteration of one component can lead to changed investment in either the altered or other display components. Extended phenotype signals (nonbody structures that carry a signalling function) provide an ideal means to manipulate signal quality in a noninvasive manner, to investigate investment patterns in display components. We made three predictions as to how males might alter investment in display components in response to artificial enhancement of an extended phenotype signal, and tested those predictions using three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. The addition of brightly coloured ornaments (threads) to the nests of male sticklebacks led to increased investment in both courtship of females and nest construction. In a field experiment, males offered coloured threads spent increased time engaged in interactions with females, and in the laboratory, they built nests that were neater and more compact (better quality), relative to males offered dull threads. Our findings support a hypothesis based on resource budgeting, and suggest that resources saved by having an artificially enhanced nest are reallocated to other courtship behaviours. The study provides a framework for investigating the interaction between signal components, and demonstrates that manipulation of extended phenotype signals can provide insight into the ways in which animals balance investment in interacting signal components in sexual displays.

AB Exploration of the environment is a key behaviour in animals. The exploratory behaviour of species or populations depends on different aspects of their ecology. New evidence suggests that differences in exploratory behaviour might also be related to life history strategies, with fast-lived animals (high metabolic rate, short life span) being faster explorers than slow-lived ones. We tested this assumption in shrews. Shrews are divided into two phylogenetic groups, which differ tremendously in life history. We compared the exploratory behaviour of three species, covering both phylogenetic groups. Shrews of the fast-lived genus Sorex were quicker to start exploration and to locate the first food patch. They also moved faster than the slow-lived genus Crocidura. Unlike many studies on exploratory behaviour that analyse only a short period of time (i.e. a single exploration bout with a fixed duration), we analysed the species-specific allocation of prolonged total exploration time into exploration bouts. Using this method, we could show that Sorex performed more, but shorter exploration bouts than Crocidura. Our results support the hypothesis of exploratory behaviour being related to life history. While the species we tested occur sympatrically, the two genera differ strongly in the climatic zones they inhabit. It is likely that also during evolution they faced different types of habitat and thus different selection pressures. These differences in evolutionary histories possibly favoured the evolution of their diversified life histories and exploration strategies. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Activating the immune system has associated fitness costs, both immediate costs in the form of reduced current reproduction and long-term costs in the form of reduced life span and future reproduction. This indicates that immune system activation can be an important agent in life history trade-offs. In this review, we evaluate the importance of four currencies generally considered as potential mediators of the costs of immune responses in ecological studies: (1) energetic costs, (2) nutrient costs, (3) autoimmunity and (4) oxidative stress, which may be responsible for these trade-offs. A meta-analysis revealed significant elevation of energy consumption during an immune response; however, the magnitude of this energetic cost was only 5-15%. In a direct comparison using similar immune system activation in tits, energetic savings in terms of lowered feeding rate was seven times higher than energetic costs of mounting an immune response. These results do not support the hypothesis that energy is the key proximate currency mediating the costs of immunity. Nutrient savings from immunosuppression seem to be even less beneficial as this constitutes only a minor part of the daily nutrient turnover in the body. In our view, there are some indications that oxidative stress can be an important currency that could mediate both short-term and long-term costs of immune system activation, although direct evidence is so far limited. The importance of autoimmune responses is at this point hard to evaluate owing to limited empirical studies in wild animals. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Lateral displays during agonistic interactions are assumed to provide contestants the opportunity to assess the opponent's quality. Once an individual has acquired sufficient information, a decision to terminate the display can be made and either escalation to fighting or de-escalation and movement away from the opponent occurs. Because cerebral lateralization enhances the processing of complex cognitive tasks in the visual domain, it is possible that lateralization might provide an efficient means by which an assessment of the opponent's quality is facilitated. I investigated whether there is evidence for lateralization in the decision to terminate parallel walks during fights recorded between individually identifiable male fallow deer, Dama dama. Males exhibited a significant bias to terminate parallel walks when displaying their right flank over their left; therefore, the decision to end a parallel walk showed evidence for lateralization. There was an increasing tendency to show a right-sided bias when terminating the parallel walk as body length increased and heavier males terminated parallel walks sooner than lighter males. Therefore, larger individuals displayed a greater tendency towards lateralization than smaller individuals. Moreover, lighter males showed a greater tendency to escalate parallel walks to fighting. These results show evidence for lateralization in the decision to terminate lateral displays during escalated contests in an ungulate species, and suggest that lateralization provides a mechanism by which contestants can resolve contests at a low cost.

AB Several factors cause animals to relocate. In this context, ant species are unique in that they not only have to relocate adults, but they must also move their brood while maintaining colony cohesion. We explored the colony relocation dynamics of the ponerine ant Diacamma indicum in its natural habitat. Irrespective of whether ants relocated from their original nest in their natural habitat or from a nestbox in an unfamiliar but natural habitat, colonies experienced fission and multiple fragmentations. However, this fission was transient, and the colonies eventually unified at a single site. The movement of the ants did not exhibit any directional preference, and the gamergate did not enjoy any special attention during the relocation process. Tandem running, a behaviour in which one ant leads a follower ant from one site to another, was used to relocate about 96% of the colony members, and 28% of the colony became tandem leaders on average. The evacuation phase was significantly shorter than the reunification phase, and this may be an adaptive response to a disturbance in the ant's dwelling. Unlike other ants, the leaders were sighted at most of the temporary sites and thus, in principle, had the opportunity to compare the conditions of alternative sites directly. Most leaders discovered the final site by following other leaders; leaders following leaders occurred throughout the relocation process and constituted 30% of the total tandem runs. In the context of these experiments, the colony relocation and reunification dynamics of ants in their natural habitat are discussed. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding space use by animals plays a key role in a wide array of behavioural and ecological fields of study. An insight into how and why species use the space available to them may aid their conservation. The West European hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus, a species in decline in part of its range, is relatively mobile and adapted to a wide range of habitat types. However, it is frequently associated with edge habitats. This edge-refuging behaviour is not well understood and may be the result of fear of predators, food availability or other factors. We used radiotelemetry to investigate the movement of hedgehogs in comparable landscapes with high and low predator (badgers, Meles meles) abundance. Simultaneously, food availability was assessed in both landscapes. Our results suggest that agricultural habitats may be 'landscapes of fear' for hedgehogs in the presence of a high number of predators. On agricultural fields, hedgehogs were on average situated closer to edge cover in areas with predators present. It is thus likely to be beneficial for the conservation of hedgehogs in areas with a high number of predators to increase the complexity of the habitat structure by, among other measures, establishing more and denser hedgerows in rural areas. Our results suggest that enhancing the complexity of the habitat structure might lessen the effects of fear. Additionally, our results emphasize the importance of integrating data on predator abundance and food availability in studies that focus on habitat selection behaviour and species conservation.

AB Among cooperatively breeding species, delayed dispersal provides an opportunity for older siblings to help rear young. There is considerable variation in the extent to which cooperative breeders delay dispersal, however, and while delayed dispersal may be a consequence of adaptive evolution favouring family living, evidence for a genetic basis is lacking. Furthermore, the extent to which dispersal behaviour itself is under direct selection, or evolves indirectly in response to selection on correlated life-history traits, remains unclear. We tested for evidence of inter-and intraspecific quantitative genetic variation in age at first dispersal in a reintroduced population of the red wolf, Canis rufus, that naturally hybridizes with the coyote, Canis latrans, which delays dispersal to a lesser extent than the red wolf. Using analyses based on individual relationships to population founders and sire-offspring regressions, we found evidence for intraspecific genetic variation in dispersal age in male, but not female, red wolves. We also found evidence for interspecific genetic variation, in that red wolves had later dispersal age than coyote-red wolf hybrids. Intraspecific variation in dispersal age was not explained by variation in social and environmental factors nor alternative targets of selection such as body mass or age at first reproduction. Thus, selection may act directly on dispersal-related behaviours. However, life-history traits may continue to be influential in creating interspecific differences in dispersal age, as hybrids also showed earlier reproduction. Our findings suggest that evolution of delayed dispersal may be due to both direct and indirect selection on existing quantitative genetic variation, and that genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying dispersal may differ between the sexes.

AB A rare and remarkable animal behaviour is communication among embryos within a clutch of eggs. For example, embryonic vocalizations facilitate synchronous hatching in some birds and crocodilians. Synchronous hatching in nonvocalizing turtles suggests a different mechanism of embryonic communication: vibration-induced hatching. We addressed the idea that embryos can communicate with one another via vibrations that expedite hatching in the pig-nosed turtle, Carettochelys insculpta, a species that has evolved rapid hatching in response to hypoxia during nest flooding. Laboratory experiments tested the hypotheses that groups of (sibling) embryos can hatch and emerge more rapidly than solitary embryos, and that a vibration cue can expedite hatching relative to a hypoxic cue alone. We first demonstrated a vibration cue for hatching: vibration-induced hatching latency (ca. 8 min) was shorter than the hypoxia-induced hatching latency (ca. 16 min). Second, latency to both hatching and emergence from experimental nests was significantly shorter in groups of eggs than solitary eggs, when subjected to hypoxic conditions (perfusion in gaseous nitrogen or immersion in water, respectively). Although we did not directly link vibrations and the sibling effect, leaving open the possibility of embryo vocalizations, our experiments, along with a simple mathematical model, suggest that pig-nosed turtle embryos can detect and respond to sibling vibrations, and that these embryonic signals may increase the survival of siblings by reducing the latency to hatch and emerge under flood conditions. Our results are also novel in revealing multiple hatching cues in a single species within a single environmental context. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The evolutionary basis of human female orgasm has been subject to furious scientific debate, which has recently intensified. Many adaptive explanations have been proposed, invoking functions from pair bonding and mate selection to sucking up sperm, but these have been attacked as being based on flawed logic and/or evidence. The popular alternative theory is that female orgasm is not adaptive and is only evolutionarily maintained as a by-product of ongoing selection on the male orgasm-ejaculation system. This theory has not been adequately tested. We tested one of its central tenets: that selection pressure on the male orgasm is partially transmitted to the female via a positive cross-sex correlation in orgasmic function (susceptibility to orgasm in response to sexual stimulation). Using questionnaire data from over 10 000 Finnish twins and siblings, we found significant genetic variation in both male and female orgasmic function, but no significant correlation between opposite-sex twins and siblings. This suggests that different genetic factors underlie male and female orgasmic function and that selection pressures on male orgasmic function do not act substantively on female orgasmic function. These results challenge the by-product theory of female orgasm. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Male mate choice is predicted to evolve as male investment in mating increases. Thus, taxa in which males pay a high cost for mating offer researchers an ideal system to test traditional sex roles. Males courting potentially sexually cannibalistic females may be under strong selection to bias their courtship efforts away from hungry females that may be more likely to attack. Here we tested the prediction that web-based chemotactile cues of recent female foraging success influence male courtship in the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. In addition, we tested the underlying assumption that previous female foraging success reduces precopulatory sexually cannibalistic attacks. We found that males courted well-fed females significantly more than they did starved females, and that this bias was maintained in the absence of the female when males encountered only (1) cues from female webs and (2) cues from female silk after web architecture had been eliminated. A nonsignificant courtship bias in favour of well-fed females was also evident when these females were transplanted to the webs of starved females. Male courtship biases in favour of well-fed females appear adaptive, as starved females were significantly more likely to attack males before mating. We conclude by noting that sexual cannibalism offers a model system wherein the exploitation of cues of predation risk have unique implications such as the effects on male courtship preferences seen here.

AB The behaviour and physiology of wild animals born in zoos, laboratories and breeding centres can differ substantially from that of their wild-caught (WC) conspecifics. For instance, captive-born (CB) animals are typically more prone to developing abnormal repetitive behaviours. In captive striped mice, Rhabdomys, we first confirmed that birth origin predicted the emergence of stereotypic behaviour (SB), with CB mice being most at risk. Second, to investigate correlates of this birth origin effect, we tested WC and CB striped mice in behavioural tasks to quantify fear/anxiety, activity and perseveration, and measured faecal corticosterone to assess physiological stress. WC mice proved more fearful and less active than CB animals, and had higher levels of faecal corticosterone metabolites. These effects, however, were unrelated to SB. WC mice were also less perseverative and more behaviourally flexible than CB animals, traits that covary with SB. Third, a retrospective analysis of laboratory records showed that SB incidence was significantly lower in adult-caught than juvenile-caught striped mice, with juvenile males being the most severely affected by early removal from the wild. In conclusion, our results indicate that adult, but not juvenile WC striped mice are typically protected against SB development in captivity, despite having poorer welfare than their CB conspecifics. They also reveal profound behavioural changes in CB mice, changes suggestive of altered forebrain function, a hypothesis now needing direct testing.

AB Shifts in work schedules test humans' capacity to be flexible in the timing of both work and sleep. Honeybee, Apis mellifera, foragers also shift their work schedules, but how flexible they are in the timing of sleep as they shift the timing of work is unknown, despite the importance of colony-level plasticity in the face of a changing environment. We hypothesized that sleep schedules of foragers are not fixed and instead vary depending on the time when food is available. We trained bees to visit a food source made available for several hours in the early morning (AM) or several hours in the late afternoon (PM), then monitored their sleep behaviour for 24 h after training, specifically comparing their sleep during the AM and PM periods previously designated as training periods. Following AM training, honeybee foragers slept more during the afternoon than during the morning, but following PM training, the same bees 'slept in' the next morning, and so slept more in the morning than in the afternoon. Although foragers did not change the total amount of time devoted to each of their behaviours (including sleep), the timing of their sleep did change. Thus, plasticity in timing of foraging was matched by plasticity in timing of sleep. The apparent correlation between the timing patterns of foraging and sleeping demonstrates temporal plasticity of sleep under ecologically realistic conditions in an invertebrate. Testing how shift work affects the health and performance of honeybees may shed light on the role of sleep in a nonhuman social animal. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB It has been posited that some parasitoid wasps 'usurp' their dying hosts as 'bodyguards' to protect the vulnerable parasitoid cocoons against attack from natural enemies such as predators or hyperparasitoids. Thus far, however, the hypothesis has been supported only in studies with insect predators. Two factors may account for this: first, hyperparasitoids, being more specialized than predators, are probably less easily rebuffed by the presence of an attending caterpillar; second, the host cocoon is used for reproduction by hyperparasitoids, but not by predators. We compared the survival of a solitary primary parasitoid, Microplitis sp., and successful parasitism by a secondary hyperparasitoid, Gelis agilis, from parasitoid cocoons with and without the presence of an 'attending' larva of the host, the armyworm, Mythimna separata. Mature Microplitis sp. larvae always emerge through the same host segment, leaving the posterior segments paralysed and attached to cocoons and the anterior segments freely moving. When disturbed by G. agilis females, M. separata larvae exhibited aggressive behaviour that repeatedly drove off approaching hyperparasitoids. In choice and no-choice experiments performed at 24 h intervals over 96 h, G. agilis successfully parasitized cocoons without attending caterpillars, but few cocoons with attending caterpillars were ever parasitized. Choice experiments, in which G. agilis wasps were released onto corn plants containing 24 h-old parasitoid cocoons with and without attending caterpillars, produced similar results. We provide the first experimental evidence that a solitary parasitoid usurps the behaviour of its host over several days as a 'bodyguard' against hyperparasitoids.

AB Colour vision in marsupials is a controversial issue, especially among the genus Didelphis (Didelphidae, Didelphimorphia). While behavioural tests have diagnosed these animals as trichromats and electrophysiological studies have diagnosed them as monochromats, recent molecular genetics studies provide evidence for dichromatic colour vision, having found two classes of cone opsins in a species of this genus. This study examines the colour perception of a male and female white-eared opossum, Didelphis albiventris, through a series of tasks involving a behavioural paradigm of discrimination learning. Both opossums succeeded in discriminating pairs of stimuli consisting of Munsell colour cards presented in random brightness values that are assumed to be easily discriminated by dichromats and trichromats (e.g. blues versus oranges). However, both subjects failed to discriminate between colours that are expected to be easily discriminated only by trichromats (e.g. greens versus oranges). The opossums were also unsuccessful in distinguishing a colour against itself (e.g. oranges versus oranges), demonstrating that discrimination was based only on visual cues. These results are consistent with recent predictions based on molecular genetics suggesting that the genus Didelphis is routinely a dichromat.

AB Sexual cannibalism, in particular before insemination, is a long-standing evolutionary paradox because it persists despite extreme costs for the victim, usually the male. Several adaptive and nonadaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, but empirical studies are still scarce and results are inconclusive. We studied the spider Araneus diadematus in which females may attack and kill potential mates at any time during courtship or mating, making the species ideal for examining the causes of pre- and postinsemination sexual cannibalism. We manipulated food availability for females and conducted mating trials in the laboratory to test predictions derived from two hypotheses: the adaptive female foraging (AFF) hypothesis, which views sexual cannibalism as an optimal female behaviour in the face of a trade-off between mating and cannibalizing a courting male; and the mate size dimorphism (MSD) hypothesis, which postulates a physical advantage of larger females in subduing males. We found partial support for the AFF hypothesis, but MSD explained sexual cannibalism irrespective of the timing of cannibalism. Our results suggest that a complex interplay of female state, mate choice and physical dominance is responsible for the maintenance of sexual cannibalism against male interests.

AB Grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, pups in the breeding colony at Froan, Norway, have a bimodal pattern of early aquatic behaviour. About 40% of the pups spend their time ashore to save energy, which can be allocated to growth or deposition of energy-rich adipose tissue. The other 60% of the pups enter the sea during suckling and the early postweaning period, and disperse to other locations within the breeding colony. Pups may swim distances up to 12 km. Neonatal aquatic dispersal behaviour may lead to increased energy expenditure for thermoregulation and swimming, and thus lead to a low rate of body mass gain during suckling and a high rate of body mass loss after weaning. Thus, we examined relationships between natal aquatic dispersal behaviour and change in body mass (Delta BM) in suckling and weaned pups. Suckling pups that had dispersed >2000 m had a significantly lower Delta BM than suckling pups that dispersed <2000 m or that did not disperse. In weaned pups, there were no effects of aquatic dispersal behaviour on Delta BM. We suggest that the bimodal natal aquatic dispersal behaviour in grey seals at the study site reflects two different strategies for postweaning survival: to stay ashore and get fat, or to take a swim and acquire diving and feeding skills.

AB Polyandry is common among insects, and female insects in general gain directly from mating multiply in terms of increased lifetime reproductive success. Nevertheless, polyandry is not rampant, suggesting that realized polyandry is the outcome of costs and benefits associated with multiple matings. In the bivoltine green-veined white butterfly, Pieris napi, females gain from mating multiply as males transfer a substantial nuptial gift along with the sperm at mating. None the less, lifetime number of matings varies between one and six, and 12% of females mate only once. We investigated the reason for this variation and tested: (1) whether female polyandry is contingent on environmental conditions (specifically whether females can compensate for adverse conditions by mating more often); and (2) whether the level of polyandry differs between the diapausing generation, which flies after pupal hibernation, and the directly developing generation (specifically whether females in the more time-constrained summer generation are more polyandrous, possibly as a result of selection for early high mating propensity and thereby shorter prereproductive period). Results showed that: (1) females did not compensate for adverse conditions by mating more often; and (2) the level of polyandry was higher in the directly developing generation than in the diapause generation. Hence, we argue that differences in time stress and mating propensity between generations interplay in shaping mating frequency, and that the difference in polyandry between generations highlights the importance of integrating developmental pathway and life history.

   ROBUSTNESS
AB Animal social networks are often built by aggregating a series of independent observations of two or more members of a group interacting or in association. Every time an observation is made, edges are drawn between each pair of individuals involved. I examined the effect of edge sample size on the reconstruction of social networks. I created different artificial networks and sampled edges from each. I estimated and compared the number of nodes, number of components, path length, clustering coefficient, network density, mean degree, betweenness centrality and degree probability distribution of the reconstructed networks to the true value of the network. I describe how the accuracy of these measures changes as the fraction of sampled edges increases. I show that edge sample size affects network measures in different ways and that when an incomplete sample is analysed, network properties can be considerably misrepresented. I also show that, because animal networks are typically small, simple curve fitting to the degree distribution P(k) should be done with caution, because different curve models can show significant fit for the same data. Overall, the results indicate that strong claims about animal social networks should not be made unless considerable effort has been made to collect an exhaustive number of association/interaction data points. If observations of associations/interactions are accumulated over a long period, the effect of increasing edge sample size could be mistaken for temporal change in social network and could also muddy the comparison of network structure between populations and between species.

AB Aggression is potentially disruptive for social groups. Although individuals witnessing a conflict are not directly threatened by aggressive interactions, the aftermath of aggression appears to be a period of social instability. We expected bystanders to respond to conflicts by affiliating with other group members and so reducing social tension. To test this hypothesis we collected data on two captive groups of Tonkean macaques, Macaca tonkeana. After an agonistic interaction, the behaviours of focal individuals uninvolved in the conflict were recorded over 5 min postconflict periods, for comparison with baseline periods. The results showed that bystanders were more likely to show affiliation during postconflict periods than in baselines. We found that affiliation occurred more frequently between individuals linked by friendship, whereas no significant effect of kinship appeared, which may be related to the open social relationships reported in Tonkean macaques. Females initiated affiliation sooner than males and conflicts involving physical contact were more quickly followed by affiliation between bystanders. Rates of scratching tended to decrease after the first affiliative interaction. None the less, few signs of anxiety were observed in bystanders. Our results reflect the high propensity of Tonkean macaques to appease others and stop aggression. This study demonstrates that postconflict affiliation occurs between bystanders in a species characterized by tolerant social relationships. It could be a pervasive means of social cohesion among primates. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Theory predicts that parents should adjust their parental investment to the reproductive value of the brood. Previous studies have mainly investigated the relationship between brood size, brood age and the intensity of care. However, the impact of brood quality traits such as the offspring's average body size on parental investment has received relatively little attention. We examined the parental response to brood quality in the biparentally brood-caring cichlid fish Pelvicachromis taeniatus. We manipulated offspring quality by manipulating the food availability for the free-swimming fry and measured the parental response over 4 weeks. Generally, care decreased over the 4 weeks suggesting that parents adjust care to decreasing offspring vulnerability. However, parents of relatively low-quality broods, that is, of broods with relatively small average individual body size, showed a greater reduction in care than parents of high-quality broods resulting in a significant difference in care provided in the fourth week. The result suggests that parents adjust their care to brood quality and supports the predictions of the parental investment theory. Furthermore, mothers of high-quality fry were significantly more aggressive towards their partner than mothers of low-quality fry. This result is discussed in the context of parental response to brood value. Generally, females invested more in brood care than males. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB It is widely accepted that group-living animals alter their behaviour towards a conspecific depending on whether it is known or unknown. To distinguish between group members and strangers in an efficient way, it would be adaptive for an animal to categorize conspecifics on the basis of familiarity. We investigated whether pigeons, Columba livia, are able to learn this categorization in a concept-like manner when trained with 2D images of conspecifics. Two of the six experimental pigeons were able correctly to classify test photographs of aviary mates which they had never seen as photographic stimuli before. Control animals, which had no real-life experience of the pictured conspecifics, all failed. This is a cognitively demanding task; not only are there no consistent visual features among group members, but photographic stimuli also present a much degraded version of the depicted pigeons. Further tests revealed that the familiarity concept could be transferred to nonconspecifics and that 24 h of exposure was enough for another pigeon to be classed as familiar. In sum, the findings show that pigeons (1) interpreted computer stimuli as representations of real entities, (2) possessed the ability to form a concept of familiarity and (3) were able to distinguish between social partners and strangers in nature.

AB Females often choose their mates based on features of the male's advertisement signal, often preferring louder, deeper, longer, or faster signals. Females of chorusing animals also frequently have preferences for signal timing positions, generally preferring the leading signal. Under natural chorus conditions, females must choose among signals that vary in features as well as relative timing. I conducted playback experiments with female Hyla cinerea treefrogs to evaluate whether one type of preference ( for attractive signal feature or attractive timing) dominates the overall attractiveness of a signal, or whether different types of preferences can interact. I found that the overall attractiveness of a signal was determined by a combination of timing and feature preferences. The specific signal feature ( amplitude, frequency, duration, or rate) was important for the outcome of this interaction effect; signal frequency preferences were very strong and dominated overall signal attractiveness, while signal amplitude, duration or rate preferences were weaker and overall signal attractiveness was largely determined by signal timing preferences. I suggest that preference interactions can result in changes in the dynamics of sexual selection and in the maintenance of variation in signal traits, because males with unattractive signals could gain higher mating success by producing these signals in a leading position, thus weakening or even disrupting feature-based signal selection.

AB Olfactory orientation by insects may be guided by specific volatile blends released from sites where resources are present. Such blends need to be recognized against the odorous background of the habitat. The egg parasitoid Closterocerus ruforum is known to be attracted to plant volatiles induced by egg deposition of its herbivorous host, the pine sawfly Diprion pini. The parasitoid has to detect this volatile signal against a background of other pine volatiles (i.e. odour from pine without host eggs). Previous studies have shown that attractive resource-indicating odour (pine with host eggs) and nonattractive habitat odour (pine without eggs) differ only by enhanced quantities of (E)-beta-farnesene in the resource-indicating odour. However, (E)-beta-farnesene per se was not attractive. We studied the relevance of quantitative ratios of (E)-beta-farnesene and other pine volatiles present in the habitat for parasitoid orientation by electrophysiological methods (EAG) and behavioural (olfactometer) assays. Seven of 12 terpenoid pine volatiles elicited an EAG response. In tests of the parasitoid's behavioural response to EAG-active volatiles, a blend of five components (including (E)-beta-farnesene) was sufficient to attract the parasitoid but only when the ratio of (E)-beta-farnesene and the other compounds matched that in odour from egg-laden pine. Since the quantities of volatiles from egg-laden and egg-free pine are not significantly different except for (E)-beta-farnesene, our results show that the quantity of a resource-indicating key compound (here (E)-beta-farnesene) is validated by its ratio to quantities of background volatiles emitted by both the resource and the habitat.

AB Three brown lemurs, Eulemur fulvus, and two black lemurs, Eulemur macaco, were trained to select consistently the photograph of the face of a known individual (KI: belonging to the same social group) when it was presented simultaneously with a photograph of the face of an unfamiliar individual (UI: belonging to another social group). After the learning phase, the subjects were presented with new pairs of photographs (KI versus UI: photographs that were not used in the learning phase), the same pairs presented in different associations, and finally pairs of photographs that were completely novel (50 different pairs). All the subjects selected the KI significantly more often than the UI under all conditions. Additional tests showed that the subjects preferentially selected photographs of a UI belonging to their own species versus a UI belonging to the other species. No preference was observed when the subjects were presented with two KI or with their own photograph associated with a UI. These results reveal that the face contains information allowing lemurs to discriminate familiar individuals from unfamiliar ones. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB An underexploited approach to study condition dependence of sexually selected ornaments is to use inbreeding to manipulate individual genetic quality. Because of differences in genetic architecture, sexually selected traits are expected to suffer stronger inbreeding depression than morphological traits. We used full-sib mating to investigate the effects of inbreeding on viability, attractiveness, morphology and potentially secondary sexual traits in male and female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Unexpectedly, the genetic load from lethal alleles (leading to early mortality) was low. In males, we found strong negative effects of inbreeding on song rate, beak colour, body size and choice chamber attractiveness, whereas body condition, fat deposition, song structure and plumage ornaments were unaffected. In females, beak colour, body size, fat deposition and choice chamber behaviour showed significant inbreeding depression. These results indicate that some but not all adult phenotypes are affected by inbreeding, most probably because of the homozygous expression of slightly deleterious mutations. Our findings complement alternative approaches to study the condition dependence of traits that may be relevant in mate choice or competition.

ID EGG PREDATORS; CUES; INFORMATION
AB Prey use predator cues to inform defensive decisions. Detecting these cues is often complicated by benign stimuli that resemble and can be mistaken for predators, leading prey to display costly defences incorrectly. One strategy that prey have evolved to reduce these 'false alarms' is to respond only to stimuli with characteristics consistent with predator cues. Decision errors might still be frequent, however, in cases where the probability distributions of benign stimulus properties completely overlap those of predator cues. In such cases, inhibition of defensive responses by characteristic features of benign stimuli could further improve discrimination. Red-eyed treefrog embryos, Agalychnis callidryas, hatch prematurely to escape egg predators. They detect predators using vibrations generated during attacks. However, common benign disturbances such as rainstorms generate vibrations with property probability distributions that largely overlap those of predators. We used vibration playbacks to test the hypotheses that embryos use two features of rainstorm vibrations not shared by predator attacks, characteristic high frequencies and an initial period of intensity buildup, to avoid hatching in response to this benign stimulus. The escape-hatching response to otherwise stimulatory vibrations is reduced in the presence of either feature characteristic of rainstorms. Either A. callidryas embryos use rainstorm features to inform their hatching decision or these features alter their perception of predator cues. Identifying likely sources of potential false alarms and comparing their stimulus characteristics to predator cues and prey decision rules will improve our understanding of both the information processing challenges facing prey and the ways they solve them.

AB We investigated the social organization of the Australian sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa, by describing the social network of a local population. We attached activity meters and GPS recorders to 21 neighbouring lizards in a semiarid site in South Australia, and monitored their location every 10 min over 3 months (September-December 2007). From over 5000 sets of synchronized location records we calculated distances between all possible dyads of active lizards, and constructed binary social networks based on close associations between individuals. We compared empirical networks with a null model network for spatially structured populations that assumed random movement within lizard home ranges. We showed significantly lower network degree (i.e. fewer cases of individuals associating) in the observed network than in the null model, and deduced avoidance between some individuals. We found the predominant form of social organization was pair living, and, contrary to previous reports, we found pair associations persisted after mating had finished. Thus, the network analysis revealed a cryptic social organization, which cannot be explained by either biparental care or mate guarding, but may instead relate to refuge site distributions, enhanced vigilance or efficient location of mates in subsequent seasons.

AB Despite widespread evidence for the benefits of polyandry, there are costs associated with each mating for females, and for many species, it is unknown whether the costs of extra matings outweigh the benefits. In the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), costs might come from male harassment during mating attempts or from injuries that females sustain during copulation. Benefits of mating might come from nutrients or water transferred in the ejaculate. If mating is costly overall, male presence ( sexual harassment) and multiple mating in C. maculatus is expected to reduce female fitness. Females were housed with differing numbers of males (1-4) and differing opportunities for copulation. When females were both harassed by and could remate with more than one male, they had lower lifetime reproductive rates and reduced life span relative to monandrous females. These results indicate that when females are continually exposed to multiple males, the direct benefits of multiple mating do not compensate for the costs.

AB Mimicry theory played a prominent role in the development of natural selection theory, and sparked a long-lasting interest in the observation that Batesian mimicry in some butterflies is female limited and polymorphic. Mimetic females of polymorphic species clearly have a selective advantage due to reduced predation pressure, but the selective forces that maintain nonmimetic female forms remain unclear. Attention has lately been focused on three explanations based on sexual selection: (1) male mate preference, (2) pseudo-sexual selection and (3) sexual harassment avoidance. These are thought to favour nonmimetic female forms and allow them to persist in the population via balancing selection. Here I review the assumptions and evidence for each of these hypotheses and assess their relative merit. I find that: (a) key predictions of the hypotheses have not been tested, (b) the hypotheses interpret surrogate measures of fitness trade-offs implicit in balancing selection (e.g. mating frequency) differently, and (c) sexual selection may not maintain nonmimetic females at high mimic frequencies if male mate preference is frequency dependent. As a result, none of the hypotheses is unequivocally supported by available data. I show that a fourth, non-sexual selectionist hypothesis, namely that physiological trade-offs maintain mimetic female polymorphism, is based on unclear assumptions and probably explains minor variation in female polymorphism. Finally, I show that the basic framework of frequency-dependent mimetic advantage, independent of sexual selection, can adequately explain female-limited mimetic polymorphism in a broad range of species. Testing this framework should be a priority in resolving this problem. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mate choice and mate attraction are important behaviours influencing the evolution of elaborate traits. It is possible that male general cognitive performance plays an important role in sexual attractiveness, but there has been no direct test of this hypothesis. Satin bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, are an excellent species for testing this hypothesis because their complex male courtship, including use of decorations of certain colours, suggests a selective advantage to individuals with superior cognitive abilities. We used males' strong aversion to red objects on their bowers to design two unique problem-solving tests. We presented males with these problems to test the hypothesis that males that are better problem-solvers have higher mating success. We confirmed this prediction and demonstrate that neither age nor motivational level significantly influenced problem-solving scores. Our findings suggest that general cognitive performance is related to male mating success. This is the first evidence that individuals with better problem-solving abilities are more sexually attractive. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID DISTANCE ESTIMATION
AB The ability to orient through familiar areas is key to the success of many animal groups. To date, research has focused on how animals orient horizontally and very little work has considered three-dimensional environments, particularly the volumetric surroundings inhabited by many birds, flying insects and fish. These animals do not have their movement constrained by surfaces, and can move with three degrees of freedom. This extra freedom of movement increases the amount of navigational information potentially available, which could lead to an information-processing problem. We studied how a fish, the sighted banded tetra, Astyanax fasciatus, copes with this problem by testing how it learns and stores information from its volumetric surroundings. Using a novel assay based on associative learning of the vertical (up/down) and horizontal (left/right) components of a rotating Y-maze, we found that banded tetras learned and remembered information from the vertical and horizontal components when they were presented either separately or as an integrated three-dimensional unit. Furthermore, when information from the two components conflicted, the fish used the previously learned vertical information in preference to the horizontal, possibly because the vertical axis contained an extra, global, cue: hydrostatic pressure. We propose that animals that navigate through volumes may simplify the information storage problem by encoding the horizontal and vertical components separately. These components could then be used together for rapid, efficient orientation. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Personality in animal behaviour describes the observation that behavioural differences between individuals are consistent over time and context. Studies of group-living animals show that movement order among individuals is also consistent over time and context, suggesting that some individuals lead and others follow. However, the relationship between leadership and personality traits is poorly studied. We measured several personality traits and leadership of individual barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis. We measured body size and scored the dominance of individuals living in a stable group situation before subjecting them to an open-field test, an activity test, a novel-object test, and a leadership test in which the order of the movement of individuals in pairs towards a feeding patch was scored. We found high repeatability for activity and novel-object scores over time. Leadership was strongly correlated with novel-object score but not with dominance rank, activity or exploration in an open field. These results provide evidence that leadership is closely related to some aspects of personality. Interestingly, an individual's arrival at the food patch was affected not only by the novel-object score of the focal individual, but also by the novel-object score of the companion individual, indicating that movement patterns of individuals living in groups are affected by the personality traits of other group members and suggesting that movement patterns of a group may be shaped by the mix of personality types present in the group.

AB One Darwinian puzzle is that many prey are morphologically or behaviourally conspicuous. Being conspicuous seems detrimental to prey with limited antipredator ability, because conspicuousness is likely to increase detection by predators. Theory predicts that if conspicuousness effectively redirects predator attacks and decreases hunting success, the benefits of enhanced survival can outweigh the cost of conspicuousness. We investigated a conspicuous antipredator behaviour in the orb spider, Cyclosa mulmeinensis, which adds decorations composed of prey pellets and eggsacs to its web. We calculated colour contrasts of spiders against prey pellets and eggsacs and recorded predators' responses to spiders on webs in the field. Webs with more decorations suffered increased numbers of wasp attacks. However because these decorations resembled spiders in size and colour, they functioned as decoys to distract predators and became the focus of predator attacks. By quantifying the costs and benefits of Cyclosa spiders' web-decorating behaviour in a natural setting, we found that this conspicuous antipredator display would enhance overall survival and was adaptive for this vulnerable prey.

AB Animals that scatter hoard seeds in the same habitat potentially compete for those cached seeds when they forage for stored food. Yellow pine chipmunks, Tamias amoenus, and golden-mantled ground squirrels, Spermophilus lateralis, scatter hoard Jeffrey pine, Pinus jeffreyi, seeds differently; chipmunks make small, shallow caches whereas ground squirrels make large, deep caches. We hypothesized that ground squirrels bury seeds deeply to avoid pilferage from chipmunks, but it was unclear how chipmunks avoid pilferage by ground squirrels. We investigated this competitive interaction by making an array of caches of differing sizes and depths in rodent-proof enclosures in the field and allowed naive subjects to forage. Ground squirrels (N = 8) were unable to find caches at any depth (0/384 caches = 0%) but chipmunks (N = 9) found 34.3% of caches present (148/432 caches), including many deeper caches resembling those that ground squirrels make. In the laboratory, ground squirrels found four species of cached seeds at chance levels (13.1% observed versus 16.7% expected from random digging), whereas chipmunks performed well above random (34.2% versus 16.7%). These results suggest that chipmunk caches are not vulnerable to ground squirrel pilfering and that ground squirrels cannot detect and remove buried seeds easily and must forage for seeds on plants or on the soil surface. Ground squirrels apparently avoid pilfering by chipmunks by larder hoarding most seeds and defending the larder. Differences in the hoarding behaviour of these species reduce competition and promote coexistence. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In maximizing reproductive success, individuals face a trade-off between parental care for their current offspring and investing in androgen-dependent sexual traits to produce further offspring. It has thus been proposed that parental effort would suppress androgen levels. Here, we studied parental effort by manipulating brood size in the peacock blenny, Salaria pavo, a littoral fish species in which males show long periods of paternal care. We focused on the effects of brood size on female spawning rate (measured as number of eggs received in the nest by focal males) and androgen levels. We found a positive linear relationship between brood size and the number of eggs received subsequently. Accordingly, spawning rate increased for males with experimentally enlarged broods while it decreased for males in which brood size was reduced. However, over a longer time interval, brood sizes of both treatments returned to the nonmanipulated brood size, suggesting an effect of additional factors such as male quality. Brood size did not show the expected negative relationship with levels of testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone. On the contrary, testosterone levels were positively correlated with brood size. However, in agreement with the prediction, changes in the level of parental care by manipulation of brood size showed an inverse relationship with testosterone levels. As with brood size, given time, testosterone levels tended to return to nonmanipulated levels. Such changes suggest that males adjust their brood size to an individual value through androgen modulation of courtship or other traits influencing female spawning rate.

AB Prey experience a broad range of temporal patterns of predation risk and may face different problems when assessing risk level and deciding how to allocate costly antipredator behaviour across time. We simulated in the laboratory repeated predatory attacks of different intensity (low versus high risk) to Iberian rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, with similar numbers of low- and high-risk attacks across a trial, but with different temporal patterns of presentation (i.e. a series of low-risk and then a series of high risk, or vice versa, or successive attacks where risk changed randomly). We measured activity levels, time hidden in refuges after each predatory attack, and propensity to hide in refuges when the predator is close but not actually attacking ('false alarm flights). Antipredator responses were of higher intensity when risk was high, but responses also depended on temporal patterns of risk. When previous attacks were of low- risk or when risk was random, prey activity did not change between risk levels. False alarm flights in the low- risk situation were more frequent when risk was random or immediately after a series of high-risk attacks. When successive attacks were of similar risk level, lizards seemed able to predict risk level in the next attack and modified their antipredator behaviour accurately. However, when risk level was random, lizards did not seem able to predict risk level and adopted a conservative strategy, overestimating risk even though costs of the antipredator responses increased.

AB Two hypothesized benefits of delayed dispersal are access to resources and prolonged brood care (or parental nepotism). Resource abundance (mistletoe wealth) is a key factor influencing whether sons stay home in western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, but nepotism is also observed. Western bluebird sons commonly remain in their family groups throughout the winter, whereas daughters usually disperse before winter. Because pairing often takes place in winter groups, with newly formed pairs settling on exclusive all-purpose territories in spring, selection for sexual competition and nepotism co-occur and may simultaneously influence patterns of aggression within groups. We measured aggression at mealworm feeder stations, finding evidence of (1) intrasexual aggression against unrelated group members by experienced breeders of both sexes and (2) nepotism towards sons and daughters by experienced breeder females but not by experienced breeder males. Females showed much higher levels of aggression towards same-sex immigrants than males did. Experienced breeder males did not evict their sons from the natal territory, but they were 12 times more aggressive towards sons than breeder females were towards daughters. They were also equally aggressive towards sons and immigrant males, suggesting that local breeding competition and the benefits of intrasexual dominance counter the benefits of paternal nepotism towards sons.

AB In nonhuman animal mate choice, a small number of ( usually male) options typically leads to an unequal distribution of selections ( usually by females) across the options, indicating adaptive choice; conversely, an increasing number of mate options typically yields less inequality of choices across the options. We examined mating skew, a measure of this inequality in mating choices, among humans by considering the offers made by participants in 118 speed-dating sessions of various sizes. Overall, the relationship between a number of indices of mating skew and option set size ( the number of opposite-sex participants in the speed-dating session) was positive, with larger sessions producing more mate choice inequality. This result contrasts with the negative relationship between skew and option set size found in nonhuman animals. We interpret these results as the outcome of similar choice mechanisms but different cues used by humans versus other species when making a choice from an abundance of mates.

AB The complex pattern of mines made by leafminers is postulated to hinder the host-searching behaviour of parasitoids, and if this is true, parasitoids should have evolved strategies of searching mines in a way that will achieve the highest efficiency. We investigated the possible deterrent effect of mine pattern complexity on a parasitoid searching for a host within a patch, and the searching behaviour used by the parasitoid to shorten search time. For this, we used the leafminer Liriomyza trifolii (Diptera: Agromyzidae) and its generalist parasitoid Hemiptarsenus varicornis (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). Observations of the parasitoids showed that searching time increased on mines with complex patterns and crosses. We also found that the parasitoids used a specific searching strategy: they made multiple trackings to find the host and each tracking was terminated with a constant mine-leaving rate per unit time irrespective of mine complexity. With an individual-based model, we also found that while search time to host encounter increased with mine complexity, the optimal mine-leaving rate that attained the most efficient search did not vary with mine complexity, indicating that making multiple trackings with an optimal constant rate was advantageous in terms of search time for any search on a mine over a range of levels of complexity. Furthermore, the mine-leaving rate estimated from the behavioural observations was consistent with the optimal rate obtained in the simulations. Multiple-tracking behaviour by H. varicornis is the best way for foraging for hosts whose feeding pattern varies from simple to more tortuous.

AB Pit-building antlion larvae are small sit-and-wait arthropod predators that dig conical pits in sandy soils. We investigated the effect of exposure to constant light versus constant dark conditions on antlion behaviour. Antlions tended to relocate less often, construct pits more frequently and construct larger pits in constant light. We interpret this as an indication of dichotomous behaviour under light versus dark conditions such that antlion larvae hunt during the day and modify their positions at night. Antlion larvae immediately responded to the complete switch in this illumination treatment and adapted their behaviour to fit the new conditions. Prey capture success did not differ between the constant light and constant dark conditions. When provided with a choice between light and dark conditions, the vast majority of larvae preferred the former. Those that preferred constant dark, however, were on average larger than those that preferred constant light. We thus suggest that since larger antlion larvae possess larger fat reserves, they can afford reductions in foraging activity ( possibly to increase safety). An examination of the antlion trade-off between their preference for light and their preference for sand depth (which may affect their ability to evade predators) showed that their response to illumination was much more prominent, irrespective of the sand depth. Finally, combining light with other factors such as temperature and density may further elucidate microhabitat selection in pit-building antlion larvae. 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB One probable cost of dispersing to a new breeding habitat is unfamiliarity with local conditions such as the whereabouts of food or the habits of local predators, and consequently immigrants may have lower probabilities of survival than more experienced residents. Within a breeding season, estimated daily survival probabilities of cliff swallows, Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, at colonies in southwestern Nebraska, U. S. A., were highest for birds that had always nested at the same site, followed by those for birds that had nested there in some (but not all) past years. Daily survival probabilities were lowest for birds that were naive immigrants to a colony site and for yearling birds that were nesting for the first time. Birds with past experience at a colony site had monthly survival 8.6% greater than that of naive immigrants. Experienced residents did better than immigrants in colonies with fewer than 750 nests, but in colonies with more than 750 nests, naive immigrants paid no survival costs relative to experienced residents. Removal of nest ectoparasites by fumigation resulted in higher survival probabilities for all birds, on average, and diminished the differences between immigrants and past residents, probably by improving bird condition to the extent that effects of past experience were relatively less important and harder to detect. The greater survival of experienced residents could not be explained by condition or territory quality, suggesting that familiarity with a local area confers survival advantages during the breeding season for cliff swallows. Colonial nesting may help to moderate the cost of unfamiliarity with an area, probably through social transfer of information about food sources and enhanced vigilance in large groups.

AB Social learning involves the transmission of information from demonstrators to conspecifics. The mother is expected to be the main demonstrator in solitary species, whereas several individuals can be demonstrators in group-living species. We studied social learning about novel food in two populations of the African striped mouse, with different social systems: a desert population (group living with paternal care and natal philopatry) and a grassland population (solitary, paternal care in captivity only and natal dispersal). We predicted that both parents would be reliable demonstrators for desert striped mice but only the mother would be a demonstrator for grassland striped mice. Adults and unweaned young were assigned to one of five treatments in captivity: (1) father or (2) mother fed novel food away from young; (3) novel food fed to both adults with young present; and (4) father or (5) mother fed mouse cubes (control) away from young. Juveniles from all treatments individually received novel food after weaning. The responses of juveniles to novel food were greater (shorter latency, more sniffs) when the mother was the demonstrator, regardless of population. Mothers may be more reliable demonstrators than fathers because information can be transmitted using multiple channels (olfaction, lactation). Our study also showed that fathers were more reliable demonstrators and responses to the novel food were greater in desert than grassland striped mice. These population differences reflect the different social organization of the populations and the unpredictable availability of highly nutritious food in the desert.

AB In fights between groups of social animals, willingness of an individual to fight increases with group size. To better understand how individuals assess numerical state and coordinate group behaviour, I investigated how individual ants, Formica xerophila, collect information about group size prior to a competitive encounter, and how this information affects F. xerophila behaviour towards a closely related competitor, F. integroides. To determine how F. xerophila collect information regarding numerical state, I performed aggression bioassays between F. xerophila and F. integroides in which F. xerophila individuals were experimentally exposed to isolated communication pathways (either physical contact or potential chemical interactions) with group members prior to a competitive encounter. I found that individual F. xerophila in direct contact with group members prior to encountering F. integroides were more aggressive during the interaction than were F. xerophila individuals in contact with group members via potential pheromones either in the air or on the ground prior to the encounter. Additionally, individual F. xerophila exposed directly to group member surface hydrocarbons prior to a competitive encounter were just as aggressive as ants exposed to live group members. Aggression towards competitors, however, was only induced after approximately 25 min of direct exposure, but individuals remained aggressive for at least 25 min after hydrocarbon stimuli were removed. The same compounds that allowed individual ants to distinguish group members from nonmembers also induced aggressive behaviour. These results provide detail into how animals can collect and use information regarding group size to coordinate a group response. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB It is important for social animals to be able to discriminate between group members. Much is known about vocal social communication through auditory playback techniques; however, visual information may also be important for conspecific recognition in the absence of auditory cues. Within the visual channel both static and dynamic features may play important roles in individual recognition. Rooks are a social corvid and they live in large colonies and form long- term pair bonds, both requiring the ability to recognize individuals. In this study we investigated whether rooks 'see' a digital image as a representation of a real animal, using visual playback techniques and a new paradigm for assessing social preferences that uses stimuli differing in features such as whether they are live animals, static or video images, or stuffed models. We presented the rooks with two different stimuli of the same category and recorded the amount of time they observed each stimulus. Rooks preferred to look at a live bird, static or video image of a bird, and a stuffed model over an empty compartment. Rooks also showed a clear preference for a strongly affiliated conspecific (e. g. their partner) over a nonaffiliated conspecific. This preference was not apparent when we presented subjects with static images; however, the preference was seen with video, indicating that rooks can recognize individuals in video. We conclude that video playback is a useful technique for investigating rook social behaviour. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The temperate comb-footed spider, Anelosimus studiosus, shows a social behaviour polymorphism: individuals may defend asocial nests against intrusion by conspecifics or cooperate with them in multifemale nests. A suite of behavioural traits, including response to predators and prey, degree of superfluous killing, exploratory behaviour and general level of activity, was examined in laboratory trials to: (1) establish the extent to which these traits are correlated with social phenotype and (2) explore the potential adaptive value of this trait suite to the respective asocial and social phenotypes. Populations from the two latitudes studied, 26 degrees and 36 degrees, showed similar suites of correlated traits or syndromes. The individuals tested generally fell into two groups in the behavioural trials, although the asocial individuals from the mixed-phenotype population at 36 degrees latitude were intermediate with respect to some of the measures. Individuals scored as 'social' generally showed less aggressive behaviour towards predatory cues, were less responsive to prey encountering their webs, showed little evidence of superfluous killing of prey and showed lower levels of activity than did most individuals scored as 'asocial'. These results suggest linkage or pleiotropy between social behaviour and these traits. The behaviour of individuals in staged, mixed-phenotype feeding pairs indicated that social individuals may suffer fitness consequences in polymorphic populations. These results are discussed with respect to the stability and dynamics of the respective phenotypes in polymorphic populations. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While polyandry is essentially ubiquitous across the animal kingdom, the net fitness consequences of multiple mating remain the subject of much debate. In some taxa the costs of multiple mating outweigh potential benefits, and large direct costs are unlikely to be compensated for by indirect benefits. Nevertheless, direct and indirect benefits potentially provide females with substantial fitness returns, and these are manifest in some species. We investigated some fitness costs and benefits of multiple mating in the fly Drosophila simulans. We compared the longevity and lifetime reproductive success of females with intermittent or continual exposure to males with those of singly mated females housed alone or housed with virgin females. We also compared the same fitness components in females mated once, twice and three times. We found no difference in the lifetime reproductive success of females housed intermittently with males and those housed continually with males, but females in these treatments produced more offspring than singly mated females (housed alone or with virgin females). However, females that were continually exposed to males died younger than females from any other treatment. We also found that females who mated more than once had higher lifetime reproductive success, and that number of matings had no influence on residual longevity. These results contrast somewhat with findings from Drosophila melanogaster, and suggest that while polyandry is beneficial for female D. simulans, male harassment can be costly.

AB Studies of female mate choice in fowl typically invoke ornament size as the best predictor of male reproductive success. The strongest evidence comes from experiments in which a hen is presented with two unfamiliar and physically separated males that she can evaluate and mate with for up to 120 min. This design controls for prior experience and male-male competition, but deprives females of information available only from longer sampling periods and a more natural context. In the wild, fowl spend their lives in stable social groups. We observed birds under naturalistic conditions to evaluate the biological significance of ornament size and to explore other potential predictors of male mating and reproductive success. For each male, we measured morphology and several behaviours related to food, predators, dominance and courtship. Using principal components analysis and multiple regression, we show that behaviour is the best predictor of male mating and reproductive success under natural conditions, and that the most salient behaviours are dominance and the rate of antipredator signalling. Dominance probably affects an individual's reproductive success by determining access to receptive females, but the mechanism responsible for the role of alarm calling is less clear. Costly alarm signals may advertise male quality, or they may reflect judicious risk-taking by males that have achieved mating success. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Spiders alter web architecture in response to many environmental factors. Yet, the functional implications of this behavioural plasticity are poorly understood, especially for spiders that spin long-lasting webs such as cobwebs. The western black widow spins a three-dimensional web that captures terrestrial prey and can persist for many days. However, the shape of the cobweb depends upon changes in the spider's body condition. Starved spiders invest more silk in sticky gumfooted threads, whereas sated spiders invest more silk in supporting threads. We tested the hypothesis that the increased investment in sticky gumfooted threads by starved spiders functions to improve the prey capture of their webs. Regardless of intrinsic foraging motivation, both fed and starved spiders captured more prey, more quickly and more efficiently, when hunting on a web that was spun by a starved spider. Our study shows that cobweb spiders actively manipulate web-spinning behaviours in ways that alter the functions of their webs and that even spiders spinning relatively long-lasting webs may use behavioural plasticity to respond to changing selective pressures in their environment.

AB Testosterone is thought to mediate a trade-off between paternal effort and mating effort, such that males investing monogamously have lower testosterone than those with multiple partners. This suggests that high-testosterone males may have a reproductive advantage over their low-testosterone counterparts via increased mating success. We tested 119 adult males to assess whether testosterone is associated with mating success, and rated masculinity and attractiveness. We found a significant positive correlation between testosterone and cumulative mating success. There was, however, no correlation between testosterone and rated masculinity or attractiveness. This study indicates that, although current levels of testosterone covary with male mating success, this effect may not be mediated by women's preferences for visual cues to testosterone levels conveyed in static face or body features. If the testosteroneemating success link is driven by female choice, this effect may be behaviourally modulated, for example, through the augmentation of male mate seeking or courtship effort.

AB In territorial songbirds both sexes depend on possession of a territory, yet its defence is traditionally regarded as the domain of male birds. Studies on duetting species have examined both male and female roles in territorial defence, often focusing on potential reproductive conflict between the pair members. Surprisingly, interactions between defending pair members are rarely investigated. We combined observations on undisturbed pairs of purple-crowned fairy-wrens, Malurus coronatus, with experimental simulation of a strong territorial threat to quantify coordination between partners during territorial defence. Pairs formed strongly cohesive partnerships: males and females naturally spent a high proportion of time close together (75% within 5 m) in dense riparian habitat, and coordinated half their songs to form duets. Partners that spent more time close together also coordinated more of their songs to form duets. When we presented playback simulating paired intruders, females responded as aggressively as males. Intensity of approach to the playback speaker was highly correlated within pairs. Spatial coordination between partners increased dramatically when they responded to simulated intrusion so that they spent virtually all their time within 2 m of one another, and most of the songs they sang were coordinated to form duets. We conclude that the highly coordinated vocal and approach responses of male and female purple-crowned fairy-wrens to simulated intrusion in the nonbreeding season are not coincidental, or a consequence of sexual conflict over mating, but instead are likely to represent cooperative territorial defence of a valuable shared resource.

AB In altricial birds, parental care after fledging should be terminated as soon as the benefits from deserting the young outweigh those from continuing parental care. In seasonal environments, multiple breeders may trade off fitness benefits of the time invested in the care of fledglings of one brood against the benefits of an advanced start of the subsequent clutch. Using radiotelemetry of 494 fledglings in 114 families (of 88 pairs) of the double-brooded barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, we found that, irrespective of the offspring quality, the duration of postfledging parental care was shorter for first broods than for single and second broods. A shorter duration of postfledging care was associated with a steeper decline in feeding rates after fledging. Postfledging parental care also depended on the pair's breeding season length and on the phenotypic quality of the female parent. We suggest that pairs that start other reproductive bouts in the same season and pairs with high chances of survival to subsequent years reduce parental effort in the current brood to maximize lifetime reproductive output. The results support the hypothesis that multibrooded birds adjust the duration of postfledging care in relation to future reproductive attempts because of an intraseasonal trade-off in the allocation of time between successive broods.

AB Explaining the factors that determine the distribution of mating success among males is essential to our understanding of sexual selection. Classic theory has focused on how competition among males and female choice for traits of the male or his territory drive sexual selection. Recent theory has also shown that female mate choice copying can alter the strength and direction of selection on male traits. Yet, we know very little about the prevalence and importance of nonindependent female choice in wild populations. In a species with male territoriality and paternal care (the ocellated wrasse, Symphodus ocellatus), I first show that females express nonindependent mate choice, responding both to the recent mating success of the male and to the presence of other spawning females rather than to variation in male courtship or defence of the nest. Females were significantly more likely to spawn with the same male when another spawning female was present than when they were alone at the nest, providing some of the first direct evidence of female mate choice copying under natural conditions in the wild. I further show that a short-term experimental increase in a territorial male's mating success attracts more females in the future and increases male paternal care. These observed patterns of female choice and male care are consistent with female choice for the direct benefits of male care where the best indicator trait of male parental effort is the mating behaviour of other females rather than male courtship behaviour or physical traits.

AB The 'cocktail party problem' refers to the difficulty that humans have in recognizing speech in noisy social environments. Many nonhuman animals also communicate acoustically in noisy social aggregations, and thus also encounter and solve cocktail-party-like problems. Relatively few studies, however, have investigated the processes by which nonhuman animals solve sound source segregation problems in the behaviourally relevant context of acoustic communication. In humans, 'spatial release from masking' contributes to sound source segregation by improving the ability of listeners to recognize speech that is spatially separated from other sources of speech or 'speech-shaped' masking noise. Using a phonotaxis paradigm, I tested the hypothesis that spatial release from masking improves the ability of female grey treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis, to discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific calls that were spatially separated from two sources of 'chorus-shaped' masking noise by either 15 degrees or 90 degrees. As the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was decreased from +3 dB to -15 dB (by decreasing the signal level in 6-dB steps), fewer females made a choice, and the likelihood of a female choosing the heterospecific call also increased. At a SNR of -3 dB, females oriented towards and chose the conspecific call in the 90 degrees separation condition, but not when signals and maskers were separated by 15 degrees. These results support the hypothesis that a well-known solution to the cocktail party problem in humans, spatial release from masking, also plays a role in acoustic signal recognition in animals that communicate in biological equivalents of cocktail-party-like environments.

AB Solitary predators respond to cryptic prey by adopting counterstrategies such as forming a search image or reducing their search rate. However, the response of group- foraging individuals to cryptic prey remains poorly studied. We investigated the effect of the presence of an experienced or a naive conspeci. c on the ability of nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata, to exploit millet seeds presented on cryptic and noncryptic backgrounds. The conspeci. c's level of experience did not affect a focal bird's foraging, so we lumped both experience condition for analysis. The presence of a competitor tended to increase the occurrences of vigilance and food searching, but it did not affect the duration of vigilance. In contrast, foraging on a cryptic background significantly affected foraging by reducing the occurrences of food searching and vigilance, and increasing the latency to eat the first seed as well as the number of detection errors. Background type and competitor presence interacted significantly for searching bout duration, number of seeds eaten and foraging efficiency. In all cases, competitor presence negatively affected foraging efficiency under cryptic backgrounds. Finally, the foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a competitor on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.

AB Two hypotheses could explain the evolution of paternal care: caring males are more attractive to females and mate more often (sexual selection); males care when the bene fits in terms of offspring survival exceed the costs (natural selection). To test these hypotheses we used Phyllomorpha laciniata: females can choose whether to lay eggs on plants or on conspecifics, and the extent to which males carry eggs varies between populations. Our results do not support the sexual selection hypothesis: females did not choose to mate with egg-carrying males in either natural populations or experimental contexts. We compared two populations that differ in the extent of male egg carrying and we show that in the population where male egg carrying was more prevalent, parasitism pressure was higher field experiments revealed that, in the population with high parasitism rate, egg mortality as a result of parasitoid attack was up to 10 times higher on plants than on conspecifics. Egg carrying is thus an effective strategy that protects eggs against parasitoids. We conclude that the main benefit derived by males from egg carrying is an increase in offspring survival, and that males are sensitive to interpopulation differences in egg mortality risks. Male care in this system has evolved despite intermediate levels of paternity certainty because the impact on offspring survival is high, and the costs in terms of loss of mating opportunities low. Thus, our findings support the natural selection hypothesis, although additional work on more populations is needed to verify this. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many defended prey advertise their defences to potential predators by being conspicuously coloured and/or having distinct bold markings. These colourful warning signals bene fit prey since they are easy to learn to avoid, and seem particularly effective as deterrents. However, the evolution of conspicuous coloration is problematic, because if a distinct conspicuous morph arises in a cryptic species, it would be more easily detected and the risk of being attacked would be high. However, this argument assumes that attack probability will be the only factor determining prey survival, but in fact many prey have external defences that predators can detect, allowing prey to survive attacks. This experiment tests whether a rare conspicuously coloured defended morph can have a selective advantage over a cryptic defended morph when defence chemicals can be detected before ingestion by a naive predator. Using chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, foraging on coloured chick crumbs, we found that naive birds can learn to avoid defended prey when they are conspicuous but not when they are cryptic. Crucially, when prey ingestion, and not attack probability, was used as our measure of mortality we found that there can be a selective advantage to being conspicuous in a cryptic population. This advantage can occur even in the first avoidance-learning trial, providing an initial selective advantage for rare conspicuous defended morphs. However, this does not occur in all conspicuously coloured prey populations, and it is evident that colour biases are important and their role in the initial evolution of conspicuous colour signals should be considered.

AB Theoretical models predict that lethal contests should take place only when animals have severely limited breeding opportunities. Indeed, fatal fighting appears to occur routinely in only a handful of species that. fit this mould. Here we report that 16-33% of all territorial evictions in male common loons, Gavia immer, are fatal for the displaced owner; in contrast, females seldom. fight to the death for territories despite frequent territorial evictions. Since loons are long- lived and have ample reproductive options, they differ starkly from other fatal-fighting species. Several factors might contribute to lethal combat in loons, including: ( 1) the high value of territories to males, ( 2) a steady loss of condition among male residents, which could lead individuals with poor reproductive prospects to invest heavily in a current reproductive attempt, and ( 3) an inability of males defending tiny lakes to escape aggressive usurpers, owing to extremely high wing loading. The difficulty of detecting fatal contests in the. field and the tendency of scientists to underestimate the behavioural impact of rare events leave open the possibility that fatal contests are a more widespread behavioural pattern than currently thought.

AB Although dogs, Canis familiaris, are skilful at responding to human social cues, the role of ontogeny in the development of these abilities has not been systematically examined. We studied the ability of very young dog puppies to follow human communicative cues and successfully find hidden food. In the first experiment we compared 6-, 8-, 16- and 24- week- old puppies in their ability to use pointing gestures or a marker as a cue. The results showed that puppies, independent of age, could use all human communicative cues provided; only their success at using the marker cue increased with age. In the second and third experiments we investigated the. exibility of the puppies' understanding by reducing the degree to which they could use local enhancement to solve these problems. Here, subjects could not simply approach the hand of the experimenter and follow its direction to the correct location because cups were placed next to the dog instead of next to the experimenter. Six- week- old puppies readily used all of the human communicative cues provided. These findings support the hypothesis that domestication played a critical role in shaping the ability of dogs to follow human- given cues.

AB The central place foraging model predicts the optimal load sizes of prey carried back to a central place. When the rate of prey loading at the patch declines with time spent in the patch, the optimal, rate-maximizing load sizes increase with round-trip travel times between patch and central place. Numerous tests of this rate-maximizing currency have been carried out with eastern chipmunks carrying loads of seeds to their burrow. All tests have provided consistent qualitative support for the model (load sizes increase with distance) as well as consistent quantitative rejection of the model (loads carried are always considerably smaller than optimal). Confidence in the repeated rejections of the currency is weak because the predicted optimal load sizes stem from extrapolations of the loading function beyond the data used to estimate it. In this study, we provided subjects in the field with a food patch that provided the same increasing interval schedule of prey arrival at 2 m and 15 m from their burrow. Results confirm the quantitative failure of the rate-maximizing currency for the central place foraging model. We propose that the consistent failures of rate maximization with chipmunks are probably due to the higher predation danger when collecting seed from a patch compared to travelling.

AB Identifying the proximate basis of heterospecific matings in hybrid populations could significantly advance our understanding of mate recognition. As females are often considered to be the more selective sex, most studies have focused only on female mate choice. However, male behaviour often plays a determinant role in sexual selection. In the European waterfrog hybridization complex, the unbalanced mating frequency observed between hybrid females Rana esculenta and the parental species Rana lessonae has been attributed to a preference of these females for heterospecific males. In this study, for the first time we investigated the behaviour of males from three taxa (two parental species and the hybrid) in natural choruses. It appears that the three waterfrog taxa differ in their mating behaviour. We found that the breeding behaviour of R. lessonae males (i.e. low-frequency territorial call, close intermale proximity, movement not limited to a small area) suggests that they do not defend any territory. This constitutes evidence that R. lessonae males compete to outrace rivals to receptive females. Apart from the acoustic behaviour that appears to be intermediate between that of the two parental species, the other behavioural traits of the hybrid resemble those of the parental species Rana ridibunda (aggressive and territorial behaviours). These results suggest a genetic basis to these complex behavioural traits. From an ecological point of view, we conclude that the strong under-representation of hybrid males observed in amplexus can be due to the maladaptive hybrid reproductive tactic in mixed choruses.

AB Using a multidisciplinary approach, the present study complements ethological behaviour measurements with basic theoretical concepts, methods and approaches of the personality psychological trait paradigm. Its adoptability and usefulness for animal studies are tested exemplarily on a sample of 20 zoo-housed great apes (five of each of the following species): bonobos, Pan paniscus; chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus; gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla; and orang-utans, Pongo pygmaeus abelii. Data on 76 single trait-relevant behaviours were recorded in a series of 14 laboratory-based situations and in two different group situations. Data collection was repeated completely after a break of 2 weeks within a 50-day period. All behaviour records were sufficiently reliable. Individual- and variable-oriented analyses showed high/substantial temporal stability on different levels of aggregation. Distinctive and stable individual situational and response profiles clarified the importance of situations and of multiple trait-relevant behaviours. The present study calls for a closer collaboration between behavioural biologists and personality psychologists to tap the full potential of animal personality research.

AB The mechanisms of competition and resource domination were analysed in the Mediterranean ant Camponotus cruentatus. In a plot located in southern Spain mature colonies are overdispersed, which is indicative of territoriality in other species. Unexpectedly, however, workers from neighbouring colonies commonly foraged in areas that overlapped by more than 44%. This suggests that while mature colonies possibly prevent the establishment of new colonies in the vicinity of their nests, they do not limit the intrusion of alien foragers. In contrast, rich food sources located in common foraging areas are aggressively defended, generally leading to their domination by the nest that discovered them first. Resource exploitation further requires rapid recruitment of foragers and soldiers to transport food as well as to exclude competitors. Complementary to the field experiments we conducted laboratory bioassays to assess inter-colonial aggression. Group encounters showed that workers of C. cruentatus were equally aggressive towards alien ants irrespective of whether they were sympatric neighbours ( and had possibly had contact), sympatric nonneighbours ( which had probably had no contact), or allopatric. This was corroborated by analysis of the hydrocarbons that generally serve as colony recognition cues. This mixture, which contains an unusual proportion of trimethylalkanes, showed important colony specificity. The high intraspecific aggression shown indiscriminately by workers indicates that the 'dear enemy' effect does not exist in this species and suggests that scarce resources are worth defending against intraspecific competitors. We discuss several proximate and ultimate constraints that may prevent the general occurrence of this process in ants. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Recent studies have stressed the role of scent marks as signals potentially mediating competitor assessment. According to this view, receivers may use scent marks to derive information about the costs of exploiting a given area, but few studies have directly addressed this hypothesis. One of its main predictions is that scent marks should reflect a signaller's competitive ability. We simulated the situation faced by an intruding male when entering the scent-marked territories of rival males of varying competitive ability to test predictions about the role of scent marks in a lizard, Podarcis hispanica. We report that males were attracted to areas marked by males of similar or higher competitive ability (i.e. larger size), but not to areas scent marked by males of lower competitive ability, and that this preference disappeared towards the end of the breeding season. Our results show that ( 1) male lizards can assess rival competitive ability (i.e. rival size) on the basis of scent marks alone, ( 2) scent marks do not function as chemical barriers to deter intruders, and ( 3) male response to marked areas varies throughout the breeding season, suggesting a shift in the cost-to-benefit balance of entering a scent-marked area. We propose that male assessment of rival competitive ability may function as an indirect assessment mechanism of territory resource quality in this species, and thus that scent marks may convey information not only about costs but also about the benefits of exploiting a scent-marked area.

AB In social insects, decisions are usually predicted to be more accurate than individual decisions, because individual preferences are amplified at the group level. Although social caterpillars, as individuals, possess considerable 'nutritional wisdom' and have the capacity to regulate their nutrient intake: does this mean that the collective nutritional decisions made by colonies are better? We investigated individual feeding responses and collective decisions when caterpillar colonies were faced with different food sources. Forest tent caterpillars, Malacosoma disstria, had to choose between nutritionally balanced and unbalanced food sources placed at opposite ends of a bridge. At the individual level, caterpillars showed a clear preference for the balanced food source. In contrast, at the collective level, colonies of caterpillars randomly chose one of the two, and then became trapped for at least 24 h as a result of trail following behaviour. If the first caterpillar found the unbalanced food, it was followed by the others and the colony was unable to reverse this choice. This study provides evidence for a novel potential cost to group living, and shows that group feeding behaviour cannot always be simply predicted from individual preferences.

AB Escalated aggression has been studied both theoretically and empirically in many species of organisms. Most studies have focused on individuals competing for mates, territories or rank within a social hierarchy. In nonhuman primates, dyadic aggression has been studied in the context of feeding trees, whereas coalitions have been studied primarily in the context of mate or rank acquisition. Although coalitions can represent a substantial fraction of agonistic interactions at feeding trees, most studies have not taken into account the effect of present ecological conditions on the occurrence of coalition formation. We examined whether there is an ecological basis to escalated aggression, defined as overt dyadic aggression and polyadic coalition formation, in wild white-faced capuchin monkeys, Cebus capucinus. Our results indicate that ecological characteristics of the feeding trees, the availability of potential allies and rank differences between interactants are important in predicting escalated aggression in this species. This is the first field study to link ecology to escalations in the form of dyadic and polyadic aggression in nonhuman primates. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examined how decision-making processes at small spatial scales can account for individual movements and food intake at larger scales. Our experiment used two currencies that might affect animal decisions: food reward at the patch scale and spatial distribution of the patches. We used Soay sheep, Ovis aries, as the model species in conjunction with an artificial arena that allowed us to modify food-handling conditions and the distribution of the food patches to record variation in food intake of both sexes. The main variable that affected food intake was how efficient the animals were at avoiding patches that were depleted in previous visits. Intake was also affected by mouth size and the spatial distribution of the feeding stations. Sheep were more efficient at exploiting clustered patches with a high energy reward than a matrix of homogeneously distributed patches of lower energy reward. Females' intake was higher than males'; we discuss this in relation to different foraging strategies related to sexual differences in fibre digestibility and the distribution of food resources of different quality that both sexes might use in field conditions. The results indicated that variation in food-handling conditions at the patch level affects food intake at larger scales, providing support for the hypothesis that animal movement related to grazing activity is a hierarchical process, scaling up from bite size to large spatial scales. However, spatial memory is important for maximizing the use of patchily distributed food. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In sexual selection, multimodal signals elicit mate choice when more than one sensory modality is activated. However, determining the relative use of each signal is difficult because it requires a comprehensive understanding of the mating system and how this system works under natural conditions. We examined the role of structural ultraviolet (UV) reflectance and pheromones in the butterfly Colias eurytheme. Both traits are important in mediating interspecific interactions and pheromones have been implicated in intra-specific mate choice. UV reflectance, which arises from the presence of a multilayer thin-film interference array, has potential as an honest indicator of male condition, viability and/or age. We investigated the relevance of these signal traits to courtship success by releasing virgin females in the path of free-flying males until each female had rejected and accepted at least one male. This design facilitated a within-subjects (females) analysis of mate choice, thus controlling for potentially confounding variation in intrinsic female receptivity. Principal component analysis indicated that variation across males in UV brightness and pheromones was essentially orthogonal. Females preferred younger males (as subjectively adjudged by wing wear), and while age covaried with UV brightness and almost all pheromone descriptors, UV brightness emerged as the best and most general predictor of male mating success. Our results suggest that this trait serves as an important intraspecific sexual signal in C. eurytheme, and they provide the clearest evidence to date regarding the functional relevance of structural coloration to female mate choice in butterflies. We discuss the preferential use of one secondary sexual characteristic (UV reflectance) over another (pheromones) with regard to evolutionary strategies.

AB We used the experimental paradigm of artificial mixed colonies of two phylogenetically related bumblebee species to analyse the dynamics of the reproductive skew in societies of Bombus terrestris. Artificial mixed-species colonies were set up by introducing callow B. terrestris workers either into a queenright (QR) or a queenless (QL) colony of B. lapidarius. The introduced B. terrestris workers were well integrated into their host B. lapidarius colony and displayed nesting activities that did not differ from those of the resident B. lapidarius workers. However, the introduced B. terrestris workers did show a different reproductive behaviour. While B. lapidarius workers did not develop ovaries in a B. lapidarius QR colony but did so in a B. lapidarius QL group, adopted B. terrestris workers in a B. lapidarius QR colony developed ovaries as if they were under QL conditions. These results indicate that, in mixed-species colonies, B. terrestris workers are irresponsive to the queen's inhibitive action on ovary development. In QL homospecific and heterospecific predominately B. terrestris mixed-worker colonies (1Bl + SBt), reproduction was dominated by a single B. terrestris worker, whereas in QR B. lapidarius or QL equally mixed-worker colonies (3Bl + 3Bt), almost all B. terrestris workers developed ovaries. We suggest that in the presence of enough heterospecific workers, B. terrestris workers behave as parasites. This last finding suggests that worker reproduction in B. terrestris is highly plastic and that the experimental paradigm of artificial mixed colonies may provide new insights into the evolution of social parasitism in this taxon.

AB We documented immediate, behavioural responses of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) to experimental vessel approaches in regions of high and low vessel traffic in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Experimental vessel approaches elicited significant changes in the behaviour of targeted dolphins when compared with their behaviour before and after approaches. During approaches, focal dolphin groups became more compact, had higher rates of change in membership and had more erratic speeds and directions of travel. Dolphins in the region of low vessel traffic (control site) had stronger and longer-lasting responses than did dolphins in the region of high vessel traffic (impact site). In the absence of additional information, the moderated behavioural responses of impact-site dolphins probably would be interpreted to mean that long-term vessel activity within a region of tourism had no detrimental effect on resident dolphins. However, another study showed that dolphin-watching tourism in Shark Bay has contributed to a long-term decline in dolphin abundance within the impact site (Bejder et al., in press, Conservation Biology). Those findings suggest that we documented moderated responses not because impact-site dolphins had become habituated to vessels but because those individuals that were sensitive to vessel disturbance left the region before our study began. This reinterpretation of our findings led us to question the traditional premise that short-term behavioural responses are sufficient indicators of impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on wildlife.

AB Communal rearing enhances the quality of offspring weaned by some social vertebrates. Previously, we observed that prairie vole pups reared in groups containing two or more breeding females (plurally breeding groups) gained significantly more body mass than did pups reared by solitary mothers, but not more than pups reared in groups containing only one breeding female (singularly breeding groups). In this study, we tested three hypotheses that might explain these differences. We tested the enhanced thermoregulation hypothesis by determining the nest temperatures experienced by pups and the time that pups were left unattended during 6-h observations, and the core body temperature of pups. To test the enhanced tactile stimulation hypothesis, we determined the time that pups were licked or groomed by adults during 20-min observations. To test the milk quality hypothesis, we determined the total solids found in milk collected from mothers with 3- and 9-day-old pups. To test the increased milk volume hypothesis, we determined an index of milk intake for 4-, 8- and 13-day-old pups. Pups reared in plurally breeding groups were left alone less by caregivers and ingested more, but not higher-quality, milk than did pups reared by solitary mothers. Pups reared in singularly breeding groups experienced greater tactile stimulation and were left unattended less, but did not ingest more or higher-quality milk than did pups reared by solitary mothers. Pups reared in plurally breeding groups experienced slightly less tactile stimulation and similar thermal conditions, but ingested more milk than did pups reared in singularly breeding groups. Our results suggest that plural breeding enhances two forms of parental investment, thermoregulation and milk volume, that contribute to the enhanced weight gain of pups in plurally breeding groups.

AB While, historically, studies of classical conditioning have been concerned mainly with the rules and mechanisms of stimulus association, more recent work is providing evidence of its adaptive value to the animal. Much of this has focused on reproductive advantages, such as learning to predict the availability of a potential mate or competitor. We looked at classically conditioned stimulus association in the novel context of sperm competition. Using field crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, we looked at the ability of adult males to associate topographical features of the environment (configurations of toy bricks) or olfactory cues (artificial odours) with the presence or absence of an apparent competitor (another male on the other side of a clear partition). Males were able to learn associations between apparent competition and one of two spatial configurations or odours, in that they transferred larger spermatophores to a female in the conditions associated with another male, both during training (when another male was present) and during testing (when it was not). Males thus appeared to modulate sperm transfer in relation to learned environmental predictors of sperm competition. However, while males began stridulating sooner after the introduction of a female, stridulated more often and were quicker to transfer a spermatophore in some conditions associated with the presence of another male, these differences were apparent only during training, and not during testing.

AB A large number of sexual selection studies have focused on examining the morphological and behavioural factors involved in male combat and female choice, such as whether large males achieve higher reproductive success compared with smaller males. However, until recently, the mechanistic reasons why such cues are linked to male dominance or female choice have been elusive. An emerging body of work shows that physiological and whole-organism performance capacities are important in individual reproductive success. Males with high performance or other physiological capacities (e.g. endurance, biting) often enjoy an advantage over males with poorer performance capacities during male-male contests. In contrast, few studies have examined links between performance and female choice. Here, we highlight recent key literature integrating sexual selection, performance and physiology. We also point to areas where a more rigorous investigation of underlying physiological processes may yield insights into sexual selection. In particular, we note that current progress in several important areas may be hampered by an inadequate physiological understanding of condition. We suggest a conceptual approach that may shed light on the physiological factors underlying condition, and we point out several other potentially important avenues for future research.

AB Conspicuous male traits, such as calling to attract females, evolve through the joint action of sexual and natural selection. When the costs of natural selection increase relative to the benefits of sexual selection, males should become less conspicuous. Male calling song in field crickets attracts both phonotactic females for mating and acoustically orienting parasitic flies that deposit larvae on calling males, killing their infected hosts. Flies are present mainly during the autumn, which means that crickets that become adults at this time have a different selective regime from those that emerge in the spring. On this basis we hypothesized that seasonal changes in parasitism would favour seasonal changes in male calling behaviour. We evaluated this hypothesis by recording the calls of individual males and by conducting nightly surveys of male calling in the field. Because seasonal changes in sexual selection may favour seasonal changes in male calling behaviour, we used pitfall traps to determine whether the number of females attracted to male calls changed seasonally. As predicted, fewer males called during the autumn than during the spring, and autumn males were less likely to call at dusk, when flies were most active. Contrary to prediction, however, males that called spent more time calling per night in the autumn than in the spring. Pitfall trap data revealed that more calling per night resulted in more female arrivals in the autumn but not in the spring. This result suggests that males that call for long periods attract more females in autumn but not in spring. This means that seasonal variation in both natural and sexual selection has resulted in seasonal differences in male calling behaviour.

AB Empirical studies on song 'complexity' have mainly focused on the effect of repertoire size. Whether differences in song complexity that are not correlated with longer signals or larger repertoires might also be meaningful for either same-sex competitors or potential mates has rarely been addressed. Male chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs, have small repertoires, with typically two or three different song types, but the number of different trill phrases within songs varies considerably. To test whether this variation is meaningful to receivers, we compared the responses of both male and female receivers to songs of equal duration but varying in the number of trill phrases. Males were tested in the field with playback experiments and females with an operant preference test in the laboratory, with song as a reinforcer. Both males and females gave stronger responses to songs with more phrases in the trill. In the literature, females are normally seen as driving songs towards more complexity. However, our results suggest that both intra- and intersexual selection can contribute to the evolution of more complex songs, but also that the salience of different song types within a male's repertoire varies.

TI Testing central place foraging in eastern chipmunks, <i>Tamias
   striatus</i>, by altering loading functions
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Eastern chipmunks are thought to be rate-maximizing central place (CP) foragers because several experimental tests have provided qualitative support for the prediction that their load sizes increase with distance between patch and burrow. Confidence in this conclusion is tainted by the fact that chipmunks always collect loads that are considerably smaller than those expected of rate-maximizing CP foragers and that most tests of the hypothesis have involved effects of distance and travel times on load sizes. We experimentally manipulated the loading functions of 12 chipmunks by providing them with either natural sunflower seeds (Helianthus sp.) or sunflower seeds onto which we fastened an appendage that had to be removed before loading. Adding the appendage to the seeds altered the loading function by adding decreasing amounts of handling time as each successive seed was loaded. Both load sizes and patch times were larger for seeds with an appendage, and the effect on load size was greater at 5 in than at 20 in from the burrow, as predicted for rate-maximizing foragers. These results provide novel qualitative support that chipmunks behave as rate-maximizing CP foragers. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB If fearfulness is stable, consistent and trait-like, then valid measures of fearfulness should be stable, consistent and independent of influences unrelated to fear. We assessed the validity of six fear measures using Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica, a common species in fear research. Measures were made during emergence, novel object, novel food and predator surprise tests. These were considered to have internal validity if they were stable over 18 days, when we controlled for nonexperimental variables including season of testing and cage location. We determined convergent and discriminant validity by factor analysis of fear measures plus measures of sociality, activity level and repetitive behaviour. Fear measures with good convergent validity showed agreement in their factor loadings. Those with good discriminant validity loaded on to different factors from nonfear measures. Most of the fear measures examined were moderately stable over time, but only half had good discriminant validity. Convergence was good among measures from the same test but poor across tests. Measures from each fear test loaded separately. Overall, flight distance and freezing duration in the predator surprise test and amount eaten in the novel food test showed the best internal, convergent and discriminant validity. When we considered only these three measures, convergence remained higher among measures from the same test than from different tests. Fearfulness thus appeared somewhat unstable over time and inconsistent across situations, which, if true across species, greatly limits the utility of fear tests.

AB There are costs and benefits to individuals of having high levels of circulating testosterone, and the costs can be particularly apparent outside the breeding season. Unlike many birds, red grouse have high testosterone levels in autumn and in this study we explored the consequences of variation in autumn testosterone levels, in terms of survival and breeding success. We caught 123 male grouse in September, from six sites in Scotland and England, U.K. Grouse were given either testosterone or control implants, then fitted with radiotransmitters and released. Control males tended to survive better, but the difference was not statistically significant. During the first 3 months, cause of mortality varied with treatment, with birds of prey killing only testosterone-implanted birds. In spring, females paired with testosterone-implanted males had larger combs (sexual ornaments) than those with controls, suggesting that they might have been better-quality individuals. Testosterone-implanted birds were more likely to be paired and to be bigamous, and each bird alive in spring produced on average 2.5 more offspring than control birds. The benefits of investing in elevated levels of testosterone are clearly high for those males that survive the winter. However, these benefits are reduced by overwinter mortality and the reproductive success of all males alive at the start of the experiment did not vary statistically with treatment. We discuss the longer-term consequences of high testosterone levels which are likely to be very different to short-term ones.

AB Developmental changes in locomotory ability may affect many aspects of organismal behaviour and ecological success. While juvenile vertebrates have lower power output and endurance than older animals, the effects of ontogeny on locomotory performance in invertebrates are unknown. Among insects, grasshoppers serve as an ideal model to study ontogeny of locomotory behaviour. Ecological and behavioural studies show that adult and juvenile grasshoppers have different predators and dispersal behaviours, suggesting different locomotory abilities. In addition, older American locust grasshoppers, Schistocerca americana, have improved oxygen delivery, which may enhance endurance. In this study, we forced American locust grasshoppers of different ages to jump repeatedly to exhaustion and quantified jump frequencies and distances. We found that, in contrast to vertebrates, grasshoppers appear to develop from low-power, high-endurance juveniles to high-power, low-endurance adults. These developmental changes in physiology match the ontogeny of life-history behaviours. Adult grasshopper jumping legs produce the high power output required to initiate flight for escape from vertebrate predators and migration, whereas high-endurance juvenile grasshoppers repeatedly jump to escape invertebrate predators and may also be forced to disperse long distances to find food.

AB Gibbons (family Hylobatidae) have rarely been studied in terms of object manipulation and tool use. We assessed whether hoolock gibbons can learn to pull on a rake-like object to gain a food reward, in a zero-order manipulation task, without specific training. Their learning style was assessed along with their understanding of the tertiary relationships between the rake, a goal object and an environmental feature. Hoolocks used a rake to pull in an out-of-reach food item in less than 90 s on first presentation. The gibbons' behaviour suggests that perceptually restructuring the environment may be within this species' abilities. Their causal understanding of three factors, the rake, the reward and a trap into which the reward could fall and be lost, was moderately better than that of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and capuchins, Cebus spp., on a similar task. Learning of simple associative rules, rather than understanding the physical properties of the trap, might explain the gibbons' performance.

ID PRIMITIVELY EUSOCIAL WASP; HYMENOPTERA; VESPIDAE; EVOLUTION
AB A striking feature of hymenopteran societies is the general absence of male workers. There are some reports of males feeding larvae in some social wasps, but not in the extensively studied Ropalidia marginata. By providing excess food and by removing the females, we investigated whether males are incapable of feeding larvae or lack opportunities to do so. Males fed larvae with probabilities and rates comparable to those of females, suggesting that lack of preadaptation to feed larvae does not explain the absence of male workers in social Hymenoptera. Although males were not as efficient as females at feeding larvae, they seemed capable of doing enough for natural selection to have promoted the evolution of male workers if there were not other factors preventing it. Genetic relatedness asymmetry may be one such factor. A third hypothesis for the absence of male workers in social Hymenoptera, concerning the increased susceptibility of haploid males to infection, is not relevant because males handle and masticate prey for their own consumption and otherwise interact with the larvae.

AB Male green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri, express a secondary sexual trait, the sword, which is favoured by female mate choice. However, the role of the sword as a signal in male-male competition has received little attention. We studied the effect of both male body size and sword length on the outcome of male-male competition. Although body size and natural sword length were positively correlated, only body size had a significant effect on competitive success. To examine the independent effect of sword length on competitive success, males were matched for body size and natural swords were replaced with plastic caudal attachments simulating swords. The attachments were of equal size but were painted to approximate swords of different lengths. When matched for body size, males with longer apparent swords won significantly more contests than males with shorter apparent swords. These data suggest that, controlling for body size, longer-sworded males experience greater competitive success. Thus, in green swordtails, it appears that both male-male competition and female choice may have played a role in the evolution of longer swords.

AB In songbirds, the individual features of a male's song play a role in female choice and male-male interactions. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the song characteristics of an individual should be correlated with its quality and this has been shown for some species. The species studied so far have only small or medium-sized song repertoires, leaving open the question of whether, in species with large repertoires, song characteristics such as repertoire size are related to male quality. We investigated the correlations between body measures, song characteristics and arrival dates of common nightingales, a songbird species in which males have extraordinarily large song type repertoires. We found that birds with large repertoires had longer wings and were heavier, and arrived earlier, than those with small repertoires. Other song characteristics, such as song diversity and proportion of whistle songs, were not significantly correlated with body measures. When we correlated body measures with arrival date, we found that birds that arrived earlier were heavier and tended to be in better condition. These findings provide supporting evidence that repertoire size is an indicator of a male's quality. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Prey selection by dragonflies in relation to prey size and wasp-like

DT Article
ID PREDATOR; POWER; EVOLUTION; MANTIDS
AB Although most of the studies on the evolution of mimicry and warning signals in insects have considered birds as the main predators, predation by other taxonomic groups, such as insects, may far exceed avian predation at some localities. However, few studies have investigated the possibility that insect predators might facilitate selection for warning colours and mimicry in other insects. We experimentally evaluated whether prey size and/or wasp-like colours and patterns were important in deterring attacks by dragonflies, using pairwise and single presentations of both natural and artificial prey in the field. Dragonflies were more likely to attack smaller natural prey and smaller artificial prey. However, dragonflies showed no differences between attacks on prey with wasp-like colours and patterns and those on the same-sized prey that were nonmimetic. Moreover, dragonflies avoided attacking both mock-painted and black-painted wasps entirely. Overall, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that wasp-like warning signals protect small insect prey from attack by dragonflies, although size seems to be an important cue in dragonfly prey choice.

AB We studied the use of song types and their acoustic features in different social contexts in the banded wren, Thryothorus pleurostictus, a resident tropical songbird in which males possess about 20 distinctive song types varying in duration, bandwidth, note composition and trill structure. We recorded six focal males intensively for 4 days each while we observed context information such as during versus after dawn chorus, presence of the female, countersinging versus solo singing, location at the edge versus centre of the territory, and proximity to the nest. All males used at least some song types differentially during each of these pairs of alternative contexts. Males also preferentially used the song types they shared with a given neighbour when interacting with that bird. Songs delivered during dawn chorus were significantly longer, wider in bandwidth, often compound (double songs), and more likely to contain a rattle or buzz and an up-sweeping trill, compared to songs delivered after dawn chorus. Similar features were also more commonly observed when birds were engaged in intense male-male interactions and boundary disputes after dawn chorus, especially when countersinging at the edge of the territory. In the presence of the female mate, males preferentially delivered a few particular song types that had narrower whole-song and trill bandwidths and lacked rattles and buzzes. Moreover, song-type diversity and fraction of compound songs were higher when the female was present than when she was absent. Thus, in addition to using type matching and variations in song-type switching and diversity to signal different levels of aggressive intention, male banded wrens also select song types based on their acoustic structure in different social contexts.

AB The adaptive significance of play is one of ethology's greatest enigmas, yet few of the many hypotheses advanced to explain play have ever been tested. I evaluated an aspect of the social-bonding hypothesis, which proposes that social play strengthens long-term bonds between individuals, enhancing future alliances. Using data from a wild population, I tested five predictions arising from the hypothesis that meerkats, Suricata suricatta, use play to strengthen ties with potential dispersal partners. Meerkats did not favour play with the most appropriate potential partners, that is, they did not prefer their own sex (although they disperse with animals of the same sex only) nor did they strive to play with younger animals (that they could dominate in a future group) or avoid playing with older animals (that they could not). Frequency of play was unrelated to the size of subsequent dispersal parties, or the likelihood of males undertaking prospecting forays with companions, and preferred playmates were not favoured as prospecting partners. Although meerkats preferred to disperse with littermates (and littermates were strongly favoured in play), they played no more frequently with their future dispersal partners than with matched controls with which they did not disperse. I conclude that the strengthening of long-term bonds between potential dispersal partners is not the function of social play in meerkats. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Despite more than three decades of research, the adaptive significance of play behaviour remains unknown. The practice hypothesis asserts that the primary function of play is to provide animals with the opportunity to practise and refine motor skills needed in adulthood. The apparent similarity between play fighting and serious fighting has led to the assertion that play is 'optimally designed' for the enhancement of combat skills. However, the practice hypothesis of play fighting has never been tested. I used data from a wild population of meerkats, Suricata suricatta (a cooperatively breeding mongoose that shows marked reproductive skew), to examine whether play experience improved an individual's subsequent fighting ability. First, meerkats showed no sex difference in frequency of play fighting (consistent with the optimal design argument, since both males and females fight to obtain the dominant breeding position in a group). Second, frequency of play fighting was not positively correlated with the subsequent likelihood of winning play fights, or the degree of improvement in play-fighting success, as would be expected if play improved fighting manoeuvres (and such manoeuvres must be the same in both play fighting and serious fighting if motor skills are to be effectively practised). Finally, individuals that ultimately won fights for a vacant dominancy did not play fight any more frequently as youngsters, or show any greater success in winning play fights, than matched same-sexed littermates that they defeated in combat.

AB We determined whether there is an association between nutritional state (as indicated by stored abdominal lipid amounts) and division of labour in the honeybee, Apis mellifera. We found that foragers (typically older bees) had lower lipid amounts than did nurses (typically young bees). Results from experimental colonies that contained nurses and foragers of the same age showed that the lipid decline in foragers was not attributable to age. Analysis of bees with different amounts of foraging experience revealed little effect of the act of foraging on lipid stores. Lipid levels were low even on the first day of foraging, suggesting that the decline in stored lipid precedes the onset of foraging. We also found that bees that revert from foraging to nursing did not regain their lipid stores, indicating that high lipid stores are not required to sustain brood care behaviour. This demonstration of a robust association between reduced lipid stores and the transition to foraging suggests that worker nutritional state may be involved in the regulation of division of labour in honeybee colonies.

AB The 'pay-to-stay hypothesis' proposes that subordinate group members help dominants in order to be tolerated in the territory. Accordingly, helpers should be punished if they, are not helping sufficiently and should increase helping behaviour thereafter. We tested whether helping and social behaviours of group members of the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher change according to these predictions. A focal helper was experimentally prevented from helping to defend the territory against a conspecific intruder by depriving it of the information that an intruder was present. At the same time the other group members witnessed both the intruder and the 'passive' focal helper. When a helper was prevented from providing help, the other group members compensated by increasing defence of the territory, which suggests that the contribution of the passive helper was beneficial. As predicted by the pay-to-stay hypothesis, helpers increased helping behaviour after being prevented from helping. However, we found no indications that dominants punished the focal helper for not having helped before. Punishment may not be measurable, though, because of an appeasement function of helping behaviour. In accordance with this hypothesis, agonistic interactions between focal helpers and dominants were reduced when helpers helped. Apparently, helpers prevent punishment by increasing helping and submissive behaviours. Our data support the pay-to-stay hypothesis and suggest a new mechanism for the regulation of cooperative investment by subordinates: pre-emptive appeasement of dominants through helping and submissive behaviour.

AB Previous research has shown that female brook stickleback are attracted to the scent from conspecific males. In this paper, I show that a female's response to the male-based cue changes depending upon the stage she has reached in her ovulatory cycle. On the day of ovulation, when the female was ready to spawn, she was strongly attracted to the scent of conspecific males, and even per-formed the species-specific courtship/receptive display (head-up, sink to the bottom and remain stationary) in response to the cue. Within 24 h of spawning, the female had begun to decrease her courtship response and move away from the cue, and by 48 h she had stopped courting completely and was spending most of her time on the control (water-drip) side of the tank. Upon ovulating a second time, she was again attracted to the scent and began courtship behaviour. This represents the first experimental demonstration of a female teleost showing a change in responsiveness to male-based odours across her ovulatory cycle similar to that displayed by female mammals.

AB A small but taxonomically diverse number of vertebrates have a left-eye preference for aggression, but this has been shown only in males. Here we present data consistent with a left-eye preference for aggressive rejection display in females of the striped plateau lizard, Sceloporus virgatus. Already-mated females perform this display, which contains key elements of male-male aggressive displays, to courting males. Lateral eye placement reduces binocular vision of such displays. In a field study, we recorded the responses of individual gravid females to one of three possible stimulus presentations: a tethered conspecific male presented so the female viewed him (1) from a head-on (HO) position, (2) with her left visual field (LVF) or (3) with her right visual field (RVF). Although a small proportion of all trials yielded no response, females were significantly less likely to show any response in RVF presentations compared with HO or LVF presentations. In a large majority of trials, females responded to males, and almost all responding females displayed aggressively. When females displayed after RVF presentations, a female was equally likely to use her LVF or RVF to view the male when she first performed an aggressive rejection display. In contrast, in LVF and HO presentations where females displayed, females were significantly more likely than expected by chance to use their LVF to view the males when they displayed. Charge, a very aggressive act, also was significantly more likely to occur when females were viewing males with their LVF than their RVF or HO. Finally, in a small number of unmanipulated natural encounters we observed, all females used their LVF to display to courting males. Our results suggest that, as in males of several vertebrate species, females show a left-eye bias for conspecific aggression. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Formation of artificial groups of domestic species occurs frequently in today's husbandry systems. These groups are kept in a closed space where the individuals are not able to withdraw from the group, and resources in the environment are most commonly limited and defensible. This creates a competitive environment where aggression and social stress are often seen. We developed a theoretical model that describes how aggression among unacquainted pigs is a function of group size. As the number of potential competitors increases, more individuals will benefit from not getting involved in costly fights. The reason for this is that the probability of being able to monopolize resources diminishes as group size increases. To verify predictions from this model, we compared aggression among unacquainted, weaned pigs in three group sizes (6, 12 and 24 pigs). There were significantly more fights per individual in groups of six and 12 pigs than in groups of 24 pigs, and the proportion of pigs not participating in fights was significantly higher in the largest group. For pigs that were willing to take the risk of getting involved in fights in the largest group size, the duration of each fight was longer than for fights in the smaller groups. These results support the predictions from our theoretical model, and we conclude that pigs are able to alter their behaviour according to how the actual competitive situation changes with group size.

TI Division of labour in parental care behaviour of a sex-role-reversed
   shorebird, the wattled jacana
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID POLYANDRY; INCUBATION
AB Jacanas represent the extreme in avian sex-role reversal. We studied the division of labour between the two sexes in parental care of the eggs and chicks in wattled jacanas, jacana jacana, in the Republic of Panama. Males were the sole incubators of the eggs (515 clutches). Males were also the sole caretakers of chicks for 97% of broods (N = 252). Caretaking activities included continuous close association with the young, leading them to foraging locations, brooding them during cold temperatures and rain, and maintaining nearly constant vigilance against threats of predation. Although females were also observed to perform all of these direct chick care behaviours, they did so very rarely (3% of broods) and only when the male was unavailable to provide such care himself. This happened either when females laid new clutches for males that were still tending dependent chicks, or when predators killed males, leaving broods defenceless and untended. The only regular contribution to chick care by females was providing defence against predators. The male was usually the first parent to detect a predator, but he recruited the female to join him in confronting threats that he could not deter alone. We conclude that, although males perform the overwhelming majority of parental care in wattled jacanas, females provide critical backup support. By displaying parental behaviours facultatively, only when the male is unable to provide them adequately himself, female wattled jacanas are able to enhance the survival of their eggs and young while typically expending only minutes per day in such efforts.

   FEMALES; MODEL; WASP
AB Many communal breeders are characterized by a conflict over who gets to reproduce, with dominant individuals often claiming the largest share of reproduction in the group. How do dominants control breeding in these species? Although infanticide has often been invoked as a means of control, previous theoretical work on indiscriminate killing of young did not support this idea. There is, however, increasing evidence from field studies in both vertebrates and insects that infanticidal individuals can discriminate between their own offspring and those of other group members, and thus avoid the risk of accidentally killing their own progeny. In a simple game-theoretical model we demonstrate that the capacity for discriminate infanticide can promote high reproductive skew even though few or no offspring are actually killed. When discrimination is good and offspring are cheap to produce, the threat of infanticide prevents the subordinate cobreeder from adding many young to the joint brood, and no killing need occur. High levels of infanticide tend to occur only when discrimination is poor, costs of offspring production are low and/or relatedness is low. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male ornamentation in socially monogamous birds has been shown to provide information to potential mates on aspects of condition and behaviour. We studied female ornamentation in the socially monogamous, biparental northern cardinal to determine whether expressions of multiple ornaments correlate with aspects of female condition and behaviour. Expressions of the ornamental red-orange bill, red underwing feathers, head crest and blackish face mask were compared to several measures of condition, parental behaviour and intrasexual aggression. Red-orange bill colour of females was correlated with both body size and an index of body condition. Redness of the underwing feathers was correlated with body size, body condition, date of first nest produced and reproductive success. Face mask expression was correlated with both nestling feeding rate and level of intrasexual aggression. The length of head crest feathers did not correlate with any measured aspect of condition or behaviour. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ornaments in female cardinals provide redundant information to prospective mates on aspects of female condition and behaviour.

ID PODARCIS-MURALIS; PREY; RESPONSES; INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR; REPTILES;

AB The threat sensitivity hypothesis assumes that multiple cues from a predator should contribute in an additive way to determine the degree of risk-sensitive behaviour. The ability to use multiple cues in assessing the current level of predation risk should be especially important to prey exposed to multiple predators. Wall lizards, Podarcis muralis, respond to predatory attacks from birds or mammals by hiding inside rock crevices, where they may encounter another predator, the smooth snake, Coronella austriaca. We investigated in the laboratory whether chemical cues may be important to wall lizards for detection of snakes. The greater tongue-flick rate and shorter latency to first tongue-flick in response to predator scents indicated that lizards were able to detect the snakes' chemical cues. We also investigated the use of different predatory cues by lizards when detecting the presence of snakes within refuges. We simulated successive predator attacks and compared the propensity of lizards to enter the refuge and time spent within it for predator-free refuges, refuges containing either only visual or chemical cues of a snake, or a combination of these. The antipredatory response of lizards was greater when they were exposed to both visual and chemical cues than when only one cue was presented, supporting the threat sensitivity hypothesis. This ability may improve the accuracy of assessments of the current level of predation risk inside the refuge. It could be especially important in allowing lizards to cope with threats posed by two types of predators requiring conflicting prey defences.

AB The links between weather and animal behaviour in population processes have received relatively little attention. I studied the effect of weather,conditions on foraging and breeding performance of a medium-sized raptor, the black kite, Milvus migrans. The frequency of prey capture attempts and their likelihood of success increased with temperature and declined with rainfall. Kites used flight styles involving a higher energy expenditure in less favourable weather. Nestling provisioning rates declined during rain spells. More kites hunted during periods of favourable weather and after periods with a high frequency of successful prey capture attempts by conspecifics; this result suggested that individuals may fine-tune their foraging effort to the expected foraging reward. Such compensatory behavioural adjustments may increase species resilience to climate change. The behaviourally mediated effects of weather on prey availability translated into population effects. Yearly weather conditions during the last stage of the prelaying period affected population-level productivity, probably through an effect on female body condition mediated by male provisioning capability and hunting yield. The predicted effects of climate change on kites may already be occurring, with progressively earlier laying and northward range expansion. These results confirm the need to pay greater attention to behaviourally mediated effects of climate on populations, particularly when individuals make compensatory adjustments that may enhance resilience to climate change.

AB Although group living can confer benefits to individuals in terms of reduced predation risk and enhanced foraging success, it may also be associated with costs, such as increased competition for food. The nutritional state of an individual could therefore affect its readiness to join or remain in groups. We investigated the shoaling behaviour of banded killifish by following marked individuals, whose nutritional state had been experimentally manipulated, and recording their shoaling behaviour in a field enclosure containing unmarked conspecifics. Overall, food-deprived fish spent more time alone, and therefore less time shoaling, than well-fed individuals. When shoaling, however, food-deprived fish were not found in smaller shoals than well-fed conspecifics. Furthermore, they did not show a greater latency to shoal initially. Having joined a shoal, however, food-deprived fish left shoals more frequently to be alone than fed fish. Rates of change in the membership size of shoals occupied by either well-fed or food-deprived fish did not differ. We conclude that nutritional state seems to affect an individual's decision to continue shoaling once an association has been made. This study is the first to investigate experimentally state-dependent changes in the size of social groups in fish under field conditions.

AB Xiphophorus cortezi males are polymorphic for the pigment pattern vertical bars. In this study, we determined whether X. cortezi females are polymorphic in their preference for this trait by examining both within- and between-individual variation in female preference. There was significantly more variation in female preference within than between individuals using both video animations and live males as stimuli; repeatability measures were 0.86 and 0.5, respectively. Some females had a strong preference for males with bars, some for males without bars, and some had either a weak preference or no preference at all. We also found a significant difference in the strength of preference for bars between females with and without bars, suggesting the potential fora genetic correlation between preference and trait. Finally, we examined female preference for bar symmetry in the same females tested for preference for bars. We detected a significant preference for bar symmetry in the population of females as a whole, and a positive relationship between the strength of this preference and a preference for the presence/ absence of bars among the subset of females that preferred 'no bars'. We discuss these results in light the possibility that these two preferences are interrelated. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB We investigated the effect of a novel trait, a red feather on the forehead, on sexual imprinting in the dimorphic zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. Parents reared young in one of four imprinting groups: (1) both parents adorned with the red feather; (2) the father only adorned; (3) the mother only adorned; (4) both parents unadorned. After the young matured, we tested their preference for adorned and unadorned conspecifics of the opposite sex in simultaneous double-choice tests. Females but not males sexually imprinted on the red feather when their parents or father were adorned. In further tests, females that had sexually imprinted on the red feather did not generalize from the learned preference for a red feather to a preference for an orange or blue feather. Neither males nor females reared by unadorned parents showed a latent preference for potential mates adorned with a red, orange, or blue feather. Our results show that in the dimorphic zebra finch, only females sexually imprint on a novel trait. Sexual imprinting can support the evolution of novel male traits and would enhance the dimorphism in this species. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The occurrence of heritable variation for polyandry in the usually monandrous moth Lobesia botrana Den. and Schiff. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) was studied in the laboratory, using isofernale lines, a selection experiment and F-1 and F-2 crosses between the selected line (S) and an unselected control line (C). We assessed polyandry by observing the frequency of recalling in once mated females (i.e. the frequency of females resuming calling after mating). Polyandry differed significantly between isofernale lines, ranging from 0 to 100% in a normal distribution. Heritability of polyandry +/-SE, estimated as a threshold trait using a full-sib design, was h(2)=0.40 +/- 0.12. Artificial selection for polyandry resulted in a significant increase from 32 to 65% in which a plateau occurred. Realized heritability in the first and second generations of selection yielded estimates of h(2)=0.41 and h(2)=0.53, respectively. We also found a concomitant, significant increase in matings per female. In the sixth generation (S line), when only females that had mated more than twice were used as parents, polyandry rose again from 65 to 80%. Results from F, crosses supported the hypothesis that polyandry was recessive and autosomally inherited. Cavalli's joint scaling test confirmed these results, yielding values +/-SE of d=0.18 +/- 0.03 and h = - 0.16 +/- 0.05. Observed and expected frequencies of polyandry in F-2 fitted significantly under the hypothesis of a two-loci model. The underlying implications of heritable variation in polyandry in a usually monandrous species are outlined, from an evolutionary perspective, in the context of the adaptive significance of this aspect of insect mating systems.

AB We investigated information transfer during vocal interactions between cricket frogs, Acris crepitans, with a specific focus on information about size and intention. In response to opponents, cricket frogs alter both temporal and spectral (frequency) aspects of their calls. Previous work suggests that males use dominant frequency, which is correlated with size, to provide information about fighting ability, and use temporal call characters, which are independent of size, to provide information about aggressive intent. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the relationship between call characters and contest behaviour. We presented a focal male with a simulated opponent, and categorized his behavioural response as attack, abandon or tolerate. We found that information about opponent size does not appear to influence a male's decision to fight, flee or tolerate an intruder. Whether or not males use the size information that is encoded in call frequency remains unclear. In contrast, changes in call frequency, which are not correlated with size, predicted the outcome of simulated contests, suggesting that male cricket frogs signal information about agonistic intent. Temporal call characters indicated whether or not a resident tolerated an opponent, but they did not predict contest outcome (attack versus abandon). Furthermore, the difference between the temporal call characters of a focal male and the simulated opponent predicted whether the resident tolerated the opponent. We suggest, therefore, that temporal call changes may be a cooperative signal designed to facilitate assessment of size through physical contact in wrestling bouts.

AB The set of mating behaviours expressed by an individual may depend upon the state of that individual and local environmental conditions. Understanding how these factors affect mating behaviours may elucidate how a mating system operates, and its consequences for the form and strength of sexual selection. We conducted two experiments on the water strider Gerris buenoi to (1) determine the effect of hunger on the mating behaviour of both sexes and (2) examine female choice for large males. In our first experiment, we manipulated hunger (20 h starvation) in both sexes and recorded mating, male harassment, copulation duration and guarding duration. We predicted that hunger would increase female reluctance to mate because mating conflicts with foraging. Female hunger (20 h starvation) decreased mating rate by two-thirds but had no significant effect on male mating behaviour. In a second experiment, we examined the effect of female hunger, and resulting reluctance, on sexual selection for large male size. Hungry females (5 h starvation) were placed with two fed males (one large, one small) and we recorded male premating and mating behaviours. We observed significant large-male mating advantage when females were hungry, but not when satiated. Mating efforts (harassment, premating struggles) were similar for both male phenotypes in both female hunger treatments, suggesting that the mating advantage of large males resulted from increased reluctance of hungry females to mate. Neither male body size nor female hunger explained a significant amount of variation in copulation duration or guarding duration. We discuss our results in light of two competing hypotheses for female choice (active and passive) on male body size and suggest that passive choice for large males acts in this system.

AB Cultural lineages are based on learned social traditions that are stable for several generations. When cultural lineages also reflect common ancestry and/or are shared by individuals that live together they are called clans. The existence of clans among killer whales has been previously proposed but has not been confirmed. Here, we show that clans exist among resident type killer whales, Orcinus orca, in southern Alaska. Resident killer whales live in stable matrilines from which emigration of either sex has not been observed. Matrilines that associate regularly (greater than or equal to50% observation time) are called pods. Pods are believed to consist of closely related matrilines and share a unique repertoire of discrete call types. Pods that share parts of their repertoire form what-Ford (1991, Canadian Journal of Zoology, 69, 1454-1483) called an acoustic clan. Here, we identified discrete call types of seven pods from. southern Alaska, using a method based on human discrimination of distinct aural and visual (spectrogram) differences. Mitochondrial DNA of members of each pod was also analysed. The repertoires of the seven pods were compared and two acoustically distinct groups of pods were identified. Each group was monomorphic for a different mitochondrial D-loop haplotype. Nevertheless, pods from different clans associated frequently. It thus appears that the acoustic similarities within groups, which we presume to be cultural, reflect common ancestry, and that these groups therefore meet the above definition of clans. We also argue that a combination of cultural drift and selection are the main mechanisms for the maintenance of clans. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mate choice copying has been documented extensively in the laboratory with almost no supporting data available from studies in the wild. We investigated male and female mate choice copying in a wild population of the sailfin molly, a species that shows copying in the laboratory. We set up two upside-down plastic tanks in a river, with two jars of water on each tank. In male mate choice trials we placed a female in one jar and a male in the other on one tank and a female in one jar on the other tank, leaving the last jar empty. In female mate choice trials we presented a male and a female on one tank and a male and an empty jar on the other. Males preferred to associate with a female adjacent to a male rather than a lone female and females preferred to associate with a male adjacent to a female rather than a lone male. In two controls for shoaling behaviour we presented two males on one side of the set-up and one male on the other or two females versus one female. These controls showed that shoaling behaviour could not explain the male and female preference. Thus both sexes of the sailfin molly show mate choice copying in the wild, much as they do in laboratory studies. At least in this species, mate choice copying is not a laboratory artefact.

AB In seasonally breeding male birds that show paternal care, plasma testosterone (T) peaks in the early spring coincident with territory establishment and pair bonding. Once nests are initiated, T declines precipitously and remains low as nestlings hatch and males become parental. A growing body of evidence suggests there is a trade-off between a male's level of T and his expression of paternal care: high T enhances sexual behaviour but reduces paternal care. Male chestnut-collared longspurs show high levels of paternal care. They feed and brood young, act as nest sentries and aggressively defend the nest against predators. We experimentally altered males' plasma levels of T such that the early spring T peak was extended through the parental phase. T enhanced song behaviour typical of the sexual phase and decreased nest sentry behaviour during incubation, but did not reduce brooding or feeding of nestlings. Thus, males responded behaviourally to T during incubation, but, unlike most other temperate-breeding birds studied, did not respond to T after eggs hatched. Based on these data and similar results in an Arctic passerine, we suggest that the pattern of males' reduced responsiveness to T during the nestling phase may reflect the relative importance of male care to nest success in this species, or a phylogenetic constraint common to the genus Calcarius.

AB Because of the necessity of lactation, mammalian mothers must perform at least a minimum amount of infant care. In cooperatively breeding species, other group members aid in all other aspects of infant care. However, some mothers continue to carry and nurse their infants more than others. The golden lion tamarin, Leontopithecus rosalia, is a small, communally breeding primate in the family Callitrichidae. We studied hormonal, individual, historical and social factors hypothesized to contribute to variation in levels of maternal care. We used neonatal weight as a measure of prenatal care, and carrying and nursing as measures of postnatal care. Greater neonatal weight was associated with smaller litter size, lower prepartum levels of oestrogen conjugates, and higher prepartum cortisol levels. Higher rates of carrying during weeks 2 and 3 were associated with higher maternal weight, larger litter size and smaller numbers of helpers per infant. Higher rates of nursing in weeks 2 and 3 were predicted by smaller group size and provisioning of the mother. The most important factors affecting postnatal maternal care were maternal weight, group size, litter size and provisioning status of the mother. Thus, females that display higher levels of maternal care do so either because they have to (they have fewer helpers) or because they can (they are in better condition). 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social interactions have lasting effects on behaviour and physiology in a variety of organisms. In the leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius, social experience alters neural metabolism and elevates circulating concentrations of androgens. In this study, we assessed the effects of social experience (housing with females versus housing in isolation) on the expression of social behaviours in male geckos (1) when gonadally intact, (2) following castration and (3) following testosterone administration. Given the neural and endocrine changes following social experience, we hypothesized that social experience would increase the capacity to display territorial and courtship behaviour in male leopard geckos. We found that intact males previously housed with females (experienced males) displayed more territorial marking and more activity when exposed to a neutral test arena relative to males housed in isolation (naive males). Experienced males continued to show more marking and activity in the testing arena relative to naive males following castration. However, the courtship behaviour of castrated naive and experienced males did not differ significantly. Following testosterone administration, experienced males again showed more activity in the empty test arena and tended to show more courtship behaviour. In summary, we found support for the hypothesis that social experience leads to changes in territorial and courtship behaviours and, moreover, found that male leopard geckos share some degree of commonality with other vertebrates in behavioural plasticity following social experience. 2002 The Association for the Study of animal Behaviour.

AB We studied factors influencing the length of the postfledging period in the Montagu's harrier, Circus pygargus. Fledging date influenced the date of departure, for both wild birds and captive-reared birds (for which food supply was constant throughout the postfledging period), suggesting that departure time was constrained by migration. However, this relationship was absent in good food years, when some birds had short periods of dependency even if fledged early in the season. The end of the postfledging period was associated with a decrease in the food provided by the parents, coinciding with an increase in the fledglings' flying and hunting abilities and in aggressive food solicitation. The postfledging period was shortest when food was scarcest (when controlling for fledging date), and was also shorter for younger siblings (when controlling for brood effects), even though the parents provided less food in poor food years, and for nestlings in larger broods, particularly the younger ones. These results suggest that departure time is an adult's choice. However, we also predicted that if fledglings control parental investment, they should attempt to prolong the period of dependency when they receive little food. Length of the postfledging period was affected by food abundance, with shorter periods in better food conditions for equivalent hatching dates. In addition, the postfledging period was longer for birds from larger broods (when controlling for hatching date and food abundance), and for wild birds than captive-reared birds except in peak vole years. These results suggest that fledglings try to compensate for a deficiency in the food supply with longer periods of dependence, provided there is enough time before migration.

AB Males of the fly Drosophila melanogaster initially court mated, unreceptive females but later develop an avoidance reaction against them and even become temporally unresponsive to virgin females. This conditioned inhibition has been described as an associative process, the conditioned stimulus being a mixture of pheromones on the female's cuticle. To assess the evolutionary significance of courtship conditioning we recorded and analysed the male's behaviour during the conditioning process. The time traces of individual males were marked by an abrupt behavioural change. The time he spent courting suddenly decreased, and the frequency of 'turn-away' events at the same time sharply increased. Thus, the gradual decline of courtship observed as a group average does not reflect a slow change in motivation of the individual male but rather the interindividual differences of an active, experience-guided all-or-none decision to stop courting and to avoid the female. Three recently collected D. melanogaster strains were each maintained under two distinct mating conditions. Males were kept together with females for either ca. 2 weeks or 18 h. After 21 generations males of the two regimes differed markedly in their behaviour towards mated females. With long interaction periods between males and females, selection favoured courtship conditioning, while with short periods no such selection was observed. Slowly recovering receptivity of mated females may be needed for the maintenance of courtship conditioning. Courtship conditioning in D. melanogaster appears to be a fitness-relevant behaviour adapted to high-density populations with females mating a second time.

AB It is increasingly clear that ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths are a component of normal avian colour perception and influence their behaviour. As artificial lighting is designed to human specifications, and so is usually deficient in UV light, there may be welfare implications for captive birds, with both context-dependent and chronic long-term effects in its absence. Domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, kept under UV-deficient environments had significantly higher basal plasma corticosterone concentrations and tended to explore less, although not significantly so, suggestive of suboptimal conditions. Chicks under full spectrum lighting had a significantly higher rate of corticosterone rise in response to capture and handling stress than chicks reared without UV, largely because a similar maximum level was reached from lower initial concentrations. These treatment differences in hormonal stress response tended to diminish with age and/or familiarity with humans, in both groups of birds.

AB Theory predicts that sexually selected characters should be condition dependent if they are to be used as honest signals of male quality. One consequence of this dependence is that young and older males will differ in the expression of these characters. Many bird song characteristics, such as repertoire size or song length, are considered to have evolved through sexual selection. Consistent with this, several studies have shown that repertoire size increases with age. However, many of these studies used cross-sectional methods, comparing song characteristics in different age classes. This approach has the disadvantage that differential survival related to song can confound the data, emphasizing or hiding individual changes. To avoid this we combined a cross-sectional with a longitudinal analysis, where the same cohort is compared at different ages, to study how song characteristics change with age in the willow warbler. The longitudinal analysis showed that song repertoire size (the set of different song elements) and element rate (number of elements produced divided by song duration) increased between the first and second year. The cross-sectional analysis gave similar results, but there were no changes in element rate. From these results we can infer that the development of several song characteristics is costly in this species. The different results provided by the two methods for element rate suggest a negative correlation between element rate and the probability of survival. The discrepancy between the methods implies that cross-sectional methods can provide erroneous conclusions in the study of changes with age in bird song.

TI Begging and parent-offspring conflict in grey seals
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID HALICHOERUS-GRYPUS; MATERNAL INVESTMENT; SIGNALS; YOUNG; SEXES; NEED
AB Theoretical models, assuming an underlying conflict of interest between parents and offspring, suggest that begging can be an honest signal of offspring need provided that it is costly. Models on begging have been tested primarily on those birds in which parents provide care for several offspring. For these species, the underlying conflict selecting for extravagant (and apparently costly) begging displays might be sibling competition rather than parent-offspring conflict. We tested hypotheses on begging and parent-offspring conflict with the grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, as our model species, in which lactating females care for a single pup. As predicted from models of begging as an honest signal of need, pups begged at a significantly higher rate when hungry than when satiated. Furthermore, a mother was more likely to approach her pup shortly after the pup had uttered a begging call than within a randomly chosen period. We found no consistent support, however, for the assumption that there are strong conflicts of interest between mothers and pups. For example, the rate of suckling was not correlated with begging rate suckling bouts terminated by pups were not longer than those terminated by mothers, and, although pups initiated the majority of suckling bouts, mothers did not terminate more suckling bouts than pups. These findings thus suggest that begging in species that care for a single offspring may evolve in the absence of strong parent-offspring conflict.

AB Territory size in animals is traditionally taken to be the result of a trade-off between the spatial/temporal distribution of resources and the level of competition. However, it may also be influenced by physical constraints that themselves show temporal variability. Thus at low light levels it becomes more difficult for visually oriented animals both to see intruders (and therefore to defend a territory) and to locate the resource (e.g. food). This could result in a direct relationship between light intensity and territory size, with animals aggregating in preferred foraging areas at lower light intensities. We tested this hypothesis by recording the dispersion and aggressive behaviour (behaviours normally associated with territoriality) of replicate groups of juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar exposed to four night-time light intensities (0.00, 0.01, 0.50 and 1.00 Ix, the latter equivalent to dawn/dusk) on successive nights. There were clear effects of light intensity: fish tolerated other individuals nearer to them and showed little aggression under conditions equivalent to starlight (0.00-0.01 Ix), but both aggression rate and the distance between fish increased markedly with light level. The fish were also most aggressive early in the night (possibly because of readjustments in territory mosaics). These results may indicate that territory size, and hence the territorial mosaic, in salmon is dynamic, changing greatly between low and high light intensities, with fish defending much smaller territories on dark nights (rather than being nonterritorial, as previously suggested). This has implications for population regulatory mechanisms in winter, when the fish are predominantly nocturnal. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To assess temporal and spatial variations in the emission of the odour guiding them to the nipples, we exposed newborn rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, to lactating females in a series of simultaneous olfactory choice tests. They showed a clear preference for females in early, rather than late, lactation, and in the prenursing, rather than postnursing, phase. Furthermore, the female's abdominal, and specifically nipple, regions were more attractive to pups than the back and non-nipple abdominal areas. Finally, the surface odour. cues from the abdomen of lactating females were as attractive as the odour of rabbit milk itself. These data suggest that the source of the active compound eliciting preferential orientation is located on the nipple, a site allowing simultaneous evaporation in air and dissolution in milk.

AB The evolution of aposematism is difficult to explain because: (1) new aposematic morphs will be relatively rare and thus risk extinction during predator education; and (2) aposematic morphs lack the protection of crypsis, and thus appear to invite attacks. I describe a simple method for evaluating whether rare aposematic morphs may be selectively advantaged by their effects on predator psychologies. Using a simulated virtual predator, I consider the advantages that might accrue to dispersed and aggregated morphs if aposematic prey can cause neophobic avoidance, accelerate avoidance learning and decelerate predator forgetting. Simulations show that aposematism is very hard to explain unless there are particular combinations of ecological and psychological factors. If prey are dispersed throughout a locality then aposematism will be favoured only if (1) there is neophobia, learning effects and forgetting or if (2) there are learning effects and warning signals reduce forgetting rates. However, the best scenario for aposematic advantage involves learning rates, forgetting and neophobia when prey are aggregated. Prey aggregation has two important effects. First, it is a highly effective way to maximize the per capita benefits of the neophobia. Second, after an attack on a single prey the benefits of learnt aversions will be immediately conferred on the surviving members of an aggregation without the diluting effects of forgetting. Aggregation therefore provides good protection against forgetting. The simulations thus provide new insights into the complexities of aposematic protection and suggest some important directions for empirical work.

AB Courtship song is one of the most important male signals in Drosophila mating. A female D. melanogaster copulates more readily when given a conspecific type of courtship song. Female D. melanogaster accepted winged D. sechellia more than wingless ones in a no choice test. Copulation frequencies varied between strains and were significantly correlated with male mating propensity of D. sechellia. Females from three of five strains of D. sechellia accepted winged D. melanogaster less than wingless ones in no choice tests, suggesting that D. melanogaster songs reduce mating in D. sechellia females. Multiple choice tests showed that males prefer conspecifics. In female choice tests, D. melanogaster females copulated with winged heterospecific D. sechellia males more than with wingless conspecific D. melanogaster males in the confined condition, suggesting that song differences between D. melanogaster and D. sechellia affect D. melanogaster females less than the absence of courtship song.

AB Marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, observed a demonstrator removing the lids from a series of plastic canisters to obtain a mealworm. When subsequently allowed access to the canisters, marmosets that observed a demonstrator using its hands to remove the lids used only their hands. In contrast, marmosets that observed a demonstrator using its mouth also used their mouth to remove the lids. Since hand and mouth demonstrators brought about identical changes in the canisters, the differential test behaviour of the observer groups suggests that they learned about the demonstrator's behaviour. Furthermore, marmosets that had not been given the opportunity to observe a demonstrator prior to testing had a low probability of mouth opening, even if the canisters were previously opened by a mouth-opening demonstrator in an olfactory control experiment. Corroborating Bugnyar & Huber's (1997, Animal Behaviour, 54, 817-831) earlier findings, our results provide further evidence that marmosets can imitate.

AB Our aim was to test the existence of Gestalt colony odour in Camponotus fellah. We isolated individual workers to prevent trophallaxis, allogrooming and body contact. After 20 days, the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of the isolated ants diverged from that of the parent colony. Moreover, each isolated individual had its own specific blend. This procedure showed that after about 20 days of isolation there was a turnover of the colony odour, revealing the genetically expressed hydrocarbon profile of each individual. It also showed that the cuticular hydrocarbon profile is polymorphic, and that its homogeneity within a colony is maintained by frequent exchanges of hydrocarbons between workers. Behavioural observations of resident workers, in their nest, towards nestmates reintroduced after Isolation indicated that a short isolation period (3-5 days), which induced a minor change in hydrocarbon profile, provoked frequent trophallactic solicitations. These were likely to permit the isolated ants to readjust their hydrocarbon profile to that of the ants in the mother colony. Longer isolation periods (20-40 days) induced a greater change in hydrocarbon profile and made the residents intolerant towards their introduced nestmates. Therefore, our results clearly support the existence of a Gestalt colony odour in C. fellah. They also show that since individual hydrocarbon production is dynamic, workers are obliged to exchange hydrocarbons continually (mainly by trophallaxis) in order to be in the Gestalt, and properly integrate into the colony.

AB Social monogamy? which does not necessarily imply mating or genetic monogamy, is important in the formation of male-female pair associations. We operationally define social monogamy as occurring when two heterosexual adults, exclusive of kin-directed behaviour, direct significantly less aggression and significantly more submission towards each other, and/or spend significantly more time associating with each other relative to other adult heterosexual conspecifics. Long-term pair associations (i.e. those lasting through a lengthy breeding season) that are characteristic of social monogamy are common in some taxa but are virtually unknown in amphibians. Recent studies, however, have suggested that red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, have complex (for amphibians) social systems. Our laboratory experiments tested the hypothesis that red-backed salamanders found in pairs in the forest display behaviours consistent with social monogamy. During the summer noncourtship season, newly collected male-females pairs showed no preference to associate with their partners more than with a novel conspecific of the opposite sex. However, during the autumn courtship season, paired males and females significantly directed preferential behaviours towards their partners rather than towards a surrogate or a novel paired salamander. Focal animals showed no significant preferences when presented with their partner and a novel single salamander, but they never directed preferential behaviours towards a novel salamander (whether paired or single) or a surrogate. These results are the first to suggest that a salamander species engages in social monogamy. Furthermore, our results suggest that social monogamy may not inhibit paired males and females from displaying alternative strategies: preferring partners when extrapair associations may be disadvantageous (i.e. the extrapair animal is already paired) but not preferring partners when extrapair associations may be advantageous (i.e. the extrapair animal is single).

AB We investigated the effects of different doses (0, 2.5, 25 and 250 mu g) of the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) on the calling characteristics of the grey treefrog in a chorus in its natural habitat. AVT changed some call characteristics known to influence social behaviour in grey treefrogs. It increased call duration and number of pulses in a call, but not dominant frequency, call rate or pulse effort. Saline injections and handling did not produce significant changes in any of the call characteristics. In addition, individual animals injected with AVT only rarely produced call characteristics that were outside of the range found in the preinjection measurements, suggesting that AVT does not cause abnormal calling behaviour. Other researchers have demonstrated that longer calls with more pulses are produced by males when chorus densities increase, and females display a strong preference for longer calls with more pulses. This suggests that the changes induced by AVT injections may have functional consequences in social interactions. We previously demonstrated that AVT-injected males (25 pg AVT) displaced resident males from calling sites through changes in calling behaviour under natural field conditions. Our results indicate that changes in call duration and pulse number could contribute to the unmanipulated resident male's behaviour towards the AVT-injected intruder, perhaps because the calls are more attractive to females or because the calls are perceived as more aggressive.

AB The human life history is characterized by several unusual features, including large babies, late puberty and menopause, and the fact that there is a strong cultural influence on reproductive decisions throughout life. In this review I examine human life history from an evolutionary ecological perspective. I first review the evidence for life history trade-offs between fertility and mortality in humans. Patterns of growth, fertility and mortality across the life span are then discussed and illustrated with data from a traditional Gambian population. After outlining the stages of the human life course, I discuss two phenomena of particular interest in evolutionary anthropology, both of which are apparently unique to humans and neither yet fully understood. First, I discuss the evolution of menopause, the curtailing of female reproduction long before death. The evidence that this evolved because investment in existing children's future reproductive success is more important than continuing child bearing into old age is reviewed, along with data relating to the biological constraints that may be operating. Second, I discuss the demographic transition. Declining fertility at a time of increasingly abundant resources represents a serious challenge to an evolutionary view of human life history and behaviour, and is thus examined in detail. Parental investment in children in competition with each other may be key to understanding both of these unusual human phenomena. a 2000 the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB It has been repeatedly suggested that primates trade social services for fitness benefits in their relationships with the opposite sex. We tested this proposal in a colony of captive chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, by examining behavioural data on grooming, agonistic support and food sharing in relation to genetically established paternity. We found no support for the notion of trade. First, males did not sire more offspring with females that they actively groomed more frequently, that they supported more often or with which they shared food more frequently. Correspondingly, females did not give birth to more offspring sired by males from which they received more services. Second, males that showed more affiliative behaviour towards females in general did not sire more progeny. Furthermore, females did not bear more offspring sired by males to which they themselves directed more sociopositive behaviour. Results from this captive colony are compatible with those reported for chimpanzees under natural conditions. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In previous experiments, we found antipredator behaviours in female Trinidadian guppies to be influenced by water temperature. To distinguish between hypotheses suggested to explain these observations, we examined the effect of an increase in water temperature on the choice of shoal size of individual female guppies, in the absence and presence of predation threat from a confined cichlid. At 22 degrees C, guppies showed no significant preference for either of two shoal sizes of female guppies, although other responses indicated a reaction to the threat. At 26 degrees C, females chose to shoal with the smaller group when the Predator was absent, but, once threatened, switched to a strong preference for the larger group. Variation in preference between individuals was quite high in all treatments, and was somewhat lower for guppies under threat in warmer water, although not significantly so. Our evidence indicates that guppies in warmer water behave as if they are at greater risk of predation, but only when under threat. Temperature-dependent increases in predation risk from ectothermic piscivores could result from less efficient escape responses and from greater vulnerability because of increased foraging activity. We suggest that selection favouring guppies displaying an optimal balance between foraging and antipredator behaviours should act more strongly at higher temperature.

ID MATING PREFERENCES; REPEATABILITY; BEHAVIOR; MALES; FEMALES; FISH; SIZE
AB Most laboratory studies of mate choice use affiliation as a surrogate measure for actual choice of a partner for copulation. In a series of recent studies using affiliation as a dependent variable, we showed that the tendency of both male and female Japanese quail to affiliate with members of the opposite sex is profoundly affected by seeing them mate with others: female quails show an increased tendency to affiliate with males that they have seen mating; and male quails show a decreased tendency to affiliate with females that they have seen mating. In the present experiments, we examined: (1) the consistency of affiliative preferences of male and female quail for individuals of both the same and opposite sex; and (2) the validity of measures of affiliation as predictors of choice of an individual with whom to mate. We found that: (1) both male and female quail display consistency from trial to trial in their affiliative preferences for members of the opposite but not the same sex, and (2) affiliative preference is a powerful predictor of choice of a partner for copulation in both male and female quail. in Japanese quail, affiliative behaviour is consistent over time and predicts mate choice.

AB During the course of ontogeny, odonates switch from being aquatic larvae to being terrestrial adults. Ontogenetic niche shift theory proposes that such shifts are adaptive and have evolved to maximize a growth rate (size) to mortality rate ratio. Individuals should therefore switch from one niche to the other at an optimal size or state. Since the majority of odonates are seasonal breeders, the extent to which the switch is optimal will depend upon the time and the resources available during postembryonic development. We collected a cohort of larvae that varied in how close they were to eclosion and reared them on either a high-nutrition or a low-nutrition diet. We then determined the relative influence of both time and nutritional constraints on survival and development rate, as well as the body size, size-corrected flight muscle mass and fat reserves of individuals at eclosion. Damselflies in both high- and low-nutrition treatments responded to a short development period by developing faster and reducing their body size, but did not change their proportional investment in fat reserves and flight muscle. Reduced larval nutrition resulted in decreased body size, flight muscle mass and fat reserves at eclosion. However, it had no effect on survival to eclosion, or development rate. We discuss these results in terms of the influence that time and nutritional constraints have on odonate development patterns and fitness. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   TEMPERATURES; VIABILITY; STORAGE
AB As precocial bird species hatch synchronously, incubation during the egg-laying stage should be disadvantageous because it makes the embryos develop asynchronously. We established the patterns of nest attendance during egg laying and the start of incubation in ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, and tested three hypotheses regarding the advantage of early incubation. To determine nest attendance, we measured egg temperatures in real pheasant nests. Females spent more time on the nest as laying progressed, with an average of 6.4 h at a clutch size of 10. At the start of incubation, nest attendance increased to over 20 h/day. On the day before full incubation, time spent on the nest was positively correlated with the female's condition and negatively with the number of breeding attempts she had already made that season. The hypothesis that an early start of incubation improves egg viability was rejected, as the predicted relationship between the number of eggs laid after the start of incubation and the number laid before the start of incubation was not significant. We also rejected the possibility that early incubation reduces the risk of nest parasitism, as it was negatively related to the number of females radiotracked around the nest. Our data supported the hypothesis that early incubation reduces the risk of nest predation by shortening the period of exposure, as the number of eggs laid after incubation started was positively related to the number of breeding attempts made by the female, and thus to the perceived predation risk, but was negatively related to the time of season.

AB During their daily patrols of their hover sites, male stenogastrine wasps display three white stripes on their tergites by fully stretching their abdomen. In captive Parischnogaster mellyi males, we observed a positive relationship between mating and both display frequency and successful aerial duels. Approaches of receptive females to hovering males and sexual interactions were most frequent at the end of the males' performance, when only a few individuals displayed their stripes in flight. We investigated the function and cost of the stripes display by manipulating this sex-dimorphic trait. Wasps with additional white stripes (simulating continuously displaying individuals) were pursued and touched more frequently by rivals, stopped their activity earlier than controls and foraged more intensely.

AB We propose that the predator-prey relationship between California ground squirrels, Spermophilus beecheyi beecheyi, and northern Pacific rattlesnakes, Crotalus viridis oreganus, offers a compelling analogy with the well-studied case of intraspecific fighting and assessment. Because ground squirrels frequently place themselves at risk by harassing rattlesnakes, they stand to benefit from assessment strategies which serve to mediate risk. For example, larger and warmer snakes are more dangerous than smaller and cooler ones. These determinants of dangerousness covary with acoustic characteristics of the rattling sounds elicited by squirrel harassment. To determine whether squirrels use these acoustic cues regarding rattlesnake body size and body temperature, we played back rattling and control sounds to individuals in a population of free-living squirrels. The squirrels clearly associated rattling sounds with rattlesnakes and proved capable of assessing both determinants of rattlesnake dangerousness on the basis of acoustic cues. Several features of squirrel behaviour covaried with these acoustic cues, including tail flagging, bipedal posture, and hesitancy to reapproach the area where the rattle was heard. Many of these behavioural differences were sustained for up to 10 min postplayback. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We examined the frequency of leg loss and its effects on competitive ability and development in the spider Holocnemus pluchei (Araneae: Pholcidae), a family of spiders known for its readiness to autotomize legs. Leg loss was common in field populations, with 7.5% of all surveyed spiders missing at least one leg, most commonly one of the anterior pair. More spiders were missing multiple legs than expected by chance, suggesting that leg loss events are not independent. Large adult spiders were missing legs more frequently than were small spiders. The competitive ability of injured males was tested in three contexts. In the field, no effect of leg loss was found on the ability of spiders,to remain in webs into which they were introduced. In the laboratory, no effect of leg loss was found on the ability to fight with a single opponent over a prey, except that injured spiders were more likely to lose high-intensity fights. There was no difference between intact and injured males in their ability to compete with three females for limited prey. Leg loss significantly affected development time. The moult interval during the instar in which the injury occurred increased by approximately 15%. However, the growth rate for injured spiders was slightly but not significantly faster in the instar following leg loss, and total development time of the two instars together did not differ significantly between treatments. No spider showed any signs of regeneration. We conclude that, although there were some statistically significant differences between intact and injured males, these are unlikely to have major impacts on fitness, in contrast to findings in other species.

AB Procellariiform seabirds such as the Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus, rear only one chick at a time but may breed many times in their lives; parents should thus limit food delivery to the chick in keeping with the balance between current and future reproductive output. Yet procellariiform chicks accumulate large quantities of lipid, which may provide a buffer against pronounced and unpredictable variation in food provisioning, resulting in part from an inability of parents to regulate food supply to the nest. We switched chicks between nests to examine the roles of parents and offspring in controlling food delivery. The serial autocorrelation in age-specific body masses for unmanipulated chicks decreased from 0.61 (P<0.01) to 0.35 (NS) over a period of 15 days and remained nonsignificant thereafter. By contrast, the serial autocorrelation for switched chicks increased from 0.64 (P<0.01) to 0.83 (P<0.001) and the serial cross-correlation rose from 0.23 (NS) to 0.50 (P<0.05). These results supported both chick determination and parental determination models of food provisioning, indicating that chicks conveyed information about their nutritional status, which parents acted upon by adjusting their rate of food delivery. We discuss these results in relation to the optimization of nestling Lipid reserves and parental foraging effort. We suggest that information conveyed by the chick's begging intensity serves to reduce the provisioning rate to well-fed chicks, but parents cannot or do not increase food provisioning to poorly fed chicks. Such adjustment of food provisioning does not refute the hypothesis that nestling obesity provides a buffer against highly variable food delivery.

AB Individuals that dare approach predators (predator inspection behaviour) may benefit by acquiring information regarding the potential threat of predation. Although information acquisition based on visual cues has been demonstrated for fish, it is unknown whether fish will inspect predators on the basis of chemical cues or whether such inspection behaviour results in information acquisition. Here, we first ascertained whether predator inspection behaviour can be mediated by chemical cues from predators by exposing groups of predator-naive glowlight tetras (Hemigrammus erythrozonus) to the chemical cues of a potential fish predator (convict cichlid, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum) that had been fed either tetras (which possess an alarm pheromone) or swordtails (Xiphophorus helleri, which lack Ostariophysan alarm pheromones). Tetras showed a significant increase in antipredator behaviour when exposed to the tetra-diet cue, but not when exposed to the swordtail-diet cue. Chemically mediated predator inspection behaviour was also affected. Both the latency to inspect and the minimum approach distance to the predator significantly increased, and the mean number of inspectors per predator inspection visit significantly decreased when tetras were exposed to the tetra-diet Versus the swordtail-diet chemical cues. We then examined a potential benefit associated with chemically mediated predates inspection behaviour. Only tetras that were initially exposed to the tetra-diet cue and that had inspected the predator acquired the visual recognition of a convict cichlid as a predation threat. Our results thus demonstrate that (1) predator inspection behaviour in the glowlight tetra can be initiated by chemical cues, (2) chemically mediated inspection behaviour is affected by the presence of alarm pheromone, and (3) inspectors benefit by acquiring the recognition of novel predators.

AB We studied the courtship songs of males from several strains of Drosophila yakuba. There was clear evidence for two types of pulse songs, generated by the male's wing vibration, which we called 'thud' song and 'clack' song. Clack song was generated by both wings, at distances further from the female than the thud component, which was produced by one-wing displays. The carrier frequency of clack song was considerably higher than that of thud, whereas the interpulse intervals (IPI) of thud song, which usually predominated, were shorter. Furthermore, thud song revealed a cycling of IPIs with a period of about 70 s, significantly longer than that of D. melanogaster or D. simulans.

AB Various behavioural or body condition indices are frequently used to measure avian parental effort. To determine which of the indices provide meaningful short-term assessments of parental effort, we used four of them concurrently on breeding green-rumped parrotlets, Forpus passerinus, and then compared the results with field metabolic rate (FMR) measurements obtained using the doubly labelled water (DLW) technique. Nest provisioning rate correlated significantly with FMR among both males and females, while proportion of time away from the nest was correlated with FMR in females but not in males. Adult mass change during the breeding cycle and feeding latency were both unrelated to FMR. Our results suggest researchers should be cautious in assuming that any indirect method of quantifying parental effort is reliable for a particular species. We also tested whether the relatively invasive DLW protocol causes potentially confounding changes in study animals' subsequent behaviour. Paired observations before and after DLW injection showed no measurable changes in parrotlet nest attendance patterns or nest provisioning rate.

AB In domestic and wild mammals, tick infestation can be a significant fitness cost. Grooming behaviour has been shown to be effective in removing ticks. We studied grooming by moose, Alces alces, infested with winter ticks, Dermacentor albipictus, to determine which of two nonexclusive models for the regulation of tick-removal grooming, programmed or stimulus driven, best fit this host-parasite relationship. The programmed grooming model states that most grooming is driven by an internal timing mechanism which periodically evokes a bout a grooming independent of peripheral stimulation from tick bites. Because programmed grooming is preventive, the model predicts that those animals that groom the most will carry the fewest ticks, and a baseline level of programmed grooming is predicted even in a tick-sparse or tick-free environment. The stimulus-driven grooming model, on the other hand, states that grooming is a direct response to cutaneous irritation caused by tick bites and other sources of irritation. This stimulus-driven model predicts that (1) animals showing the highest rate of grooming will carry the most ticks and (2) animals will groom little when tick challenge is low. Both predictions of the stimulus-driven model were supported for moose: (1) calves oral-groomed three times more than cows, and tick densities on calves were three times higher than on cows; and (2) although all moose carried high densities of immature winter ticks (larvae, nymphs) from October through to February, grooming rate was very low until adult ticks started feeding in March-April. Peak grooming rates occurred during adult tick engorgement in March-April. Because an engorging adult female tick produces far more irritation than an engorging nymphal or larval tick, moose appeared to groom in direct proportion to the degree of cutaneous irritation and did not show a baseline level of grooming. The predominance of stimulus-driven grooming and apparent absence of programmed grooming may be the result of relaxed selection pressure for grooming in the evolutionary history of moose. Because the winter tick appears to have been introduced to moose from deer relatively recently, moose may not have had the time to adapt to winter ticks. The coevolutionary relationship between moose and winter ticks may be of insufficient duration for the evolution and/or maintenance of programmed grooming.

AB We studied the territorial behaviour of the Tasmanian native hen, Gallinula mortierii, a cooperatively breeding gallinule, for three breeding seasons at Maria Island National Park, Tasmania, Australia. Our analyses of 2738 territorial contests among 54 groups revealed that 87% of interactions were won by the group that initiated the interaction, 7% yielded no clear result, and only 6% were won by the opposing group. Asymmetries in the resource-holding potential of competing groups were not involved in deciding the outcomes of territorial contests. Our results suggest that asymmetries in payoff were involved, as in each of the 3 years groups with better quality territories were more likely to start interactions, and as a result, were more likely to win them. Only 6% of territorial contests escalated to involve physical contact and changes in territory boundaries rarely resulted from individual contests. The quality of a group's territory either changed very little between breeding seasons, or markedly increased or decreased. We conclude that major changes in territory quality occurred only under relatively rare conditions where the risks associated with escalated contests were reduced, or where the payoffs from a favourable result were improved. Males put more effort into the defence of the group territory than did females. The extra effort of males was directed more towards extragroup males than towards extragroup females. Females, in contrast, were equally aggressive towards both sexes. This suggests that the agonistic behaviour of male Tasmanian native hens may contain a mate-guarding component as well as functioning in the defence of territory.

AB We examined vocalizations of Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, given in response to a dog, in two populations, at Rocamadour, France, and Salem, Germany. Calls were recorded from 16 individuals in Rocamadour and 23 individuals in Salem. Despite an overall similarity, an acoustic analysis revealed significant differences in the call structure between populations. To test the perceptual salience of these acoustic differences, we conducted playback experiments in both populations in which calls from the own or the other population were broadcast. The overall response pattern did not differ significantly between the populations with regard to the origin of the call, However, subjects responded slightly, but significantly longer after playback of calls from the other group. Although call function apparently determined the general response of subjects, they none the less discriminated between calls from different origins. These results suggest a small but possibly meaningful plasticity in call production. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Lake-dwelling waterfleas, Daphnia, often face a dilemma;Food availability is highest, near the water surface, but predation by visually hunting predators is also most severe. Swimming downward at dawn reduces predation risk, but food availability and temperature also decrease with depth. We tested whether Daphnia process information derived from food and predator presence to estimate the costs and benefits of migration, and to determine when it pays to swim down. We studied downward swimming of D. galeata x hyalina in response to stepwise accelerations of relative increases in the intensity of light at several food and fish kairomone concentrations. Both had a modifying, additive, although independent effect. We studied in six clones. the clonal differences of this environmentally induced plasticity of photobehaviour. These clones were caught at two depths at noon during a period of vertical migration in Lake Maarsseveen (the Netherlands), and so presumably differed in vertical migration behaviour. Two clones, one from the epilimnion and one from the hypolimnion, showed a particularly significant difference in migration behaviour. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Wild zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, breed opportunistically when there is sufficient food available, often rapidly mobilizing their reproductive systems in response to an ephemeral boom in grass seed production. For females in captivity, fecundity, attractiveness to mates and survival to reproduction are all correlated with their hedging weight. By contrast, for males, only attractiveness is related to hedging weight; the relationship between hedging weight and male mortality is much weaker and that for male fecundity is unknown. Previous work thus suggests that how much food nestlings receive will have a profound impact on their reproductive success, and that this effect may be more marked for females than for males. I manipulated the food available to domesticated breeding zebra finches to test Trivers & Willard's (1973, Science, 179, 90-92) hypothesis of adaptive sexual investment. When food availability was restricted clutch sex ratios were significantly more male biased than when food was available in excess. Within clutches, daughters hatched sooner than sons and first-hatched chicks fledged at higher weights than those that hatched last. Chick mortality was female biased when food availability was low but male biased when food availability was unrestricted. I compared the song output of brothers of differing weight at independence, but found no significant difference between them. These data suggest that zebra finches manipulate both their primary and secondary sex ratios in relation to food availability to invest adaptively in sons and daughters, and support Trivers & Willard's hypothesis.

AB To investigate whether male common gobies, Pomatoschistus microps (Pisces, Gobiidae), treat their offspring differently depending on confidence of paternity, we conducted an experiment in which randomly chosen males either spawned alone with a female, or with a sneaking male present. Males did not treat their brood differently whether they had experienced sneaking or not. Our estimates of parental care, nest defence against potential egg predators and fanning rate were the same for the two treatments. Furthermore, there was no difference in filial cannibalism (eating their own progeny) between males that had been sneaked upon and males that had not. However, nest-guarding males that ate some of their brood had a smaller original brood area than other males. This suggests either an increase in paternal expenditure with increased brood size or a threshold value (absolute brood size or proportion of nest space covered) above which males do not cannibalize eggs.

AB We investigated the amount of variation in mating behaviour between and within individual male and female American toads, because both sources of trait variation can influence the course of sexual selection. Males varied in all four call parameters investigated (dominant call frequency, pulse rate, call rate and call duration). Individual males lowered the dominant frequency of their call when they interacted vocally with nearby males. Dominant call frequency was more highly correlated with body size in vocally interacting males than in non-interacting males. Pulse rate of calls primarily varied with water temperature. Call rate and call duration showed the most variation of the four call properties, but this variation was unrelated to male morphology or social interactions. Females varied in three aspects of mating behaviour: two measures of pair formation and their preference for dominant frequency of male calls. The body size of paired males varied between females both in pairings initiated by either sex and in pairings initiated only by females. Males chosen by females were usually larger than average, although age and prior breeding experience of females did not affect mate choice. Playback experiments indicated that female preference for calls of low dominant frequency depended on the temporal patterning of alternative calls presented. Each of the four male vocal properties showed significant repeatability, but only one of the three aspects of female mating behaviour was repeatable. We discuss how different degrees of repeatability in sexual traits of males and females may influence the action and detection of sexual selection in this and other species.

   GROWTH; SIZE
AB Cannibalism is uncommon in most species despite being taxonomically widespread. This rarity is surprising, because cannibalism can confer important nutritional and competitive advantages to the cannibal. A general, but untested, explanation for why cannibalism is rare is that cannibals may be especially likely to acquire pathogens from conspecifics, owing to greater genetic similarity among conspecifics and selection for host specificity and resistance to host immune defences among pathogens. We tested this hypothesis by contrasting the fitness consequences of intra-versus interspecific predation of diseased and non-diseased prey. We fed cannibalistic tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) larvae diseased conspecifics, healthy conspecifics, diseased heterospecifics (a sympatric congener, small-mouthed salamanders, A. texanum), or healthy heterospecifics. Cannibals that ate diseased conspecifics were significantly less likely to survive to metamorphosis and grew significantly less than those that ate diseased heterospecifics, but none of the other groups differed. Tiger salamander larvae also preferentially preyed on heterospecifics when given a choice between healthy conspecifics and heterospecifics. These results suggest that pathogen transmission is an important cost of cannibalism and provide a general explanation for why cannibalism is infrequent in most species.

AB In a field experiment, we tested whether workers of bumblebees, Bombus pascuorum and B. humilis, parasitized by larvae of conopid flies, Physocephala rufipes and Sicus ferrugineus, differ in their flower choice from unparasitized ones. We collected workers at random in the field and immediately tested them in experimental arenas that offered the choice of a reference plant (red clover, Trifolium pratense) versus a test plant (from five species). The choices of 396 workers were analysed with logistic regression models (logit analysis). We performed all tests in the same field and at the same time where the workers were foraging naturally. On average, the parasitized bees were less likely to visit the reference plant. In addition, they were more likely to switch plant species even after the first visit in the experimental sequence.

ID BEHAVIOR; ECHOLOCATION; PERCEPTION; CHIROPTERA
AB Responses of the vespertilionid bat Pipistrellus pipistrellus to five recently caught conspecifics confined to a wire-mesh cage, at distances of 50 and 5 m from their roosts, were recorded on 12 separate evenings at three roosts during pregnancy and lactation. When bats were confined 50 m from their roost, an almost 20-fold increase in the number of bats that passed across an open site around the cage was recorded and the strength of response (number of bat passes) increased with time. When the bats were 5 m from the roost there was an 80-fold increase in bat activity above the cage. Playbacks of recorded distress calls produced by single hand-held bats resulted in a more than three-fold increase in bat passes, but the response waned rapidly. The distress calls of recently caught P. pipistrellus were generally similar to those of individuals from the same colony held for longer in captivity, and differences in distress calls between two of the three colonies studied probably reflect differences in the physiological states of recorded bats, rather than the existence of colony-specific vocalizations. Distress calls probably function in attracting conspecifics which perform mobbing behaviour as an anti-predator response. (C) 1998 The Association for the study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The significance of multiple ornaments of male birds and other animals is currently not well understood. Male red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, possess a number of morphological traits that appear to be ornamental in nature. These traits include components of the colourful plumage and fleshy structures on the face and head, the single, medially-located comb, paired wattles and ear lappets. Some studies have implicated the comb in the mate choice decisions of female junglefowl, and some have also indicated that plumage of males is not important in this regard. To test for a possible role of other male morphological ornaments in female mate choice, and to evaluate the earlier counterintuitive findings concerning male plumage, we controlled comb size, and experimentally manipulated plumage, wattles and ear lappets of male red junglefowl. We also tested responses of female junglefowl to asymmetry of bilaterally paired male ornaments by manipulating the symmetry of the paired wattles, ear lappets and the ornate hackle feathers of the neck. None of these manipulations provided evidence that female red junglefowl are sensitive to asymmetry of paired ornaments of males. A series of tests involving a male with pronounced body asymmetry likewise produced negative results. In contrast to some other studies on birds, we obtained no evidence that female red junglefowl use symmetry of either ornamental or non-ornamental traits in mate choice decisions. Comb size, the only male trait Shown to be used by females, both in the present study and in some earlier ones, did not correlate significantly with natural asymmetry in any of several measured traits.

TI Learning from others' mistakes: a paradox revisited
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC INFORMATION; PIGEONS; STARLINGS; PERFORMANCE
AB Some researchers have reported the paradoxical finding of enhanced social learning when naive observers learn from unskilled rather than skilled demonstrators, particularly in discrimination tasks. In two experiments with starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, I considered whether this enhanced learning is because the observer (1) sees incorrect responses only, (2) sees both correct and incorrect responses or (3) sees an increase in the proportion of correct responses over trials. In experiment 1, individual starlings observed a demonstrator bird perform multiple simultaneous discrimination tasks. In one group, the demonstrator always picked the correct stimulus; in another group, the demonstrator always picked the incorrect stimulus; in a third group, the demonstrator consistently picked the correct stimulus 50% of the time. Those subjects that observed only incorrect choices performed significantly better than the other two groups, but none of the birds achieved the 90% correct performance criterion. Experiment 2 involved a single discrimination task; thus, a fourth group was added to control for individual learning. Again, subjects that observed only incorrect responses learned the discrimination significantly more quickly than the other three groups. Subjects that observed the demonstrator make both correct and incorrect responses were equally likely to select the same (correct) or opposite (incorrect) stimulus when the demonstrator picked the correct stimulus. When the demonstrator picked the incorrect stimulus, however, these subjects were significantly more likely to pick the opposite (correct) stimulus. These findings suggest that when learning a discrimination problem, observing a foraging companion's lack of success is more informative than observing its success.

AB Siblicide is common in many asynchronously hatching birds, including brown pelicans, Pelecanus occidentalis. Most adaptive models of siblicide, and of brood reduction in general, tacitly assume that parental deliveries of food remain fixed, and therefore that supplies to seniors remain unchanged or increase after a junior's death. If parents match deliveries to brood size, however, then seniors may get less food following brood reduction. To test the assumption that parental deliveries remain constant, and to determine how brood reduction affected seniors, food deliveries to control (three-chick) and experimentally reduced (two-chick) broods of brown pelicans were compared. Parents brought less food to reduced than to control broods. Similarly, a literature review revealed that avian parents generally delivered less food to smaller than to larger broods of experimentally altered sizes. In brown pelicans, when food deliveries decreased following brood reduction, second-hatched ('B') chicks received less food, but first-hatched ('A') chicks' supplies remained unchanged. B-chicks may have gained more in control broods by appropriating the extra food that last-hatched ('C') chicks otherwise would have gained. If brood reduction decreases fighting, nestlings may gain more net energy even if they receive less food. Fighting did not decrease significantly in reduced broods, perhaps because fledging averaged one chick/brood, so A and B-chicks still competed intensely. Alternatively, small sample sizes may have prevented detection of differences in fighting. Seniors did not concentrate their attacks on C-chicks, perhaps because seniors may benefit by delaying the decreases in parental food deliveries that follow brood reduction.

AB Footdrumming was compared in three allopatric species of kangaroo rat, Dipodomys, from three habitats. Analysis of footdrumming recordings revealed species-specific patterns of drumming ranging from single thumps to individual footdrumming signatures. The desert kangaroo rat, D. deserti, drums single thumps spaced 0.25-0.30 s apart that are sometimes introduced with a short footroll. The giant kangaroo rat, D. ingens, drums long footrolls that can average over 100 drums at 18 drums/s. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat, D. spectabilis, drums three to 38 footdrums in a footroll combined into sequences of two to 12 footrolls at a rate of 17 drums/s. In playback tests, all three species stood in alert postures and entered the burrow in response to footdrumming of their own and the other species. The rats also responded in species-specific ways. Dipodomys spectabilis drummed to its own species' footdrumming, but not to playbacks of the single drums of D. deserti. Instead of footdrumming to playbacks of its own species, D. deserti approached the speaker more frequently than did either of the other two species. Dipodomys ingens footdrummed equally to all footdrumming playbacks. The species' differences reflect differences in social tolerance and spacing. Dipodomys deserti rarely engages in footdrunming exchanges and chases visitors from the burrow. Dipodomys spectabilis engages in frequent footdrumming exchanges and some chases, and D. ingens seems to tolerate close neighbours and footdrums periodically.

   EVOLUTION; MONOGAMY; POLYGYNY
AB Social monogamy is the most common pair bond in birds and one hypothesis for its prevalence is that already mated females ('residents') prevent other females from establishing a pair bond with their mates ('competition for male parental care' hypothesis). To investigate this hypothesis we experimentally induced aggressive behaviour in resident female lapwings by presenting a female dummy conspecific, and a male dummy as control, near their nests. Females attacked both dummies. However, the female dummy was attacked more often than the male during the 5-min trials. Attacks on the female dummy were mostly on the ground (88%, N = 27 resident females) whereas the male dummy was attacked either by aerial dives (53%) or on the ground (47%, N = 24 resident females). Frequency of attacks on the female dummy decreased over the incubation period, whereas there was no such trend with the male dummy. These results suggest that female lapwings attempt to prevent their mates from attracting a new mate and thus try to monopolize their parental care. Other competing hypotheses for the explanation of aggressive behaviour in female lapwings are also discussed but were not supported by our data.

AB The advertisement call of the leptodactylid frog Batrachyla antartandica from southern Chile consists of a train of brief percussive tone pulses whose energy is centred at about 2 kHz. To gain an understanding of the temporal features that are essential for call recognition, playback experiments were conducted with 11 males. Subjects were presented with a synthetic imitation of this signal and variants for which different temporal call parameters were modified systematically. The number of pulses, pulse rate and latency of evoked vocal responses (EVRs) to stimuli having high pulse repetition rates (i.e. 8 and 16 pulses/s) were significantly weaker relative to responses to stimuli having an equal number of pulses but lower pulse rates. A similar, non-significant tendency was observed for a series of stimuli with different pulse rates for which the total stimulus duration was held constant. EVRs also decreased significantly for stimuli having long pulse durations (i.e. 48 and 96 ms) relative to stimuli comprising shorter pulses. No significant differences were observed between EVRs to stimuli for which pulse rise and fall times were varied from 1-20 ms. Responses to calls comprising trains of 10 pulses were weaker compared with stimuli having fewer pulses per train. The selective EVRs of B. antartandica for different temporal parameters contributes to an understanding of the mechanisms involved in call recognition and stress the relevance of temporal processing of sound by males for the emergence of specific patterns of vocal behaviour in anurans.

TI Song development by grey catbirds
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB What are the relative roles of imitation, improvisation and invention in the development of large song repertoires in species of the songbird family Mimidae? This question was addressed in a laboratory study of the vocal development of young grey catbirds, Dumetella carolinensis, collected from western Massachusetts. Two groups heard a repeated 10-s, tape-tutored segment of catbird song, two other groups heard a repeated 16-min segment and a fifth group heard no tape-tutored songs. One male selected for study from each group developed a large repertoire of seemingly normal songs, and wild males responded strongly to songs of the male that had heard no tape-tutored song. Relying little on precise imitation and largely on improvising or inventing, each male developed a highly unique repertoire. A geographical survey of catbird song revealed little to no evidence of song sharing or microgeographical variation, which is consistent with the idea that imitation plays a relatively minor role in song development. Perhaps simultaneous selection for large repertoires and reduced geographical variation has led to such an emphasis on song individuality and non-imitative developmental processes.

AB Large numbers of wood ants, Formica aquilonia, crawl up trees to gather food (arthropods and honeydew), and most return to the ground the same way. A small but noticeable percentage, however, returns to the ground by falling. This continuous rain of free-falling ants, from trees to the ground, is analogous to the drift of invertebrates in freshwater streams, and provides ecologists with an easily replicated terrestrial system for studying the phenomenon of drift. In a field experiment in this system, when birds came to forage, the total numbers and percentages of ants entering the rain increased dramatically. Initial background levels of ant rain (before birds came to forage) ranged from 0 to 11.9% ((X) over bar = 4.0%). When birds came to forage in certain trees, the percentage of ants entering the rain in those trees ranged from 2.9 to 28.4% ((X) over bar = 9.1%). In trees not visited by birds, ant rain decreased slightly during the same period to a mean of 3.7%. As the total time birds spent foraging in a tree increased, ant rain there also increased.

AB In species with biparental care, communication between the parents may increase the efficiency and decrease the risks of care delivery. In northern cardinals, Cardinalis cardinalis, the female's singing from the nest may provide information that allows her conspicuous mate to target his visits to the nest to times when food is needed, saving energy and flights that may attract nest predators. Thirteen pairs of cardinals were recorded in 25 nestings over six summers in Madison, Wisconsin; U.S.A. When a male with nestlings sang or called within 12 m of the nest, his probability of bringing food to the nest varied with his mate's response. The male was more likely to come to the nest when the female sang than when she did not, unless she responded to the male's song with a matching song type. Most males were least likely to come to the nest when their mates matched their songs. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Breeding adult male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus L., develop an elaborate breeding signal, the primary component of which is ventral red coloration. In laboratory dominance tests staged under illumination conditions that maintained or eliminated male perceived coloration, this study examined (1) the relationship between male coloration and fighting ability and (2) the applicability of three hypotheses for the current function of male coloration in male-male competitive interactions. In pairs of males from a Long Island, NY, population matched for size and prior dominance experience, the more brightly coloured males were more likely to initiate and win under white light. The effect of colour on dominance success was lost under replicates illuminated by coloured-light treatments that masked the signal by eliminating its visual contrast. The loss of competitive advantage associated with more conspicuous coloration was not an artefact of illumination manipulations, since the effects seen under white light were maintained under a coloured-light treatment that maintained male coloration. These data suggest that red belly coloration of males functions as a threat signal. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In a laboratory study, 12 different experimental set-ups were used to examine the ability of Portia fimbriata, a web-invading araneophagic jumping spider from Queensland, Australia, to choose between two detour paths,only one of which led to a lure (a dead, dried spider). Regardless of set-up, the spider could see the lure when on the starting platform of the apparatus, but not after leaving the starting platform. The spider consistently chose the 'correct route' (the route that led to the lure) more often than the 'wrong route' (the route that did not lead to the lure). In these tests, the spider was able to make detours that required walking about 180 degrees away from the lure and walking past where the incorrect route began. There was also a pronounced relationship between time of day when tests were carried out and the spider's tendency to choose a route. Furthermore, those spiders that chose the wrong route abandoned the detour more frequently than those that chose the correct route, despite both groups being unable to see the lure when the decision was made to abandon the detour.

TI Honey bees transfer olfactory memories established during flower visits

ID APIS-MELLIFERA; AGE
AB To see what effects learning in one context can exercise upon subsequent learning in other contexts the relation between olfactory learning performance of honey bees, Apis mellifera a L., in a restrained classical conditioning paradigm for the proboscis extension reflex and chemosensory experience under natural circumstances was investigated. The effects of food-source odours and of the hive's odour on subsequent laboratory proboscis extension performance were tested. There was a transfer effect for odours from a food source to proboscis extension reflex conditioning in the laboratory: bees extended their proboscis in response to food-source odour and showed resistance to its extinction. Hive odour had no detectable effect. Thus, the observed transfer effect for food-source odours was likely to be caused by memories established during foraging rather than by within-hive experience with the scent of harvested food. The observed transfer effect for odours from a food source thus points to a surprisingly weak role of context for the retrieval of olfactory memories established during foraging. Furthermore, it offers an experience-based explanation for variability in honey bee proboscis extension learning. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

   ORGANIZATION
AB Female copulation behaviour in the black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, was studied by detailed observations of individually marked birds together with DNA fingerprinting analyses for paternity assessment. For each breeding occasion females typically mated only once with one male, and did not mate outside the lek arena. They re-mated with the same or another male usually only if the initial copulation was disturbed and was probably unsuccessful in sperm transfer. The willingness of females to copulate only once with one male suggests that multiple mating with several males incurs a cost that more than outweighs any possible fertility or sperm competition benefits. Attempts by neighbouring males to disturb copulations were frequent, but only a small fraction of these were successful in terms of causing the female to re-mate. There was no tendency for females to redirect matings to the males that had disturbed them which also suggests that disturbance risk is not limiting female choice. However, risk of disturbance does increase the cost of female choice, and in that sense it will have some impact on mating decisions, in particular if the benefits of increasing choosiness are not great.

AB Males and females of pelagically spawning marine fishes face different problems in maximizing reproductive success. Males must allocate sperm over frequent, successive spawns. Females must ensure successful fertilization of their egg clutches. This study examined sperm allocation between individual spawns, the daily 'standing crop' of sperm just prior to spawning, gonadal investment (testis weight/body weight) in males and fertilization rates of females of the coral reef fish Sparisoma radians. Males released a median of 8.94 x 10(6) sperm per pair spawn, with the number increasing with increasing clutch size and body size of the female mate. Standing crop of sperm correlated with male spawning frequency, and testicular investment correlated with degree of sperm competition by streaking males. Fertilization efficiency (number of eggs fertilized by a given number of sperm) increased with the body size of the female partner. Fertilization rate, i.e. the proportion of the clutch successfully fertilized, was over 90% in most spawns, but significantly increased with the number of sperm released by the male. The probability that a spawn was joined by a second, competing male ('streaker') increased with the body size of the spawning female. Overall, the sperm allocation pattern can be explained both as a form of sperm economy in which males release the minimum number of sperm needed to fertilize most of the eggs in clutches of different size, and as a response to an increased probability of sperm competition with females of increasing size.

AB Models of lek breeding based an female preferences for mating with high quality males have predicted that leks should be evenly distributed at distances approximating the diameter of female home ranges, and empirical studies have cited lek distribution in support of these models. In the 'black hole' model of lek evolution, leks arise because clusters of male territories retain mobile females; female mating preferences are not assumed. Here this model is extended to include sufficient space and animals for multiple leks to form, and it is used to generate predictions about the size and spacing of leks in different populations. Like models based on female choice, black hole models predict that leks will be evenly spaced at distances of approximately one female home range diameter, that lek size will increase with increasing male density, and that females will be concentrated near the centre of leks where male territories will be smallest. The addition of female copying to the model decreases the tendency for leks to form, but this influence is mitigated by an upper limit on harem size. Since similar lek distributions are predicted by contrasting models, the even distribution of leks may imply some mechanism causing females to aggregate at the largest accessible cluster of territories, but does not clarify the nature of this mechanism.

AB The white-throated savanna monitor, Varanus albigularis, is a large (>5 kg) carnivorous lizard that inhabits the arid savanna in southern Africa. In the natural environment, feeding occurs only during the 4-month wet season when invertebrate and small vertebrate prey are abundant. Seven experiments were conducted to examine the foraging, feeding and sensory discrimination behaviour of these lizards towards land snails, a favoured natural prey. Subjects were 16 subadult, captive-hatched lizards. Each lizard received several trials in choice discrimination tests with two or three types of snail stimuli differing in visual, chemical or tactile cues. Lizards differentiated between land snails using both visual and chemical cues. Large snails and those requiring short handling times were chosen over small snails and those requiring greater handling time. Neither snail movement nor snail weight were significant cues in choice of individual prey. Lizards preferred empty shells with fresh snail odour to empty snail shells without odour. The results suggest that these monitor lizards discriminate between prey items using visual and chemical cues. A result of their selectivity is obtaining a high caloric reward at a minimum energetic cost. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Stabilimenta are silky structures on the webs of some orb-weaving spiders, whose function is still not well understood. This study tested the prey-attraction hypothesis as a possible function of stabilimenta with the banded garden spiders Argiope trifasciata in southeastern Michigan. Spider webs' stabilimentum length, prey interception rates and web characteristics were recorded daily. The daily insect interception rates and web characteristics were compared between stabilimentum-decorated and undecorated webs. An intra-web comparison was performed between decorated and undecorated halves of webs on the daily insect interception rates and web characteristics. The effects of location and characteristic of webs on insect interception rates were further examined at decorated and undecorated webs. A higher interception rate for flying insects was found in webs decorated with stabilimenta, but orthopteran interception rate was the same when compared with undecorated webs. The decorated web's higher interception rate for flying insects did not seem to result from locations or characteristics of webs. The length of a stabilimentum had little effect on increasing its attractiveness to flying insects. There was no difference in flying insect interception rates between decorated and undecorated halves of webs, but orthopteran interception rates were always higher in lower halves of webs. The results from intra-web comparison indicated that a stabilimentum did not increase insect interception rate of the adjacent area but did increase that of the whole web.

   SINGING BEHAVIOR; BIRD SONG; DIALECTS; ONTOGENY
AB Many songbirds overproduce songs during development and shrink the repertoire at the time of adult crystallization. The amount of overproduction varies between species. The hypothesis was tested that overproduction of learned songs during ontogeny is correlated with a migratory annual cycle. It is argued that in migrants, overproduction permits song matching between territory neighbours when song memorization is restricted to an early sensitive phase and young males subsequently disperse relatively long distances to their first breeding territory. Song development was compared in the sedentary Nuttall's white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli, and two migratory taxa, the Puget Sound white-crowned sparrow, Z. l.pugetensis, and the mountain white-crowned sparrow, Z. l.oriantha. Although the Puget Sound and Nuttall's white-crowned sparrows are sister taxa, male Puget Sound sparrows more closely resembled the more distantly related, but migratory, mountain white-crowned sparrow on every measure of song development studied. It is concluded that a migratory annual cycle is a better explanation of diversity in vocal development in this species than recency of common ancestry.

TI Mate selection by repeated inspection: More on pied flycatchers
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID CHOICE; EVOLUTION
AB Our understanding of deceit in animal signalling is limited by our conceptual tools as well as by the available data. Mate choice in polyterritorial birds, such as pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, is a particularly contentious example. Dale & Slagsvold (1994, Anim. Behav., 48, 1207-1217) developed a quantitative model of discrimination of male quality (mating status) based on repeated sampling of territories by searching females. The model emphasizes the trade-off between correctly rejecting already mated males and incorrectly rejecting unmated males. In the present study, their model was incorporated into the framework of signal detection theory and the relationship between search costs, search tactics and the resulting rates of discrimination errors was examined. Over a range of reasonable assumptions about probabilities and payoffs, the scenario suggested by Dale & Slagsvold implies that female pied flycatchers should inspect each territory only a few times and accept only males that are present at every inspection. Consequently, male mating status should be moderately discriminable. The quantitative tools offered by signal detection theory are consistent with the conceptualization of deceit established by Dawkins & Krebs (1978, Behavioural Ecology: An Evolutionary Approach) and with the recent evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) analyses of signalling developed by Johnstone & Grafen (1992, Proc. R. Sec. Lend. Ser. B, 248, 229-233). (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB As a result of social subordination, female common marmosets undergo suppression of ovulation and inhibition of sexual behaviour. This study examined the possibility that subordination also results in decreased aggressiveness and increased submissiveness towards same-sex strangers. Thirty-two adult females were pre-assigned to eight mixed-sex social groups. The females' behavioural and adrenocortical responses to brief confrontations with each of three female strangers were assessed under two conditions: while subjects were pair-housed with a male and while they were living in established, mixed-sex groups. Only 22% of subjects threatened stimulus females in the heterosexual pairs condition, 47% submitted and 31% showed no agonism. These agonistic behaviour patterns reliably predicted whether a female would become dominant or subordinate in a mixed-sex group. When animals were housed in established social groups, both dominant and subordinate females either showed similar responses to stimulus animals as they did in the earlier condition or became somewhat less responsive. Plasma cortisol levels did not correlate with agonistic behaviour and were not elevated by stranger-encounter testing. Finally, in the first 10 days following group formation, subordinate females that had shown ovulatory cyclicity prior to group formation were significantly more likely to receive persistent aggression from their dominant female groupmate than subordinates that had been anovulatory. These results suggest that attainment of social status between female marmosets is closely related to pre-existing individual differences in agonistic behaviour, whereas tolerance between females depends upon ovarian function.

AB Workers from incipient colonies of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, are less aggressive towards conspecific non-nestmates than are workers from reproductively mature colonies. This often leads to brood raiding between incipient colonies, where workers take brood from other incipient colonies without opposition. The development of aggressive reactions by incipient colony workers and queens towards non-nestmate workers and queens was examined. Both workers and queens show nestmate discrimination from the earliest stages of colony activity. Workers from the colony's first cohort vigorously attacked workers from mature colonies. These same workers rarely attacked non-nestmate workers from incipient colonies, although they were more aggressive towards them than towards nestmates. Workers and queens often vigorously attacked non-nestmate queens, and were more aggressive towards unfamiliar than familiar queens. Queens bitten by workers were likely to be expelled or killed within 3 days of introduction. The highly aggressive response of incipient colony workers towards unfamiliar queens suggests that brood-raiding colonies do not consolidate for mutual benefit. Rather, they struggle for possession of brood while attempting to prevent the entry of additional reproductive females into the colony. In addition, heritable cues were neither necessary nor sufficient for worker acceptance of queens. Finally, although incipient colony workers from colonies with four foundresses were slightly less aggressive towards non-nestmates than workers in colonies with single foundresses, they still discriminated against non-nestmate queens. This result suggests that cooperative nest founding alone cannot explain the development of non-territorial, polygyne S. invicta colonies. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Gallup et al.'s (1995, Anim. Behav., 50, 1525-1532) defence of the view that Gallup's mark test has provided evidence of self-recognition in apes is countered point by point. The plausibility of the defence is criticized because of poorly designed experiments, unreliable experimental effects, illegitimate cross-experimental comparisons, false inferences and anecdotal observations. A recent attempt to fortify the case using developmental data (Povinelli et al. 1993, J. comp. Psychol., 107, 347-372) was unsuccessful because it failed to find a reliable relationship between age and mark test performance. Consequently, there is still no convincing evidence of self-recognition or mirror-guided body inspection in animals. An alternative research strategy is recommended in which the self-recognition hypothesis is tested directly through complete, carefully designed experiments.

AB The responses of male and female Drosophila melanogaster to male courtship songs were investigated by videotaping single sexed groups of flies as they were exposed to simulated sounds: pulse, sine, pulse sine and rhythmic, and controls: white noise (males only), and silence (females only). Patterned sounds (1-min silence, 1-min sound) were delivered for 19 min: (1) in 6-dB steps from 60 to 108 dB; and (2) at 84 dB. This method enabled sound intensity effects to be distinguished from the effects of time of exposure. Pulse, pulse sine and rhythmic songs significantly increased male locomotory activity and male-male courtship interactions compared with initial measurements at no sound. Sine song had similar effects but to a lesser degree. White noise resulted in complete cessation of movement. Females behaved differently from males: there was more movement at initial no sound, followed by decreased movement over time in all conditions. However, sine and rhythmic songs differed significantly from the silent control condition and maintained activity at a high level. An exposure of 1 min to pulse sine song at 84 dB made females slow down showing that intensity level, and not length of exposure, was the critical stimulus. It is suggested that the different responses of males and females to the various components of male courtship song are adaptive: female movement initially attracts males; while increased male movement plus decreased female movement enhances mating.

AB Although parasite modification of host behaviour is well established, little is known about the effects of parasites on the spatial learning abilities of the host. The effects of an acute, sub-clinical infection with the naturally occurring, single host, enteric, protozoan parasite, Eimeria vermiformis, on spatial water-maze learning by male laboratory mice, Mus musculus, were examined. Individual mice had to learn the spatial location of a submerged hidden platform using extra-maze visual cues. Determinations of spatial acquisition were made with different groups of mice on days 4 (pre-infective), 7 (onset of infectivity or patency) and 10 (infective) post-infection. Task retention was examined in a probe trial 1 day later. The infected mice displayed significantly poorer acquisition and retention of the water-maze task over 1 day of testing (six blocks of four trials) than either sham-infected or control mice, with mice at days 4 and 7 post-infection displaying significantly poorer spatial performance than mice on day 10 post-infection. This attenuation of spatial learning occurred in the absence of either any symptoms of malaise or illness, or any evident motor, visual and motivational impairments. These parasitic-infection-induced decreases in spatial learning are likely to arise as side-effects of the immunological and neuromodulatory responses of the host and may be considered as a fitness cost associated with response to infection.

ID WATER-BUFFALO; BEHAVIOR
AB Allonursing was investigated in a dairy herd of 30 river buffalo cows and their calves. The primary behavioural variables were solicitations of allonursing by calves and acceptances of calves by cows. The sample of cows included a group of nine half-sisters, two additional pairs of half-sisters, and a pair of full-sisters. All of the calves were half-siblings owing to putative common paternity. Ancillary variables were age, milk-yield and docility of cows, as well as age, sex, weight and growth rate of calves. Three hundred and fifty-one instances of allonursing and 341 of filial nursing were recorded. There were large individual differences in the cows' tendencies to accept their own offspring and non-filial calves, and for the calves to successfully solicit milk from their mothers and other cows. Thirteen of the 30 cows accounted for 97% of the allonursing. Frequent allonursing was correlated with decreased growth rate in the donors' calves. Allonursing was unrelated to kinship or reciprocal relationships among the cows, and was associated with a lack of maternal experience in young cows and apparent milk theft by hungry calves whose mothers were not providing them with sufficient milk.

AB Current models of interference-based ideal free theory often use the coefficient of interference, m, to quantify the intensity of competitive interference. However, it is not clear what m means in terms of behaviour. This is because the Hassell and Varley model, from which m is derived, only provides a description of the interference process without alluding to the mechanisms underlying the relationship. In this paper a behaviour-based, analytical model is described which finds the ideal free distribution of predators searching for food in a patchy environment. An interference expression from a model developed by Ruxton et al. (1992, Theor. Pop. Biol., 42, 235-253) based on the interactions of a group of predators with each other and their prey is used to obtain the ideal free distribution over any finite number of food patches for different prey distributions. Using examples of environments with two and three patches, the effects of the degree of interference and the total prey density on such distributions are also studied. Contrary to many published results, an over-representation of predators in the best patch is always predicted. This effect is enhanced by increasing prey abundance. When interference is the result of wasted time, m cannot exceed 1; in most cases m is expected to be very low.

AB How the Neotropical frog Physalaemus pustulosus uses spectral cues to recognize and assess the relative attractiveness of conspecific calls was examined using 50 different phonotaxis experiments with a total of 1005 individual female-choice tests. The advertisement call is an FM sweep from 900 to 430 Hz, or 'whine', which can be followed by a 'chuck' (with most energy near 2500 Hz) to enhance the whine's attractiveness. Female-choice tests pairing full whines against modified whines or chucks indicate that stimulation in a high-frequency region of the whine's fundamental between 900 and 560 Hz, followed by stimulation in a partially overlapping low-frequency region between 640 and 500 Hz is necessary and sufficient for call recognition. No single frequency or frequency band within each region is crucial for recognition, and the recognition system is tolerant of silent gaps and shortening of the signal. Adding energy at any frequency in the normal whine's fundamental or in the chuck enhances the attractiveness of the call. The higher frequencies of the chuck, which contain 90% of its energy, are normally responsible for its enhancement of the call. These results suggest that much of the natural call in this species is unnecessary for call recognition, and that the recognition system is very tolerant of call variation. They also suggest that the system assessing the relative attractiveness of calls is extremely permissive, and that virtually anything that increases the amount of energy in the call at frequencies stimulating any part of the peripheral auditory system may make the call more attractive.

AB Dual-choice experiments were devised to test whether pipistrelle bats, Pipistrellus pipistreIlus, can discriminate between odours of a limited number of conspecifics from both their own colony and from a different one. All of five females from one colony learnt to discriminate between,the odours of colony-mates of the same sex and reproductive condition with 75% certainty after an average of 5 days (20 choices per day). Ten bats (five from each of two colonies) chose odours of females from their own colony in preference to those of females from a second colony on the first series of 20 trials. These experiments demonstrated the ability of pipistrelles to recognize familiar individuals by scent cues and also to discriminate between familiar versus unfamiliar conspecific odours.

AB To date, research on Callimico goeldii has been focused on reproductive endocrinology. Only sparse and mostly anecdotal data on parent-infant behaviour are available. This study provides a quantitative description of the first 6 weeks' caregiving of five offspring to five captive pairs. With inclusion of the data from an additional four offspring the date of first transfer from the mother to the father (22.1 days after parturition) and of the first transfer to the substrate (28.7 days after parturition) were determined. A dear sexual dimorphism was found in that female infants were transferred to the father on average 6 days earlier than males, whereas latencies of the first transfer to the substrate did not differ significantly between the sexes. Behavioural, scores which correlate with this difference and/or individual differences between the observed breeding pairs were investigated in an attempt to find parameters that describe and predict a pair's infant care strategy. Analysis of the infant-parent and parent-infant behaviour demonstrated that the decline in maternal carrying rather than in nursing is associated with parent-infant conflict; therefore, as carrying is also a major maternal investment in this small-bodied species, parental carriage is suggested to be the principal currency of weaning in C. goeldii.

AB Female and male preferences for various features of the male's vibratory courtship signals are described for the wandering spider Cupiennius getazi (Ctenidae). Preferences were determined by replaying synthetic and natural, but altered, conspecific male signals to the spiders. Although the number of females responding varied between the different test situations, the number of responses per replayed signal were not significantly different. The latency of the first female response was not correlated with the number of females responding, that is, with the quality of the male's signal. Females responded on average around the third replayed signal. Thus females appeared to follow an all-or-none response rule. They were only broadly tuned to the average properties of the male's releaser (e.g. they tolerated large variations of amplitudes, durations and repetition rates). Moreover, they did not prefer high to low amplitudes, long to short signals, or frequently repeated to rarely displayed signals or syllables. It thus seems unlikely that they differentiated between conspecific males during the vibratory communication phase of courtship. In contrast, females exhibited clear preferences for syllables longer than 240 ms and consisting of two 'subsyllables'. These patterns are typical for conspecific signals, but atypical for heterospecific signals. This strongly suggests that female preferences serve species recognition. Theory predicts that when male investment is small relative to that of females, males will be less selective in responding to cues indicating the presence of a potential mate. In C. getazi, displaying males are such a cue for both sexes. In response to male vibrations, males had few preferences and were either as selective as females or less so (in two and five of the seven tested parameters, respectively).

AB In monogamous species the amount and quality of male parental care may be essential for females since fitness depends on number and quality of offspring. Degree of male ornamentation may be used by females as an indicator of paternal effort and thus may be an important factor in mate choice situations. This was tested by observing feeding rates of yellowhammers, a species showing considerable colour variation. Male and female feeding rates were inter-correlated and were both negatively correlated with male coloration. Relative male feeding rate was not correlated with male colour. In spite of a low feeding rate by more highly coloured older males, no effect was found on nestling condition, indicating compensation by high quality food or bigger load per nest visit. Nevertheless, coloration was positively related to the number of fledged young for old males and so may indicate parental quality. These results suggest that older and generally more colourful males may be more experienced and of higher quality and so may be preferred by females.

AB In a Costa Rican population of the Montezuma oropendola, Psarocolius montezuma, males defended groups of sexually receptive females. Females nested colonially, and males aggressively competed with each other for access to groups of females at nesting colonies. Males were ranked based on the outcome of aggressive interactions. The top-ranking or alpha male physically excluded all lower-ranking males from the colony and prevented them from approaching females. The alpha male was present at the nesting colony during those periods of the day when the highest number of females was present. During other parts of the day, the alpha male was often absent and lower-ranking males moved into the colony and defended females there until the alpha male returned. Over the course of the season, the number of males present at the colony was positively correlated with the number of sexually receptive females there. Male competition was localized at that portion of the colony containing the highest number of nest-building females; when females finished their nests and laid eggs, males shifted to areas containing females that had not yet laid eggs. Males also moved to new colony sites whenever the females moved, both within and between breeding seasons. Male mating success at the focal observation colony was strongly and positively associated with dominance rank; 77% of 88 copulations observed were obtained by the alpha male. These results indicate that the Montezuma oropendola has a female-defence mating system. This mating system is more similar to those of polygynous mammals than it is to those of most other polygynous birds.

AB Assortative mating based on a courtship signal was investigated by examining the relationship between the male-produced pheromone and female preference in the bark beetle, Ips pini. Female preference in response to the male-produced pheromone was measured in the held using traps baited with a range of 11 synthetic blends of the two pheromone enantiomers, (+) and (-)ipsdienol. The production of ipsdienol enantiomers was measured from individual, live-trapped male beetles in the laboratory. Although there was a significant regression of the blend that male beetles produced and the blend to which they responded, the sex ratios of beetles responding to different blends of enantiomers in the field did not differ significantly. In a second experiment, male-female pairs were sampled in the field, females were assayed for preference in a laboratory olfactometer, and male enantiomer production was measured in the laboratory. There was a significant correlation between female preference and male blend production. Pheromone production and response were not correlated with body size, nor was body size correlated in male-female pairs.

TI RECIPROCAL BENEFITS OF ALLOMOTHERING FOR FEMALE VERVET MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Allomothering, or care of the young by individuals other than the mother, was studied in captive groups of vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus. The most frequently proposed hypotheses to explain caretaking by primate allomothers are (1) the mother benefits from the reduction in time and energy allocated to infant care, and (2) the allomother benefits by gaining maternal experience prior to the birth of her own first infant. Analysis of longitudinal data on behaviour and  reproduction provided empirical support for both of these hypotheses. Mothers who used allomothers more often were able to spend more time away from their infants in the first 3 months of the infant''s life, without leaving their infants alone, and were also able to shorten the interval to the birth of their next infant. Females who had more experience in caretaking and carrying infants as juveniles were more likely to rear their first live-born infant successfully. Allomothering by juvenile females was preferentially directed toward their infant siblings and toward the infants of the highest-ranking mothers.

TI THE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROLONGED COPULATIONS OF THE DAMSELFLY,
   ISCHNURA-GRAELLSII (ODONATA, COENAGRIONIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Copulation in the damselfly Ischnura graellsii lasted 1-5 h, and took place in the afternoon and evening at the study site in north-west Spain. Copula duration was measured in the laboratory under controlled temperature, humidity, photoperiod and density. At high density (15-20 males/insectary), copulations that started early in the day were always long, while at low density (two males/insectary) they could be short or long. At both densities, copulations with previously mated females were  longer than with unmated females. The duration of stage II of copulation, when the male transfers sperm to the female, was constant and independent of density and time of day. A study of egg production in females mated only once indicated that copula duration is not correlated with the proportion of fertile eggs laid, and that females start running out of sperm after about 15 days. These results indicate that prolonged copulations of I. graellsii have a guarding function, but the existence of more sperm displacement in long copulations cannot be rejected. Guarding takes place during stage I of copulation, before the males invest sperm in the female, which is unusual. The relation between copula duration and postcopulatory behaviour in Ischnura species so far studied is discussed.

TI ESCALATED DAMSELFLY TERRITORIAL CONTESTS ARE ENERGETIC WARS OF ATTRITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Thirteen pairs of neighbouring Calopteryx maculata (Odonata: Calopterygidae) males were manipulated such that members of each pair became residents in the same territory, thereby removing the normal resident-intruder asymmetry and permitting direct analysis of the physical and energetic factors affecting the outcomes of the prolonged, escalated contests that resulted. Energy reserves (fat remaining at the end of contests) were more often correlated with winning these contests than size or physical attributes related to flight ability. This pattern was also true for 11 natural contests in which persistent intruders displaced residents. Fat content varied with age, being lowest in immature (teneral) and older males, and highest in young males first appearing at the water. Our results indicate that escalated territorial contents in C. maculata favour males with the greatest energy reserves. High fat content in some males, especially young ones, may allow them to overcome the normal resident-intruder asymmetry and displace established territory residents. Since males rarely feed while at their territories and since territories are important for obtaining and protecting mates, energy reserves may be crucial to reproductive success and escalated flights may be especially costly.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF THE QUEEN, COLONY SIZE AND WORKER OVARIAN DEVELOPMENT
   ON NESTMATE RECOGNITION IN THE ANT RHYTIDOPONERA-CONFUSA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Colonies of the ant Rhytidoponera confusa commonly occur naturally both with (queenright) and without queens. (Queenless colonies contain reproductive workers). Both queenright and queenless colonies showed highly significant kin discrimination ability. Furthermore, 10 assays from four different experimental designs all showed no significant difference in discrimination ability between the two colony types. Aggressiveness and discrimination ability were not correlated with colony size in nine of the 10 assays. The tenth assay showed a significant positive correlation. Aggression towards nestmates maintained with individual alien conspecific queens for 4-7 weeks was no different from that towards nestmate controls but was significantly less than aggression towards non-nestmates. These results suggest that the queen is not the major source of the colony odour in this species. Aggression between reunited queenright and queenless fragments of the same colony in R. confusa is directed towards those nestmates in the queenless fragment with especially well-developed ovaries. Hence ovarian development probably explains such aggression better than interpretations by other researchers that the aggression is evidence for the queen producing the colony odour.

TI COMPARATIVE MORPHOLOGY AND MATE COMPETITION OF FLIGHTLESS MALE FIG WASPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The evolution of extreme and disparate male morphology in fig wasps was investigated by reference to differences in mate competition. Five morphological types were distinguished amongst the flightless males collected in Malaysia. Data are presented on three fig wasp species: Ceratosolen solmsi (Agaonidae, Blastophaginae), Apocrypta bakeri (Torymidae) and Philotrypesis pilosa (Torymidae). The three species are commonly found within the same fig receptacles but the males of each species  have very different morphologies. The long, narrow, tubular males of A. bakeri occur at an intermediate density and are adept at finding mates which are located in the deeper recesses of the fig receptacle; the soldier males of P. pilosa also occur at an intermediate density and aggressively defend recently mated females who are distributed more evenly within the fig receptacle; and the males of C. solmsi, which are found at high density, and which are not obviously modified for fighting  or rapid locomotion, have evolved morphology to counter intense sperm competition. It is suggested that intense sperm competition is a common feature of fig wasps in the family Agaonidae as a consequence of the high density of males and the enclosed female population, and that it accounts for the lack of aggression that is characteristic of members of the family.

   GRASSHOPPER SCHISTOCERCA-AMERICANA (DRURY) (ORTHOPTERA, ACRIDIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individuals of the polyphagous grasshopper Schistocerca americana ate less of a novel plant food when the first meal on the food was followed by an injection of one of four plant secondary compounds or lithium chloride. Tests with a control group of insects indicated that this reduction in consumption was not due to direct non-associated effects of injected compounds on acceptability of the food. The learned association of the food with the effects of an injected compound was retained for at  least 2 days but not 4. Insects learned to associate the novel foods spinach and onion with aversive stimuli, but did not learn to eat less blackberry, which appeared to be the most palatable of the foods on first contact.

TI GRADED AGGRESSIVE SIGNALS IN BLANCHARD CRICKET FROG - VOCAL RESPONSES TO
   OPPONENT PROXIMITY AND SIZE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Blanchard''s cricket frog, Acris crepitans blanchardi, possesses a complex communication system showing extensive variation within and among individual males. Potential social determinants of variation in male calling behaviour were experimentally examined through playback experiments of synthetic advertisement calls. Specifically, the following were investigated: (1) how male calling behaviour changes in response to the presence of an intruding caller; (2) how calling behaviour varies with  intruder proximity; and (3) how calling behaviour varies with absolute and relative intruder size. Aggressive calling is defined as the type of signal produced during wrestling contests over calling sites. Nearly all aspects of male calling behaviour varied continuously with playback sound pressure level, becoming progressively more aggressive as sound pressure level increased, that is, as the the simulated intruder drew nearer. Male calling behaviour therefore appeared to be graded in response  to intruder distance, increasing in aggressiveness with decreasing distance. Males responded more aggressively to playbacks of low frequency calls (simulating a large intruder) than to playbacks of high frequency calls (simulating a small intruder). However, vocal responses did not vary with male size or size relative to that of the simulated intruder. Vocal escalation independent of a male''s absolute and relative size may be a consequence of ambiguity about relative strength, or it may be a  mechanism through which males attempt to conceal their relative strength from opponents.

TI PROLONGED COPULATION AS A POST-INSEMINATION GUARDING TACTIC IN A
   NATURAL-POPULATION OF THE RAGWORT SEED BUG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Females of the ragwort seed bug, Neacoryphus bicrucis Say, mate and oviposit approximately daily in their natural habitat. The last male to mate a female fertilizes most of the eggs in the clutches laid afterward. Therefore, males may experience selection pressure to guard females from remating as a means of protecting the fertilization priority of their sperm. In both the laboratory and the field, the duration of copulation is correlated with the operational sex ratio, suggesting that males  prolong the duration of copulation as a post-insemination guarding tactic under conditions of intense competition for females.

TI DIFFERENTIAL PREDATION ON COLOR MORPHS OF THE MIDAS CICHLID,
   CICHLASOMA-CITRINELLUM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Predation has often been invoked as a selective agent affecting colour patterns in a wide range of organisms, but data relating susceptibility to predation and objective measures of conspicuousness are rare. To investigate relative crypticity in free-swimming fishes, two colour morphs of the Midas cichlid were exposed to predation by largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides. The two colour morphs, normal and amelanic golds, were viewed by predators in ponds against a uniform, natural background. Swimming pools, 4 m in diameter, were stocked with equal numbers of gold and normal juvenile Midas cichlids. Bass took a significantly higher proportion of normal-coloured fishes (69.2% of fish) than gold morphs overall, and in a significantly higher proportion of trials (68.8% of experiments). No differences were found between colour morphs in their behaviour or in the willingness of bass to attack either morph. The significance of these results are discussed in relation to the visual system of the predator and the relative conspicuousness of the prey colour patterns.

TI SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS OF DROSOPHILA COURTSHIP SONG RHYTHMS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Crossley (1988, Anim. Behav., 36, 1098-1109) and Ewing (1988, Anim. Behav., 36, 1091-1097), have criticized the use of non-linear regression in testing for song cycles in Drosophila courtship songs. In the present study a large body of data was reanalysed with appropriate time series analyses. The results confirm the original conclusions based on regression. Evidence suggests that the apparent discrepancies between our results may arise from: (1) the size of mating cell used by Ewing (1988) to record songs; (2) the way the song traces are interpreted; (3) the way mean inter-pulse intervals are assessed, especially when there are missing data points; and (4) the method used to assign statistical significance.

TI FORAGING IN A PATCHY ENVIRONMENT - PREY-ENCOUNTER RATE AND RESIDENCE
   TIME DISTRIBUTIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Small bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, foraging among patches in the laboratory did not search systematically within a patch; their intercapture intervals did not differ from a model of random prey encounter within a patch. Patch-residence time, number of prey eaten, and giving-up time (time between last prey capture and leaving the patch) were measured for bluegills foraging in two different three-patch ''environments'' (a constant environment, in which each path began with the same  number of prey and a variable environment, in which two patches began with low prey density and one patch with high prey density). When compared with three decision rules a forager may use to determine when to leave a patch, the data most closely agreed with predictions from a ''constant residence time'' rule. Bluegills responded to changes in the distribution of prey among patches, but not by using different decision rules. There was qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with a model of  random residence times. The total number of prey eaten by a bluegill during a foraging bout was similar to the number predicted from a model of random search and random residence times.

TI SONG DISCRIMINATION-LEARNING IN ZEBRA FINCHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Young male and female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were tested for their ability to discriminate between the song of their father or tutor and that of another male in two types of preference test, one with a male whose song was dissimilar to that of the father or tutor and one with a male who sang a similar song, on removal from the father, at 4 months and at 6 months of age. Birds that were isolated from their father at 25 days (group A) did not show a preference for their father''s song whereas those isolated from the father at 35 days (groups B and C) learned to prefer their father''s song. In addition, group C, which were housed with tutor 1 from 35 to 70 days and with tutor 2 from 4 to 6 months of age, preferred their tutors'' songs to those of other males. If one compares the strength of preference in the two types of test, group B showed a weaker preference for the father in tests with the father and a similar male. Further, group C showed a weaker preference in the test with tutor 1 versus a similar male. The possibile influence of tutor, sibling and own song on the discrimination of the father''s song is discussed, and the results are compared with those for song performance learning. Finally, the mother birds preferred their mate''s song.

TI AN ANALYSIS OF THE COMMUNICATION FUNCTION OF ATTACK CALLS IN LITTLE
   GULLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The communication function of two different vocalizations, termed ''eeyit'' and ''whet'', made by little gulls, Larus minutus, to intruders near the nest was investigated by analysing the temporal relationship between these cells and covert attack (1) under natural circumstances and (2) in two experiments with intruder dummies. Eeyit was given prior to attack, whereas whet coincided with the attack itself. Whether or not eeyit was followed by attack depended on the reaction of the intruder to this call. Eeyit seems to carry the message ''I shall attack if provoked'', whereas whet seems to function primarily by impressing the attacked bird, and by distracting its attention during the attack. Given the existence of marked within-individual constancy of eeyit, it is argued that honest information about a bird''s attack motivation is transferred by this call in all situations.

TI AN OLFACTORY RECOGNITION SYSTEM IN THE FERRET MUSTELA-FURO L (CARNIVORA,
   MUSTELIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study demonstates that ferrets can use variations in odours from anal sac secretions as a communication system. Odour preference tests showed that ferrets can discriminate between male and female ferret anal sac odours, between strange and familiar, familiar and their own, and fresh and 1-day-old odours. They did not discriminate between fresh and 2-h-old odours, nor did male ferrets discriminate between the odours of oestrous and anoestrous females. Ferrets were more attracted to the odours of the opposite sex than to those of their own sex. When faced by an opponent, male ferrets were more aggressive in the presence of their own rather than their opponent''s odour, and less aggressive with their opponent''s odour than with that of a known, dominant animal''s odour. These results are consistent with both a sex attraction role and a territorial defence role for anal sac odours. A scent-matching mechanism for territoral defence is supported, although a neighbour-neighbour recognition/avoidance mechanism cannot be rejected. Gas chromatography revealed sexually and individually distinct profiles of volatile compounds in anal sac extracts, but no consistent seasonal trends. Females had high concentrations of 2,3-dimethylthietane and/or 3,4-dimethyl-1,2-dithiolane. Males usually had high concentrations of indole. 3-Propylthietane was an important constituent in most individuals. These differences in concentration were significant and could provide an olfactory recognition system of sex and individual identity.

TI ANALYSIS OF THE MATING SYSTEM OF THE FIDDLER-CRAB, UCA-LACTEA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Claw-waving male Uca lactea sometimes attracted wandering females into their burrows for underground mating, but more often mated with nearby resident females on the surface. Female U. lactea mated at all stages of reproduction and experienced one or more copulations on the surface before wandering. Thus wandering females had sufficient spermatozoa to fertilize their eggs before copulating in a male''s burrow. After refusing to mate with neighbouring or burrow-less males, females were displaced from their burrows by the males. Displacement by males was a major cause of female wandering. Females did not leave their burrows in order to copulate, as do American fiddlers; rather, some mating occurred as an indirect result of wandering. Females who were not displaced by males ovulated and incubated clutches in their own burrows. Thus, although courting by waving a claw to attract a female into the male''s burrow is preserved in this species, the surface mating system of the  Indo-Pacific subgenera is also employed. The sperm of the last male to mate with a female prior to egg extrusion is most probably used to fertilize the eggs. Thus a male that entices a female into his burrow gains a reproductive advantage.

TI CALL SITE SELECTION IN A HYBRID POPULATION OF TREEFROGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Call site selection in the treefrogs Hyla cinerea and Hyla gratiosa has been regarded as an important behavioural mechanism in maintaining reproductive isolation. Its probable genetic basis was evaluated in a hybrid popualtion near Auburn, Alabama [USA]. Allozymically-defined parental and hybrid classes exhibited distinct call site preferences. The pure parental categories demonstrated expected site differences: 41 H. gratiosa called from the ponds proper, whereas 92 H. cinerea called out of the water. Eighteen out of 19 F1 hybrids selected intermediate call sites along the shoreline. Preferred call sites of backcross individuals were generally comparable to those of their respective parental species. Observed site specificities in these various genetic classes demonstrate a heritable component in site-selection behaviour.

TI SPATIAL-LEARNING IN THE NECTARIVOROUS BANANAQUIT - JUVENILES VERSUS
   ADULTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Both theory and previous studies suggest that nectarivores should learn to visit a flower in a new location more easily than to return to a flower in a position just visited. To test this hypothesis, both naive hand-reared juvenile and experienced adult bananaquits, Coereba flaveola were studied. Experimental results with experienced adults supported the hypothesis. Adults learned very quickly to switch to flowers in different locations (win-shift), but had difficulty learning to return to flowers in a position just visited (win-stay). However, naive juveniles learned win-shift and win-stay problems with equal facility. These results support the hypothesis, but suggest that bananaquits do not have a predetermined tendency to shift locations of flower visits. It suggests instead that their win-shift bias is a result of their previous experience.

TI BI-PARENTAL CARE IN WILLOW PTARMIGAN - A LUXURY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus, usually pair monogamously and both parents invest considerable time and energy in the care of offspring. However, the species is occasionally polygynous (5-9%), and in these cases only the females care for offspring. To examine the consequences of uni-parental care for the production of offspring and the body condition of mates, either the male or the female parent was removed at the onset of incubation and at hatch. Natural removals were also observed. Lone  hen willow ptarmigan (widows) defended eggs and incubated clutches successfully, whereas single parent males (widowers) did not. After hatch, widows (mates removed either at the onset of incubation or at hatch) and pairs raised equivalent numbers of chicks to fledging, but widowers (mate removed at hatch) were less successful. There were no differences between parental types in numbers of offspring returning in a subsequent season or in the mating status of offspring in the first year of  return. Widows and paired hens had similar rates of survival during the breeding season, and, in subsequent years, similar return rates and mate fidelity. Willow ptarmigan, after the onset of incubation, provided more parental care than is required to produce offspring and maintain survival and body condition of their mates. Thus, these hypotheses can be eliminated as probable factors maintaining monogamy for willow ptarmigan at this site during 1981-1984. Bi-parental care in willow ptarmigan  may have developed as a salvage strategy for males as a consequence of their remaining throughout incubation to guard their mates and capitalize on the potential to re-nest.

TI MALE SIZE AND MATING SUCCESS IN DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER - THE ROLES OF
   MALE AND FEMALE BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Larger D. melanogaster males delivered more courtship to virgin females, produced more courtship song and sang more loudly than smaller males. They also moved around more when not courting. All courtships were terminated by the female decamping or while she was moving. Females decamped equally often when courted by large and small males but were more likely to be moving while courted by large males, and this appeared to be a consequence of the faster running and courtship tracking speeds of  larger males. The results suggest that scramble competition between males to deliver courtship is important in determining mating success, but not that females discriminate between males of different sizes. However, the higher audibility of louder sounds to females and their tendency to move while courted both have the effect of favouring larger males.

TI PARENTAL MANIPULATION OF OPTIMAL HATCH ASYNCHRONY IN CATTLE EGRETS - AN
   EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To examine the effects of asynchronous hatching on parental fitness, cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis, chicks were exchanged between nests to create broods with no hatching intervals, normal 1.5-day intervals (two control treatments), and doubled (3-day) intervals. Relative to controls, Synchronous Experimental broods fought longer and more often. Their parents were solicited more vigorously and provided more food to their chicks, but did not produce more surviving offspring. By contrast, Asynchronous Experimental broods had the highest rate of brood reduction, apparently because of the exaggerated competitive disparities among siblings, though fighting rates were low. A composite index indicated that these manipulations of normal hatch asynchrony lowered parental efficiency by 24-45%. These results are consistent with the ''sibling rivalry reduction hypothesis'' for the evolution of hatch asynchrony, wherein parents are predicted to create sufficient inequities among offspring to  allow the formation of a stable feeding hierarchy (and the potential for efficient brood reduction) without wasting offspring energy unnecessarily on sibling rivalry.

TI BEHAVIOR AND FECUNDITY OF FEMALE RATS MATED WITH PREFERRED OR
   NONPREFERRED MALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sexually experienced female rats were allowed to choose between two inaccessible males. Approximately half of the female developed a consistent preference, and the most ''discriminating'' females were mated with either their preferred on their non-preferred male. Female without a decided preference were mated with one of the two males randomly selected by the experimenter. The pairs of discriminating females and preferred males had higher levels of non-sexual contacts, solicitations and sexual activity than the pairs of discriminating female and non-preferred males. Specifically, the former pairings were characterized by higher levels of non-sexual contact and affiliative behavior (crawl over and under response) and solicitation responses (ear-wiggling and darting) by the female and shorter latencies for intromissions and ejaculations than the pairings with a non-preferred male. The pairs that included non-discriminating females behaved more like the pairs with a discriminating female and a preferred male than those with a discriminating female and a non-preferred male. Even so, the number of females delivering litters and the size of the litters did not differ between the different experimental pairings. These data suggest that a discriminating female rat is not conferred an obvious reproductive advantage over a less discriminating female.

TI HAMSTERS DEMAND FOR FOOD TO EAT AND HOARD AS A FUNCTION OF DEPRIVATION
   AND COST
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Unlike many other species, golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) do not compensate for a loss in weight following a brief period of food deprivation: this may be due to their adapatation for a hoarding mode of life. We studied the interaction of hoarding with deprivation and a second challenge to body weight, increasing food costs. Hamsters earned all their food in operant chambers, in which they lived. The cost of food was varied by making it available on several different fixed ratio schedules. Regardless of whether the hoard was taken away each day (experiments 1 and 3) or left intact (experiments 2 and 4), food consumption was virtually constant as cost increased, but hoarding declined sharply. Hoarding was enhanced by a short deprivation period (experiment 3) especially when the subsequent cost of food was low (experiment 4). The results suggest that hamsters do indeed show compensatory behaviour following deprivation, or when the cost of foraging is high, but its form is different from that seen in non-hoarding species.

TI HOW CONSTANT IS THE CONSTANT OF RISK-AVERSION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB We describe an experiment designed to distinguish between two models of risk-sensitive feeding behaviour: the variance discounting model and the z-score model. The variance discounting model assumes that mean reward levels do not affect preferences over reward variability, but the z-score model assumes that mean reward levels do affect preferences over variability. We presented two choices to feeding rufous hummingbirds, Selaphorus rufus. One alternative had a higher mean and a higher variance than the other. After measuring preference, we increased the mean of both alternatives by adding the same amount to all possible outcomes. The variance discounting model predicts that such a general shift should not change preferences, but the z-score model predicts that preferences will change. Our reuslts support the z-score model. The variance discounting model''s assumption of constant risk-aversion fails.

TI SPATIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN MARES AND FOALS OF THE WELSH PONY
   (EQUUS-CABALLUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Welsh pony mares and foals (Equus caballus) were usually found to be within 1 or 5 m of each other during the first week of the foal''s life and gradually spent more time at greater distances as the foals became older. There was an overall levelling of the trend during the 9th-15th weeks of life of the foal, followed by a second period of change during weeks 16-24. Through weeks 21-24, mares and foals spent at lest half of their time within 5 m of each other. Proximity was primarily due to  foal activity except during foal recumbency. During the first 8 weeks of the foal''s life, a mare remained close by when it was recumbent, either by grazing in a circle around it or by standing upright beside it. Mares and foals were most likely to be close together when they were resting upright with the other ponies in the herd and most likely to be far apart when the foal was playing. Similarities in patterns of spatial relationship between the foals of a given mare were demonstrated. There was no difference between colts and fillies in the development of independence.

TI THE FUNCTION OF DISTRESS CALLS GIVEN BY TUFTED TITMICE (PARUS-BICOLOR) -
   AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB I studied the response of tufted titmice (Parus bicolor) to distress-call playbacks to discern the function of distress calls given in a non-breeding context. At baited locations, titmice were presented with three different stimuli: (1) a hawk model, (2) a distress-call playback, and (3) a hawk model in association with a distress-call playback. The reactions of titmice to these stimuli were measured in terms of the number of titmice attracted to the stimuli, time spent by titmice in the area  around the stimuli, and the number of visits made by titmice to the area around the stimuli. Titmice approached closer to and spent more time near the source of the distress call when the call was not associated with a hawk model than when a hawk model was present. In either case, the approach of titmice was slow and cautious. Exposure to a hawk model in the absence of a distress-call playback caused titmice either to mob the model or ignore it. Titmice recognized the hawk model more often when it was associated with a distress-call playback than when it was presented alone. These observations are in accordance with predictions of the hypothesis that distress calls warn other birds of danger. Conversely, many observations contradicted the hypothesis that distress calls are calls for help.

TI TERRITORIAL INTRUSIONS BY PIKAS (OCHOTONA-PRINCEPS) AS A FUNCTION OF
   OCCUPANT ACTIVITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pikas (Ochotono princeps) defend individual territories on talus. We tested the short-term stability of pika territories and found that although animals may intrude on the territories of conspecifics at any time, they were much more likely to do so if the occupant was inactive. Pikas usually waited until occupants were unavailable to defend their territory before intruding, apparently to avoid detection and repulsion by the occupant. Intruder avoidance of active occupants was most pronounced among same-sex dyads and non-nearest neighbours. Instances of territory intrusion were most frequent among nearest neighbour heterosexual dyads. Most cases of intrusion appeared to be related to eventual relocation of territories, deterring settlement of unfamiliar conspecifics on nearby vacant territories, and/or increasing familiarity with nearest neighbours of the opposite sex.

TI SINGING BEHAVIOR IN RELATION TO POLYTERRITORIAL POLYGYNY IN THE WOOD
   WARBLER (PHYLLOSCOPUS-SIBILATRIX)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male wood warblers (Phyloscopus sibilatrix) decreased singing activity after pairing. A few days later they began to sing intensively again, but only in a secondary territory or in an outlying part of the primary territory. The long song characteristic of unpaired males was replaced by a short song after pairing. When singing at a distance from the nest, paired males changed to the long song. It is suggested that song in the wood warbler is important for female attraction and that the singing behaviour found in the studied wood warblers clearly indicates that all paired males tried to attract a second female.

TI A TEST OF INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION IN THE STOMATOPOD GONODACTYLUS-FESTAE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mantis shrimp G. festae lives in rock cavities which it must frequently defend against conspecifics. To determine if individual recognition is used to mediate these aggressive contents, adult intruders were matched sequentially against residents that were larger and smaller than themselves. Intruders were repulsed by large residents, but were able to evict small ones from their cavities. Later, each intruder was exposed once to a cavity containing the odor of the animal that defeated it and once to a cavity containing the odor of the animal it defeated. Intruders rapidly entered cavities containing the odor of the resident they defeated, but were hesitant to enter cavities containing the odor of the animal that had successfully defended against them. This demonstrates that G. festae can distinguish between the odors of 2 previously encountered opponents and suggests that this species is capable of individual recognition.

TI AN EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY OF THE FORAGING STRATEGY OF THE WOOD ANT
   FORMICA-AQUILONIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individual foragers return to a site at which food has been discovered. This site allegiance is maintained provided that the food source is maintained. It is not, a random search precedes discovery of an alternative source to which allegiance is transferred. Particular sites are located initially by the use of visual cues. However, such cues have a diminishing importance for orientation since, as the route becomes familiar, a spatial map is constructed from bearings of, and distances between, the major topographical features. Since ants individually learn the most economical route, this ability, together with site allegiance, results in the observed route fidelity. The foraging population established is variable and is related to the previous availability of food and consequent need of the colony. Environmental factors affect the amount of food collected and influence the size of the foraging population through the hunger of the colony. A variable colonial foraging response is dependent upon the tendency of individual nest-bound ants to forage when stimulated by an aroused replete ant returning from a successful foray. The availability of food, but apparently not its position, is communicated: recruited ants forage to remembered sites at which they have been rewarded.

TI ALTERNATIVE MATING STRATEGIES IN A DESERT GRASSHOPPER - EVIDENCE OF
   DENSITY-DEPENDENCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Field observations revealed that, on a given day, male mating behavior in a population of the grasshopper Ligurotettix coquilletti ranged from little or no stridulation (inactive) to relatively persistent singing (active signalling). Inactive males were usually located in the territories of active signallers. Actively signalling males achieved more matings, and also more frequently approached and mounted females in incidents terminating in the male departing the female without copulating.  Individuals switched between inactive and actively-signalling behavior during their adult lives, and males that were usually active signallers achieved greater lifetime mating success. Thus, we obtained no evident to support the hypothesis that variation in mating behavior was maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection. By comparing the behavior of males in two field plots maintained at different population densities, however, we found that high density was directly related to a  higher incidence of inactive behavior. Males perched on creosote (Larrea tridentata) bushes (their host plant), and certain bushes harboured numerous males. These aggregated males mated more often than single males on bushes. Mating behavior was independent of body size and, while young (< 7 days old) males tended to be inactive, neither age nor the time of adult maturation during the season could fully account for the incidence of inactive behavior among males. Instead, we suggest that the adoption of inactive behavior resulted partly from aggressive encounters between males.

TI TERRITORIAL DEFENSE OF SPACE AND FEEDING SITES BY A PLETHODONTID
   SALAMANDER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two series of experiments were conducted, one in field enclosures and another in the laboratory, to test the hypothesis that the salamander, Desmognathus monticola (family Plethodontidae) defends its refuges and feeding sites against conspecific intruders. When two identical cover sites were provided as refuges in the laboratory, residents and intruders occupied separate cover sites significantly mor often than the same sites. Residents did not, however, show strong preference for the same site, nor did they consistently defend a specific site. When food supplements were provided consistently at the same cover sites in field enclosures, resident D. monticola occupied and defneded the feeding sites significantly more frequently against intruders than the non-feeding cover sites. Individuals not receiving food supplements also excluded intruders from the occupied cover sites but did not defend a specific cover site. Residents in enclosures where no food supplements were provided  were significantly more active at night, outside cover sites, than residents receiving food supplements. Individual D. monticola exhibit territoriality by excluding intruders from the refuges they occupy. Providing food supplements increases the site specificity of individuals and decreases the amount of time spend in nocturnal activity.

TI SEED PREFERENCES BY DESERT RODENTS BASED ON LEVELS OF MOULDINESS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Large species of kangaroo rats (family Heteromyidae) make extensive underground caches of seeds. During collection and storage, seeds become inoculated with fungal spores, most of which are common pernicious storage molds in human agriculture systems. The molds and their metabolites may be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the species of mold and the growth conditions. Feeding experiments were conducted to determine the preferences for moldy seeds by Dipodomys spectabilis. Results showed that kangaroo rats prefer slightly moldy seeds over very moldy seeds, dry seeds, and unmoldy, imbibed seeds, apparently taking advantage of beneficial effects of molds while avoiding the liabilities.

TI COLOR OF THE UPPER MANDIBLE - AN ADAPTATION TO REDUCE REFLECTANCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Reflectance from the upper mandible of willow flycatchers (Empidonax traillii) was altered by painting the mandible with white nail polish. Sham-experimentals were painted with clear polish and controls were untouched. Light-billed flycatchers adjust to increased reflectance from light bills by foraging from shaded perches, a result similar to the frequent use of shade by naturally light-billed wood warblers (Emberizidae, Parulinae). When in sunlight, the proportion of commuting flights (give-up flights) was signficantly higher among white-billed flycatchers than among dark-billed conspecifies, suggesting a lower foraging success in sunlight for white-billed flycatchers. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that dark mandibular coloration is an adaptation to reduce visual interference.

TI WHY DOES THE HERRING GULL LAY 3 EGGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Food supplements placed daily beside the nests of herring gulls, L. argentatus, for the 1st 5 days after the 1st chick hatched produced improved weight gains over this initial period and higher fledging success, particularly in the 3rd chick. The fledging success of the fed group appears to be due to increased weight gain and not to increased parental protection in the supplemental period. Since there is indirect evidence that food is available this suggests that the parents are putting less  effort into foraging for their chicks than they are able to and less than is in the interests of the 3rd chick in the 1st days after hatching. On a separate colony 3 chicks in the brood for more than 5 days resulted in lower weight gains for the 2nd chick, but not the 1st. Fledging 3 chicks rather than 1 or 2 may greatly increase the parents'' reproductive effort and consequently the 3rd egg is primarily insurance against the loss of the 1st or 2nd.

TI LARGEMOUTH BASS (MICROPTERUS-SALMOIDES) LEARN TO AVOID FEEDING ON TOAD
   (BUFO) TADPOLES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), when starved for 1 day, almost totally abstain from eating toad (Bufo americanus and B. woodhousei) tadpoles. However, there is a positive relationship between bass hunger levels and the acceptability of Bufo larvae as food items. With experience, there is a decrease in the number of toad tadpoles engulfed (taken into the mouth), and that actually consumed by the bass, while the number of larvae expelled (spat out) increases. Bass strongly prefer  Hyla crucifer tadpoles to B. americanus larvae, and learn to distinguish between the 2 species. These results agree with the hypothesis that the schooling behavior found in B. americanus tadpoles functions, at least in part, as a deterrent to predation.

TI COMPETITIVE RESOURCE SHARING - AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST OF A LEARNING RULE
   FOR ESSS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) distributed themselves between 2 simulated drift food patches in the ratio of patch profitabilities (Milinski 1979). The rule with which each fish decides to stay in one or the other patch was investigated, as well as whether the fish have more difficulties in reaching a decision when the prey is supplied irregularly as is the case under natural conditions. With frame by frame analysis of filmed experiments the hunting success and sampling effort of each individual fish could be determined continuously. The results support the hypothesis that the fish used the relative payoff sum (RPS) learning rule (Harley 1981; Regelmann 1984). All decisions of individual fish during a trial, whether to stay or leave a patch, correlated closely with decisions predicted by the RPS learning rule using the actual experience of the fish. Differences in competitive ability between the fish influenced the dynamics of the distribution in the predicted way, the more successful competitors deciding earlier where to stay than the less successful ones. This had the effect that the good competitors as well as the poor ones were distributed between the patches in the ratio of patch profitabilities. It is also compatible with the RPS learning rule that the fish reached their decision as quickly whether they were supplied with prey regularly or irregularly.

TI STEREOTYPED BEHAVIOR, ADJUNCTIVE DRINKING AND THE FEEDING PERIODS OF
   TETHERED SOWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior of 25 tethered sows in an intensive piggery was observed for 1 h before and 1 h after the delivery of food to determine if behavioral stereotypies appeared as adjunctive behaviors. The different components of behavioral stereotypies had different associations with the feeding period. Head-waving, bar-biting and rubbing the snout against the cage were most common before feeding, and were shown particularly by the older sows. Manipulating the drinker and, for some sows, rubbing were most common after. There was some evidence of polydipsia. Vacuum chewing, playing with the chain and aggressive behaviors did not appear to be associated with the feeding period. The last 2 behaviors occurred only rarely. Seven sows showed stereotyped sequences of rapid rubbing or rapid drinking after the delivery of food, and these sows showed more excitement before food was delivered. Rooting was common for the full hour after all food had been consumed, and occurred in conjunction with long  duration drinking. The occurrence of adjunctive drinking by sows may result from the persistence of feeding motivation, perhaps because concentrated food does not provide sufficient stomach distension, combined wth the knowledge that food will definitely not be forthcoming. Stereotyped sequences of behavior may be a means of reducing the arousal generated by the expectation of food.

TI THE EFFECT OF LIGHT-INTENSITY ON PREDATOR AND PREY BEHAVIOR IN CYPRINID
   FISH - FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE PREY RISK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Light intensity has been hypothesized to play a major role in determining the timing and outcomes of predator-prey interactions in aquatic systems. Prey risk is often minimal in bright light and increases at low light levels. Four possible predator and prey behaviors that relate light intensity to predation rates were studied, using 2 spp. of cyprinid fish: Rhinichthys atratulus as prey and adult Semotilus atromaculatus as predators. The following 4 light-related behaviors were investigated: prey schooling behavior, predator activity patterns, detection of predators and evasive responses by prey, and the defensive use of structure in the habitat by prey. Prey risk is closely related to predatory activity; aggregating by prey and early detection of predators may play secondary roles.

A division of labor among L. longispinosus workers was demonstrated by investigating relationships among behaviors listed in the ethogram and among worker sizes. A matrix of transition probabilities between behaviors was constructed and inspected for non-random sequences of acts. Workers performed 4 roles and belonged to 3 behavioral castes. There was a significant relationship between a worker''s size and her behavioral caste. Polymorphism evidently underlies polyethism even in acutely monomorphic species.

TI FORAGING TACTICS OF A TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDER - COSTS OF TERRITORIAL
   DEFENSE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, established territories in laboratory chambers. Their foraging tactics, on 2 types of prey differing in caloric profitability and defense behavior, were observed under a series of experimental conditions in which competitive threat was increased: no competitor present, familiar conspecific''s pheromones present, unfamiliar conspecific''s pheromones present, familiar conspecific intruder present, and unfamiliar conspecific intruder present. As the degree of competitive threat increased, more time was devoted to territorial defense (displays and biting) at the expense of foraging. Simultaneously, the territorial residents gradually shifted from a specialized diet on the more profitable prey type to an indiscriminate diet, even though prey densities and the residents'' encounter rates with each prey did not change. The presence of unfamiliar pheromones and both intruders led to approximately a 50% decrease in the resident''s rates of net energy gain, about 80% of which was due to the time withdrawn from foraging and 20% due to change in diet. Changes in foraging time and diet both reflected the costs of territorial defense.

Brood-guarding males frequently deserted their mates and broods in the presence of a surplus of females. Female parents did not desert their mates, regardless of the sex ratio. Several other measures also indicated a reduced pair bond stability associated with a female surplus. The capacity of males to re-spawn at shorter intervals than females may account for  these results.

AB A new spider species, Schizocosa rovneri (Uetz and Dondale), and its sibling species, S. ocreata (Hentz), provide an example of how sexual communication fucntions as a species-isolating mechanism. Sexual communication by substratum-coupled stridulation is a critical factor in the reproductive isolation of these species. In laboratory pairings, males of both species court conspecific and heterospecific females indiscriminately. Females only respond receptively and copulate with conspecific males. A forced mating technique that employed anesthetized females tested for interfertility. Heterospecific pairings of female S. rovneri with male S. ocreata and female S. ocreata with male S. rovneri resulted in the production of egg sacs and offspring in each case. A series of experiments isolated the various components of sexual communication in S. rovneri. For the male, S. rovneri, olfactory and tactile cues from the female''s silk are sufficient to release courtship behavior. For the female S. rovneri, substratum-coupled sound production (stridulation of the male palps) is necessary and is by itself sufficient to induce receptive behavior.

AB Female choice was studied in a prolonged-breeding population of B. w. australis in central Arizona [USA] during the spring of 1981 and 1982. Field observations revealed that variation in call rate was significantly greater between males than within males and that male call rate was correlated with mating success. Male size was not significantly correlated with mating success, nor was positive assortative mating with respect to body size observed. Females did not discriminate between calls of large and small males in choice experiments. Males with high call rates were preferred, independent of size. For anurans, these results are the 1st to document clearly female choice based on male phenotype independent of male size. High call rate may be an indicator of male fitness in this female-choice system.

Juvenile lake char (S. namaycush) rarely show any indication of territoriality and have very low levels of agonistic behavior. The inheritance of behavior in their reciprocal hybrids was investigated by multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis. Lateral display, charge, chase and forage composed the 1st canonical axis (87.2% of total dispersion). Pooled hybrid means were closer to that of brook char, suggesting either directional dominance or modification of the behavior of hybrids in response to water flow. The mean values of reciprocal hybrids were skewed towards the maternal parent, suggesting a maternal effect in the phenotypic expression of behavior in these fish.

AB Laboratory studies determined that the defensive responses used by 2 agamid lizards, Agama savignyi and A. pallida, change as a function of body temperature. At high body temperatures, these lizards flee rapidly from predators. At lower body temperatures, which reduce sprint speed, the lizards rarely run but instead hold their ground and attack aggressively. This temperature-dependent switch in defensive behavior may have evolved because cold lizards that live in open habitats would have little chance of outrunning predators. Defensive behaviors of animals may in general be sensitive to physiological variables that influence locomotor performance.

TI SOCIAL RESPONSES TO VARIATION IN FOOD-SUPPLY AND NEST SUITABILITY IN
   ANTS (TAPINOMA-ERRATICUM)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The social organization of T. erraticum colonies was studied in 2 environmental contexts: mild starvation, and disturbance inducing a complete change of nest site. Trophallactic activity was compared with brood transport behavior in tests performed repeatedly on the same group of insects. Workers were individually marked, enabling interactions to be analyzed within the group. An age-dependent difference in behavior exists during feeding. When the colony changed its location, certain workers were transport specialists, while others remained inactive; thus the transport behavior of T. erraticum workers may not be age-dependent, unlike feeding behavior. A principal components analysis of the results indicated no link between these 2 types of activites at the individual level. Types of social organization may exist which are specific to each of the activities performed.

TI DEFERRED INDEPENDENCE AND PROLONGED INFANTILE BEHAVIOR IN YOUNG VARIED
   TITS, PARUS-VARIUS, OF AN ISLAND POPULATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In identical conditions under captivity, island fledglings of the varied tit, P. varius, showed begging behavior for .apprx. 3 times as long as did mainland fledglings. The begging posture and call were exaggerated in island fledglings. The exaggerated begging behavior and its long maintenance in island fledglings apparently contribute to the extended duration of post-fledgling parental care which was observed in the field. The prolongation of begging behavior and parental care in island varied tits probably evolved as a result of the low food availability which is expected from the smaller seasonal flush of food and the high population density of the birds.

TI INTRAGROUP BEHAVIORAL-CHANGES AND THE INITIATION OF SEX REVERSAL IN A
   CORAL-REEF FISH IN THE LABORATORY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations of the coral reef fish, A. squamipinnis (Peters), suggest that the behavioral control of female-to-male sex reversal is more complex than a simple dependence on the presence or absence of a male or on simple aspects of aggression or aggressive dominance. When the behavioral interactions of all group members of small, bisexual social groups of this fish were examined before and after male removal, 2 behavioral features were identified as possible factors controlling the initiation of sex change: the profile for behaviors received from, and the percentage of rushes given to other group members. Males and females each showed characteristic profiles both for behaviors given and for behaviors received. On the basis of the behavior-given profile, 2 types of female were identified. Both types were capable of changing sex following removal of the male. Two-4 wk were required by sex-reversing fish for the profiles for behavior given to change to a completely male form. After male removal, the remaining females began to treat the sex-reversing fish as though she were a male. To be treated as a male seems insufficient cause to initiate the behavioral and coloration changes of sex reversal in a female.

TI VOCAL RECOGNITION IN FREE-RANGING VERVET MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Screams of free-ranging juvenile vervet monkeys were played to a group which included their mothers and 2 control females who also had offspring in the group. Mothers and controls were separated from their offspring at the time. Mothers'' responses showed significantly shorter latency and longer duration than controls''; mothers were also significantly more likely to approach the speaker. Playbacks significantly increased the probability that controls would look at the mother; a majority of controls did so without any apparent cue from the mother. Adult female vervets can distinguish their offsprings'' screams from those of other immatures, and vervets may be able to associate specific screams with specific individuals, and these individuals with their mothers.

AB The development of isolation peeps (IP) was studied in 7 laboratory-reared squirrel monkeys (S. sciureus) over the age range of 1 day to 2 yr. IP were identified by specified criteria from the wide range of vocalizations recorded and analyzed by descriptive and statistical methods. Despite the presence of substantial maturational changes in IP, the data reveal individuality or vocal signature at all ages tested. The animals had developed by the end of the study unique and stable IP comparable to those recorded previously from wild-caught adults.

TI VISUAL MONITORING IN SOCIAL-GROUPS OF TALAPOIN MONKEYS
   (MIOPITHECUS-TALAPOIN)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Visual monitoring was recorded in 4 social groups of Talapoin monkeys. In single sex groups, low ranking individuals monitor other monkeys in the group more frequently than high ranking individuals. Levels of visual monitoring increase in mixed-sex groups with the dominant individuals paying proportionately more attention to the opposite sex and subordinates more attention to their own sex. If this is analyzed in relationship to the ongoing behavior, then animals receiving high levels of aggression show high levels of monitoring, and vice-versa for monkeys receiving low levels of aggression. Individuals receiving most attention are not necessarily the most aggressive, but are high ranking. Sexual behavior is the prerogative of dominant males and receive more monitoring from females than subordinates, while those females receiving sexual attention receive proportionately more of the dominant male''s monitoring than subordinate females.

   TO PLAYBACK OF SPECIES SONG AND SYMPATRIC SPECIES SONG, BEFORE AND AFTER
   PAIRING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Playback experiments with species song elicited strong levels of aggression from unpaired sedge warbler males in territory. After pairing, although a significant decrease in aggression was detected it was sufficient to maintain territory throughout the breeding season. As males ceased to sing upon pairing, it seems unlikely that habituation to song was responsible for the decrease in aggression. Experiments with sympatric reed warbler [A. scirpaceus] song confirmed the existence of interspecific aggression. In unpaired males the lower level of interspecific aggression was similar to that in paired males in response to species song. Interspecific aggression did not show a significant decrease after pairing, responses were much more variable and possibly related to the individual''s particular territorial situations both past and present.

AB An interspecific hierarchy of 8 spp. of southern California [USA] birds and mammals [Aphelocoma coerulescens, Amphispiza bilineata, Carpodacus mexicanus, Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus, Lophortyx gambelii, Spermophilus beecheyi, Sylvilagus audubonii] was observed at a seed bait station. Species ranking was basically determined by size, but between certain species the status of an individual interspecifically was also correlated with its ability to supplant, or be supplanted, intraspecifically. Interspecific dominance hierarchies can be quite complex, as reactions among individuals may depend on both intra- and interspecific factors. Assessment of species'' niche-breadth may be complicated by differential responses of conspecifics with individuals of other species.

TI COMPENSATORY RESPONSES OF GOAT MOTHERS TO THEIR IMPARIRED YOUNG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB The behavior of a mother goat towards her young normally compensates for differences between them in their vigor at birth. Weakening the first-born with drugs [ketamine hydrochloride] still does not prevent its getting equal access to the udder, though weakening the second-born may render it so much less vigorous that maternal compensation does fail. When the mother is unable to distinguish her kids by sight or smell, she is unable to modulate her responses to the kids and then the more vigorous kid always establishes priority of access to the udder. This may be what normally occurs under harsh environmental conditions where the mother''s milk supply is occasionally inadequate for 2 kids.

TI FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION OF BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Tinbergen on the subject of the hierarchical organization of behavior noted that the variability and plasticity of behavior (even of the behavior which at that time was called instinctive) seemed a major obstacle to mechanistically oriented explanations. Lorenz had tried to solve the problem offered by the variability of ''instinctive behavior'' by restricting the concept to the relatively simple stereotyped, and species-specific units which he called ''instinctive activities'', or ''Erbkoordinationen'' in German, and for which in English the names ''fixed motor pattern'' or ''modal action pattern'' are commonly used. For an understanding of the machinery of behavior as far down as the physiological and even molecular levels, the analysis of the functional organization of behavior is as important as the study by physiological methods of the nervous and endocrine mechanisms. The example of the reproductive behavior of the digger wasp Ammophila pubescens is given. Through system analysis of complex behavior insight shall be gained into the software underlying the programs which the physiological machinery can achieve. The hierarchy-hypothesis and its derivatives should be seen as steps on this way, always open to improvement. The systems and sub-systems postulated after analysis of complex behavior sequences can best be defined as control-systems of different orders fulfilling special tasks or sub-tasks in the context of the hierarchical organization. What aspects of behavior (motor and sensory) they control and in which way, and what kind of physiological mechanisms are involved, is likely to be different for each system. With this fragmentary presentation of the history of the hierarchy-hypothesis and of its possible usages for understanding the behavior of species and of individuals, stress was laid on the importance of 1 of Tinbergen''s main contribution to ethology.

TI ANEMOTAXIS AND ODOR-TRAIL FOLLOWING BY TERRESTRIAL SNAIL HELIX-ASPERSA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Terrestrial snails H. aspersa that were exposed to moving air containing a relatively uniform concentration of host-plant [lettuce] utilized an anemotactic response and oriented upwind toward the odor source. Also, the snails were able to follow a well-defined trail of host-plant odor via olfactory cues in the absence of directional cues from air movement. In the natural environment, these anemotactic and odor-trail-following mechanisms may operate either independently or in combination to enable location of a host plant.

TI RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTI-PREDATOR BEHAVIOR AND AGGRESSION AMONG
   CONSPECIFICS IN 3-SPINED STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The response of individual breeding three-spined sticklebacks to territorial intruders of various species was compared with their response to a predator outside the breeding season. The nature of the territorial response to the different intruders, as revealed by factor analysis, was very similar and the level of aggression shown to the different species co-varied across individuals and during each breeding cycle. The level of territorial of the individual fish was positively correlated with their boldness towards a predator. These results provide tentative support for the idea that anti-predator behavior and aggression towards conspecifics are linked in this species. Supporting evidence for and possible adaptive significance of these results are discussed.

TI SOCIAL AND TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR OF LABORATORY MICE (MUS-MUSCULUS L) IN
   SMALL COMPLEX AREAS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hierarchically organized colonies of 5 male M. musculus of strain LACA/CFW were transferred to complex arenas of 1.3, 2.6, 3.8 or 5.2 m2. Mice in the 1.3 m2 areas subsequently had their living space increased by removal of a partition of 2.6, 3.8 or 5.2 m2. Changes in dominance occurred in 8 out of 13 of the colonies; the dominant mouse occupied the majority of the floor area, but some subordinates formed small territories. The number of territories held by subordinates was greater in the larger areas. In colonies in which the living area was expanded, however, there was no increase in the number of territories formed.

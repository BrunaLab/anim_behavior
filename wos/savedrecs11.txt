AB Promiscuous and repeated mountings by females are evolutionarily intriguing as females are expected to be choosy and matings are expected to be costly. We evaluate the evolutionary basis of these behaviours in a high-density population of European badgers. We analysed postpartum mounting behaviour, in 3 years, at two neighbouring social groups each year. We demonstrate a polygynandrous social mating system, with repeated mounting. Mounting was skewed among females in four social-group-years, but overall did not differ from random, potentially because female reproductive success is context dependent, varying with local food availability and female-female competition. Some males mounted more than others; however, male mounting frequency was not related to dominance rank, self-grooming rate, or body condition index. Mounting frequency did not predict paternity success; furthermore, a 16-year genetic data set showed that paternity success was positively correlated with body condition index. Females may therefore mount with males that do not father their offspring to minimize the risk of infanticide from them. Females may also trade mountings for allogrooming from males, but mounting frequency did not vary with relatedness, aggression received from males or sequential allomarking by males. We conclude that promiscuous and repeated mounting in badgers may have evolved to reduce male-male aggression around mounting and the likelihood of infanticide from males by masking paternity. Promiscuous mounting of female badgers does not devalue the previous male's sperm, but may promote sperm competition, genetic diversity and genetic compatibility.

AB Consistent individual differences in behaviour have now been documented in a broad range of organisms over a variety of contexts. However, individual differences in social contexts have received less attention. We explored the consistency and temporal persistence of individual differences in tactic use in a producer-scrounger foraging game using two sets of flocks of wild-caught nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata. With both sets of birds, we observed significant individual differences in tactic use that persisted under different food distributions and when flock members were reunited at a 6-month interval with the same flockmates but not when flock members were different. In another experiment, in which birds with high-scrounging profiles were made to forage in the same flock, the corporate frequency of scrounging was no higher, and the intake rate no lower than in flocks made up of intermediate- or low-frequency scroungers. Taken together our experiments suggest that persistent individual differences can arise from dynamics that are peculiar to the group in which they occur, underlining the importance of companions' identity in determining tactic use in this game. Behavioural plasticity can erase idiosyncratic individual differences in games with frequency-dependent payoffs when group composition changes.

AB In this paper we develop a simplified and experimentally tractable version of Andersson & Krebs's (1978, Animal Behaviour, 26, 707-711) classical model of caching behaviour. We conducted three experiments using captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, to test the predictions of this model. These experiments explored the effects of three theoretically important variables: availability time (T-a), handling time (h) and background foraging rate (gamma). In experiment 1, we tested the predicted effect of availability time, and we found that blue jays cached more food items when availability time was short. In experiment 2, we examined the interaction between availability time and handling time, and we found a significant effect of handling time (jays cached more when handling times were short), but no effect of availability time (apparently contradicting experiment 1). In experiment 3, we considered the predicted interaction between handling time and habitat richness (as represented by the background foraging rate). Experiment 3 revealed significant effects of both handling time and background, but no interaction between the two variables. We discuss the implications of these experiments for the further development of our model. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sexual selection research has always been a subject for debate. Much of the criticism has concerned the imposition of conventional sex roles based on an anthropomorphic view of animals imposed by the researcher. This conventional view may have hampered research, for example from acknowledging male mate choice. Sexual conflict theory is a fast-growing research field, which initially stems from sexual selection research. We investigated how the sexes are described in sexual conflict research and what characteristics they are assigned. We assessed these topics with literature studies of (1) the terminology used and (2) what parameters are incorporated in sexual conflict models. We found that males and females are consequently described with different words, which have different connotations regarding activity in the conflict. Furthermore, theoretical models mainly investigate conflict costs for females, although costs for both sexes are necessary for coevolutionary dynamics. We argue that sexual conflict research uses stereotypic characterizations of the sexes, where males are active and females reactive. Thus, previous discussions on the use of anthropomorphic terms in sexual selection seem not to have had any impact on sexual conflict research, which is why the topic of stereotyping the sexes is still of current importance. We suggest that scientific gains can be made by eliminating a sex-stereotyped perspective. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The strategy females use to sample potential mates can influence mate choice and thus sexual selection. We examined the mate sampling strategy of the cricket Gryllus lineaticeps. In our first set of experiments, we simultaneously presented three different chirp rates to females. The set consisted of three trials, each covering a different range of chirp rates. Independent of chirp rate range, female G. lineaticeps preferred rates that were above 3.0 chirps/s to rates that were below 3.0 chirps/s. Females did not discriminate among chirp rates that were below this threshold and did not discriminate among chirp rates that were above this threshold, suggesting that they express a fixed threshold sampling strategy. In our second experiment, females were presented sequentially with a fast chirp rate and then a slow chirp rate. When the interval between presentations was 20 min, females showed significantly weaker responses to the slow rate than to the fast rate. However, when the interval between presentations was 24 h, female responses to the slow and fast rate did not significantly differ. The latter result suggests that females lower their threshold of acceptance when they have not recently experienced highly attractive song types. This lower acceptance threshold is probably adaptive, as it would allow females to avoid paying high search costs, and to reproduce, only when low-quality males are available. Our results are consistent with a rarely considered sampling strategy ( fixed threshold with last chance option strategy) and highlights the importance of the timing of social experience for mate sampling.

AB Variation in maternal behaviour can have profound consequences on offspring phenotype, survival, reproductive success, as well as maternal fitness. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie variation in maternal care can provide us with a more thorough understanding of the evolution of parental care. In some taxa, the effects of steroid hormones such as testosterone on paternal care have been well studied. However, patterns of female androgens in natural populations are rarely documented and relationships between maternal androgens and behaviour remain poorly studied. In this study, we first validated an enzyme immunoassay to measure faecal androgen metabolites (FAM) in territorial North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus. We validated this assay by demonstrating that (1) our antibody reacts with testosterone metabolites, (2) reproductive females have significantly higher FAM than nonreproductive females, and (3) patterns of FAM were largely mirrored in plasma androgen levels. Second, we tested the hypothesis that androgen concentrations drive behavioural trade-offs in free-ranging breeding female red squirrels during gestation and lactation using 3 years of FAM data and 10 years of behavioural observations. FAM increased after conception and parturition, peaked during mid-lactation around the time of juvenile emergence, and then declined during the remainder of lactation and after weaning. Around the peak of FAM during mid-lactation, nest use was lowest, while territory defence and time spent foraging were at their highest levels. These associations between maternal androgens and behaviour support the hypothesis that androgens may play an important role in mediating maternal behaviour in free-ranging animals.

AB Mormon crickets, Anabrus simplex, form large migratory bands that march over rangeland in the western United States in search of nutrients. Immune defence is particularly relevant to survival in migratory bands, but little is known about the role of nutrition in insect immunity, particularly in nature. We hypothesized that immune defences are compromised in Mormon cricket bands because of nutrient limitations. Members of a migratory band in Nevada, U.S.A., preferred carbohydrate diets over proteins. After feeding on the carbohydrate diet, migratory velocity was less and the ability to encapsulate foreign particles and lyse bacteria was greater than for Mormon crickets consuming protein. Less locomotory demand for lipids may result in greater antibacterial activity. Total phenoloxidase (PO) activity also increased following feeding on carbohydrates, whereas spontaneously active PO was not different between the two diets. These results were very different from those of a band in Utah, U.S.A., that preferred the protein diet and that had enhanced spontaneous PO activity after protein supplementation. Haemolymph of Mormon crickets from the Nevada band was sampled 18 h after the diet treatments, whereas that from the Utah band was drawn 4 h after treatment. Either the difference in immune measures was due to the difference in sampling time, or spontaneous PO activity was protein-limited whereas encapsulation and antibacterial activity required carbohydrates. Currencies for the generalized immunity of insects may differ, and constraints on immunity in a given environment depend on which macronutrients are in short supply. 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The mating system of sciomyzoid flies is typified by vigorous premating struggles and a large male mating advantage. Females commonly exhibit three behaviours ( shaking, kicking and curling) during struggles. We tested the predictions of three hypotheses proposed to explain the evolution of female resistance in Coelopa frigida. Both shaking and curling were associated with reduced female mating rate and thus appear to be resistance traits. Mounts that ended while the female was curling appeared to be terminated by the male dismounting from the female rather than as a result of resistance. The communication hypothesis proposes that female resistance functions by signalling to the male that the female is unwilling to mate to encourage males to dismount them. Curling therefore seems to fit the predictions of the communication hypothesis. Shaking was associated with sexual selection for large male size and also males that could withstand resistance the longest. These observations fit with the predictions of both the female reluctance and screening hypotheses. Furthermore, shaking was associated with a pattern of mating that increased offspring fitness. This did not occur in females that did not shake. This corresponds with the predictions of the screening hypothesis that resistance generates indirect sexual selection. However, our results are also largely consistent with the female reluctance hypothesis. It appears that different resistance behaviours may have different functions, and furthermore that individual resistance behaviours might generate different mating rates and patterns of sexual selection between female karyotypes.

AB Although the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, has been a very important model system for the study of intrafamilial conflict and parental strategies, a detailed understanding of the variation in parental effort that can occur both within and between pairs is lacking. In part this is because many different methods have been used by individual studies to quantify parental care (i.e. nest visit rate, time in the nest and number of feeds per visit), but these have not directly been compared. We used nestbox cameras to monitor parental visit rate and the distribution of food among the nestlings in domestic, captive wild and wild free-living zebra finches. The percentage of nest visits by parents in which they fed the nestlings was consistent, with multiple feeds to different nestlings occurring within a single visit. The quantity of food delivered and its distribution among the nestlings, however, varied greatly both within and between broods. The number of regurgitations a brood received correlated significantly with the number of individual feeds when accounting for environment, but not with nest visit rate or the duration of time parents spent in the nestbox. In captive conditions, parents visited the nest at twice the rate of wild free-living birds, overall providing nestlings with twice the amount of food. Captive conditions also led to food distribution becoming less equitable among the brood, owing to changes in the number of regurgitations per individual feed and the number of overall feeds per nest visit.

AB The proximate causes triggering nest abandonment have important implications in the host-parasite arms race. Cowbird parasitism and rejection of parasitism are costly to some hosts; therefore, cues affecting their responses have important evolutionary implications. Experimental addition of a cowbird egg to the nest of a yellow warbler, a host that abandons nests parasitized by cowbirds via burial or desertion, elicited a rejection frequency similar to that of naturally laid cowbird eggs. Eggs experimentally added before sunrise (time of natural parasitism) were rejected at the same frequency as eggs added after sunrise; therefore, timing of parasitism did not influence rejection. Interaction with a robotic egg-removing cowbird increased the probability of abandonment, and the most aggressive individuals were likely to bury the model cowbird egg. Individual behaviours, therefore, were correlated across contexts. Host-parasite interactions and aggression are the two most important components in host defence. Future work should focus on the physiological aspects of individual variation, such as differences in hormone levels between individuals that accept and reject parasitized clutches.

AB Older males are often reported to have higher mating success than younger males. To the extent that male quality and survival are positively correlated, this observation raises the possibility that females use male signals to assess age and thus quality. I tested this hypothesis in the fall field cricket, Gryllus pennsylvanicus, a species in which females are known to prefer older males, and males call to attract females. Tests were both longitudinal (males recorded early and late in life) and cross-sectional (males recorded once, each at different ages). I measured a variety of temporal and spectral calling song parameters and tested the predictions that: 1) calling song changes with age, and 2) variation in calling song correlates with variation in age. I found significant changes with increased age: calls showed decreased pulse period, decreased pulse duration, decreased pulse peak frequency, more pulses per chirp and increased pulse period variability. Although pulse period and pulse duration were negatively correlated with male age in bivariate correlations, canonical correlation failed to detect any significant relationship between male age and any linear combination of song parameters. I also measured a number of male body size traits and found that the majority of information in male song appears to be related to body size. I discuss the results in relation to the auditory sensitivity of G. pennsylvanicus, and suggest a simple mechanism that explains both female preference for older males and female discrimination against heterospecific males.

AB In animals, behavioural properties such as aggressive propensity are often consistent over a life span, and they may form part of a behavioural syndrome. We studied how aggressive propensity influences dominance, contest behaviour and growth in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher. We tested whether intrinsic aggressive propensity (1) influences dominance in paired contests, (2) causes different aggression levels in contests with partners matched for aggressive propensity compared to unmatched partners, and how it (3) affects growth rate in groups that were either matched or unmatched for aggressive propensity. Intrinsic aggressive propensity was first scored with a mirror test and classified as high, medium or low. Thereafter we tested fish with either high or low aggressive propensity with partners matched for size and either matched or unmatched for aggressive type in a paired contest for a shelter. We scored dominance, aggression and submission. As predicted, (1) dominance was more clearly established in unmatched than in matched contests and (2) individuals with high aggressive propensity launched more attacks overall than fish with low intrinsic aggressiveness, suggesting a higher propensity to escalate independently of winning or losing the paired contest. However, contrary to expectation, (3) individuals with low aggressiveness grew faster than aggressive ones in unmatched groups, whereas the opposite occurred in matched groups. This suggests that individuals with low aggressive propensity may benefit from conflict evasion, which might allow them to gain dominance in the future owing to larger body size.

AB Cryptic species may seem identical to us, but not to each other. The Chrysoperla carnea group of green lacewings has species-specific substrate-borne duetting songs that maintain reproductive isolation among its cryptic species. We propose that sympatric species of the group will partition acoustic niche space so as to minimize mating mistakes. Sibling species pairs could therefore occupy abutting regions of acoustic space without hybridizing in nature. One species pair, Chrysoperla plorabunda and C. adamsi, are not only closest relatives, but are also the most acoustically similar among sympatric congeners. Using F-1 hybrids as a surrogate taxon occupying acoustic space between the parents, we tested the hypothesis that this space cannot support an additional species. Focusing on a critical song feature, volley period, we confirm firstly that the hybrid song occupies unfilled signal space between the parents. Secondly, we show that song discrimination is strong between parents, but weaker between parents and hybrids. Thirdly, each parent has the ability to respond to the other's signal in a narrow region of overlap. Finally, preference functions for hybrids broadly overlap those of parents. These acoustic tests confirm that a species of this intermediate song phenotype could not persist. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recognition of group members is of fundamental importance in social animals, allowing individuals to protect resources against intruders and parasites, as well as ensuring social cohesion within the group. In ants and other social insects, social recognition relies on multicomponent chemical signatures, composed primarily of long-chain cuticular hydrocarbons. These signatures are colony specific and allow discrimination between nestmates and non-nestmates. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying detection, perception and information processing of chemical signatures are poorly understood. It has been suggested that associative learning might play a role in nestmate recognition. We investigated whether Camponotus aethiops ants can associate a complete cuticular hydrocarbon profile, consisting of about 40 compounds, with a food reward and whether the new association, developed in an appetitive context, affects aggression against non-nestmates carrying the hydrocarbon profile associated with food. Individual ant workers were able to associate the non-nestmate chemical profile with food. However, conditioned ants were still aggressive when encountering a non-nestmate carrying the odour profile used as training odour in our experiments. This suggests that ants, like some, but not all other insects, show interactions between different modalities (i.e. olfactory and visual), and can treat complex chemical cues differently, according to the context in which they are perceived. This plasticity ensures that learning in an appetitive context does not interfere with the crucial task of colony defence. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The open-field test, which measures animal activity or distance covered by individuals subjected to a novel arena, is used frequently in behaviour studies. Studies generally report consistent individual differences in activity level in the open-field, but no study has tested whether individuals change their activity level differently within a single open-field test. If such differences exist, then the reliability of activity levels measured over the whole test may be affected by the duration of the test. Here, we present analyses showing how a reaction norm approach can be used to account for individual differences in temporal activity patterns. Specifically, we measured individual temporal patterns of activity in wild eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, and house mouse, Mus musculus, strains by decomposing the total duration of open-field tests into successive shorter time intervals. Open-field tests on chipmunks and mice lasted 3 min and 5 min, respectively. We detected repeatable individual and strain differences in temporal activity patterns. Activity during the first time interval (at the beginning of the test) was positively correlated with activity measured over the whole test, meaning that short tests yield a valid measure of activity in chipmunks and mice. We recommend analysing open-field data using random regressions to obtain activity measurements that are robust against differences in temporal activity patterns.

AB Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are unusual among primates in that they express their social position with a unique vocal signal, the pant-grunt. The call is only produced when encountering a higher-ranking group member and has thus been interpreted as a 'greeting' signal. We monitored the calling behaviour of nine adult females in a group of free-ranging chimpanzees, the Sonso community of Budongo Forest, Uganda, when encountering higher-ranking adult males. We found that call production was by no means rigid, but that calls were given only if certain social conditions were met. Although all adult males received pant-grunts from females, the alpha male received a significantly larger proportion of calls. The number of pant-grunts given to males was not correlated with their hierarchical position or with the level of anticipated aggression. Instead, females were significantly more likely to vocalize to other males if the alpha male was absent, suggesting that their calling behaviour was moderated by social inhibition. The presence of the alpha female had a similar yet weaker inhibitory effect. Social inhibition was further increased with increasing numbers of bystanders, especially males. Our results thus demonstrate that chimpanzees use their 'greeting' signals flexibly by taking into account the social fabric of their community.

AB The sharing of song types between males of the same local population is a common phenomenon in some songbird species. One presumed advantage of such sharing is that it enables 'song matching' (i.e. responding to an interactant with the song he just sang or another song of the interactant's repertoire). Song sharing probably arises through song learning, whereby males of some species prefer acquiring songs shared in the local population. However, such a preference may lead to uniformity of repertoires, devaluating the signal value of shared songs. Here we investigated repertoire composition in a local population of nightingales. More precisely, we analysed the number of song types shared by a given number of males and compared the finding with different simulated models of song acquisition. We found that proportions of both (songs shared by many males as well as songs sung by a single male only) were clearly more common than expected. We also simulated the cultural evolution of the population's repertoire. The results of these simulations supported our conclusion from the simulation of song acquisition that unshared songs arise through invention of novel song types or modification of existing ones, although we cannot rule out that unshared songs also appear through immigration of males. Our findings suggest that nightingales have a preference to acquire both shared song types, which enable matching the songs of opponents, and unshared or 'invented' new song types, which may help to avoid being matched by opponents.

AB Cuckoo bumblebees (subgenus Psithyrus) are social parasites in colonies of their host bumblebee species (Bombus). In spring, parasitic females awaken from hibernation and start searching for established host nests. Some Psithyrus species are specialized on one host species, whereas generalists parasitize several species. In previous investigations, nest-marking signals of the bumblebee hosts have been shown to play a role in host recognition and discrimination between host and nonhost. We performed behavioural experiments and comparative chemical analyses with the specialist Bombus (Psithyrus) vestalis and the generalist Bombus (Psithyrus) bohemicus to identify semiochemicals that the females use to recognize the common host, Bombus terrestris. In chemical analyses of footprint samples, we mainly identified nonpolar hydrocarbons and polar wax-type esters. Bioassays with nonpolar and polar fractions obtained by solid phase extraction indicate that specialized parasites use a complex bouquet of compounds for host recognition, whereas generalists need only selected substances common to the signals of all of their hosts. The evolutionary significance of the results is discussed. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sex role preferences in simultaneous hermaphrodites may vary with individual condition and partner quality across consecutive matings. Theoretical and empirical studies have highlighted an individual's body size and its relation with the partner's body size as potential factors that influence the preferred sex role. We studied effects of body size of focal individuals and partners on (1) mating frequency and mating interval, (2) courtship role and (3) number of sperm donated in successive copulations in the land snail Succinea putris where 'active' individuals mount the shell of their 'passive' partner before penises are intromitted reciprocally. We found body size-dependent differences in mating behaviour between small and large individuals: (1) smaller individuals of mating pairs were more likely to adopt the active role, (2) small individuals seemed to prefer inseminating larger partners, (3) a positive relation between body size and sperm number donated was found, (4) large individuals adjusted sperm number to their partner's body size, and (5) the smallest number of sperm was donated by large focal individuals to small partners. In addition, the number of sperm donated (1) increased with longer mating intervals and (2) decreased in later copulations indicating that the number of previous matings may affect male resource allocation. Our results support the view of models of sex role preferences, gender conflicts and solutions to gender conflicts that predict that the preferred sex role is variable within a species (e. g. size-dependent sex allocation models and the gender ratio hypothesis).

AB Male mating success is generally governed by either female choice or male-male competition and multiple cues may influence both processes. Anuran amphibians are best known for acoustic communication but visual cues have also been found to play a role. Little is known, however, about visual cues in explosively breeding anurans in which sexual selection is based almost exclusively on male-male competition. During their search for mates, males may not distinguish between the sexes or species and mismating attempts are known to occur. Assuming that mismatings are costly for males, one would expect selection to favour a trait that facilitates sex recognition. We determined the colour of the explosively breeding common frog, Rana temporaria, during reproduction by spectrophotometry. While reflectance of all body parts in both sexes decreased from immigration to spawning, reflectance of male throats increased significantly. The mean luminance of male throats was more than twice that of female throats. Male throats contrasted most against male flanks with luminance contrast being significantly higher than chromatic contrast. In an experiment with individually marked frogs, throat luminance was not correlated with male size, body condition or the physical presence of females, whereas temperature showed a significantly positive effect. Our results give no hint that throats indicate male status or indicate male quality. Considering the high densities during breeding, our results suggest that bright male throats can act as a visual signal among males to facilitate gender recognition and avoid attacks by other males.

AB Research on behavioural syndromes (consistent individual differences in suites of correlated behaviours) requires formal statistical methods to describe and compare syndrome structures. We detail the shortcomings of current methods aimed at describing variation in behavioural syndromes, such as multiple pairwise correlations and principal components analysis (PCA). In their place we propose an alternative statistical framework involving: (1) calculation of trait variance-covariance and correlation matrices within each data set; (2) statistical evaluation of specific hypotheses regarding how behaviours covary within a behavioural syndrome; and (3) statistical comparison of behavioural covariances across data sets using structural equation modelling (SEM). Given their unfamiliarity to most behavioural ecologists, we illustrate these methods using an already published data set for two groups of populations of three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, living in ponds with and without fish predators. Previous analyses suggested a lack of behavioural syndrome structure for stickleback that lived in the absence of fish predators. However, by evaluating a priori hypotheses of how behaviours might covary using SEM, we were able to demonstrate that the two types of populations differed specifically in covariance patterns for aggression, exploration of novel food sources and altered environments, but not for exploration of novel environments and activity. Such detailed inferences cannot readily be made based on conventional statistical approaches alone, and so the methods we outline here should become standard in studies concerning the evolution of behavioural syndromes within and between populations.

AB It is widely established that social alarm signals trigger learning about discrete stimuli present at the same time. Such learning facilitates, for example, acquisition of responses to novel predators and has the functional advantage that individuals avoid exposing themselves to a potentially risky situation. Avoidance of potential danger might equally apply to learning about risky places, but would require social alarm signals to trigger learning about contextual cues, rather than discrete stimuli. Here, we tested this hypothesis by analysing the behaviour of experimental observer Indian mynahs, Acridotheres tristis, both before and after they had watched demonstrator mynahs showing alarm behaviour at a foraging site where observers were accustomed to feeding. To isolate changes specifically attributable to the behaviour of demonstrators, we compared this group's post-training behaviour with that of a control group, which watched social companions foraging at the feeding site. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence that experimental observers became more wary of the feeding site after observational training relative to control observers, suggesting that social alarm signals do not trigger learning about the location in which an alarmed individual is observed. In light of previous work in our laboratory showing that Indian mynahs become more wary in a place in which they have observed a predator attack on a social companion, we suggest that social learning about places may require observation of both social alarm and its cause.

AB Resource distribution is fundamental to social organization, but it poses a dilemma. How to facilitate the spread of useful resources but restrict harmful substances? This dilemma reaches a zenith in famine relief. Survival depends on distributing food fast but that could increase vulnerability to poisons. We tested how Temnothorax albipennis ants solve this dilemma in the distribution of honey solution after 48 h of starvation in four colonies with individually marked workers. We constructed the complete network of liquid food transmission (trophallaxis) between individuals. Within the first 30 min of famine relief, 95% of the workers received food and the distribution rate was an order of magnitude faster compared to the controls. We tested the assumptions of a simple analytical model that best fitted our data. Good mixing during famine relief was facilitated by the movement of internal workers away from the brood pile and the movement of foragers with food away from the nest entrance. This is intriguing because T. albipennis workers have spatial fidelity zones and in the controls internal and external workers were segregated. We discovered that colony vulnerability to poisons during famine relief might be mitigated by: (1) the dilution of food from the same source through mixing, (2) the concentration of food in workers positioned midway between the colony centre and its periphery and (3) the existence of living 'silos'. The latter are expendable foragers, who stay inside the nest and store food during famine relief, thus acting as potential disposable testers for food toxicity.

AB Environmental noise caused by human activities may hamper acoustic communication in animals. Field studies in urban environments suggest that birds may alter their communicative behaviour in response to noise, but there is little experimental evidence for a detrimental effect of urban noise on perception. We investigated the masking effects of urban noise on signal detection using operant tests with great tits in the laboratory. We compared masking effects induced by urban noise, woodland noise and a typical dawn chorus, including a variety of singing birds. Maskers were presented at their natural sound pressure level and masking conditions were compared to a silent no-masker condition. The signals to be detected were composed of artificial sinusoids and noise bands mimicking signal features of natural great tit song elements. Both masker condition and signal feature significantly affected signal detection in the captive great tits. Deteriorated auditory thresholds in woodland and urban noise required the signal to be on average 12 dB and 18 dB louder than in the no-masker condition, respectively. The dawn chorus masker showed the most dramatic shift in auditory threshold of about 29 dB. Signals with the sound energy concentrated within a narrow frequency range were on average easier to detect than signals spread over a wide frequency range. Our perceptual results provide insight into how birds may counteract negative masking effects by singing song elements with specific features.

AB As in all otariids, Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea, females alternate foraging trips at sea with suckling periods ashore, and each time they return, mothers and pups have to find each other among individuals at the colony. The need for a finely tuned mechanism of individual recognition is exacerbated by their habit of changing the suckling location. Using playback experiments with modified calls, we investigated the acoustic parameters involved in the discrimination of the mother by pups. The signature efficiency was also tested in the three environments in which reunions at the study site occur by performing propagation tests. Pups paid great attention to both amplitude and frequency modulations, and to the exact frequency values of the call to identify their mother. When severe modi. cations of AM and FM patterns were made to mothers' calls pups no longer responded to them. This may have arisen because the calls fell outside the natural species range. The energy spectrum, even though highly individualized, was not important for individual recognition. Propagation tests revealed that one particular environment was extremely harsh and did not allow accurate transfer of the individual signature components whatever the distance. In two other environments, AM was only reliable to a distance of 16 m, but both FM and frequency spectrum could be transmitted with limited degradation over 32 m. The different environments greatly influenced the efficiency of the individual identification process. Accordingly, the area in which mother-pup reunions occur is an important factor in the success of individual recognition. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Foraging by intraspecific kleptoparasitism is widespread among animal taxa. Most kleptoparasitic interactions are considered facultative, and can be influenced by life history stage and trade-offs with other activities such as mate searching. Trade-offs with mating strategies are often sex specific when males are selected to invest in mate searching while females engage in foraging to maximize fecundity. As a result, sexual dimorphism in opportunistic foraging may evolve, and would predict an ontogenetic shift from the juvenile to the adult stage where males could adopt opportunistic foraging. To investigate this hypothesis, we studied the effect of sex and life history stage on the frequency of kleptoparasitism in ant-eating spiders of the genus Zodarion in the field. These spiders use a special capture technique involving a quick attack on an ant that is left unguarded by spiders for several minutes, providing ample opportunities for kleptoparasitism. We found that adult females consistently hunted actively, while adult males ceased active prey capture and instead engaged in kleptoparasitism. Juvenile spiders were active hunters irrespective of sex. Consistent with an ontogenetic shift in foraging behaviour from hunting to kleptoparasitism in males, males preferred to feed on dead (freshly killed) prey while females preferred live prey. Furthermore, males experienced a decline in prey capture rate compared with females and juveniles. Kleptoparasitism in males was accompanied by inspection of female foraging sites, suggesting that males cease active prey capture and maximize mating opportunities.

AB Life history theory predicts that individuals paired with attractive mates may invest more in offspring. Such differential investment may amplify the effects of genetic quality on fitness. Attractiveness can include 'good gene' and 'complementary gene' components, but how the latter affects parental investment remains unknown. We found that nestling song sparrows with genetically dissimilar parents grew faster than did nestlings whose parents were genetically more similar to one another. A cross-fostering experiment revealed complementary gene effects on growth; nestlings produced by genetically dissimilar parents grew faster than their adoptive 'siblings' reared in the same nest but produced by parents that were more genetically similar. To explore whether parental investment exaggerates these complementary gene effects on growth, we monitored parental nest visits. Maternal visits were negatively related to genetic similarity between mates. The novel finding that females adjust levels of care according to the genetic diversity of their offspring suggests that parental investment can amplify complementary gene effects on fitness.

AB Although the use of communication signals during worker-queen interactions in honeybees have been studied in detail, signals involved in worker-drone interactions have received less attention. We determined whether workers perform piping and the vibration signal on drones, and whether drones respond in ways that potentially enhance their mating success. Workers did not produce piping on drones, but they did perform vibration signals. Approximately 50% of the drones examined received vibration signals, and drones were more likely to be vibrated when they were sexually immature than when they were mature. Drones responded to the vibration signal by increasing movement and by interacting more with workers, which contributed to an increase in the proportions of time that they received trophallaxis and grooming. Because trophallaxis supplies nutrients necessary for sexual maturation, and because grooming may also contribute to drone health, workers could potentially use the vibration signal to promote development and mating performance in drones. We found no evidence that the vibration signal was associated with drone flight. The majority of signals were performed on drones in the morning several hours before flight activity, there was no relationship between the level of vibration activity experienced by drones in the morning and flight activity later that same day, and drones were rarely vibrated when returning to the nest between consecutive mating flights. In many social insect species, reproductive males are fed through trophallaxis and workers perform vibrational signals to influence activity of nestmates. Tactile, vibratory signals may therefore provide mechanisms for investigating the role of worker-drone interactions in colony reproductive decisions for a wide array of species.

AB In the biparental, cooperatively breeding cottontop tamarin, Saguinus oedipus oedipus, adult sons provide an energetically and reproductively valuable service to their breeding parents by helping to carry infants. Other species may use aggressive coercion or punishment to enforce alloparenting. Yet, affiliation in primates is important in negotiating social relationships and may be exchanged for services. We hypothesized that the rewards of grooming might be used by expectant parents to cultivate strong relationships with and maintain the services of adult son alloparents. We tested for an interchange trade of aggression or grooming for infant carrying according to a biological market. Individual rates of grooming, but not aggression, received by sons were explained by previously demonstrated levels of alloparental infant carrying. However, the direction of the interaction differed according to the sex of the parent. Mothers groomed better carriers at a higher rate, whereas fathers groomed poorer carriers at a higher rate. This sex difference in parental behaviour may reflect differential benefits that male and female breeders receive with increasing help. Market predictions based on alloparent availability were not supported, but results indicated a connection between affiliation and cooperative service. The rates of huddling and contact affiliation between fathers and adult sons suggest a sex-specific set of social relationship traits conducive to both affiliation and infant carrying. These may be necessarily tied to the particular form of infant care by males in this cooperatively breeding species. Fathers may condition sons for the social aspects of carrying, which involve socially coordinated efforts and close physical proximity between adult males.

AB Reconciliation, affiliation between opponents after a conflict, is an important means to reduce the detrimental effects of aggression in social primates. Socially deprived (SD) rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, however, do not reconcile, while socially raised animals do. This lack of reconciliation in deprived animals may be caused by (1) a lack of secure and valuable relationships, (2) having missed the opportunity to learn reconciliation as an immature, or (3) high stress levels in social situations that prevent reconciliation. It is unclear which of these factors causes the lack of reconciliation in deprived animals. We investigated these factors using newly developed measures distinguishing between the attempt to reconcile and acceptance of this attempt in captive rhesus macaques with different rearing histories. The results suggest that the absence of reconciliatory behaviour in the SD animals is not due to lack of initiation of contact and the potential to reconcile, but to rejection of affiliative approaches by the opponent after a conflict. Although we cannot exclude that SD animals did not learn to approach opponents, the results seem best explained by the hypothesis that approaches are considered threatening and avoidance of reconciliation is caused by a high anxiety level in the SD individuals. 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Adults of the mangrove cricket show a clear and persistent circatidal rhythm in their locomotor activities, with a free-running period of about 12.6 h. Individuals are active during the subjective low tide and inactive during the subjective high tide, under constant darkness. When we provided a 30 min inundation stimulus four times, at intervals of 12.4 h, the circatidal rhythm entrained to the given inundation cycles under constant darkness. After the treatment, crickets became inactive around the times when the inundation stimulus was expected. The circatidal rhythm responded to periodic inundations in a phase-dependent manner: when periodic inundations started during the first half of the active phase (i.e. the subjective low tide), a large phase delay resulted, whereas periodic stimuli that started during the second half of the subjective low tide caused a large phase advance. The shape of the phase response curve (PRC) resembled that of the Type 1 PRC of circadian rhythms, with continuous transitions between delays and advances. The similarity between the PRC patterns provides evidence of a circatidal oscillator, which has characteristics similar to a circadian oscillator.

AB Many prey species use chemical cues to detect predators. According to the threat sensitivity hypothesis, prey should match the intensity of their antipredator behaviour to the degree of threat posed by the predator. Several species of lizards display antipredator behaviours in the presence of snake chemical cues, but how species specific are these responses? In Australia, most snake species eat lizards, and are therefore potentially dangerous. Hence, we predicted that lizards should display generalized rather than species-specific antipredator behaviours. To test this prediction, we quantified the behavioural responses of velvet geckos, Oedura lesueurii, to chemical cues from five species of elapid snakes that are syntopic with velvet geckos but differ in their degree of danger. These five snake species included two nocturnal ambush foragers that eat geckos (broad-headed snake Hoplocephalus bungaroides, and death adder, Acanthophis antarcticus), two active foragers that eat skinks (but rarely eat geckos) and that differ in their activity times (nocturnal small-eyed snake, Cryptophis nigrescens, and diurnal whip snake, Demansia psammophis), and a nocturnal nonthreatening species that feeds entirely on blind snakes (bandy-bandy, Vermicella annulata). Geckos showed similar antisnake behaviours (tail waving, tail vibration), and a similar intensity of responses (reducing activity, freezing), to chemical cues from all five snake species, even though the snakes differed in their degree of danger and foraging modes. Our results suggest that velvet geckos display generalized antipredator responses to chemicals from elapid snakes, rather than responding in a graded fashion depending upon the degree of threat posed by a particular snake species.

AB Cooperative colony founding (pleometrosis) in social insects is an ideal model for investigating how cooperation and competition shape social behaviour among unrelated individuals. In many ant species, foundress associations are more competitive and the colonies survive better compared with single-queen colonies. However, cooperation among queens breaks down at the time of emergence of the first workers, and all but one queen are eliminated. Because no sexuals are produced in incipient colonies, the surviving queen will monopolize the future reproductive success of the colony, while defeated queens will have zero fitness. We examined factors affecting queens' survival prospects during reversion to single-queen colonies in cooperative foundations of the ant Lasius niger. By combining phenotypic and genotypic analyses, we determined how queen's size, individual investment and maternity apportionment influence the outcome of fights. Larger queens were more likely to survive fights. However, smaller queens survived up to one-third of the fighting. By contrast, neither weight loss at the time of a fight outbreak, a measure of queens' relative investment in brood production, nor maternity apportionment influenced the outcome of fights. Moreover, investment of cofoundresses and partitioning of reproduction were not adjusted to queen's size, suggesting that reproductive competition among queens does not occur before the emergence of the first workers. These results lead us to consider pleometrotic associations in L. niger as a 'best of a bad job', whereby the benefits of joint founding and the probability of surviving the conflict might be sufficient for smaller queens to embark on cooperative foundations.

AB In a successive negative contrast (SNC) procedure, subjects used to a familiar contingency are unexpectedly shifted to a less favourable one. Typically, mammals in the new condition show lower anticipatory and consummatory responses than controls that only experience the low contingency, but similar experiments in birds have failed to show SNC. We investigated SNC in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. In experiment 1, birds that were shifted from mealworms (preferred food) to turkey crumbs (less preferred food) consumed less of the turkey crumbs, and showed elevated activity and exploratory feeder probing with respect to unshifted starlings exposed throughout to turkey crumbs. This is the first report of consummatory SNC in birds. In experiment 2, two groups differed in the amount of information. Initially, both groups encountered simultaneously one hopper with mealworms and three with turkey crumbs. The mealworm hopper was colour coded in group 'cued' but not in group 'uncued'. After a shift, all four feeders contained turkey crumbs and were signalled by the colour associated with turkey crumbs before the shift. The two groups did not differ in postshift consumption, and increased overall activity similarly after the shift. Exploratory feeder probing, however, increased significantly less in group cued than in group uncued, consistent with the view that informed animals adjusted faster (ceased searching for the preferred food) to the new conditions. The dissociation between exploration and consumption in their sensitivity to available information during the reward downshift is discussed in terms of the adaptive implications of SNC.

AB Game theory states that iterative interactions between individuals are necessary to adjust behaviour optimally to one another. Although our understanding of the role of begging signals in the resolution of parent-offspring conflict over parental investment rests on game theory implying repeated interactions between family members, empiricists usually consider interactions at the exact moment when parents allocate food among the brood. Therefore, the mechanisms by which siblings adjust signalling level to one another remain unclear. We tackled this issue in the barn owl, Tyto alba. In the absence of parents, hungry nestlings signal vocally to siblings their intention to contest vigorously the next, indivisible, food item. Such behaviour deters siblings from competing and begging when parents return to the nest. In experimental two-chick broods, nestlings producing the longest calls in the absence of parents, a signal of hunger level, were more successful at monopolizing the food item at the first parental feeding visit of the night. Moreover, nestlings increased (versus decreased) call duration when their sibling produced longer (versus shorter) calls, and an individual was more likely to call again if its sibling began to vocalize before or just after it had ended its previous call. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that siblings challenge each other vocally to reinforce the honesty of sib-sib communication and to resolve conflicts over which individual will have priority of access to the next delivered food item. Siblings challenge each other vocally to confirm that the level of signalling accurately reflects motivation. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Space use by animals can provide insight into the habitats in which they live. In predictable landscapes where high-quality habitat is distributed heterogeneously, fidelity can increase individual fitness because animals benefit from familiarity. We tested the hypothesis that space use and the level of site fidelity will reflect habitat productivity and the spatiotemporal distribution of resources. To test our hypothesis we examined site fidelity in 41 grizzly bears, Ursus arctos, during 2003-2006 in the Mackenzie Delta, in Canada's Arctic. We estimated annual home range size for males ((x) over bar 1215 km(2)) and females ((x) over bar 680 km(2)) using the 95% fixed kernel approach. We used three methods to examine the level of home range fidelity in consecutive years. Bear locations were largely spatially nonoverlapping between years, which represented a pattern of both low site and home range fidelity. Although distances between home range centres were small for both males ((x) over bar 7: 7 km) and females ((x) over bar 8: 4 km), mean percentage overlap was only 24.2%. Our observations suggest that bears remain philopatric to a region, however, position and configuration of the annual range drifts over time. The low fidelity that we observed suggests an adaptive strategy of space use for low-density populations in regions of low productivity where quality habitats are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. We suggest that traditional definitions of a home range may be too limited for Arctic grizzlies and propose that the multiannual home range is a more meaningful measure for describing space use.

AB We studied parental care behaviour in a field population of convict cichlids, Amatitlania siquia, a fish with biparental care of its free-swimming young (fry). We simulated catastrophic brood loss by removing all of the young from 26 broods of various ages. We recorded parental defence behaviour for 5 min preremoval and three consecutive 5 min postremoval intervals. We then returned all of the young and recorded 5 min of parent-offspring reunion behaviour. Following brood loss, both parents defended the empty territory and searched for missing young. Females spent more time in the empty territory and performed more attacks in defence of the empty territory than did males. Females searched and defended a significantly larger area than males did. During the 15 min fry-absent period, males increasingly spent more time away, whereas females maintained a constant level of investment in searching the brood area. Four of 26 males (15%) engaged in courtship with a new female within 15 min of brood loss. Attacks to repel potential predators from the brood area declined in frequency over the 15 min fry-absent period in both sexes. Standard length (age) of young was positively correlated with parental investment for females but not males. Number of young was positively correlated with parental investment for males but not for females. We conclude that post-brood-loss behaviours are search and recovery tactics that contribute to parental inclusive fitness in the event of incomplete brood predation.

AB Considerable research has tested two axioms about antipredator behaviour: prey may respond to temporal variation in risk (the risky times hypothesis) or to spatial variation in risk (the risky places hypothesis). The risk allocation hypothesis extends the risky times hypothesis, noting that the context into which a period of risk or safety is imbedded should affect the level of response, and predicting that vigilance should be greatest during a brief pulse of risk and lowest during a brief pulse of safety. We tested these models using natural variation in true predation risk, by observing elk, Cervus elaphus, in the presence or absence of wolves, Canis lupus, on three sites in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, over 4 winters. Elk were exposed to wolves frequently in the Northern Range, intermittently in the Gallatin Canyon, and never in the Elk-horn Mountains. We used GLM to control the effects of herd size and composition while testing for responses of vigilance to daily wolf presence (temporal variation) and to site-specific, background levels of risk (spatial variation). The data gave strong support to the risk allocation hypothesis and equivocal support to the risky times hypothesis, and did not support the risky places hypothesis. Contrary to the risky places hypothesis but as predicted by risk allocation, Gallatin elk were more vigilant than Northern Range elk despite lower background risk in the Gallatin Canyon. The contradictory predictions of the risk allocation and risky places hypotheses have important rami. cations for research on the ecological consequences of antipredator behaviour.

AB The effects of aggregation in navigating animals have generated growing interest in field and theoretical studies. The few studies on the effects of group flying on the performance of homing pigeons, Columba livia, have led to controversial conclusions, chiefly because of the lack of appropriate technology to follow pigeons during their entire homeward flight. Therefore, we used GPS data loggers on six highly trained pigeons from a familiar release site first by releasing them six times individually, then six times as a group from the same site, and, finally, again six times individually. Flight data showed that the homing performance of the birds flying as a flock was significantly better than that of the birds released individually. When flying in a flock, pigeons showed no resting episodes, shorter homing times, higher speed, and almost no circling around the start zone in comparison to individual flights. Moreover, flock-flying pigeons took a nearly direct, 'beeline' route to the loft, whereas individually flying birds preferred to follow roads and other longitudinal landmarks leading towards the loft, even when it caused a detour. Our results show that group cohesion facilitates a shift towards more efficient homing strategies: individuals prefer navigating by familiar landmarks, while flocks show a compass orientation.

AB Animals often perform displays, not only in agonistic contexts, but also in nonagonistic contexts such as greeting and courtship. How have such cross-contextual displays evolved? Here I analyse the Hawk-Assessor game to examine this issue. In this game, Hawks attack other players when they meet them, beginning a fight. In contrast, Assessors first perform a display and subsequently decide whether to fight. The Assessor strategy is the only evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) in the classic Hawk-Assessor game, which assumes that Hawks do not attack displaying Assessors. In this paper,first I point out that, when that assumption is not made, Hawk is also an ESS. Then, I consider the cost of inappropriate attacks on nonopponents. Animals in the real world encounter not only opponents but also nonopponents, such as partners and potential mates. They might attack nonopponents inappropriately because of uncertainty of social recognition or overly aggressive motivation. Assessors might avoid inappropriate attacks because they start encounters with conspecifics using a display and thereby gain time to verify the social recognition or reduce their aggressive motivation. In this case, the Assessor strategy can be the only ESS again and the display of Assessors becomes a cross-contextual display. According to this model, one can predict that, for species performing cross-contextual displays, there is a risk of inappropriate attack. One can also predict that the species without risk will start agonistic interactions by attacking immediately. Empirical examples are consistent with the predictions.

AB In many insects, recognition cues for social status or family membership are based on differences in cuticular hydrocarbons. In some cases these cues reflect reproductive status. Burying beetles, Nicrophorus orbicollis, form temporary pairs to rear a brood and, as a pair, they must defend their young and the breeding resource (a small vertebrate carcass) from conspecific intruders. Thus, a mechanism for the identification of a nonpartner is necessary for the appropriate aggressive response. Burying beetles appear to use reproductive status to identify partners. In behavioural tests of recognition, unknown individuals at the same reproductive stage were accepted as mates. In addition, males showed significantly less aggression towards unknown nonbreeding females treated with an extract of their mates' cuticular hydrocarbons. Cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of males and females on the sixth day of breeding, the most intense phase of parental care, were significantly different from those of their nonbreeding counterparts, but quite similar to each other. We conclude that these hydrocarbon profiles change during a breeding bout and mediate recognition of breeding partners. Furthermore, although juvenile hormone haemolymph titres changed dramatically during breeding, they did not directly affect hydrocarbon profiles.

AB One of the greatest paradoxes in evolutionary biology is the continued maintenance of genetic variation for phenotypic traits that appear to confer strong fitness advantages. Of these traits, body size is perhaps the one that has been most consistently linked to increased longevity and reproductive success in males. We investigated two hypotheses for how events occurring during mating in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae could impede directional selection on male body size: (1) whether male copulation probability is random with respect to body size in aerial swarms, and (2) whether large males are less competitive during mating than smaller, shorter-lived rivals. By manipulation of larval nutritional conditions (low, intermediate and high food allocation), we generated cohorts of male A. gambiae mosquitoes that differed in adult body size and energy reserves (body size and energy reserves being positively correlated with larval nutrition). When competing against one another in aerial swarms, males from the intermediate food treatment were six and two times more successful at acquiring mates than those from the high and low food treatments, respectively. The median survival of males from this most sexually competitive group was approximately 13% lower than that of the larger males with high larval nutrition. We conclude that phenotypic determinants of long-term survival and mating success may not be correlated in this system, and thus that stabilizing selection as well as environmental condition-dependent expression of traits could account for the maintenance of variation in male body size in this species and in other swarming insects.

AB Collective detection and predation risk dilution are two nonexclusive mechanisms that can allow a reduction in antipredator vigilance in large animal groups. The two mechanisms make remarkably similar predictions in many contexts, and disentangling their relative contribution has proven empirically difficult thus far. We examined a situation where predators are more likely to attack from one side of the group. Provided that all foragers in the group can detect the predator equally well, the collective detection hypothesis predicts that all individuals will adopt the same vigilance level if this mechanism acted alone. In terms of risk dilution, individuals that are on the riskier side of the group, namely those on the attack side, are unlikely to benefit to the same extent as other groupmates from the presence of companions, and should have a higher level of vigilance than more buffered foragers further inside the group. We show that semipalmated sandpipers on the riskier side of flocks were more vigilant and thus pecked at a lower rate than those in the centre of the flocks and those on the less risky side. The proportion of successful pecks did not vary with spatial position within the flocks, suggesting that differences in food availability did not confound the above findings. We conclude that it is unlikely that collective detection acted alone and that risk dilution, acting alone or in combination with collective detection, shaped antipredator vigilance in an avian prey under predation risk.

AB Networks are collections of units that potentially interact as a system. Electronic power grids, human societies, the Internet, food webs and metabolic pathways are examples of networks that have emergent properties that allow all vertices (viz. individuals, components, species, etc.) to be linked by a short chain of intermediate vertices. My field observations on a colony of 65 free-ranging Columbian ground squirrels suggest that their society also exhibits these characteristics via social interaction. On average, any dyad of squirrels in the colony can be connected via amicable interaction with three intermediate individuals. The connectivity of individuals (viz. the number of individuals to which an individual is directly connected) decays following a scale-free power law distribution. Individuals that have similar age, reproductive status and number of associates (viz. the number of individuals to which the individual is connected via social interaction) interact amicably with each other more than other squirrels. The network is robust to the removal of random individuals. However, simulated removal of individuals that are connected to many other squirrels increases the number of intermediates between two random individuals and fragments the network into smaller clusters when removals exceed 10% of the individuals in the colony. Thus, certain individuals appear to play more central roles than others in the cohesion of the network. My results reinforce previous studies showing that network theory can be used to determine the roles played by individuals in the cohesion of animal societies, thus providing a framework for studying sociality across species.

AB The proximate physiological mechanisms producing the parental ability to vary offspring sex ratio in many vertebrates remain elusive. Recently, high concentrations of maternal testosterone and glucose and low concentrations of maternal corticosterone have been suggested to explain male bias in offspring sex ratio. We examined how these factors affect secondary offspring sex ratio in nondomesticated field voles, Microtus agrestis, while controlling for maternal age, testosterone level of the male and body condition of both the female and the male. We found that females with high preconception serum testosterone and glucose levels produced a male- biased litter, whereas there was no association between maternal corticosterone level and litter sex ratio. Older females produced a bias towards sons, but neither their body condition nor paternal testosterone level correlated with litter sex ratio. Finally, females mated with a high body- condition male tended to deliver a male- biased litter. Our results suggest that several physiological traits of the mother may simultaneously be related to offspring sex ratio in mammals.

AB The sensory bases of food detection, food location and food choice in nocturnal primates are poorly understood. Grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus, are omnivorous nocturnal strepsirhines and generally regarded a good model for the most ancestral primate condition. We set up a series of choice experiments in a controlled laboratory environment to investigate the roles of acoustic, olfactory and visual cues and the importance of unimodal versus multimodal cues for prey perception in this species. Subjects in our study were able to find hidden prey better than expected by chance using any of the three sensory modalities tested; that is, any of the cues provided was sufficient and none was indispensably necessary to trigger prey detection. Availability of visual cues alone enabled successful prey detection in > 90% of trials. Detection performance increased with the number of modalities available. Taken together, our data identify vision as a key modality for prey detection in captive-born grey mouse lemurs and at the same time stress the role of multimodal information for successful foraging in this nocturnal primate.

AB The round dance and mutual feeding (trophallaxis) enable honeybees to transfer information concerning a food source, including its profitability. For nectar, which consists mainly of sugars, profitability is usually defined by its energetic value. Nectars, however, also contain a wide range of trace components, some of which affect their attractiveness. Honeybees produce honey from nectar. We compared the round dance and trophallaxis behaviours of bees foraging on avocado and citrus honey solutions, as a substitute for nectars. These sources differ in their trace-elements composition, with avocado nectar and honey containing higher concentrations of minerals than citrus nectar and honey. In a second experiment, we compared the behaviour of bees foraging on sucrose solution and sucrose solution enriched with four major mineral components of avocado nectar. Subjects foraging on avocado honey had a significantly lower probability of dancing than those foraging on citrus honey, a rate of direction reversals that was almost one half, a lower total number of reversals, shorter dance duration and longer trophallaxis time. When avocado honey was supplied to bees that previously fed on citrus honey, most of them avoided it, indicating a Strong context effect. When foraging on mineral-enriched sugar solution, dance variables tended to be lower compared with sucrose solution without minerals, but differences were smaller than the differences between the honey solutions. These results show that nectar trace components affect the estimation of nectar profitability by bees and consequently recruitment of new foragers to nectar sources.

AB Unicolonial ants possess an unusual social system characterized by the absence of internest aggression resulting in expansive networks where individuals move freely among distant nests. The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), can form geographically vast and numerically large unicolonial populations, or supercolonies, a trait that has been linked to its ecological success in the introduced range, and is one of the few invasive ants in which native and introduced populations have been examined to elucidate the origins and maintenance of unicoloniality. Supercolony formation may result from mixing of genetically homogenous and nonaggressive colonies, or initially aggressive colonies harbouring the most common recognition alleles. In this study, we examined interactions between mutually aggressive L. humile colonies in the absence of barriers limiting intercolony encounters to determine whether aggressive interactions result in either colony elimination or fusion into new nonaggressive colonies. By pairing experimental laboratory and field colonies displaying varying levels of intraspecific aggression, we determined that pairs that did not fuse had higher numbers of workers fighting and killed than colony pairs that fused and that genetic and cuticular hydrocarbon similarity between colony pairs was correlated with both levels of intraspecific aggression and colony fusion. We suggest that selective fusion of initially aggressive colonies sharing certain recognition cues may be a proximate mechanism shaping L. humile social structure, leading ultimately to extreme unicoloniality in introduced populations when ecological conditions are favourable.

AB Social animals live and interact together, forming complex relationships and social structure. These relationships can have important fitness consequences, but most studies do not explicitly measure those relationships. An approach that explicitly measures relationships will further our understanding of social complexity and the consequences of both direct and indirect interactions. Social network analysis is the study of social groups as networks of nodes connected by social ties. This approach examines individuals and groups in the context of relationships between group members. Application of social network analysis to animal behaviour can advance the field by identifying and quantifying specific attributes of social relationships, many of which are not captured by more common measures of sociality such as group size. Sophisticated methods for network construction and analysis exist in other fields, but until recently, have seen relatively little application to animal systems. We present a brief history of social network analysis, a description of basic concepts and previous applications to animal behaviour. We then highlight relevance and constraints of some network measures, including results from an original study of the effect of sampling on network parameter estimates, and we end with promising directions for research. By doing so, we provide a prospective overview of social network analysis' general utility for the study of animal social behaviour. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study ofAnimal Behaviour.

AB An increasing number of studies are focusing on the role of animal temperament in the ecology of wild populations. One important step in these studies is to estimate the repeatability of temperament traits, by replicating measures of an animal's behavioural or physiological reactions to a novel or stressful situation. When studies are performed in the field, several factors can affect repeatability estimates: (1) micro-environmental conditions prior to or during a test may affect the measured behaviour, and spatial heterogeneity in predation risk within the habitat of a population may affect repeatability; (2) a decrease over time in the strength of behavioural reactions as a result of habituation may bias repeatability; and (3) individuals may differ in their habituation. In this study we used a linear mixed-model approach to test for the occurrence of interindividual variation in behavioural reaction and habituation of eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, to a hole-board test and a handling bag test. We found high intraindividual consistency for the behaviours recorded both in the hole-board and handling bag tests; four temperament traits could be considered (i.e. activity/exploration, reaction to stress, emotionality and docility). Given that we found no phenotypic variation in habituation, chipmunks seem to show a behavioural carryover in activity/exploration and docility, which could have consequences for the evolutionary potential of habituation to novelty.

AB Shoaling is a common antipredatory adaptation in several fish species. However, parasite infections may alter shoaling behaviour of fish by impairing fish sensory/motor systems and by reducing the net benefit of shoaling. In an experimental study, we investigated whether Diplostomum spathaceum (Trematoda) eye flukes alter shoaling behaviour of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and if this has an interaction with predation risk. The parasite reduces the vision of fish by inducing cataract formation, which in previous studies has been shown to alter fish escape responses and crypsis. We found that the shoals of infected fish contained fewer individuals and they divided into separate groups more often compared with controls. The difference between infected and control fish in their shoaling behaviour further increased undersimulated avian predation, which increased the cohesiveness of groups in control fish but not in infected fish. These findings suggest that reduced shoaling of D. spathaceum-infected fish may predispose them to predation by birds, and thus provide a potential mechanism to enhance the transmission of this trophically transmitted parasite.

AB In socially monogamous passerines, extrapair paternity can increase the variance in male reproductive success. If gaining extrapair fertilizations is linked to specific secondary sexual ornaments, the opportunity for sexual selection is enhanced. Therefore, to understand the evolution of male phenotypic characteristics, it is important to identify traits that predict male extrapair mating success. Tree swallows show among the highest rates of extrapair paternity known to occur in birds, yet it is unclear whether male extrapair mating success is associated with phenotypic traits that honestly advertise individual quality. We compared morphological characteristics and plumage coloration of male tree swallows that sired extrapair offspring with those that sired only within-pair offspring in the same breeding population to identify the characteristics that predict extrapair fertilization success. Males who produced extrapair offspring had brighter plumage, and were more likely to be returning breeders, than males that did not have extrapair young. In paired comparisons, however, there was no difference between extrapair males and the male they cuckolded. These results suggest that female tree swallows may prefer brighter or older individuals as extrapair mates, but also, that older males may invest more energy in pursuing extrapair copulations. Furthermore, since females had extrapair offspring in their nest regardless of their social mate's morphometric or plumage attributes, we suggest that extrapair mating may be a reproductive strategy allowing females to increase the genetic diversity, while maintaining genetic quality, of their offspring.

AB Several internally fertilizing hermaphroditic animals can only perform one sexual role at a time. In such species, two individuals that engage in a copulation may have different interests in acting as male or female. A gender choice must be made which, if both individuals have the same preference, may give rise to a severe sexual conflict. Here we tested the hypothesis that gender choice could be influenced by mating history, using the freshwater snail, Physa acuta. We recorded the copulatory behaviour of 240 pairs composed of a focal individual and a partner, each either short- or long-isolated. We found that the time to the first copulation was unaffected by isolation status, suggesting that first contacts in this species are random processes. In contrast, the duration of copulations and the frequency of rejection behaviours suggested that individual gender preference switches from male biased to female biased as isolation increases. In addition, snails rejected copulations more frequently when presented to a partner with the same isolation status. Reciprocity, measured as the rate of gender swapping between the first and second copulations, was high irrespective of gender status. We suggest possible evolutionary causes for this gender preference switch and discuss its potential importance in natural population as well as its consequences for the maintenance of hermaphroditism.

AB Many conspicuous ornamental traits in animals are expressed in both males and females. Despite this, most research has focused on sexually dimorphic ornamentation. Mutual ornamentation has often been viewed as a result of either a nonadaptive genetic correlation between the sexes or similar selection pressures in both sexes. Here, we review the theoretical underpinning and empirical evidence for these ideas. Few studies have attempted to test empirically whether a genetic correlation between the sexes can constrain the evolution of sexual dimorphism, and the results have been mixed. By contrast, there is good evidence that mutual ornaments can have a signal function in both sexes, especially in terms of mate choice. Other possible signalling functions have received little attention. Social status signalling is especially likely to be important, because competition over nonsexual resources is more balanced between the sexes than sexual competition. There is a need for experimental studies that explicitly test these hypotheses simultaneously in both sexes.

AB We studied the causes of natal dispersal of male and female brown bears, Ursus arctos, in two study areas in Sweden. Males had a higher dispersal probability ( 94%) than females ( 41%). For males, we found no difference in dispersal probability or mean age of dispersal between the study areas, in spite of differences in population density and sex ratio. Male-male competition did not seem to influence subadult male dispersal probability significantly. These results support the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis as the cause of male natal dispersal. For females, dispersal probability decreased with increasing maternal age and decreased with increasing body size, and an interaction between maternal age and body size suggested that the importance of body size decreased with increasing maternal age. Nondispersing females were closer to their mother than their dispersing sibling sisters were in the period between weaning and dispersal. Female littermates seemed to compete for philopatry, suggesting that a dominance hierarchy among female littermates based on body size may cause the subdominant sister to disperse. If juvenile females are born into matrilineal assemblages, surrounded mostly by related females, the competition for philopatry may not be as severe as when they are born into an area surrounded by mostly nonkin females. This hypothesis is supported by the decreasing importance of body size for dispersal with increasing maternal age. We suggest that natal dispersal in juvenile female brown bears can be explained by the resident fitness hypothesis. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated an extreme behavioural specialization in the army ant Eciton burchellii. The spectacular group raids of these ants, which can contain up to 200 000 workers, always remain connected to the nest by a 'principal trail' of forager traffic. Remarkably, some workers use their bodies to plug potholes in the natural surfaces that the principal trail travels over, to provide a partly living surface for their nestmates to use. We found that this highly specialized behaviour results in a clear net benefit to the colony. Our experiments show that foragers do not discriminate against surfaces that force all individuals to run as slowly as the smallest workers, but that this prompts some ants to plug neighbouring low-quality surfaces. Individuals size-match to the hole they plug and cooperate to plug larger holes. The resulting modi. ed surface allows prey-laden foragers to attain maximum speed. Overall, this results in a strong positive relationship between ant size and speed and an increase in the mean speed of prey-laden traffic. Moreover, calculations suggest that under a range of realistic scenarios, plugging behaviour results in a clear increase in daily prey intake. Broadly, our study provides rare quantitative evidence that extreme specialization by a minority can significantly improve the performance of a majority, and benefit the group as a whole. It also suggests, however, that these benefits are a consequence of the unusual and derived foraging strategy of E. burchellii. This highlights the importance of considering ecology and evolutionary history in the study of social organization in animal societies.

AB We studied mate selection mechanisms in the tomato fruit borer moth Neoleucinodes elegantalis, and we found that males and females tended to mate monogamously. Males chose a female according to the blend of her sex pheromone, and they preferred heavier females for mating. Females that produced the preferred blend of the sex pheromone were heavier and had larger wings. Heavier males were more likely to initiate flight sooner and to be the first to copulate with the female. These results suggest that females compete for faster-responding males by producing an attractive blend of sex pheromone, and that males compete for females that synthesize the more attractive sex pheromone blend by responding to the calling female faster. We propose that the pheromone blend preferred by males constitutes a signal reflecting the genetic and physiological quality of the female that is difficult to achieve for biosynthetic reasons. We found that a synthetic 'supernormal' pheromone blend was more effective in attracting males than was the pheromone produced by calling females, thus providing a useful means of mass trapping of males (e.g. to control infestations in tomato plantations). The results support theoretical predictions that mate selection behaviour in both sexes regulates most sexual encounters, even those modulated by sex pheromones.

AB Although 90% of passerine birds live in socially monogamous pair bonds, molecular studies have revealed that genetic polygamy occurs in 86% of surveyed passerines, because individuals engage in copulations outside the pair bond (extrapair copulations; EPCs). Most explanations for the occurrence of EPCs involve female gaining indirect benefits from the extrapair male. The sedge warbler is a socially monogamous species in which some offspring result from EPCs (8% in this study). Complex song is a sexually selected male trait used by females which select mates based on a variety of male qualities. We used microsatellite DNA profiling to detect extrapair young and assign paternity. 'Good genes' theory predicts that females should engage in EPCs with males of higher quality than their social mate, with resulting fitness benefits. Extrapair males had smaller song repertoires and smaller territories than the social mate. This apparent preference for small-repertoire males as extrapair mates conflicts with the predictions from previous studies of this species. Sudden cessation of song after pairing may mean that song cues are unavailable for later extrapair matings and females may switch to other cues. Such behaviour may lead to different patterns of female choice during social and extrapair mating in the sedge warbler. We conclude that multiple reasons underlie patterns of female choice in this species. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study ofAnimal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Body size is an important determinant of male mating success, and acoustic signals often contain information about size. Most playback experiments that have tested for female preferences for larger males have manipulated only single characteristics, even though size is often correlated with multiple signal attributes. We first determined which characteristics. of the advertisement calls of male barking treefrogs were correlated with body size, then we used two-choice playback experiments to determine whether female choice for larger males was influenced by these characteristics. In univariate tests, we varied only one of three size-correlated call parameters (fundamental frequency, call amplitude, call duration) at a time. In composite tests, we varied all three characteristics simultaneously, using univariate regressions of each parameter on size to predict the values expected for each characteristic for small, medium and large males. In univariate tests, females preferred large over small males for call amplitude and duration, medium over small males for amplitude and fundamental frequency, and large over medium males for call amplitude. In composite playbacks, females preferred large males over medium and small males, and medium males over small males. Females thus showed clear preferences for larger males, especially in the composite tests. Comparisons between the results of the univariate and composite tests indicated that female preferences for larger males are mediated by a combination of call characteristics rather than any single trait. Reliance on a combination of traits may function to increase the probability that females select larger males despite weak correlations between body size and individual call characteristics.

AB Vertebrate pheromones that affect female receptivity have been documented only in salamanders. These courtship pheromones have been investigated most intensively in plethodontid salamanders. The source of the plethodontid courtship pheromone is the male's submandibular (mental) gland, which produces a multiprotein secretion. In earlier work with our main study species, Plethodon shermani (the red-legged salamander), an extract of protein secretions obtained from male mental glands acted to increase sexual receptivity in females. In addition, one particular protein in the gland secretion, plethodontid receptivity factor (PRF), could act alone to increase female receptivity. We now report that a second protein, termed 'plethodontid modulating factor' (PMF), acts oppositely to reduce female receptivity. The natural courtship pheromone blend thus includes two proteins that separately produce opposing messages, even though the combined effect of both proteins is to increase female receptivity.

AB Spotted hyaenas house cubs in communal dens during much of the early development period. This practice facilitates social integration of young into the clan's dominance hierarchy. For Crocuta, however, use of communal dens entails costs. Within a clan, social rank is correlated with individual privilege. If costs of denning communally likewise vary with rank, then breeding females may be forced to adopt different denning strategies accordingly. I quantified three costs (den access, visitor aggression, disruption to nursing bouts) in relation to maternal rank for 27 females within one clan. I examined denning strategies that may reduce costs (cub age when transferred to a communal den, social correlates of den selection, daily attendance pattern) to determine whether they varied predictably in relation to mother's rank. Although conflicts among mothers were infrequent, low-ranking females were more likely to be denied access to the communal den entrance and, possibly in response, more often attended their cubs when other mothers were absent. High-ranking mothers were visited more often, but treated less aggressively than were mid-or low-ranking mothers. In efforts to socialize with mothers and cubs, visitors often disrupted nursing bouts. Cub responses to nursing disruptions were correlated with cub survival. Mothers showed rank-related differences in den selection; high-ranking females occasionally chose dens with fewer occupants, while all other mothers chose dens containing the highest number of animals. Mid- and low-ranking mothers were attracted to dens containing high-ranking mothers and cubs. The potential benefits of affiliating with high-ranking individuals are discussed.

AB In mammals, high dominance rank among males is often associated with mating success. However, mating opportunities do not automatically translate into offspring production; observed mating success may be discordant with offspring production, for three reasons. (1) Observed mating may be nonrepresentative of actual mating if some mating is surreptitious (decreasing the chance that it will be observed), (2) mating may be nonrandom if some males allocate more mating effort to females with high fertility (i.e. if some males differentially invest in higher fertility mating) and (3) conception success may be nonrandom if sperm competition or sperm selection play a role in conception. We performed a genetic analysis of paternity in the well-studied savannah baboon, Papio cynocephalus, population in the Amboseli basin, eastern Africa, in order to measure the concordance between observed mating success and actual offspring production. We found that observed mating success was generally a good predictor of paternity success, that high-ranking males had higher paternity success than lower-ranking males, and that male density and male rank stability contributed to variance in male paternity success. We found little evidence for successful surreptitious mating (although subadult males did occasionally produce offspring, apparently using this strategy), and no clear evidence for differential sperm success or sperm depletion (although we could not rule them out). However, we found clear evidence that high-ranking males showed mate choice, concentrating their mating efforts on females experiencing conceptive rather than nonconceptive cycles.

AB Adoption is frequent in colonial animals where opportunities for dependent young to receive care from nonbiological parents are high. The departure of dependent young from their original family to seek adoption in neighbouring families is thought to be induced by sibling competition for access to limited resources provided by poor-quality parents. We tested this hypothesis in the colonial Alpine swift by manipulating the number of young reared per brood, with the prediction that offspring from enlarged broods switch nests more frequently than those from reduced broods. Although nestling swifts hatch with little locomotor activity, from 20 days until their first flight at 50-70 days they frequently move out of their nests to seek adoption in neighbouring families. Although nestlings reared in experimentally enlarged broods were lighter and their body mass at day 20 after hatching was more variable than in nestlings reared in reduced broods, there was no difference between the two treatments in the frequency of nests switching and in the age when nestlings switched nests for the first time. However, consistent with other evidence that nest switching by nestling swifts evolved as a strategy to reduce ectoparasite load, young from broods with naturally high numbers of the ectoparasitic louse fly Crataerina melbae were more prone to switch nests. This shows that ectoparasitism rather than sibling competition is a key proximate factor promoting the evolution of nest switching in the colonial Alpine swift.

AB Mate choice may vary according to various factors, such as mate availability and variation in mate quality. We tested seasonal changes in female choice regarding male size in a marine fish, the two-spotted goby, Gobiusculus flavescens. In this species, males occupy nests in which females lay their eggs and males thereafter provide exclusive parental care of the eggs until hatching. Females are predicted to prefer large males if, for example, they are better at competing for and defending nests. In this species, the opportunity for females to be selective should decline over the breeding season as the availability of males decreases. We therefore predicted a reduction in female choosiness with season. We conducted mate choice tests, during the early (May) and later (June) part of the breeding season, in which females were allowed to choose between males differing in body length. Females chose large males early in the season, but became unselective with respect to male size later on. This change in mate choice may be caused by a reduction in overall choosiness as a result of the decline in male availability with season. Alternatively, the change could be caused by a switch in choice cues used by females if factors other than male size become more important for female reproductive success later in the breeding season. Further studies are needed to test between these alternative explanations. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Avian brood parasitism reduces the success of parasitized broods, yet most hosts of brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, neither desert parasitized clutches nor eject parasite eggs. We investigated whether spatial and temporal patterns of repeated cowbird parasitism on individuals influence the benefits of desertion or ejection in prothonotary warblers, Protonotaria citrea, and red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus. First, we demonstrated spatiotemporal correlation of parasitism across subsequent years of breeding for individual females of both host species. Repeated parasitism of individual warblers occurred because females used the same nestboxes repeatedly, but parasitism was not related to cowbird preference for particular host females' phenotypes in either species. Second, we found that nest desertion by warblers was disfavoured because parasitism of sequential nesting attempts within a breeding season was significantly correlated for replacement clutches but not for second broods. In blackbirds, nest desertion was also not favoured because the likelihood of parasitism remained constant between first and replacement clutches of the same year. We then examined the relative fitnesses of two different cognitive pathways in the development of parasite rejection mechanisms based on a theoretical model for the benefits of egg ejection. Our models showed that the benefit of ejecting cowbird eggs based on learning to recognize the hosts' own eggs would be consistently reduced with repeated parasitism. In contrast, the benefits of an experience-independent egg-ejection mechanism would remain constant in the face of structured cowbird parasitism. Limited horizontal transmission of brood parasitism may affect host-parasite coevolution both by diminishing the fitness benefits of host resistance to costly parasitism and by shaping the ontogeny of hosts' recognition systems in response to repeated parasitism.

AB In birds, sibling competition encompasses several activities, one of which is jostling for position, that is, competing for the location in the nest where parents predictably deliver food items. We hypothesized that nestlings that compete by jostling for position may fall out of the nest either accidentally or because siblings push each other to reduce brood size. This hypothesis predicts that in a competitive environment needy nestlings trade-off the benefit of being fed against the cost of falling out of the nest. As a first attempt to evaluate this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated the number of young per brood in the colonial Alpine swift, Apus melba. Nestlings fell out of their colony more frequently when reared in enlarged than in reduced broods. Because brood size manipulation affects not only the number of young per nest but also their body condition, we analysed an extended data set to disentangle these two factors. This analysis showed that, independently of brood size, nestlings in poor condition and those reared in broods where sibling differed markedly in weight were more likely to disappear from the colony. Nestling disappearance also occurred predominantly in nests close to the colony entrances. Although nestling swifts can wander in the colony and become adopted in neighbouring nests, we found no evidence that wandering per se increased the risk of falling out of the colony. Our study therefore highlights a novel cost of scramble competition. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Based on differing roles during the breeding season, male pinyon jays are predicted to be more accurate than females in recovering cached seeds over long retention intervals. We additionally predicted that males should be able to accurately recover caches made by their mates over short and long retention intervals. We conducted four experiments to test these predictions. During experiment 1, we tested the accuracies of the jays' spatial memory at a short retention interval of 5-7 days. We tested their recovery of their own caches and caches made in their presence by their mate and a nonmate of the opposite sex. While females and males found their own caches with similar accuracy, males were more accurate in finding caches made by their mates. Experiment 2 used the same design for caching, but longer retention intervals of 1, 2 and 4 months. Males were more accurate than females in the longer month intervals. To test whether differences found indicated a broad difference in spatial cognition, in experiment 3 we tested nonmated male and female jays in an open-field analogue to the radial arm maze. There were no significant effects of sex for task acquisition, accuracies across retention intervals, or patterns of adjacent holes or errors chosen. In experiment 4, we compared nonmated males and females in cache recovery at long internals and found no sex difference in accuracy. In addition, neither sex was affected by opportunities for memory rehearsal. We conclude that spatial memory in pinyon jays may be a state-dependent trait: females tend to be less accurate after longer intervals when mated than when not mated.

AB In many gregarious species, including ducks and geese, being dominant provides more benefits than costs, because dominants have better access to resources essential for survival or reproduction. In geese, being in better body condition during migration towards the breeding grounds positively influences reproductive success. However, underlying proximate mechanisms linking prebreeding body condition on the wintering grounds to breeding success remain poorly understood. We investigated social dominance correlates and family status, in three consecutive winters, in a free-ranging, migrating, dark-bellied brent goose population. Families with juveniles dominated pairs, and pairs dominated singletons. Dominance rank did not increase with the number of juveniles per family. Males were dominant over females. Social dominance and reproductive status for a given winter were significantly correlated with body mass, body size and body condition during the previous winter, suggesting that body condition in winter also affects subsequent breeding success and hence also dominance. Levels of testosterone and triiodothyronine were not correlated with immediate or later dominance or reproductive status. We discuss the role of family status as a signal of social status in determining reproductive strategies. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Males of the bushcricket Poecilimon mariannae are parasitized by the acoustically orienting fly Therobia leonidei. Developing fly larvae reduce male bushcricket survival and reproductive effort. We estimated potential lifetime reproductive success (PLRS) of male bushcrickets to investigate the likely costs of this parasitism. Our analysis explored the relative reduction in PLRS caused by parasitoid infection by examining effects on survival, calling attractiveness and spermatophylax size. We also incorporated nonparasitoid-related mortality. Parasitized males lost 42% of their PLRS compared to nonparasitized males. The shortened life span after parasitism accounted for half of the PLRS reduction. Decreased spermatophylax production also had a major effect on PLRS, while decreased calling attractiveness had a smaller effect. This fitness loss was context dependent and changed with extrinsic nonparasitoid-related mortality. If nonparasitoid-related mortality was high, the selection on host males to avoid parasitism was weak; if it was low, parasitized males lost a considerable amount of reproductive opportunities compared with unparasitized males.

AB Animals from numerous taxa use auditory information to functionally deceive other individuals, either by producing or withholding various vocal signals. However, little empirical evidence has demonstrated that any nonhuman species recognizes how manipulating auditory information can alter the knowledge state of other individuals. We explored whether one monkey species, the rhesus macaque, understands the connection between hearing and knowing. Monkeys were presented with the opportunity to take grapes from a human competitor who was looking away. One of two grapes was placed inside a silent container, and the other was placed inside a noisy container. We predicted that subjects would selectively choose the silent container over the noisy container, because the noisy container might alert the human competitor to the subject's actions. As predicted, subjects reliably took the grape from inside the silent container when the competitor was not looking. In contrast, subjects chose randomly when the competitor was looking and therefore already knew about the subject's approach. These results demonstrate that monkeys preferentially attempted to obtain food silently only in conditions in which silence was relevant to obtaining food undetected.

ID HYMENOPTERA; DYNAMICS; COLONIES; GENUS; TIME
AB We investigated how foragers are activated in colonies of the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus. Each day, a harvester ant forager makes many trips out of the nest to gather seeds and bring them back to the nest. The rate at which foragers return to the nest is linked to food availability: when food is easy to find, foragers return more quickly. We examined how the return of successful and unsuccessful foragers influences the rate at which inactive foragers are stimulated to leave the nest on subsequent trips. In field experiments, successful or unsuccessful returning foragers were removed before they reached the nest. Foraging activity in response to removals was compared to that in computer simulations modelling the effect of returning foragers on departure rate. Field experiments showed that forager departure rates were not affected by the return of unsuccessful foragers, but depended strongly on the return of successful foragers. The results corresponded to the model in which inactive foragers were instantaneously stimulated to leave the nest by the return of each successful forager, and not to three other models that required inactive foragers to remember elapsed time or events. The results of field experiments were thus consistent with a simple behavioural rule that is sufficient to adjust foraging intensity to current food availability.

AB The golden jackal, Canis aureus, and the red fox, Vulpes vulpes, are two common canids in Israel. Although the two species have similar diets, the jackal is about three times larger than the red fox. The current evidence for interspecific competition between these two canids is circumstantial and indirect. In this study we aimed to measure experimentally the response of red foxes to increasing exposure to the presence of the golden jackal. Our field experiments comprised three stimuli: urine as a scent stimulus, a mounted specimen and urine as a static animal-image stimulus, and a caged pet animal as a live animal stimulus. The treatment and control were placed near food trays, and the behaviour of foxes around these trays was documented by video recorders. In most cases, the presence of scent or cast of a golden jackal did not alter the behaviour of the foxes. However, foxes avoided the test arena when a live jackal was present. This finding provides strong evidence that red foxes fear jackals, and shows that foxes are more concerned when a live jackal is present. The possible implications of the observed fox behaviour for the understanding of large-scale competitive exclusion among canid species are discussed.

AB Females often prefer to mate with males with certain traits. Preferred males might cooperate with females to reduce the direct costs of reproduction. However, unpreferred males use alternative tactics that attempt to alter female choice in their favour, such as coercion. When this occurs, females have to choose whether to pay the costs of coercion and mate with preferred males or avoid the costs of coercion by mating with unpreferred males. The decisions females make are expected to depend on the relative costs and benefits of mating with preferred and unpreferred males and the frequencies of the two male types. Here I present a study of simultaneous coercion and cooperation among wild coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch. This species is well known for its alternative male types, sneakers and fighters. I found evidence that females prefer to mate with, and cooperate with, small sneaker males, but regularly mate with large fighting males to avoid the costs of coercion. Large males were more aggressive towards females than were small males. In addition, females spent more time preparing their nests when they were alone with small males than when they were accompanied by large males, and they oviposited for longer durations when small males were part of the spawning group.

AB Trophically transmitted parasites may predispose infected hosts to predation by altering host behaviour, which can be either an adaptation of the parasites to enhance transmission to the next hosts in the life cycle or a nonadaptive side-effect of infection. In an experimental study, we investigated host manipulation by Diplostomum spathaceum (Trematoda), an eye fluke of fish, to evaluate its adaptive value as a parasite strategy to increase transmission efficiency to bird hosts. The parasite induces cataract formation in the lenses of fish eyes, and predisposes fish to predation by reducing their escape response. We examined the effect of developmental stage and the number of parasites on parasite-induced cataract formation and the susceptibility of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, to simulated predation (capture by dip-net). We found that the catchability of fish increased with the coverage of parasite-induced cataract. Furthermore, cataract formation was most intensive after eye flukes had completed their development, and host manipulation took place only when parasites were infective to birds and thus capable of being transmitted. Intensity of infection, however, did not affect vulnerability of fish to capture by dip-net. These findings suggest that the ability of the parasite to manipulate fish behaviour by impairing its vision may have resulted from selection preferring parasite genotypes with higher transmission efficiency.

AB Although bird song is thought to be important in mate attraction, little is known about how females perceive differences in song and which specific elements of song females prefer. Most studies, to date, have examined female choice during preference tests for song stimuli, and most have treated females with oestrogen prior to testing. At present, it is unclear whether song preferences during such tests reflect actual mate preferences. This study tested the hypothesis that experimentally altering male courtship vocalizations (song) would affect female mate choice and the formation of long-term socially monogamous relationships. Male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were vocally distorted using two minor and reversible techniques. Females in a two-choice paradigm preferred control males over vocally distorted or muted males. In a pair bond formation experiment, all control males had paired 5 days into the study, whereas only one vocally distorted male had paired. By the end of 2 weeks, however, four nerve-transected males and one air-sac-punctured male had paired. These results suggest that females do use song quality as a basis for choosing males. However, other male qualities may eventually override vocal quality as the basis for female choice. 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   PREFERENCES; IMMUNOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS
AB A major cost of social behaviour is the increased risk of exposure to parasites. Female mice discriminate between uninfected males and males infected with parasites such as the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus, on the basis of social cues, displaying aversive responses to the odours of infected males and preferentially mating with nonparasitized males. Here, using female mice whose gene for the neuropeptide, oxytocin (OT), has been deleted (OT knockout mice, OTKO), we show that at least one normal allele for OT is required for the discrimination, individual recognition and avoidance of H. polygyrus parasitized males on the basis of odour. In an odour choice test, female wild-type (OTWT) and heterozygous (OTHT) mice displayed a marked initial choice for the odours of uninfected males over infected males that were either familiar or novel, whereas the OTKO females showed no consistent initial choice. This was not associated with olfactory deficits because females of all three genotypes distinguished between the odours of uninfected males of varying sexual states. A 1-min exposure to the odours of infected males also induced analgesic responses (i.e. pain inhibition) in OTWT and OTHT females, with the OTKO females displaying a markedly attenuated analgesia. These analgesic responses and the associated behavioural correlates of anxiety/fear facilitate the expression of a reduced interest in and avoidance of parasitized males by females. The OTWT and OTHT, but not the OTKO females, also distinguished between the odours of novel and familiar infected males and modulated their analgesic responses on the basis of prior familiarity, displaying reduced analgesia to familiar males and enhanced analgesia to novel males. Our findings indicate that a normal OT gene is an essential part of the central mechanism whereby females can, on the basis of odour, discriminate between parasitized and nonparasitized males and, thereby, both reduce the transmission of parasites to themselves and select for parasite-free males.

AB Body size-age relationships may have important implications for the evolution and maintenance of alternative mating tactics, but these relationships remain largely unexplored in anuran amphibians (frogs and toads). In a single territorial anuran species, smaller noncalling 'satellite' males are younger than calling males. These results have led to the general assumption that such an age difference also holds for other anuran species with body size differences among behavioural. phenotypes. However, individuals of many organisms show different developmental and/or growth trajectories that correspond to variation in adult morphology and behaviour. To test the generality of smaller satellite males being younger than larger calling males in anurans, we examined body size-age-behaviour relationships in Woodhouse's toads, Bufo woodhousii, and Great Plains toads, B. cognatus. Age estimates, based on skeletochronologic analysis of lines of arrested growth (LAGs) from phalanges, indicated that males sampled while adopting a noncalling satellite tactic were smaller, but not younger, than males sampled while adopting a calling tactic. Furthermore, examination of inter-LAG areas of bone deposition indicated that smaller satellite male B. woodhousii showed lower growth rates relative to calling males. A similar trend occurred for B. cognatus. We discuss our results in the context of developmental patterns associated with alternative mating tactics in other species and endocrine regulation of behavioural tactics in anurans.

AB Learning of olfactory and gustatory cues occurs throughout the adult stage of parasitoids, particularly during host location and patch exploitation. A loss of learning capacities could affect both the whole host-parasitoid system and the wasps' reproductive success. We analysed the effect of low-temperature exposure on learning, patch exploitation strategies and patch-leaving rules used by Anaphes victus (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae). Females were stored 0, 3, 6 and 12 weeks at 4 degrees C at the second larval instar. After emergence, females were offered three successive patches containing 16 hosts, of which 0, 50 and 100%, respectively, were parasitized, and their foraging behaviours were recorded. Cold-exposed females oviposited fewer eggs, seemed less able to learn external marks (or did not use their learning capacities), oviposited more in already parasitized hosts and used different patch-leaving rules to control females. The degree of the change in behaviour was positively correlated with the duration of cold exposure. Low-temperature exposure thus affected the reproductive success, expression of learning, host discrimination ability and patch-leaving decision rules of the parasitic wasps. We discuss the implications of these effects on the pattern of patch exploitation for biological control and field situations. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviotir.

AB Parasitoids are ideal organisms for testing theories concerning the trade-off between current and future reproduction. Upon encountering a host, a female has to decide whether to lay an egg, and thus invest in her current reproduction, or feed on the host to invest in her future reproduction. Theory predicts that the optimal female decision will depend on the costs and benefits of host feeding. The benefits of host feeding are well understood, but there is a lack of data on the associated costs. Models developed so far have assumed costs to be fixed: a host used for feeding cannot be used for egg laying and thus represents zero returns in terms of future reproduction. We investigated the costs and benefits of host feeding in Nasonia vitripennis, one of the many parasitoid species that can feed and lay eggs on the same host. Host feeding increased egg production but had no effect on the longevity of females; it also reduced the fitness of female offspring by significantly decreasing their size at emergence (no equivalent effect was found in male offspring). Female offspring size was negatively correlated with the extent of host feeding that had taken place in the host from which they emerged. The costs of host feeding in this species are therefore not fixed but vary according to the amount of nutrients extracted from the host. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study or Animal Behaviour.

TI Bayesian analysis of linear dominance hierarchies
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID ORDER
AB Studies on social animals often seek to identify dominance hierarchies, in which individuals are ranked according to competitive abilities based on counts of wins and losses in pairwise encounters. I illustrate Bayesian approaches, based on the method of paired comparisons, for determining ranks and for estimating relationships between dominance ability and other attributes. Bayesian inference combines prior probability distributions for each unknown parameter with likelihood functions to produce the joint posterior probability distribution for the quantities of interest. In contrast to nonparametric techniques for inferring ranks, Bayesian models yield measures of certainty for each inference and allow rigorous estimates of correlations between ranks and covariates even when there is considerable uncertainty as to the ranks themselves. A possible objection to the Bayesian approach is that it appears to entail more restrictive assumptions than do simpler methods. However, simulations show that Bayesian inferences are more robust to deviations from these assumptions than are the results of nonparametric methods.

AB The extent to which two parents are related to each other can strongly influence the fitness of the offspring. Although females should choose mates based on the level of genetic similarity, current evidence suggests that behavioural kin discrimination in birds is limited and may preclude this possibility. We investigated the potential for cryptic sperm selection in the polyandrous, lek-breeding ruff, Philomachus pugnax. In direct sperm competition between two males, the one that fertilized the majority of offspring was most often least genetically similar to the female. This was not due to intrinsic male qualities such as sperm mobility or ejaculate size, because the predictive variable is the genotype of one male relative to that of the female and of the other competing male. This is an extrinsic quality and an individual male may be favoured in one competitive triad (a female and two competing males) but not in another. This finding has implications for the extent to which birds can adaptively optimize outbreeding, even in the absence of the behavioural ability to discriminate genetic similarity and has broad implications for sexual selection in birds, a taxon in which high levels of genetic polyandry are the norm.

AB We used genetic parentage analysis and radiotracking to determine how far male Acadian flycatchers travel from their territory in search of extrapair matings. Acadian flycatchers on our study site have a linear spatial distribution of territories associated with watercourses. With this type of spatial arrangement, males have only one or two immediate neighbouring females within 100 m and therefore have limited opportunities for extrapair (EP) fertilizations unless they travel far from their territory. In our sample of 53 nests collected over 4 years, 58% of nests contained EP young and 40% of nestlings were EP young. We identified the EP sire and the location of his territory at 13 nests with EP young, and over half (7/13) were not immediate neighbours. The mean distance between the territory of the EP sire and the territory where he attained EP fertilizations was 526 in. We were also able to exclude all immediate neighbours as EP sires for 12 additional nests containing EP young. The minimum average distance between an EP sire's territory and the territory containing an EP young that he sired was estimated to be 9 10 in. Overall, the EP sire was a neighbour in only 24% of nests with EP young. Radiotelemetry observations showed that six of seven mated males made off-territory forays and averaged 0.4 forays/h. Males travelled an average of 202 m off-territory (range 50-1500 m) and were away from their territories an average of 10.2 min/foray. Because our findings contrast sharply with those of other studies examining extrapair fertilization in passerines, in which most extrapair sires are neighbours, we suggest that when males have few adjacent neighbouring females, the benefits of searching widely to increase the number of potential extrapair mates can outweigh the costs of EP forays.

AB The interaction between the sensory properties of food plants (i.e. taste and smell) and their postingestive consequences is thought to be an important mechanism by which browsing herbivores learn about the toxic and nutritional properties of foods. The extent to which this mechanism is important when multiple food options are available, each differing in concentrations of both nutrients and plant secondary metabolites, is little known and was tested using goats as a model browsing herbivore. Twenty-four juvenile female goats, Capra hircus, were offered branches of four conifer species, with one species being offered per day on 4 successive conditioning days per week for 5 weeks. On conditioning days, animals were dosed orally with a mixture of two stimuli according to their treatment allocations. Treatments consisted of combinations of a positive (sodium propionate) and a negative (lithium chloride) postingestive stimulus, both imposed at one of four levels. Preference was assessed on the fifth day by offering all species simultaneously for 20 min and measuring relative consumption. From the first week, goats responded in a dose-dependent fashion to lithium chloride by reducing their relative preference of associated conifer species as the dose increased. However, they did not modify their choices with the variation in sodium propionate intensity. Comparisons with other experiments which did not use the conditioning method suggest that in complex situations with many stimuli, animals may need additional preingestive cues to perceive the whole value of the food, particularly for assessing nutrient rewards of food plants.

AB The risk of predation is a strong force shaping many aspects of animal behaviour. Early detection and efficient avoidance strategies not only help prey to survive, but also limit the negative impact predation has on other aspects of their lives. The type of antipredator strategy an animal uses must depend on its ability to collect accurate information on the risks to which it is exposed. However, models attempting to predict when a prey animal should escape from an approaching predator often assume that the prey has accurate information on a predator's distance and direction of approach. To test whether such models could be applied to a prey animal with restricted sensory capabilities, I explored the predator avoidance behaviour of the fiddler crab Uca vomeris by approaching crabs with small dummies intended to mimic a hunting tern. The crabs responded strongly and reliably to the simple dummies. They were clearly sensitive to risk and responded more often and earlier, the further away they were from their refuge. The probability of response was most strongly influenced by how directly and therefore how closely the dummies approached the crabs and reached 100% for very direct approaches. Surprisingly, however, the crabs responded later when the dummies approached them more directly. I argue that this counterintuitive result reflects a lack of reliable information on the predator's distance and movement relative to the crab and its refuge, because like many small animals, crabs cannot measure the distance to a predator. I conclude that general models attempting to predict when animals should respond to an approaching predator need to incorporate the information that prey animals have available at the time of response.

AB Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, switch between the cryptic solitarious phase and the swarming aposematic gregarious phase with increased population density. We tested whether solitarious- and gregarious-phase locusts respond differently to hyoscyamine, a plant alkaloid that protects against predators. Solitarious-phase locusts were deterred by the taste of this compound and discriminated against it in long-term choice tests. Gregarious-phase locusts readily accepted the alkaloid and fed equally from a choice of foods that did or did not contain hyoscyamine. Solitarious insects that had begun the transition to the gregarious phase (i.e. that had been crowded) accepted and even seemed to prefer food containing the alkaloid. We did not detect any physiological costs associated with consuming hyoscyamine. Solitarious-phase locusts avoid predator detection through crypsis and would not benefit greatly from consuming toxic plants. Gregarious-phase locusts follow a foraging strategy found in other aposematic grasshoppers: they switch frequently between food plants with little regard to allelochemical content, and could acquire antipredator defence by feeding on a variety of toxic plants. Solitarious locusts in transition to the gregarious phase might benefit more from chemical defence than isolated individuals because predator avoidance learning is enhanced when distasteful prey are aggregated. Phase differences in locust feeding behaviour form part of integrated cryptic and aposematic antipredator strategies that also include differences in coloration and aggregation.

AB Scramble competition for mates selects for traits that increase an individual's ability to efficiently locate mates. We tested the hypothesis that scramble competition for mates is the cause of sex differences in spatial ability among meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus. Specifically, we tested the predictions that males with better spatial ability have larger home ranges, visit more females' nests, and achieve greater reproductive success. We also tested the prediction that receptive females would mate with the first male that they contacted. The spatial ability of wild-caught males was quantified using the Morris water maze. Males with known spatial ability were released into enclosures for two field experiments. In the first experiment, we determined the males' home range sizes using radiotelemetry. In the second experiment, we quantified males' visits to nests by housing females in nestboxes with one-way doors and checking the boxes for male visitors twice daily. Paternity was determined by amplifying polymorphic loci using nine microsatellite primers. We found that males with better spatial ability had larger home ranges and made more visits to different nestboxes than did males with poorer spatial ability. Males with better spatial ability did not, however, sire more litters or pups. This finding may have been the result of female mate choice based on traits other than spatial ability. Females also did not always mate with the first male that they encountered.

AB We tested the predictions that the frequency of aggression, degree of resource monopolization and individual size variation within groups would decrease as patch size and predation risk increased. In a preliminary experiment, groups of 10 convict cichlids, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, were allowed to compete for food presented in either small (20.7 cm(2)) or large (208.7 cm(2)) patches. As predicted, the frequency of aggression and size variation within groups decreased and the number of fish feeding at any particular time increased as patch size increased. In small, defensible patches, the increased aggression by dominant individuals apparently excluded some fish from the foraging patch, causing an increase in size variation within groups. In a second experiment, we manipulated patch size and perceived predation risk (addition of conspecific skin extract versus distilled water) in a 2 x 2 factorial design. There were significant interactions between the two main effects for all three dependent variables. In small patches, increasing the perceived predation risk caused a decrease in aggression and size variation within groups and an increase in the number of fish foraging at a time, whereas in large patches, increasing the perceived predation risk had no significant effect on aggression, but decreased the number of fish feeding, resulting in an increase in size variation within groups. In defensible patches, increasing perceived predation risk had the same effect as reducing the economic defensibility of the patch. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mormyrid electric fish communicate using a fixed electric organ discharge (EOD) produced with a variable sequence of pulse intervals (SPI). Through a combination of spike train analysis techniques and multivariate statistics, we develop quantitative methods for analysing temporal patterns in the SPI in Brienomyrus brachyistius. Previous research has indicated the existence of distinct temporal patterns that play an important role in social behaviour, but these studies have relied upon subjective assessments of the SPI: no study has yet used quantitative methods for analysing temporal patterns, so it remains unclear whether there are categorically distinct displays or continuous variation. We demonstrate the existence of three modal classes of frequency modulations (bursts) that differ categorically in their temporal patterning and can therefore be appropriately termed displays. 'Scallops' are stereotyped, transient bursts to EOD intervals of 10-20 ms. 'Accelerations' are maintained decreases in EOD interval to values of 25-40 ms. Evidence indicates that 'rasps' combine a scallop followed by an acceleration. Analysis of signal characteristics and their production in relation to several variables, combined with previous research, suggests that accelerations function as aggressive signals, rasps as male courtship signals, and scallops as advertisement signals. This descriptive study is an important first step in the analysis of temporal patterns in the SPI, and provides a foundation for addressing general issues in animal communication. The relative simplicity of their electric communication displays suggest that mormyrids are an excellent model system for studying the evolution, function and mechanisms of stereotyped temporal pattern generation.

ID EVOLUTION; MEMORY; DISCRIMINATE; ABILITY; FRUIT
AB Although the fitness benefits of learning are well understood, we know little about its costs; yet both are essential to understand the evolution of animal learning. We tested the hypothesis that learning has an operating cost, such that an animal repeatedly forced to use its learning ability would show a reduction in some fitness component(s), relative to an animal of the same genotype that does not have to learn. Five 'High-learning' lines of Drosophila melanogaster, which had been selected for improved learning ability, 0 were exposed to 12 consecutive 48-h cycles of alternating conditioning treatment under mild nutritional stress. Their learning score first increased, reaching a maximum around day 12 (i.e. the sixth conditioning cycle), and then progressively declined. These changes were not due to ageing, as they were not observed in flies from the same lines maintained under standard conditions. From around day 12, the productivity (egg-laying rate) of the flies in the conditioning treatment became progressively reduced, relative to flies from the same lines not exposed to conditioning, but otherwise kept under the same food-limited conditions. This reduction in productivity was not observed when these treatments were applied to five 'Low-learning' lines, which had not been exposed to selection, and which show no detectable response to conditioning under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, exposure to repeated cycles of conditioning revealed an apparent trade-off between the learning score and productivity among the 'High-learning' lines. These results indicate an operating cost of learning, paid only by genotypes that show learning, rather than general effects of stress caused by the conditioning regime. Potential proximate explanations include (1) the impairment of oviposition decisions caused by the accumulation of memory interference and (2) energy costs of collecting, processing and storing information.

AB Cooperation and social support are the major advantages of living in social groups. However, there are also disadvantages arising from social conflict and competition. Social conflicts may increase allostatic load, which is reflected in increased concentrations of glucocorticoids. We applied the emerging concept of allostasis to investigate the relation between social status and glucocorticoid concentrations. Animals in a society experience different levels of allostatic load and these differences may predict relative glucocorticoid concentrations of dominant and subordinate individuals. We reviewed the available data from free-ranging animals and generated, for each sex separately, phylogenetic independent contrasts of allostatic load and relative glucocorticoid concentrations. Our results suggest that the relative allostatic load of social status predicts whether dominants or subordinates express higher or lower concentrations of glucocorticoids. There was a significant correlation between allostatic load of dominance and relative glucocorticoid concentrations in both females and males. When allostatic load was higher in dominants than in subordinates, dominants expressed higher levels of glucocorticoids; when allostatic load was similar in dominants and subordinates, there were only minor differences in glucocorticoid concentrations; and when allostatic load was lower in dominants than in subordinates, subordinates expressed higher levels of glucocorticoids than dominants. To our knowledge, this is the first model that consistently explains rank differences in glucocorticoid concentrations of different species and sexes. The heuristic concept of allostasis thus provides a testable framework for future studies of how social status is reflected in glucocorticoid concentrations.

AB Migratory birds replenishing their fuel stores have to decide when to leave their stopover site for the next flight bout. We studied whether the decision to leave a stopover site depends on wind and rain conditions. From capture-recapture data of 1153 European robins collected during three autumns at a stopover site in Switzerland, we estimated the daily emigration probability with a newly developed multistate capture-recapture model that accounts for the occurrence of transients. We tested whether the variation in the daily emigration probabilities can be explained by wind speed, wind direction (both on the ground and 300 m above ground) or rain. Variation in emigration probability was largely explained by variation in wind at 300 m and rain. The emigration probability was highest (0.5) during nights with no or weak (<1.5 m/s) winds at 300 m and no rain, intermediate (0.15-0.2) on nights without rain and with medium wind (>1.5 m/s), and on nights with weak winds (<1.5 m/s) and rain; and almost zero during nights with rain and strong winds at 300 m. Wind direction at 300 m and wind conditions (speed and direction) on the ground had no influence on departure decision. We suggest that birds may consider cues other than wind speed at ground level to predict wind speed at higher altitudes, and that they consider wind direction only when aloft by selecting an optimal flight altitude. Wind speed aloft and rain appeared to be significant factors that synchronize bird migration spatially and temporally.

AB Over the last three decades, empirical evidence has been accumulated indicating that displaced homing pigeons, and most likely other birds as well, are able to navigate home by deducing positional information from atmospheric trace gases perceived by olfaction. I briefly describe the most important results leading to this unexpected conclusion and experiments revealing the decisive role of winds at the home site. A hypothesis trying to explain the results proposes that proportional relationships among a number of atmospheric trace compounds (which determine the quality of a resulting odour) show fairly regular spatial distributions with gradient character. Gas-chromatographic analyses of air samples in an area covering 400 km in diameter revealed that differently oriented ratio gradients of volatile hydrocarbons do in fact exist. They are fairly resistant against, but not independent of, changes of wind direction. Using the measured atmospheric data as inputs, a model system is able to simulate homing navigation on a performance level similar to that observed in pigeons. Results of both pigeon experiments and air analyses are incorporated into an earlier ('preolfactory') concept of a hypothetical gradient map linked with a sun compass, which is now modified and furnished with more concrete physical substrates. Winds are identified as the crosslink embedding atmospheric ratio gradients into a directional reference scale provided by the periodically moving sun and the, geomagnetic field. Kramer's 'map-and-compass concept' is reconsidered. As crucial questions are still unsolved, olfactory navigation remains a challenge for future research.

AB In species living in social groups, aggression among individuals to gain access to limiting resources can lead to the formation of stable social hierarchies. We tested whether dominance rank in social groups of sponge-dwelling cleaning gobies Elacatinus prochilos in Barbados was determined by physical attributes of individuals or by prior experience of dominance, and examined the foraging consequences of dominance rank. Intraspecific aggression within groups resulted in stable dominance hierarchies that were strongly correlated with fish length. Dominant individuals maintained exclusive territories while subordinate fish occupied broader home ranges. Larger, competitively dominant fish were able to monopolize areas inside the sponge lumen with the highest abundance of the polychaete Haplosyllis spp., a favoured prey item, and achieved the highest foraging rates. The removal of a territorial individual from large groups resulted in a domino-like effect in territory relocation of the remaining fish as individuals moved to the territory previously occupied by the individual just above them in the group hierarchy. Individuals added to existing groups generally failed to gain access to territories, despite being formerly dominant in their original groups. When given the opportunity to choose a location in the absence of larger competitors, gobies frequently preferred positions that were previously defended and that had abundant food. These results suggest that intraspecific competition for resources creates the observed dominance structures and provides support for the role of individual physical attributes in the formation and maintenance of dominance hierarchies.

TI Effect of resource competition on the long-term allocation of grooming

AB Seyfarth (1977, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 65, 671-698) proposed an influential model that explained the long-term patterning of grooming relationships between female primates in terms of an interaction between the idealized grooming objectives of females and competition for valuable grooming partners. A critical test of the model requires a demonstration not only that competition for partners exists, but also that females do have an underlying target for the amount of grooming that they would like to receive relative to the amount they need to give. As it is not possible to stipulate a priori what this target is, or to detect it directly, we assessed its applicability by making a set of predictions, within the framework of Seyfarth's model, as to how observed grooming patterns should change with changes in the intensity of resource competition. We tested the se predictions with data from a troop of baboons, Papio hamadryas ursinus, for which the within-bout structure of grooming has already been shown to be sensitive to changes in resource competition (Barrett et al. 2002, Animal Behaviour, 63, 1047-1053). We found no evidence of competition for grooming partners and our results do not support the predictions of the modified model with respect to the existence of underlying grooming objectives. The findings that the grooming of female baboons is more diverse and that the mean rank distance separating partners increases when resource competition is greater, together with the absence of rank effects on long-term patterns, are, however, supportive of the recent biological market approach to social interactions.

AB Optimal migration theory depends to a large extent on the range equation, that is, a function relating potential distance moved to fuel load. Such range equations derived from aerodynamic principles exist for birds. I derive an analogous range equation for animals that run based on biomechanical principles. The range for animals that run is proportional to ln(1/+f), where f is the relative fuel load at departure and relates the mass at departure (m) to the lean mass (m(o)) as m=(1+f) m(o). Predictions pertaining to migration decisions, such as optimal stopover duration, fuel load and detours around barriers, can thereby be made for animals other than birds. I hope this paper will stimulate further experimental tests regarding migration decisions in suitable animal systems. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Ants as central place foragers are known to visit repeatedly renewable patches such as extrafloral nectaries, yet the criteria workers use to evaluate their quality, as well as the rules used to decide when to leave the patch, have not been identified. We examined the assessment of nectar flow rate by nectar-feeding ants, Camponotus rufipes. Single workers from a laboratory colony were trained to visit an artificial feeder providing 20% sucrose solution either ad libitum or at controlled flow rates (0.118-2.36 mul/min). These flow rates simulate the conditions faced by workers when visiting plant extrafloral nectaries. Ants adjusted their visit times to the different flow rates, so that the time spent at the feeder decreased with increasing nectar flow rates. The volume of nectar collected increased with increasing nectar flow rates, and workers were observed to return to the nest with partially filled crops. To investigate the rules used by ants to decide when to depart from the patch, we confronted experienced workers on their fifth visit with a depleted patch, and recorded the time spent there before leaving. The time depended on the previously experienced flow rate, even though ants always found a depleted patch, indicating that ants arrive at the patch with an expectation about the nectar flow rate, and use as a departure rule an estimate of time that depends on the flow rate previously experienced.

   EVOLUTION; COLONIES; DOMINANCE
AB Kin selection theory predicts potential conflict between queen and workers over male parentage in hymenopteran societies headed by one, singly mated queen, because each party is more closely related to its own male offspring. In 'late-switching' colonies of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, i.e. colonies whose queens lay haploid eggs relatively late in the colony cycle, workers start to lay male eggs shortly after the queen lays the female eggs that will develop into new queens. It has been hypothesized that this occurs because workers recognize, via a signal given by the queen instructing female larvae to commence development as queens, that egg laying is now in their kin-selected interest. This hypothesis assumes that aggressive behaviour in egg-laying workers does not substantially reduce the production of new queens, which would decrease the workers' fitness payoff from producing males. We tested the hypothesis that reproductive activity in B. terrestris workers does not reduce the production of new queens. We used microsatellite genotyping to sex eggs and hence to select eight size-matched pairs of 'late-switching' colonies from a set of commercial colonies. From one colony of each pair we removed every egg-laying or aggressive worker observed. From the other colony, we simultaneously removed a nonegg-laying, nonaggressive worker. Removed workers were replaced with young workers from separate colonies at equal frequencies within the pair. There was no significant difference in queen productivity between colonies with reduced or normal levels of egg-laying or aggressive workers. Therefore, as predicted, reproductive B. terrestris workers did not significantly reduce the production of new queens.

AB We tested the general assumption that enrichment of the housing environment is rewarding to laboratory rats, Rattus norvegicus. We used the behavioural response in anticipation of a forthcoming reward as a measure of the rewarding property of a simple enriched cage. For this, a Pavlovian conditioning schedule was applied to announce the oncoming transfer to an enriched cage. The response of rats in anticipation of this transfer was compared with that of rats that expected sexual contact, transfer to a standard cage or forced swimming. We also characterized the behavioural profile of the anticipatory response, because until now only general descriptions of this behaviour have been available. The strong increase in activity in anticipation of both an enriched cage and sexual contact and the similar response in terms of the behavioural elements analysed indicate that the appraisal of access to an enriched cage shares a common denominator with the perception of sexual contact. Because sexual contact is generally accepted to have highly rewarding properties to rats, we concluded that the enriched cage is highly rewarding as well. The anticipatory response for sexual contact or an enriched cage was clearly different from the anticipation for access to a standard cage or a forced swim session, indicating that the anticipatory response is related to the positive nature of the stimulus. In general, anticipation appears to be quantifiable by the level of activity measured by the total frequency of behavioural elements displayed. Some behavioural elements, such as exploration, locomotion, arousal and grooming, seem to be more specifically related to the nature of the forthcoming stimulus.

   PATERNITY; SURVIVAL; FEMALE; BIRDS; LIFE; TITS
AB In some species of birds, individual adults feed different subsets of the brood after the young have left the nest. However, few studies have shown that such 'brood division' represents long-term separation into subfamilies, rather than short-term biases in care, and the function of brood division is unknown. Most functional hypotheses assume that brood division is an adult adaptation to increase reproductive success; others suggest that fledglings are responsible for brood division, or that brood division is the outcome of conflicts of interest within families. We tested for long-term brood division in the white-browed scrubwren, Sericornis frontalis, a cooperatively breeding passerine, and assessed functional hypotheses, using behavioural, morphological and molecular evidence. We found that 71% of scrubwren broods became divided in the second week after fledging, and remained divided for the following 4-5 weeks of care. Furthermore, most individual young were fed almost exclusively by a single adult, even in undivided broods and broods of one. Brood division did not arise through adults caring for young of a specific sex, nor did genetic paternity explain division. Tests of other hypotheses were indirect, relying for example on testing mechanisms rather than predictions. We rejected the hypotheses that brood division was primarily an adaptation to reduce the mean or variance in predation, or that it was likely to increase the rate at which young were provisioned. Fledglings probably had an active role in maintaining brood division, with fledglings that had been biggest in the nest tending to be fed by adults that had fed nestlings at the greatest rate. This suggests that the most dominant fledgling may sequester the care of the best feeder. We also found evidence that brood division might be an adult adaptation to reduce the effects of sibling competition, or that it might arise through conflicts of interest among adults. We further suggest that social specialization, resulting from learning about a particular individual, might bring additional advantages to long-term brood division.

AB We compared nestling begging calls of four hosts (reed warbler,, Acrocephalus scirpaceus; great reed warbler, A. arundinaceus; dunnock, Prunella modularis; and meadow pipit, Anthus pratensis) and the respective host-races of the common cuckoo. Note structure varied between host species, but not between cuckoo host-races, so cuckoos did not vary their call-note structure to match that of their hosts' chicks. Call rate increased with age, but there were marked differences between both host species and cuckoo host-races. Dunnock-cuckoos called more rapidly than reed warbler-cuckoos despite growing at the same.-rate. We suggest this difference reflects how cuckoos tune into the way these host species respond to begging signals from their own young, because dunnock chicks called. much more rapidly than reed warbler chicks. Great reed warbler-cuckoos called at a lower rate than reed warbler-cuckoos when young, but at a greater rate when older than 8 days. This could also result from the cuckoo chicks tuning into differences in the way these. hosts respond to begging signals. However, great reed warbler-cuckoos grew at a faster rate than the other cuckoo host-races, so they may also call faster to demand higher provisioning rates from this larger host. To test these hypotheses critically,. data are needed on:how the different host species integrate visual and vocal begging signals from their own broods. We discuss how differences in cuckoo begging might develop, given that cuckoo host-races are restricted to female cuckoo lineages. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PREFERENCES; SEX; AVOIDANCE; BENEFITS
AB Brooding behaviour is a likely cue to a female's reproductive status and therefore a potentially important factor in male mate assessment. We induced brooding behaviour in adult female Japanese quail by exposure to foster chicks for five 20-min trials over 3 days. In two experiments, we assessed the influence of this brooding behaviour on male mate choice in Japanese quail using an established mate choice paradigm. In each experiment we gave males a choice between two-females presented simultaneously and measured preference by-the time spent in proximity to each. In the first experiment, a mate's preference for the initially preferred female significantly decreased after he had seen her brooding three chicks. In the control condition, male preference for an initially preferred female remained relatively consistent over consecutive trials if he did not see her brood chicks. These results suggest that females who, are brooding chicks are less attractive to male Japanese quail. Further evidence from the second experiment substantiates this finding, and strongly suggests that males are averse to behavioural cues from maternal females, rather than the mere presence of chicks.

AB In all species of penguins studied to date, the display call, or parental call, has been demonstrated experimentally to facilitate identification between mates and between chicks and parents. We investigated parent-chick recognition in two nesting species, the Adelie penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae, and the gentoo penguin, P. papua. Through playback experiments, we tested the capacity of chicks to recognize the parental call at varying levels of background noise. By using modified calls, we found that chicks of neither species used temporal characteristics of the parental call (variations in frequency or amplitude with time) for individual recognition, but that both species used a simpler parameter, the pitch of the call. This finding contrasts with the more sophisticated use of acoustic cues by chicks of two non-nesting species, identified in earlier work. These differences in auditory processing of parental calls may have evolved because of different ecological constraints, particularly whether recognition of a nest site supports mutual identification of parent and offspring.

AB Five microsatellite loci were used to determine paternities in six Apis mellifera colonies headed by naturally mated queens. The last inseminating males were identified by collecting and genotyping the mating sign left in the genital tract of each queen. Significant differences in paternity frequencies were observed between males, but the proportion of worker and queen offspring sired by the last inseminating drone did not differ significantly from those of other drones. Each male kept his rank of precedence for the different cohorts, although the variance in subfamily proportions decreased over time, most notably in the colony displaying the lowest level of polyandry. These results suggest that, if sperm competition exists in the honeybee, it does not significantly increase the fitness of the last inseminating drone. The spermatozoa of the different inseminating drones are not totally mixed before they reach the spermatheca, in particular when only few males mate with the queen. The weak difference in the subfamily proportions observed between queen and worker samples confirms that nepotistic interactions are rare. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Potential reproductive conflicts are common in social insects and may occur between and within castes. In multiqueen (polygyne) colonies of ants, reproductive conflicts among coexisting queens may be resolved by aggressive interactions and/or by pheromonal signalling. Pheromonal signals may be directed at workers, which may adjust the reproductive shares of queens behaviourally. Workers are expected to favour a queen that is more likely to be their mother and to produce offspring of close kin to them. We used microsatellite markers to study reproductive partitioning between cobreeding Formica fusca queens in a laboratory experiment where workers received a choice between two queens. We expected queens of this species to communicate their reproductive status by chemical communication, because no aggressive interactions between queens have been observed. We found that queens of different reproductive status (with majority, minority or no production) differed in their cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles. The fecundity of a queen was associated with worker behaviour; the higher a queen's fecundity, the more attention she received from workers. Our results suggest that a queen fecundity signal is encoded in her CHC profile and acts as a pheromone for workers, which respond to the signal by discriminating between queens.

AB Three major behavioural mechanisms underlying sexual selection in many systems are male-male competition, female choice and male-female conflict. We used path analysis to evaluate the relative importance of these mechanisms in generating sexual selection on a, suite of male traits in the stream-dwelling water. strider, Aquarius' remigis. To gather data for the analysis, we quantified the morphology (total length, limb length, forefemur width, genital length), behaviour (activity), mating frequency, mean mating duration and overall mating success of 96 adult males over a 10-day period. Males varied considerably in mating success. Over the 10 days, individual males mated 0-14 times, spending 0-67% of their time in copula. Path analysis showed that male-male competition was important in favouring larger males with longer limbs that tended to be more active. Active males should encounter females more frequently. In water striders, almost all male-female encounters result in intense premating struggles pitting female resistance to mating against male insistence. This male-female conflict favoured larger males with longer genitalia. These traits help males overcome female resistance. Female choice was expressed via female-controlled variation in mate-guarding durations. Female choice favoured smaller males perhaps because they are lighter, less expensive 'shields' against harassment by other males. Male size thus affected mating success via all three behavioural mechanisms. Weak, overall sexual selection favouring larger males was the product of conflicting effects: male-female conflict strongly favouring larger males and male-male competition weakly favouring larger, males, offset by female choice favouring smaller males. Separate analyses for warmer versus, colder days showed that on colder days (daily high below 20degreesC), male-male competition was the main mechanism generating variation in mating frequency, while on warmer days, both male-male competition, and male-female conflict were important.

AB Stumptailed macaques, Macaca arctoides, are characterized by high levels of postconflict affiliative contacts between opponents. We investigated the occurrence of postconflict affiliative contacts between opponents and third parties that were not involved in the original conflict. We collected 10-min focal observations during postconflict and control periods in which we recorded all aggressive and affiliative behaviours between opponents and third parties. We distinguished three types of third parties depending on the relationship with the focal animal: own kin, opponent's kin and individuals unrelated to both opponents. We analysed the interactions with third parties separately, while distinguishing two classes of affiliative behaviours: (1) allogrooming and contact sitting and (2) sociosexual behaviours (e.g. genital inspection). The macaques showed differences between postconflict and control periods in their affiliative contacts with third parties. Aggressors received more postconflict grooming and contact sitting from their opponents' kin, received more sociosexual behaviour from their own kin and unrelated individuals, and directed more sociosexual behaviour to unrelated individuals. Victims received and directed less postconflict grooming from and towards their own kin. They received more postconflict sociosexual behaviour from all partners except their own kin and directed more sociosexual behaviour to all partners except the opponent's kin. This study establishes the occurrence of multiple postconflict triadic affiliation in stumptailed macaques, and is the first to show that victims receive contacts from third parties in a cercopithecine species, a behaviour previously described only in chimpanzees. It also highlights the importance of analysing the different affiliative behaviours separately in postconflict situations. Otherwise, many of the patterns we report, especially those involving victims, would have been missed. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ability to generalize a familiar image to visual transformations like a mirror image or a left-right transformation may allow recognition of familiar images from a different viewpoint. As this problem applies to flower recognition by honeybees, Apis mellifera, we asked whether bees transfer acquired information about a previously rewarded pattern to its mirror image and/or its left-right transformation, and which are the mechanisms involved in such a transfer. Bees were trained either with a single pair of patterns or with six different pairs of patterns presented in a random succession. Within each pair one pattern was rewarded and the other not. All patterns had four quadrants, each displaying a different stripe orientation. In multiple-pattern training the six rewarded patterns shared a common configuration different from that of the six nonrewarded ones. After both kinds of training, the bees preferred the mirror image and the left-right transformation of the rewarded pattern (or rewarded configuration) to a novel pattern. They also preferred the left-right transformation to the mirror image. We explain this performance by: (1) matching with a retinotopic template of the trained patterns after training with a single pair of patterns; and (2) matching with a generalized pattern configuration after training with a randomized series of patterns. In the second case, orientations would be bound together in a specific spatial arrangement. Bees would associate a specific orientation with each retinal quadrant and approach the pattern provided that a particular quadrant contains a particular orientation. Although both strategies are based on comparison of an image currently perceived with one that has to be accessed from memory, they constitute different options as the former is less flexible while the latter allows for categorization of novel patterns.

AB Cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps, appears generally consistent with state-dependent models of individually selfish antipredator behaviour. We examined further detailed aspects of this cooperative behaviour, including the suggestion that by engaging in this behaviour sentinels advertise their status and gain social prestige. Chosen sentinel locations were higher, but no more exposed, than the best alternative locations within 25 m. Sentinels started off closer to the centre of the foraging group than when sentinel bouts were terminated. Change-overs between sentinels were nearly always due to previous sentinels terminating their own bout. On the rare occasions when bouts were interrupted by upcoming sentinels, physical contact or aggression was extremely rare. Dominant males tended to terminate sentinel bouts of other birds, interrupting especially the dominant females. Other than this, there was no effect of an individual's sex or dominance rank on any aspect of sentinel change-overs or location choice when acting as a sentinel. There were also no differences in any sentinel activity between simple family groups, and those more complex nonfamily groups within which individuals compete for reproduction. Rates of alarm calling did not differ between group members, although dominant males did make more territorial calls to neighbouring groups while acting as a sentinel. Therefore, we found relatively little evidence that individuals compete for the chance to act as a sentinel as a means of showing off within groups of Arabian babblers. Instead, our study confirms the primary function of sentinels as a system of cooperative vigilance. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Primates use social grooming to service coalitions and it has been suggested that these directly affect the fitness of their members by allowing them to reduce the intrinsic costs associated with living in large groups. We tested two hypotheses about the size of grooming cliques that derive from this suggestion: (1) that grooming clique size should correlate with relative neocortex size and (2) that the size of grooming cliques should be proportional to the size of the groups they have to support. Both predictions were confirmed, although we show that, in respect of neocortex size, there are as many as four statistically distinct grades within the primates (including humans). Analysis of the patterns of grooming among males and females suggested that large primate social groups often consist of a set of smaller female subgroups (in some cases, matrilinearly based coalitions) that are linked by individual males. This may be because males insert themselves into the interstices between weakly bonded female subgroups rather than because they actually hold these subunits together.

AB In biparental species, parents often cooperate by emphasizing different parental roles. However, these parental sex differences often disappear when only one parent is present. For example, under natural conditions, the female convict cichlid fish, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, typically remains with the offspring while the male spends most of his time patrolling the territory and chasing intruders. With the removal of the mate, either parent is capable of raising the offspring alone, and when doing so, they each perform all parental roles. We tested how the presence and absence of the mate and the presence and absence of an intruder influence parental sex-role specialization in A. nigrofasciatus. When presented with an intruder, widowed males left the offspring unattended more often and spent more time attacking the intruder compared with widowed females. For intact pairs, males showed a tendency to leave the offspring more than their mates but this sex difference was not significant. However, these paired individuals rarely left the offspring unattended. With an intruder present, paired males and females spent the least amount of time with the offspring (compared with widows and paired individuals without an intruder present), with males spending significantly more time with the intruder than females. Unlike pairs without an intruder, parents with an intruder changed roles only in support of the other parent. Thus, females rarely approached the intruder unless the male was also present and the male rarely approached the offspring without the female also being present. We speculated that the male's inability to remove the intruder caused females to support the male in attacking the intruder and the male returned to the offspring and joined the female during those periods when the intruder was least threatening.

AB Behavioural ecology is currently undergoing a paradigm shift, with the traditional concepts of the choosy, monogamous female and the coadapted gene complex increasingly giving way to the realization that sexual reproduction engenders conflicts, promotes polyandry, and thereby provides females with a cryptic arsenal of postcopulatory processes with which to safeguard their investment in large, costly eggs. As research focuses on reproduction from the female perspective, evidence is emerging that polyandry can provide genetic benefits that enhance female reproductive success. In this review, we propose that reproductive mode is a critically important factor influencing the type of genetic benefits that females gain by mating with more than one male. Among the hypotheses that propose genetic benefits to polyandry, there is a distinction between those that posit benefits from intrinsic (additive) effects of paternal genes in offspring, and those that propose a benefit resulting from defence against incompatibility. Polyandry to acquire superior paternal genes and polyandry as a defence against incompatibility are not mutually exclusive hypotheses. However, evidence from reproductive physiology, immunology and evolutionary conflict theory suggest that development of the embryo within the female makes polyandry for incompatibility avoidance far more important for viviparous females than for females that lay eggs.

AB We investigated the effects of a vertically transmitted, feminizing parasite on mate choice and precopula guarding in its crustacean host Gammarus duebeni. Males guard females in precopula for several days before mating at the time of egg laying. They choose females on the basis of size and time to laying. We investigated two alternative hypotheses. (1) The parasite manipulates host behaviour leading to increased pairing success for infected females. (2) Male G. duebeni avoid the costs of parasitism by mating selectively with uninfected females. We also compared the morphology and activity of uninfected and infected females. We found no evidence for parasite manipulation of host mating success. Pairing success did not differ between uninfected and infected females at the point of collection in the field. There was no difference in the morphology or activity of uninfected and infected females and infected females showed no changes in their response to male mate-guarding attempts. We also found little evidence for selective mating by males with uninfected females. Males showed no preference for uninfected versus infected mates in laboratory choice tests. However, males guarded uninfected females for longer in laboratory conditions, suggesting that males ale willing to invest more in guarding uninfected mates. Our results are in accordance with previous predictions of reduced virulence for vertically transmitted parasites. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Colourful signals in insects, fish, amphibians, lizards and birds have attracted considerable attention among evolutionary biologists. While primates display the most conspicuous secondary sexual coloration in mammals, little is known about its function. In several types of organisms, variation in colour predicts differences in social status. For this study, I experimentally investigated the relationship between scrotal colour and social status in adult vervet monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus, by analysing the social interactions between pairs of unfamiliar males matched for size, but differing in scrotal colour. Differences in scrotal colour predicted eventual social status, as males with a dark scrotum dominated those with a pale scrotum. Experimental modification of scrotal colour failed to confirm that scrotal colour alone signalled social status, but supported the finding that males with scrota of similar colour were more antagonistic towards each other than males differing in colour. These results represent the first experimental evidence for a relationship between colour and social status in primates. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Anuran release vocalizations prevent prolonged amplexus of males by conspecific and heterospecific males, whereas advertisement vocalizations potentially act as a premating isolation mechanism. Selection favouring prompt release during heterospecific amplexus should result in convergent character displacement in release vocalizations. Conversely, selection should produce divergent character displacement in advertisement vocalizations. I examined call properties important to mate recognition from release and advertisement vocalizations of allopatric and sympatric populations of Bufo fowleri and B. terrestris to determine whether the two calls exhibit opposing patterns of character displacement. Results indicated convergent character displacement in the periodicity of release vocalizations (a measure equal to the inverse of pulse rate and an estimate of release vibration rate). The periodicity of advertisement vocalizations was significantly displaced from the allopatric character state resulting in greater divergence in sympatry. However, this parameter was already largely divergent in allopatry and, therefore, results were not consistent with the pattern expected for divergent character displacement. The dominant frequency of sympatric advertisement vocalizations was not significantly displaced from allopatry. Results for advertisement vocalizations provided evidence that convergence of release vocalizations was not the result of hybridization. There was no evidence that clinal variation accounted for displacement of call characteristics. Convergent character displacement in the periodicity of release vocalizations may facilitate interspecific communication during heterospecific amplexus, whereas divergent advertisement vocalizations promote species isolation.

AB The behaviour of house cats Felis silvestris catus from nine litters was recorded at 4 months, 1 year and 2 years of age, in their home environment immediately after meals fed by their owners. We extracted by principal components analysis four elements of 'behavioural style' that were consistent from one age to another: based upon behaviour patterns that were most heavily loaded on each component, these were labelled as Staying Indoors, Rubbing, Investigative and Boldness elements. The Staying Indoors and Rubbing elements are similar to two aspects of behavioural style identified in a previous study of adult cats; the Boldness element, possibly coupled with the Investigative element, may be similar to the shy/bold continuum identified in controlled studies of cats and other species. Four-month-old male cats were the most likely;to Stay Indoors; the Rubbing element increased with age in the majority of individuals, both male and female. Littermates tended to be similar to one another in Rubbing (at 4 months) and Boldness (up to 1 year). A positive effect of handling received during the first 8 weeks of life was detected for Boldness at 4 months of age. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many species of orchids that do not offer food rewards to pollinators bloom in clusters, early in the season, and are polymorphic for corolla colour. Previous studies suggest that the foraging behaviour of insect pollinators may select for early blooming and colour polymorphism. I tested whether pollinator behaviour can also favour aggregated flowering in these species, in a two-stage laboratory experiment on naive bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (L.). In the first stage, the bees were allowed to forage on three colours of artificial flowers that contained sucrose rewards. In the second stage, I added nonrewarding flowers of a fourth colour and recorded the bees' visits to them. The four types of artificial flowers were either arranged in spatially distinct clusters, or were randomly intermingled. I used two reward schedules for each spatial arrangement: constant refilling of reward-containing flowers and probabilistic refilling. Bees that foraged on clustered flowers flew more often to the nonrewarding patch, and made more visits to nonrewarding flowers, than bees that foraged on intermingled flowers. This tendency was obtained both in the constant reward and in the probabilistic reward schedules. The results Support the hypothesis that pollinator attraction may select for clustered, synchronized blooming in flowers that do not contain nectar and pollen rewards.

   SIZE; AGE
AB Eggs often suffer high levels of predation and, compared with older animals, embryos have few options available for antipredator defence. None the less, hatchlings can escape from many predators to which eggs are vulnerable. I studied early hatching as an antipredator defence of red-eyed treefrog embryos, Agalychnis callidryas, in response to egg predation by social wasps (Polybia rejecta). Red-eyed treefrogs attach their eggs to vegetation overhanging;water, where they are exposed to arboreal and aerial predators. Wasps attacked half the egg clutches and killed almost a quarter of the eggs I monitored at a natural breeding site in Panama. Hatching tadpoles fall into the water, where they face aquatic predators. As predicted from improved survival of older hatchlings with aquatic predators, most undisturbed eggs hatched relatively late. However, many younger embryos directly attacked by wasps hatched immediately. Embryos attacked by wasps hatched as much as a third younger than the peak undisturbed hatching age, and most hatching embryos escaped. Thus hatching is an effective defence against wasp predation, and plasticity in hatching stage allows embryos to balance risks from stage-specific egg and larval predators. Wasp-induced hatching is behaviourally similar to the snake-induced hatching previously described in A. callidryas, but occurs in fewer eggs at a time, congruent with the scale of the risk. Individual embryos hatch in response to wasps, which take single eggs, whereas whole clutches hatch in response to snakes, which consume entire clutches. Embryos of A. callidryas thus respond appropriately to graded variation in mortality risks. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB This review identifies four receiver psychology perspectives that are likely to be important in the design and evolution of warning signals. Three of these perspectives (phobia, learning and prey recognition) have been studied In detail, and I include a brief review of recent work. The fourth, a memory perspective, has received little attention and is developed here. A memory perspective asks, 'how might warning signals function to reduce forgetting of avoidances between encounters?'. To answer this question I review data from psychology literature that describe important features of animal long-term memory. These data suggest that components of warning signals may function to reduce forgetting land therefore increase memorability) by (1) preventing forgetting of learnt prey discriminations; (2) jogging the memories of forgetful predators; and (3) biasing forgetting in favour of prey avoidance when the warning signal of a defended aposematic species is copied by an edible Batesian mimic. A combination of a learning and a memory perspective suggests that the features of aposematic prey that accelerate avoidance learning may also be the features that decelerate forgetting processes. If correct, this would have important implications for the comprehension of signal design. Finally, I suggest that the cryptic appearance of an edible prey may decelerate predator learning and accelerate predator forgetting, to the benefit of the prey. In terms of learning and memory, crypsis may be an antisignal. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We compared screams of four species of macaques (rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta; pigtailed monkey, M. nemestrina; Sulawesi crested black macaque, M. nigra; stumptailed macaque, M. arctoides) with respect to predictions of Morton's motivation-structural rules (Morton 1977, American Naturalist, 111, 855-869). We examined screams produced by victims of attack that involved contact aggression (pulling, pushing, Slapping, grappling and biting) from a higher-ranking opponent. For each macaque species, we digitized 100 screams from females 3 years of age or older and measured acoustic features of each call. We used discriminant function analysis to determine whether the 400 vocalizations could be assigned to the correct caller species on the basis of their acoustic structure. Calls were assigned to the correct species at a significantly higher rate (93.5%) than expected by chance (25%). Each of the four macaque species used acoustically distinct screams in a shared context. While the differences in the macaque species' vocalizations suggest no simple correlation between immediate context and the acoustic forms of screams, there was general correspondence between the acoustic structure predicted by motivation-structural rules and inferences about the internal state of the vocalizer derived from the typical intensity of aggressive patterns that characterize each of the four species.

AB I experimentally manipulated levels of food abundance and density of competitors to determine how these factors influence the territory size of juvenile steelhead trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Steelhead trout were held in artificial stream channels and I followed cohorts that were fed at one of three levels of food abundance and stocked at one of three levels of fish density. By measuring territory size over a 2-month period, while the fish were glowing, I was also able to assess the effects of body size in determining the size of a territory. Defended and foraging areas;were similar in absolute size, but the frequency of space use was different for defence than for foraging. As predicted, territory size decreased with increasing levels of food abundance and increased with decreasing levels of fish density. In addition, territory size increased with increasing body size even after controlling the effects of food abundance and competitor density. In comparison to previous studies, territory size of steelhead trout changed more dramatically in response to changing levels of food and competitors. For territorial animals with indeterminate growth, territory size is not only adjusted as a trade-off between the costs and benefits of defence, but also with respect to body size due to increasing metabolic demands as individuals grow.

AB Wintering birds increase their fat reserves throughout the day, and impaired escape performance is often considered to be an important cost of fat reserves. Since lifting a larger mass requires more energy, if birds escape at maximum power output, an increase in mass will impair the escape flight. In this study we did not find support for mass-dependent escape performance for yellowhammers, Emberiza citrinella, and greenfinches, Carduelis chloris, with natural daily mass increases of 7-8%. This suggests either that the birds were not performing at maximum output at dawn, when light, or that maximum power output was higher at dusk, when heavy. Either way the birds seemed to be able to put more effort into their escape flight when heavier. In both species, when alarmed, birds took off significantly faster and at a steeper angle than when not alarmed. Yellowhammers escaped at a higher speed and angle than greenfinches, and reacted faster to the predator model. This suggests that predator escape is more than just Newtonian physics, and may be influenced by behavioural, as well as morphological, adjustments. Different species may have evolved different responses to predation risk. Our results seem to be in disagreement with recent ideas about mass-dependent predation risk. However, to build up reserves, birds have to increase exposure time, which increases predation risk. This cost may be more important than impaired escape performance when relatively small, daily, changes in body mass are considered. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We have developed a novel model to study the correlated evolution of behavioural and morphophysiological traits in response to selection for increased locomotor activity. We used selective breeding to increase levels of voluntary wheel running in four replicate lines of laboratory house mice, Mus domesticus, with four random-bred lines maintained as controls. The experiment presented here tested for correlated behavioural responses in the wheel-cage complex, with wheels either free to rotate or locked (environmental factor). After 13 generations, mice from selected lines ran 2.2 times as many revolutions/day as controls on days 5 and 6 of initial exposure to wheels (10 826 versus 4890 revolutions/day, corresponding to 12.1 and 5.5 km/day, respectively). This increase was caused primarily by mice from selected lines running faster, not more minutes per day. Focal-animal observations confirmed that the increase in revolutions/day involved more actual running (or climbing in locked wheels), not an increase in coasting (or hanging). Not surprisingly, access to free versus locked wheels had several effects on behaviour, including total time spent in wheels, sniffing and biting. However, few behaviours showed statistically significant differences between the selected and control lines. Selection did not increase the total time spent in wheels (either free or locked), the frequency of non locomotor activities performed in the wheels, nor the amount of locomotor activity in cages attached to the wheels; as well, selection did not decrease the amount of time spent sleeping. Thus, wheel running is, at the genetic level, a largely independent axis of behaviour. Moreover, the genetic architecture of overall wheel running and its components seem conducive to increasing total distance moved without unduly increasing energy or time-related costs. The selection experiment also offers a new approach to study the proximate mechanisms of wheel-running behaviour itself. For example, frequencies of sniffing and wire biting were reduced in selected females but not males. This result suggests that motivation or function of wheel running may differ between the sexes.

AB We compared the ability of coal tits, Parus ater (a food-storing species), great tits, P. major, and blue tits, P. caeruleus (two nonstoring species) to remember spatial locations in a spatial delayed-matching-to-sample task. Presentation of a single sample image on a touch screen was followed by a choice phase containing two, three or four images, in which the bird had to choose the original image. Storers made more correct choices than did nonstorers. Performance was affected by the proximity of the distracters: both groups performed less well when distracters were close to the sample although storers were less affected by proximity of distracters than were nonstorers. Both groups made correct decisions sooner than errors. We conclude that the accuracy of spatial memory in food-storing birds is greater than that of nonstorers.

AB We studied the laying behaviour of shiny cowbirds, Molothrus bonariensis, parasitizing brown-and-yellow marshbirds, Pseudoleistes virescens. Shiny cowbirds lay two egg morphs, spotted and white immaculate. Brown-and-yellow marshbirds eject the white egg morph but accept the spotted morph. The incidence of parasitism in this host was 66.5%, and half of the parasitized nests had more than one shiny cowbird egg. There was a positive relationship between the number of parasitic events and the availability of nests in the laying stage, but parasitic events reached a plateau when the availability of nests was high. The distribution of parasitic eggs per nest was more clumped than expected by chance. Shiny cowbird females synchronized parasitism with host laying in 80% of the cases. They seldom parasitized nests before the host started laying or after the nest had been deserted or predated. The majority of multiply parasitized nests were parasitized by more than one female. Females that lay white eggs did not avoid parasitizing brown-and-yellow marshbird nests. Egg pecking by cowbird females resulted, on average,in one egg lost per parasitic event and the probability of being broken was greater for host eggs when host and parasitic eggs where both in the nest.

AB We studied green, Chelonia mydas, and loggerhead, Caretta caretta, turtles nesting on the island of Cyprus to determine the effects of flipper tagging on postovipositional behaviour and reproductive success. Tagging was undertaken immediately after oviposition (64 green turtles; 111 loggerheads). On 12 occasions, loggerheads immediately stopped covering the eggs and proceeded directly to the sea. No green turtles abandoned nesting. In all other cases, where sufficient data were collected, the duration of the two postovipositional phases of nesting behaviour (covering and camouflaging) and the speed of descent to the sea did not differ between tagged and untagged turtles. The durations of behaviours also did not differ between females not tagged, tagged once or tagged twice. There was no effect of tagging on the likelihood of hatching or on the hatching success of clutches in either species. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID BEES; VARIANCE; BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB We tested the risk-sensitive foraging preferences of wild rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, with three types of artificial flowers. All three flower types provided the same mean volume of 30 mu l of sucrose, but differed in terms of variability of the reward: constant, low variance and high variance. In trinary comparisons, subjects preferred the low-variance reward over the constant reward, and the constant reward over the high-variance reward; a result not predicted by risk-sensitive foraging theory. However, when tested with traditional binary comparisons, hummingbirds showed conventional risk-averse behaviour and selected the constant reward over the low-or high-variance rewards. This reversal of preference represents a context-dependent foraging preference. The utility of selecting intermediate levels of risk and the source of the preference reversal are discussed relative to risk-sensitive foraging theory and the effects of local context on foraging choices.

ID JUVENILE ATLANTIC SALMON; SIZE; SALAR; PARR
AB We present an. individual-based model describing the distribution and resource gain of territorial individuals in situations where the rank order of territory quality changes over time. The model integrates both competitive (territory-holding ability) asymmetries and a memory function. A balance of effects resulted in a peak in movement rates, but not resource gain, for individuals of intermediate ability. Furthermore, when the system was reduced to a linear array of territories (as commonly used in empirical studies) the model generated quite different predictions because of the severe limitation in movement that the linear array imposes. We suggest that the model can be used to generate testable predictions for territorial species such as salmonids, and that future empirical work should take into account the consequences of reductions in movement imposed by a linear array of territories.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID ARANEAE; INFORMATION; STRATEGIES; ARANEIDAE; PREDATOR; BEHAVIOR; TACTICS
AB Orb-web spiders often relocate their webs when they assess a web site as prey poor. When a spider spins its web at a new site, it may not be able to assess the prey availability at the site accurately on the first day, owing to stochastic variation in foraging success, but it is gradually able to make an assessment. Therefore, a spider's foraging behaviour may change according to how long it has been at its current web site. To test this possibility, we conducted a prey removal experiment, with the spider Cyclosa argenteoalba, to compare the response to prey deprivation of spiders that were on new sites with that of spiders that had been at a site for several days. Spiders in both groups had a higher relocation rate than the natural rate, but more spiders in the new-site group relocated their webs. Spiders thus seemed to use previous experience of prey capture at a web site to decide whether to relocate their web. The total length of silk thread in a web was greater on the second day at a new web site than on the first. We suggest that spiders minimize their investment in web threads until they are certain that the web site is prey rich. (C) 1999 The Association fbr the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We carried out behavioural observations to investigate the function of long-term investment in vocal display by fallow bucks during the breeding season. The measures of long-term investment used were the date of initiation of vocal activity, the number of days vocal during the breeding season, and the proportion of time spent vocalizing. We analysed data from 3 years (1993_1995) to assess' the relationship between the date of initiation of vocal activity, and the number of days vocal, and age, dominance rank and mating success. Observations from a sample of focal males in 1996 were used to determine the effect of the proportion of time; vocal during the breeding season on dominance rank and mating success. The majority of socially immature males (less than or equal to 3 years old) did not vocalize; among socially mature males (greater than or equal to 4 years old), dominance rank was more important than age in explaining variation in vocal activity. The onset of vocal activity by fallow bucks was not a direct consequence of the presence of mating opportunities since the first males became vocal more than 3 weeks before any matings occurred. Long-term investment in vocal activity did not alter the dominance relationships that had been established between males before they became vocal. When we considered all mature males from 3 years of observations, the majority of matings were achieved by those that had high rank, initiated vocal activity early during the breeding season and remained vocal on most days. For the 1-year sample of mature males, the factor most highly correlated with mating success was the proportion of time that males spent vocalizing during the mt. Thus we have shown a strong relationship between the time invested in vocal;display by fallow bucks and their mating success. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB This study examines the effects of harsh environmental conditions on life history trade-offs in parental care in a marine fish, the common goby, Pomatoschistus microps. We compared male parental care and hatching success over two sequential brood cycles in fish breeding in conditions of either low dissolved oxygen or normal levels of oxygen. Males compensated for a low oxygen environment by increasing the time they spent fanning water over their eggs, as well as their fanning tempo. They also increased the frequency of egg-directed activities and decreased nest-building activities. Males in the low oxygen treatment lost more weight than control fish during the first spawning, and were more likely to abandon care during the second spawning. Males that completed care under low oxygen conditions did not differ from control males in the hatching success of their offspring or the size of young at hatching, but hatching started on average 1 day later. Thus, greater parental allocations to offspring while breeding in a harsh environment led to reduced future allocations. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   BEHAVIOR; PREY; WEB; STRATEGIES; HABITAT; PREFERENCES
AB The wolf spider, Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz), varies foraging patch residence time in the presence of different sensory cues from prey, even without food rewards. This study examines the influence and interaction of hunger state, age and sex on the use of different types of sensory information to determine foraging patch sampling duration. In a series of two-chambered artificial foraging patches, I tested 26 S. ocreata once as immatures, and again as adults, under two hunger states (satiated and 7 days without food). Patches varied in the type of sensory information provided by live prey (crickets) as follows: visual cues alone; vibratory cues alone; combined visual/vibratory cues; and control (no prey). Without feeding in patches, the type of sensory stimuli available from prey strongly affected patch residence time, with spiders using primarily visual rather than vibratory cues. Hunger level as a main effect had no influence on residence time, but hunger state did mediate the importance of visual or vibratory information. Significant age- and sex-related differences in patch residence time in the presence of different sensory cues were found. These data suggest that ontogenetic and sex-specific foraging strategies are influenced by use of prefeeding perceptual cues rather than hunger state in wolf spiders.

AB To test the causes and consequences of variation in natal dispersal in root voles we released 53 matrilines (mothers with newly weaned litters) separately in field enclosures, during nine consecutive periods. The matrilines could disperse and distribute themselves among three pre-emptied habitat patches. Two dispersal measures were recorded: short-distance dispersal defined as individuals immigrating to a neighbouring patch, and long-distance dispersal defined as unsettled individuals captured along the fence of the enclosures. We analysed the role of social factors (i.e. maternal and litter characteristics), habitat quality (i.e. seasonal effect) and experimentally manipulated shape of the natal patch in dispersal. The consequences of dispersal were analysed with respect to the spatial distribution of kin, and to pregnancy in females and sexual maturation in males. Dispersal was unrelated to patch shape. In agreement with the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis, long-distance dispersal was male biased and philopatric males were most frequently reproductively inactive. Whilst young males avoided their mother, they seemed to disperse, settle and mature sexually independently of their sisters. In agreement with the resource competition hypothesis, young females avoided their mother and were most frequently reproductively inactive when residing in their mother's patch. We conclude that inbreeding avoidance was underlying the male dispersal pattern. For females, long-distance dispersal was most in agreement with the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis while short-distance dispersal could be explained by the resource competition hypothesis.

   DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; LONG SPERM; COPULATION DURATION; FEMALE
   RECEPTIVITY; MATING PATTERN; SIZE; EUPYRENE; PSEUDOOBSCURA
AB Members of the Drosophila obscura species group exhibit sperm heteromorphism in which males simultaneously produce two different morphologies of sperm, short and long. Short sperm represent at least 50% of the ejaculate in several species but do not function in fertilization and thus, the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon is unknown. Selective pressures associated with the risk of sperm competition have been suggested to explain the maintenance of sperm heteromorphism. Here I test: (1) whether males alter their behaviour or ejaculate characteristics in response to the risk of sperm competition, and (2) whether short, nonfertilizing sperm serve as 'cheap filler' in the female reproductive tract, thereby delaying female receptivity to subsequent matings. Males did not alter tactics based on the risk of sperm competition; copulation durations of males mated to nonvirgin females were unexpectedly shorter than when both sexes were virgin and, contrary to sperm competition predictions, males did not alter the ratio of fertilizing:nonfertilizing sperm relative to female mating status or female age. Short sperm had a small, if any, role in influencing female remating behaviour. The number and proportion of short sperm present in sperm storage organs did not differ between nonvirgin receptive and nonvirgin nonreceptive females. The proportion of short sperm present in the ventral receptacle, however, was lower in receptive than nonreceptive females. Remating behaviour was strongly linked to oviposition patterns. Nonvirgin receptive females oviposited more eggs than nonreceptive females, and female remating interval was positively related to both the number of eggs and progeny produced. Although, oviposition parameters are related to fertilization and thus, the use of long sperm, nonvirgin receptive and nonreceptive females did not predictably differ in the number or proportion of long sperm in storage. These results suggest oviposition per se is probably more important than sperm in determining female receptivity and that sperm heteromorphism may play a marginal, if any, role in affecting female remating.

AB We report a negative correlation between the weight of a female convict cichlid, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, and the magnitude of her defence against a model brood predator for a brood reduced to 100 eggs. We account for this relationship by the fact that a larger female is more likely to spawn a larger number of eggs than isa smaller female, making a fixed number of eggs relatively less valuable to the larger female. We performed two supplementary experiments that eliminated other logical explanations of the data. One experiment involved scaling the model brood predator. Results indicated that the size of model relative to the parent (over the range of ratios investigated) has no significant effect on magnitude of defence. The other experiment demonstrated no systematic trend in defence when brood number was unmanipulated. Thus, on average,; larger females defended their naturally larger broods to the same extent as smaller females defended their smaller broods. Together, these three results suggest that female convict cichlids of different sizes do not value the same brood number equally. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In this study we describe the signature headbob displays of seven of the eight extant species of Cyclura iguanas using data collected from the field and from captive animals. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to estimate the ancestral states of several measures of the headbob displays, including number of headbobs and the duration of headbobs and inter-bob pauses. Divergence in the headbob display among species has been substantial, with some major changes occurring within only a few (about six) generations. Otherwise, results are consistent with those obtained previously for other lizards which suggest that there is an evolutionary limit on the total duration of headbob displays. Differences in the results obtained using different phylogenetic methods suggest that although estimates of ancestral states are reasonably robust to violations of evolutionary assumptions, we cannot determine the standard errors of those ancestral phenotypes accurately without more detailed information about the types of forces (e.g. selection, drift) underlying evolutionary change in these traits. In particular, within-species variation had a substantial impact on the standard errors of estimated ancestral states, and should be included in such estimations whenever possible. Finally, our results emphasize the importance of conserving behavioural as well as genetic diversity in trying to preserve endangered species for possible reintroduction into the wild.

AB The bright plumage of male ducks in sexually dichromatic species is thought to have evolved through intense sexual selection. This study examined the relationship between the timing and speed of moult into this bright plumage and subsequent mating success of male harlequin ducks, Histrionicus histrionicus. Males that moulted relatively slowly had a lower chance of establishing a pair bond than others. The timing of moult was unrelated to whether a male obtained a mate. Moult speed and timing were not correlated within individual males, but were significantly repeatable in individual males over 2 years. Moult speed probably reflects the condition of males, whereas timing of moult is more likely to be related to the distance to an individual's breeding area, which determines the timing of arrival to the moulting grounds. In waterfowl species that have been studied, males usually form dominance hierarchies before pairing and females tend to choose dominant males. We suggest that male harlequin ducks that moult slowly are poor-quality individuals, which are relegated to subordinate status and are unlikely to attract a mate the following autumn.

AB I studied the relationship between behaviour and plasma testosterone level (T) and the seasonal changes in T and plasma corticosterone levels (B) in male red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus. I measured T and B using radioimmunoassay, and on the day after taking blood, I observed each male's behaviour for 60 min. The time that males spent conspicuously perched and the number of songs were positively correlated with T, but the proportion of time spent conspicuously perched and the frequency of song were not correlated with T. The frequency of aggressive encounters, sexual chases, epaulet exposure when singing and flights within the territory were positively correlated with T, suggesting a direct role for circulating testosterone influencing male aggressive behaviour. Both T and B increased early in the breeding season, peaked when the first females were receptive, and decreased through the remainder of the breeding season. Late in the season, the presence of a receptive female caused males to have increased T. The peak in T when the first females were receptive, the positive correlation between aggression and T, and the response to a receptive female with increased T support predictions of the challenge hypothesis. T was positively correlated with B, suggesting a cost to the males of maintaining high T. When a receptive female was present on the male's territory, T was negatively correlated with date. Male red-winged blackbirds ir Indiana may respond less to receptive females late in the season when benefits associated with protecting paternity and gaining extra-pair fertilizations decrease.

ID MALE BETTA-SPLENDENS; SOCIAL-ISOLATION; COHABITATION; EVOLUTION; DISPLAY
AB Zahavi's handicap theory, formalized by Grafen, suggests that 'cheaters' must be at a disadvantage if a communication system such as ritualized aggression is to evolve (Grafen 1991, In. Behavioural Ecology: An Evolutionary Approach (Ed. by J. R. Krebs & N. B. Davies), pp. 5-31. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific). To determine whether cheating is disadvantageous in Betta splendens, we held a series of live interactions, after inducing hyper-aggression by socially isolating and then briefly 'priming' the fish. Primed isolates, which were no stronger than their rivals, 'cheated' by escalating rapidly to tailbeating and biting. These cheaters, however, usually lost fights to non-isolated opponents. Unprimed isolates, i.e. socially isolated fish that were not primed, were not initially hyper-aggressive and thus did not cheat. They lost fewer fights than the cheaters. Results suggested that cheaters lost because they exhausted themselves by their hyper-aggressiveness, allowing their non-hyper-aggressive opponents to win. This result is consistent with the Zahavi-Grafen model of how an 'honest' level of ritualized aggression can be stabilized in a population. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Maternal abuse of offspring in group-living monkeys was investigated to assess whether abuse of infants can be interpreted as an adaptive reduction of parental expenditure or as a behavioural pathology. I compared the parenting styles of 10 abusive and 10 non-abusive rhesus macaque, Macaca mulatta, mothers living in three large captive groups over the first 12 weeks of infant life. I also analysed the social interactions between mothers and infants and other individuals. Abusive females scored higher than controls on several measures of maternal protectiveness and rejection, indicating that they were highly controlling mothers. They also received fewer contacts and approaches from other individuals, and tended to be more aggressive and more interested in other females' infants compared to non-abusive mothers. Infant abuse was accompanied by similar or higher parental expenditure in the offspring rather than by a reduction in expenditure, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. Therefore, the results of this study support the hypothesis that infant abuse is a form of behavioural pathology. Infant abuse in rhesus macaques shows parallels with that in other primate species, but some of its characteristics could be a by-product of species-specific behavioural adaptations of rhesus macaques.

AB In haplodiploid species, the presence of unmated (virgin) females that can produce only haploid male offspring may have several important effects on a range of phenomena such as reproductive strategies, the transmission of parasitic chromosomes and the evolution of eusociality. The strength of these effects will depend upon the prevalence of virgin females. Two theories make conflicting predictions concerning the importance of factors that should be associated with increased levels of virginity, emphasizing either the degree of local mate competition or brood size. In this paper, a model is presented which predicts that, under conditions of local mate competition, the prevalence of virginity should be negatively correlated with the average number of offspring developing in a patch. The different predictions were then tested using data from 53 species of fig wasps representing 15 genera from four continents. Across species, the estimated prevalence of virginity was significantly inversely related to brood size, but showed no correlation with sex ratio (an index of local mate competition), supporting the predictions of our model. Qualitatively similar results were found when a formal comparative analysis was carried out using a morphologically and molecularly based phylogeny.

ID HOMING PIGEONS; INITIAL ORIENTATION; MEMORY; SITES
AB In previous experiments suggesting that previewing visual landscapes speeds homing from familiar release sites, restricted access to olfactory cues may have artefactually encouraged homing pigeons, Calumba livia, to resort to visual landmark orientation. Since evidence for the role of visual landmarks in wide-ranging avian orientation is still equivocal, Braithwaite & Guilford's (1991, Proc. R. Sec. Lond. Ser. B, 245, 183-186) 'previewing' experiments were replicated: birds were allowed or denied visual access to a familiar site prior to release, but allowed ample access to olfactory cues. In experiment 1, allowing birds to preview familiar sites for 5 min prior to release enhanced homing speeds by about 12%. In experiment 2, modified to reduce between-day effects on variation, previewing enhanced homing speeds by about 16%. These experiments support the conclusion that visual landmarks remote from sight of the loft are an important component of the familiar area map, although the nature of the landmarks and how they are encoded remain to be determined.

AB The study aimed to determine whether the so-called social calls that are produced by foraging bats of two phonic types of Pipistrellus pipistrellus serve a social function. First, the relationship between insect availability and the rate of production of social calls was measured at a foraging site of both phonic types. Second, playback experiments of social calls of the two phonic types were conducted in the field to determine the response of foraging bats to these calls, and to determine whether the calls are used in communication within or between phonic types. Two hypotheses are suggested for the function of social calls: that they may be used either to attract other bats to a food patch, or in agonistic interactions between bats in defence of a food patch. At relatively low insect densities, the rate of social call production of both phonic types increased significantly as insect density decreased. When social calls of each phonic type were broadcast, there was a significant reduction in bat activity of the same phonic type. In contrast, playbacks of social calls resulted in no change in activity of the other phonic type. The results supported the food patch defence hypothesis, that social calls are used to warn off other bats of the same phonic type when insects are scarce. The results also supported the hypothesis that the two phonic types are sibling species. Social calls were shown to serve a social function in intraspecific communication, but there was no communication between phonic types. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Direct benefits to females of choosing mates have recently been suggested to Flay a role in the evolution of female preferences even in non-resource-based mating systems. Direct benefits affect the fecundity or survival of females whereas females gain indirectly from being choosy by passing on good genes to offspring or by producing sons that are themselves more attractive to females. I investigated two potential direct benefits that females gain from being choosy in the lek-breeding painted reed frog, Hyperolius marmoratus broadleyi: assurance of fertilization and reduction in search costs. Males did not differ in their fertilization rates, indicating that choosy females did not benefit by gaining higher rates of fertilization. However, costs of mate searching were high due to predation risk by brown water snakes, Lycodonormorphus rufulus, at the breeding site. Small natural choruses were monitored using an acoustic localization technique based on the measurement of arrival time differences of a male's signal at an array of microphones. Females preferred males that were near to their release site and that called at high rates. These preferences were corroborated experimentally in two-choice arena trials and are consistent with the notion that females should reduce search time under high predatory pressure. Because sampling costs are high, females are selected to reduce search time and males are predicted to call so that females can locate them easily. High sampling costs also make direct selection on female preferences a plausible solution to the lek paradox. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Game theoretical models predict that the assessment of relative fighting ability and motivation is a process fundamental to resolving most contests. Demonstrations of assessment must (1) identify characters associated with fighting success and (2) establish a correlation between opponent asymmetry in these characters and the costs of fighting. Pair-wise contests between male house crickets revealed that winners were generally heavier than their opponents, although this effect varied with the degree of asymmetry in mass and the presence or absence of burrows. Prior burrow residency and initiating a fighting bout provided additional, but small advantages in fighting success. Fight winners performed a larger repertoire of agonistic tactics, more total acts, and escalated more frequently to energetically costly tactics than did their opponents. As a result, the winner's total energy expenditure usually exceeded the loser's. In accordance with the core prediction of assessment models, the cumulative energetic costs of combat for both opponents increased with decreases in asymmetry of mass and energy expenditure rate. These results suggest that house crickets resolve contests by assessing asymmetries in both body size and their relative use of costly tactics. The relative energetic costs incurred by combatants may reliably signal relative energy reserves and contribute to the active assessment of fighting ability, rather than simply accrue as a by-product of combat.

AB The present study tests the hypotheses that an increase in circulating levels of corticosterone, during the period when flocks were being established, redirects the behaviour of juvenile willow tits, Parus montanus, away from hock establishment towards dispersing from their natal areas. As dispersing is a poorer strategy than joining a flock, juveniles should be less sensitive to environmental stressors during this period. An experimental increase in circulating corticosterone in free-living willow tits affected dispersal behaviour differently in juveniles and adults during the period of flock establishment (July-September). Adults did not leave their territories, whereas the majority of corticosterone-treated juveniles disappeared from the forest. Corticosterone is thus likely to be a factor, involved in the dispersal behaviour of juvenile willow tits during early autumn. When the experiment was repeated at a time when permanent winter flocks had been established (October-November), the corticosterone treatment did not make the juveniles leave their territories. Adults showed the same behavioural response as in late summer. To test the hypothesis that juvenile willow tits are less sensitive to environmental stressors during the period of flock establishment, willow tits were captured at three different times of the year and exposed to handling stress. In late July, neither juveniles nor adults showed any marked response to capture stress. In mid-September juveniles still showed little response to handling stress, whereas adults had become very sensitive. In January both age groups responded rapidly to capture stress.

AB Social groups of alpine marmots, Marmota marmota, often contain several adult males only one of which is a dominant territorial male. How reproductive competition may be expressed among adult group males during mating was investigated, in particular whether reproduction is suppressed in subordinate males. Among adult subordinate males at least 3 years old, potential offspring of the territorial male ('sons') had androgen levels as high as those of territorial males whereas non-related group males ('non-sons') had significantly lower vernal levels, similar to those of 2-year-old individuals. Plasma androgen and corticosteroid titres were negatively correlated in subordinates at least 2 years old but were positively correlated in territorial males. Corticosteroids correlated negatively with body mass in sons and were high regardless of body mass in non-sons. Androgens mirrored these relations. Injuries from intraspecific fighting were more frequent among non-sons than among sons. Androgens and corticosteroids of territorial males correlated positively with the number of non-sons in the group, whereas the number of sons in a group had no comparable or at best the opposite effect. These results indicate that territorial males attempt to inhibit reproduction in other group males but adjust their effort according to inhibition costs (presumably increasing with a subordinate male's body size) and benefits (which are lower in sons). Marmots with high corticosteroid levels in spring gained less mass during the following summer. This could impair winter survival or reproductive success in the next year. Body-mass loss during hibernation correlated positively with vernal androgen levels in adult males. Only males with sufficient summer mass gain may be capable of sustaining energetically costly interruptions of torpor at the end of winter, necessary for gonadal development. The interactions between group members around mating time may reflect general patterns throughout the year that lead to selective reproductive inhibition in the group via effects on mass gain, hibernation mass loss and gonadal development.

AB For many species, mate guarding results in dramatic departures from normal behaviour that reflect compromised attention to feeding and other activities. Such departures have previously been difficult to document in primates, however. Data were gathered on two aspects of male behaviour that were predicted to be constrained during consortships, individual travel distance and duration of feeding bouts, for wild male baboons, Papio cynocephalus, in and out of mate-guarding episodes. In each case, consorting males were compared with themselves outside of consortships, and, in the case of distance travelled, they were compared also with non-consorting males matched for sample time and location. Males travelled significantly shorter distances while consorting than while not consorting, with the result that consorting males travelled distances similar to those travelled by females. Males also had significantly shorter feeding bouts while consorting. The shorter travel distances and feeding bouts experienced by consorting males may represent important constraints on male foraging activity, and probably result in decreased energy intake during mate guarding. Seasonal and non-seasonal breeding patterns will have different consequences for the magnitude of fluctuations in energy stores and depletions experienced during mate guarding, and costs of mate guarding in species that breed non-seasonally will be more difficult to document because they are necessarily smaller and temporally dispersed. When considered across the lifespan, however, mate guarding costs to non-seasonal breeders may equal or exceed costs to seasonal breeders. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

   there evidence for a mix of metabolic pathways?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; PENGUINS
AB Predictions of models for the optimal allocation of time over the dive cycle for divers using aerobic and anaerobic respiration, were tested experimentally on the tufted duck, Aythya fuligula, and pochard, A. ferina. Patterns in the dive cycle were highly correlated with water depth. In both species, foraging time increased with water depth up to 3 m. In the pochard, foraging time subsequently declined before increasing again at around 4 m. Qualitatively similar patterns in foraging time are predicted by the model based on the use of aerobic and anaerobic respiration, the 'mixed metabolism' model. As predicted by this model and previous 'aerobic' models, foraging time decreased in response to increasing substrate depth (used to increase foraging costs), while surface time was not affected. Paddle rates, used as an indicator of foraging costs, however, did not increase. In response to lower water temperature (used to increase the energetic costs of both the travel and foraging phases of the dive), surface times increased as predicted, except at the shallowest depth class. The predicted relationship between foraging time and diving costs is complex, being dependent on water depth and a number of other parameters; the observed trends were non-significant. Ascent duration decreased with decreasing temperature, but descent duration did not change significantly. Estimates of paddle rates and travel speeds suggest that foraging is on average more costly than travelling (ascent and descent combined), diving costs decrease with depth and travel speeds change subtly with depth.

AB Foraging models emphasize reward and/or prey capture rates as primary determinants of residence time. The influence of sensory information has rarely been examined experimentally, but may also be important in animal foraging decisions. This study examined the influence of sensory cues without food reward on residence time in wolf spiders, as well as the interaction of visual and vibratory information in foraging decisions. It also elucidated the effects of prior sensory experience on foraging decisions in wolf spiders. Sixty mature females of the common wolf spider, Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz), were tested in a four-chambered artificial foraging patch. Patches varied in the type of sensory information provided by live prey as follows: visual stimuli alone, vibratory stimuli alone, visual and vibratory stimuli together and control (no stimuli). Spiders were allowed to move freely from chamber to chamber for one hour while the duration, number and sequence of patch visits were recorded. Sensory cues, even without food rewards, are sufficient criteria to influence residence time. Spiders tended to remain longer in patches with visual cues alone or visual and vibratory cues together over those with vibratory information alone. Individuals varied significantly in both residence time and sensory biases between individuals, but none showed evidence of using prior sensory experience to choose patches or modify patch residence duration.

AB Field assays of kin recognition were conducted on females of the social wasp, Polistes fuscatus. The assays consisted of switching sister colonies and recording whether aunts accepted or rejected their non-nestmate nieces. Hexane extracts of each female were then analysed with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer. A step-wise discriminant function analysis (DFA) was conducted to predict behavioural outcomes (accept or reject) on the basis of differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. Ten cuticular hydrocarbons were included in the highly significant (P=0.0015) linear discriminant function. They consisted primarily of methyl-branched alkanes, which were relatively colony-specific, and straight-chain alkanes, which were less colony-specific. A jack-knifed procedure resulted in a 100% correct classification of all nieces to the accept or reject behavioural group. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Several authors have recently revived the old ethological claim that behavioural characters could be used to provide accurate estimates of phylogeny. To test this contention we constructed a behavioural data set for the pelecaniforms based upon van Tets' (1965, Ornithol. Monogr., 2, 1-88) classic comparative study of their social behaviour. Parsimony analysis of the resulting 20 taxa, 37-character data set produced 12 shortest trees. These trees fitted the behavioural data well. A permutation tail probability test found that the behavioural data contained more structure than would be expected by chance alone. The behavioural trees were compared with previously published morphological and genetic estimates of pelecaniform phylogeny to test if they were more congruent than would be expected by chance. In all cases the behavioural trees were far more similar to the morphological and genetic trees than chance alone would predict. By mapping the distribution of the behavioural characters onto a best-estimate evolutionary tree constructed from the independent trees, it was possible to investigate the homology of the behavioural characters. All but three of the characters appeared to be homologous. The behavioural characters were, therefore, no more homoplasious than other types of characters. The best-estimate tree was used to predict the social displays of the pied cormorant, Phalacrocorax varius, and to evaluate hypotheses about the derivation of male advertising displays.

AB Among social insects, foraging behaviour serves as a principal link in the translation between individual-level performance and colony-level success. Because nest size has been implicated as an important variable in that translation, foraging behaviour was studied in an ant species that spontaneously changes its nest size over the summer. Effects of queen presence/absence and nest size on speed, linearity and directionality of movement were measured for (1) a series of undisturbed nests and (2) nests that were altered in a pseudo-mutant experiment to simulate nest fractionation in the field. Ants looking for food behaved differently for each of these three measures than did ants carrying food to the nest. Furthermore, nest size had strong effects on the behaviour of ants, but queen presence/absence was not a consistently important factor. Our results show that an ant forager's behaviour reflects the social milieu within her nest, even when she is outside that milieu. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The long-held hypothesis that active foragers should use chemical senses to detect food more than do ambush foragers is verified for lizards. In actively foraging and herbivorous families, tongue-flicking permits sampling of chemicals for detection and identification of prey, but in ambush-foraging families the tongue does not participate even in detection of prey. Because foraging mode and prey chemical discrimination are stable within most families and in some higher taxa, their states are often historically determined. Possible influences of foraging ecology and phylogeny on prey chemical discrimination were analysed by studying correlated changes in the two variables. For several alternative phylogenetic reconstructions, shifts in foraging mode are coincident with shifts in prey chemical discrimination. These results suggest adaptive adjustment of prey chemical discrimination to foraging mode. Other possible interpretations are discussed. Evolution of lingual morphology and behaviour and of the vomeronasal system for enhanced efficiency of active foraging suggest that foraging behaviour may have driven much of the diversification of squamate reptiles.

AB Attempts to include psychological constraints in models of foraging behaviour differ in their assumptions concerning the accuracy of estimation of environmental parameters. Psychologists model estimation error as increasing linearly with the magnitude of a stimulus (Weber's Law), whereas behavioural ecologists either ignore error or assume it to be independent of stimulus magnitude. Studies on the estimation of time intervals have confirmed Weber's Law, but there are few data on the accuracy of estimation of amounts of food. Since the currency of most foraging models is the amount of food acquired per unit of time spent foraging, information on estimation of amount is required. Here, a titration method was used in which starlings chose between two cues. One colour signalled a standard food reward, and the other a reward that adjusted in magnitude according to the birds' choices: it increased when the standard was preferred and decreased when the adjusting option was preferred. There were two standards of 3 and 9 units of food, each of which was delivered at two rates to control for possible effects of rate of reinforcement on discrimination. The observed value of the adjusting option oscillated around a mean value slightly larger than that of the standard. The amplitude and period of these oscillations were larger when the standard was larger, independent of the rate of reinforcement. Also, molecular analysis showed that the probability of choosing the currently larger alternative increased as the relative difference between the adjusting option and standard increased. These results are consistent with Weber's Law applying to starlings' memories for amounts of food. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The effect of kinship on larval cannibalism was examined in the marbled salamander. In separate behavioural trials, cannibalistic larvae were presented with two smaller conspecifics (a 'prey group'), matched for size, that were (1) siblings of the cannibal, (2) non-siblings and (3) one sibling and one non-sibling (i.e. a mixture of two sibling groups); larvae were allowed to consume only one conspecific during each trial. This experiment was repeated in 2 consecutive years with larvae from two different populations. In both years, significantly fewer cannibals ate a non-sibling from the mixed sibship group than from groups composed of two non-siblings. In contrast, the number of cannibals that ate a larva from the pure sibling prey group did not significantly differ from the number that ate their sibling from the mixed sibship prey group. Thus, small larvae were significantly more vulnerable to cannibalism by their siblings than by non-siblings. The availability of unrelated individuals as alternative prey did not deter cannibals from eating their siblings, even though cannibals readily consumed prey of either genotype when the alternative one was absent. This kinship-biased cannibalism apparently was not due to size-selective predation or to differences among sibships in their propensity to cannibalize siblings. Moreover, the behaviour of potential prey did not differ towards related versus unrelated cannibals during initial observations of larval interactions. Cannibals required similar amounts of time to capture and process both sibling and non-sibling prey. To our knowledge, our results provide the first evidence of sibling cannibalism when unrelated individuals are available as alternative prey.

AB The role of female choice as a potential mechanism influencing male reproductive success in non-human primates is unclear. Few systematic studies have explicitly evaluated how female reproductive tactics modify male mating success. A 19-month held study of savanna baboons, Papio cynocephalus, was undertaken in Kenya in order to document patterns of mate choice and mate competition. Neither size dimorphism nor female competition hindered the expression of female choice. Female mating preferences affected the identity of mating partner and the probability of an escalated confrontation over access to a female. Reproductive tactics that diminished consortship duration included hiding from a male and approaching other males, whereas maintaining proximity to a male partner when he was aggressively challenged prolonged consortship duration. Non-cooperation in the form of mount rejection had no negative repercussions on male ejaculatory success and did not increase the chances of male abandonment. Male mating success depended more upon male than female reproductive tactics, and female tactics seemed to be based upon a propensity to mate with multiple males.

TI DO HUMPBACK WHALES EXHIBIT LATERALIZED BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIMATE HANDEDNESS; MEGAPTERA-NOVAEANGLIAE; PREFERENCE
AB Lateralized behaviour has been documented in non-human species, although many observers believe that it occurs at the individual rather than the population level. Its occurrence in humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, in Massachusetts Bay was investigated by examining active behaviour types in which preference could be given to one direction or side. These included head breaching (direction of spin), flippering (right or left) and tail breaching (direction of movement). In addition, persistent abrasions on the right or left jaw resulting from turns to one side during bottom feeding were noted. Of 75 individuals with jaw abrasions, 60 (80%) showed abrasions on only the right jaw, while 15 (20%) had abrasions on only the left. No whales had abrasions on both jaws. Location of abrasions was consistent in all resighted individuals for up to 12 years. Two of the three active behaviour types were not strongly lateralized: directional bias was seen in only five of 21 bouts (23.8%) of breaching, and in three of 11 bouts (27.3%) of tail breaching. However, 22 of 34 bouts (64.7%) of flippering showed a bias towards one direction (generally the right). Furthermore, direction of bias in all behaviour types was individually consistent between bouts and was strongly correlated with abrasions on the corresponding jaw (P=0.0032). The sex ratio of individuals with jaw abrasions, and of those showing directional bias in active behaviour, did not differ significantly from that of the overall population. Overall, these data suggest that humpback whales exhibit some behavioural asymmetries, at least one of which is at the population level. This result suggests asymmetry of function in motor or somatosensory representations, although too little is known about the brain of this species to permit definitive conclusions.

TI THE COAT-TAIL EFFECT IN MERGED FLOCKS OF DARK-EYED JUNCOS -
   SOCIAL-STATUS DEPENDS ON FAMILIARITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIPS; HYEMALIS
AB When two groups of social animals combine to form a larger group, new social relationships must be formed. Among dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis hyemalis, it has been reported that most members of one flock attain higher ranks than those of another flock when two groups are combined. A possible mechanism for this effect involves differential treatment of familiar and unfamiliar individuals by the most highly ranked bird in the combined flock: a so-called 'coat-tail effect' (Wiley 1990, Anim. Behav., 40, 587-596). To demonstrate this effect, 34 small flocks of wild-caught juncos were established, and then combined to form 17 hocks in which each bird's social status was determined. In the combined flocks, members of the highest-ranking bird's original flock attained adjacent, and higher, ranks than members of the other flock. In a second experiment, small flocks from which either the highest- or lowest-ranking bird had been removed were combined. In combined flocks lacking the highest-ranked bird from each flock there was no tendency for birds from one group to rank higher than those of the other. In contrast, when low-ranked birds were removed, members of one flock again attained adjacent, and higher, ranks than members of the other, indicating that the presence of the highest-ranked bird was necessary for a coat-tail effect to occur. There is evidence that juncos behaved differentially towards familiar and unfamiliar birds, and that flock members could have assessed the relative ranks of the highest-ranked members of the small flocks, suggesting a probable behavioural mechanism for the coat-tail effect.

Larvae responded positively to the presence of siblings, their secretions, and faeces while reaggregating. Larvae do not have to see or touch siblings in order for reaggregation to occur and leaf quality does not appear to be involved in reaggregation. There were differences in behaviour of 4- and 8-day-old larvae: 4-day-old larvae responded positively to the presence of siblings whereas 8-day-old larvae did not, and under natural conditions 4-day-old larvae are found in aggregations whereas 8-day-old larvae are solitary.

AB Female domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, were reared from hatching with (peat-reared) or without (wire-reared) access to dry peat. When 8 weeks old, they were housed individually in cages and at 9 weeks the incidence of dustbathing on the wire cage floor was recorded (baseline). When 12 weeks old, the pullets were given one of three treatments: (1) peat was placed below the cage so that the bird could see it, but not interact with it (Below); (2) peat was placed in front of the cage so that the bird could peck and bill-rake in it (Front); or (3) peat was placed in the cage so that the bird could interact fully with it (In). The birds' responses to the peat were recorded for 1 h. During baseline, more components of dustbathing behaviour on the wire were recorded in the wire-reared pullets suggesting that birds' perception of a dustbathing substrate is influenced by previous experience. During the test, the proportion of pullets dustbathing differed between rearing conditions on In and Front but not Below. There were significant interactions between rearing and treatment on the amount of the components of dustbathing behaviour performed; there were no differences between rearing groups on Below, and peat-reared pullets performed more than wire-reared on In. These results indicate that the sight of a dusty substrate may contribute to the initiation of dustbathing. Fowl also appear to hatch with a predisposition which enables them to 'recognize' a substrate suitable for dustbathing.

AB Prey selection models in which a patch is depleted by a number of foragers predict that the less profitable prey are rejected early in the foraging bout, but accepted later on. Such behaviour would lead to partial preferences: certain prey types are sometimes rejected and sometimes accepted (eaten), even within the same foraging bout. In the absence of competition, however, parasitoids should show no such switch in behaviour. This prediction was tested using the insect parasitoid Leptopilina heterotoma (Hymenoptera: Eucoilidae) searching a patch containing unparasitized and parasitized (less profitable) hosts. In the experiments, the degree of competition was varied by (1) having either a single parasitoid or two parasitoids simultaneously searching on the patch, and (2) keeping parasitoids either alone or together with conspecifics before the experiment. For a given patch quality (expressed as the average quality of the five previously encountered hosts), parasitoids accepted parasitized hosts more often when they searched a patch alone than when there were competitors present. Competition clearly influenced oviposition decisions. The predicted switch in behaviour was observed in the presence of competition, and a much less pronounced change in the absence of it. Keeping parasitoids alone or together before the experiment did influence the oviposition decisions but in the opposite way to that predicted: the latter accepted parasitized hosts more readily at high patch quality than the former. Finally, it was shown that the parasitoids are able to distinguish between the four types of host (unparasitized, once parasitized by a conspecific, once parasitized by the female herself and twice parasitized).

   GREAT TIT; PAST INVESTMENT; CICHLID FISH; SURVIVAL; YOUNG; DESERTION
AB The predictions of optimal parental investment theory were tested by studying nest defence decisions of willow tits, Parus montanus. As predicted, parental defence intensity increased with offspring age, female parents defended early and middle-season broods more vigorously than late ones and the annual proportion of mobbers correlated significantly with annual means of clutch and brood sizes. Against the predictions, defence intensity was not adjusted to the quality (weight, size and condition) or quantity of offspring, which was also confirmed by brood size manipulation experiments. In this respect, willow tits seemed to commit the so-called Concorde fallacy. A suggested explanation for these non-adaptive responses is that a trait to determine the brood value continuously is not needed, since breeding success is high and predictable every year. In addition, in this population parents with reduced and enlarged broods had the same fitness as those with control broods. Therefore, parents behaved optimally when they did not change their defence intensity according to the manipulations. Thus, this lack of response to unnatural variation in a minor component of lifetime reproductive success could be considered a pseudo Concorde fallacy. These results suggest that parents are able to predict the forthcoming breeding success early in the season, and that this prediction holds quite precisely, with parental investment levels being relatively equal regardless of clutch and brood size.

TI MOTHER-INFANT CONTACT AS CONTINGENT BEHAVIOR IN GELADA BABOONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Trivers (1974, Am. Zool, 14, 249-264) suggested that weaning behaviour in mammals is the outcome of parent-offspring conflict over the amount of investment (in the form of milk) that the offspring should receive. However, it is also possible that such conflicts are disputes about the timing of investment in the offspring: conflicts occur as mothers attempt to train their infants to suckle only when their presence on the nipple does not interfere with the mothers' ability to engage in other activities. Data from eight mother-infant pairs of wild gelada baboons, Theropithecus gelada, were used to examine the relationship between maternal activity and infant suckling/contact behaviour in order to test whether disputes are more likely to occur over the quantity or timing of investment. Infant gelada more than 4 months old were more likely to be out of contact when the mother was feeding, and suckled only when the mother was resting or socializing. This relationship resulted from a bias in the level of rejection of infants towards those activities in which the presence of an infant hindered the mother. Further analyses confirmed that mothers were more concerned with training their infants to make appropriate forms of contact, rather than with limiting the infants' access to the nipple; whilst the level of ventro-ventral contact declined rapidly, time spent on the nipple changed relatively little during the period covered by the sample. Comparison of the data with that for other baboon species suggested that differences in the onset and development of this relationship can be attributed to the constraints imposed by contrasting diets and feeding styles.

AB Before mating, all male odonates translocate sperm from the testes (IX segment) to the penis (II segment), but in Coenagrion scitulum this behaviour is repeated up to six times during copulation. The aim of this study was to find an explanation for this unusual behaviour. Copulation behaviour consists of three to seven cycles, each of which includes one intra-male sperm translocation, one stage I and one stage II (i.e. the complete copulatory sequence typical of zygopterans). The duration of pre-copulatory tandem and cycle 1 of copulation was negatively correlated with time of day and positively with male disturbance. Males captured during stage I of any copulatory cycle always had the seminal vesicle full of sperm, thus indicating that they do translocate sperm during sperm translocation behaviour. Females were inseminated at stage II. The volume of ejaculate in females in the held interrupted during stage I of the first copulatory cycle was not significantly different from the volume stored by pre-copula females indicating that males cannot remove a significant amount of sperm from the female's genital tract at this stage. Spines on the horns of the penis, which in other damselflies help remove the sperm stored by females, are, however, absent in C. scitulum. Experiments with virgin females that received up to five inseminations indicated that the sperm are progressively packed, and therefore the volume is not directly proportional to the number of inseminations. Male C. scitulum thus has a poor sperm removal ability and multiple intra-male sperm translocation and insemination of the female during the same copulatory act seems to be a mechanism of sperm competition by which the male achieves a greater fertilization success.

AB The effort a male expends caring for offspring is expected to be influenced by the availability of additional mates. The effect of unmated females on male parental care was examined in red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phaeniceus, by removing female parents during the nestling period at two different times of the breeding season: (1) early, when unmated females were still available and (2) late, when all females had settled and additional mates were no longer possible. Many males fed nestlings at experimental nests; however, male parental care was not related to the availability of unmated females. Instead, male parental behaviour seemed to be influenced strongly by the presence or absence of an additional mate in her fertile period. Male red-winged blackbirds only fed offspring when no additional mates were in their fertile period. These results suggest that paternity guarding may have influenced male parental behaviour more than the opportunity to attract additional mates or to rear nestlings to independence.

AB Female Aphytis melinus (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), previously thought to be unreceptive after their first mating, mated multiply in the held at an incidence of at least 3.2-6.7%. In spring the adult sex ratio was female biased while in autumn it was male biased. Following copulation, male A. melinus guard females for an average of 149 s during which they display behaviour identical to that seen prior to copulation. Behavioural experiments using genetically marked pairs of males were set up to test several hypotheses concerning the adaptive significance of guarding and postinsemination displays. The behaviour seen during guarding probably keeps the female quiescent but does not influence the fate of second-male sperm. Second males that did not guard achieved equal paternity to those that did. Guarding and its associated post-copulatory behaviour helped 'switch off' female receptivity. The percentage of second males that managed to achieve intromission, if attempting to mate with a previously guarded female, dropped from 97 to 70%. Furthermore, males courting a previously guarded female scored significantly more contacts, unsuccessful mounts, time to achieve the successful mount, wingbeats, and time in the successful pre-coital mount. Last-male sperm precedence did not occur. Second males shed 30.5% of the progeny if the guarding male was immediately dislodged and 14.2% of the progeny if the first male was allowed to complete guarding. Thus by delaying rival male courtship through guarding, first male A, melinus decreased the chance that the female would mate again. Guarding also reduced the proportion of progeny sired by a second mating male.

AB The neural processes underlying filial imprinting in birds are divided, for purposes of theoretical analysis, into three systems: Analysis of stimuli into features, Recognition of familiar stimuli in terms of their features and Execution of filial behaviour. The Analysis system is linked to the Recognition system which is linked, in turn, to the Executive system; the Analysis system is also linked directly to the Executive system. Each system consists of modules that contain units. The neural net, used to explore this model, is unsupervised and three-layered; and it is fast since it can operate efficiently with few modules. In the naive state, the strengths of the connections between units in one system and those in others downstream art all low, with the exception of those connections between units in the Analysis and Executive systems; these connections art started at maximum strength. Connections between active units of two systems are strengthened up to a maximum; those between an inactive unit of one system and an active unit in a system downstream are weakened down to zero. Weakening takes place more slowly than strengthening. This model simulates many aspects of imprinting including recognition of fine detail in the familiar stimulus, while generalizing to stimuli resembling the one with which the bird was imprinted. When experienced, the model simulates withdrawal from objects that are sufficiently novel and, as a consequence, the end of the sensitive period for imprinting. The model readily forms polymorphous categories, updates existing stimulus representations and classifies together physically distinct stimuli, if they have occurred within a short time of each other.

AB A solitary anthophorid bee (Anthophora sp. nov.) in the Sinai desert showed sexually dimorphic diurnal activity patterns, whereby males defended territories containing clumps of the flower Alkanna orientalis between 0815 and 1430 hours while females fed exclusively on these same flowers only in the early morning up to 0900 hours and from about 1400 hours with virtually no male-female overlap on any one particular plant. Thus males defended the floral resources through long periods when conspecific females were absent. Female nests were usually within the male territories, however, and females copulated mainly with resident males. This system therefore has some similarities to resource defence polygyny, with territoriality functioning for mating advantage. The male strategy, however, was inappropriate merely to secure matings, as these occurred principally in the early morning and thereafter territories could have been abandoned for the day without loss of copulations; but by maintaining patrols throughout the day, a male would additionally ensure that there were better quality floral reserves in areas where his own females would feed to stock that day's nest-cells, and thereby he achieved matings with better-resourced females. The behaviour of the male Anthophora is therefore a form of territoriality that achieves potentially larger offspring, thus serving as pre-zygotic paternal investment.

TI TIME-PLACE LEARNING, FOOD AVAILABILITY AND THE EXPLOITATION OF PATCHES
   IN GARDEN WARBLERS, SYLVIA BORIN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID STARLINGS; RHYTHM
AB Garden warblers were trained in a laboratory experiment to visit four feeding sites at four times of day. Within each feeding site, food was available for 4.5 h. This consisted of an initial period when the rate of food availability increased linearly ('increasing ramp'), a 1.5-h period of constant food availability ('plateau'), and a 1.5-h period when rate of food availability decreased linearly ('decreasing ramp'). After the pattern had been learned, three experimental manipulations were carried out in probe trials to test the relative importance of response to local changes in food availability and the learned time-place pattern in controlling switches between sites. When all four sites offered the same availability of food continuously, the pattern of visiting sites persisted, indicating the role of a learned time-place pattern. The cycle of visiting the four sites was completed more rapidly when the availability of food was low. When the pattern of availability of food in all four sites was advanced or delayed by 1 or 2 h, the birds shifted their time of visiting in the direction of the shift in availability, but by a smaller amount. This shows that in part the time of switching between chambers is controlled by immediate experience. When the peak of food availability in one site was advanced by 1 h, the birds visited this site earlier, and there was a suggestion that they responded more to the decreasing ramp function of availability than to the increasing ramp.

TI AGE-RELATED DOMINANCE IN MALE DARK-EYED JUNCOS - EFFECTS OF PLUMAGE AND
   PRIOR RESIDENCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Age-related differences in dominance ability and the effect of prior residence on age-related dominance were investigated in captive male dark-eyed juncos, Junca hyemalis. To determine if adults and first-winter birds differed in their intrinsic dominance ability, pairs of adult and first-winter birds of equal body size and winning experience were established. Because plumage influences status, young birds were experimentally darkened to match their older cage-mates. Adult and first-winter  males became dominant with equal frequency. Because of this result and the fact that adults are usually dominant in the field, the effect of prior residence on age-related dominance was also investigated. When given prior residence, birds of either age-class won significantly more interactions against intruders. Although first-winter residents (without darkened plumage) dominated intruding adults, they won significantly fewer interactions than did resident adults against intruding adults. This  difference in relative dominance success may be due to age-related plumage differences. In the absence of advantages based on prior residence or winning experience, both adult and first-winter birds may rely on plumage differences to settle contests with others of their age class. Prior residence confers an advantage on both adult and first-winter birds. In nature, however, adults are more likely to experience this advantage as a consequence of earlier arrival at migration stopover sites and of  site fidelity to the wintering grounds.

TI ONTOGENY OF MIGRATORY ORIENTATION IN THE SAVANNAH SPARROW,
   PASSERCULUS-SANDWICHENSIS - MECHANISMS AT SUNSET
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ontogeny of the mechanisms of migratory orientation that are employed around the time of sunset were examined using hand-raised savannah sparrows. Groups of yound birds were given controlled experience with the daytime sky during the first 3 months of life. The directional relationships between sun azimuth, skylight polarization patterns and magnetic directions were manipulated. Orientation tests were performed between the time of sunset and the first appearance of stars during the birds''  first autumn. Birds learned to perform migratory orientation in response to polarized light patterns (E-vector orientation), which seemed to be their orientation cue of first choice. The polarized light compass of this night migrant appeared to be calibrated during ontogeny by magnetic directions.

TI THE EFFECTS OF AVIAN MOBBING ON A POTENTIAL PREDATOR, THE EUROPEAN
   KESTREL, FALCO-TINNUNCULUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB European kestrels were observed being mobbed by other birds on 63 occasions. Eleven species were involved, and in two instances mobs were composed of more than one species. Both flight-hunting and perch-hunting kestrels flew significantly further between their foraging positions when they were mobbed than when they were not mobbed; on average, mobbing resulted in flight-hunting kestrels moving 6.8 times, and perch-hunting kestrels 2.7 times, the mean distances moved by non-mobbed birds. The  mean strike distance of perch-hunting kestrels attempting to capture birds was significantly less than the distance between perches flown by perch-hunting kestrels when mobbed. These data provide quantitative support for the assumption that mobbing causes a predator to vacate its immediate foraging area. The activity of the kestrels also influenced the frequency that they were mobbed, with kestrels that were flight-hunting being mobbed more than expected compared with ones that were  perch-hunting. Kestrels were observed being mobbed throughout the year, and there was no discernible difference in their response to mobbing between seasons. These results are discussed in relation to current ideas on the functions of avian mobbing.

TI THE LOGIC OF MATE DESERTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the fitness consequences of mate desertion are markedly affected by whether the partner also deserts, natural selection is expected to favour desertion decisions that take the mate''s decision into account. A model for the evolution of mate desertion is described in which individuals make desertion decisions repeatedly during the period of parental care, choosing the option (desert or stay) that gives them the greater fitness, taking into account whether their mate has already deserted. If the partner still remains, the optimcal decision is made assuming that the partner responds optimally in turn. Four patterns of time-dependent payoffs define all possible desertion decisions, three of which produce different kinds of stable evolutionary outcome: both parents stay with the young; both desert; and one deserts, one stays. The fourth pattern (''pre-emptive desertion'') also returns in both parents deserting but paradoxically, in this case, they sacrifice fitness by so doing. Such uncooperative parents are caught in the well-known Prisoner''s Dilemma of game theory and provide a link with recent thinking on the evolution of cooperation. Under conditions of mate choice or repeated interaction between potential mates the payoff pattern that normally produces pre-emptive desertion may result instead in a ''both stay'' outcome. When desertion decisions are conditional on the partner''s decision, in the way assumed here, desertion outcome cannot be predicted simply by comparing  the costs and benefits of desertion for the male and female at any one time. Rather, one needs to know the way in which these payoffs vary for each partner over the whole of the parental care period. Applications of the model are discussed, with particular reference to uniparental care in fish and biparental care in birds.

TI RESPONSES TO DISTRESS CALLS BY BLACK-HEADED GULLS, LARUS-RIDIBUNDUS -
   THE ROLE OF NONDEGRADED FEATURES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Distress calls of black-headed gulls have a complex structure. They are efficient over long distances, despite the alterations that occur during propagation. This degradation was analysed by broad-casting distress calls in the natural environment where gulls spent most of the day. Degradation was greatest for amplitude modulation (AM) and also for fast frequency modulation (FM). It was least for slow FM and for the lowest harmonics of the complex carrier frequency. Synthesized distress calls that contained only these non-degradable structures (some without AM, others with a simplified FM) elicited normal responses from the gulls. This suggests that the gulls could use only those parameters that were not degraded, which may be an adaptation to the constraints of the transmission channel.

AB In a two-choice test, drones preferred queen models marked by a distinctly coloured ''mating sign'' (secretions of the drone''s copulatory organs) to unmarked models. This was true also for models. This was true also for models marked by aluminium foil. Dark-coloured drones preferred to copulate with light coloured models and vice versa. Models carrying copulating drones were more attractive than single models. Thus a copulating drone as well as the mating sign and other coloured markers increased the attractiveness of a queen. The mating sign may indicate a form of cooperation between drones by marking a queen after sperm transfer to facilitate the identification of a queen by the following drones.

TI THE EFFECT OF RELATEDNESS ON REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND MATE CHOICE IN THE
   WHITE-FOOTED MOUSE, PEROMYSCUS-LEUCOPUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Genetic similarity between mates has a significant effect on the reproductive success of white-footed mice. Pairs of mice bred over a range of degrees of relatedness demonstrated a significant inbreeding depression in litter size at weaning and offspring weight at weaning. If juveniles that are lighter at weaning are less likely to be recruited into the breeding population, these experiments also demonstrated a mild outbreeding depression. However, this cost does not appear to be due to the traditional mechanisms of outbreeding depression. Kin recognition appears mate choice in white-footed mice and to act as a mechanism for reducing the costs of inbreeding and outbreeding. In an arena, oestrous females presented with either male odours or actual males showed a preference for males on an intermediate degree of relatedness. Non-oestrous females showed no such preferences.

TI EFFECT OF BROWN-HEADED COWBIRDS ON THE EVOLUTION OF YELLOW WARBLER
   ANTI-PARASITE STRATEGIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater, has recently expanded its breeding range into eastern North America. In the newly inhabited regions, brood parasitism by this generalist should present a strong selective force favouring the evolution of various anti-parasite strategies. The purpose of this study was to: (1) establish the impact of cowbird parasitism on reproductive success of yellow warblers, Dendroica petechia, and estimate its importance relative to nest predation; and (2)  determine if yellow warblers in eastern Ontario [Canada] have already evolved specific anti-parasite adaptations. The results suggest that parasitism accounted for 41% of all egg losses and was at least as important as nest predation. Yellow warblers tended to reject cowbird eggs if they were parasitized in the early egg-having stages and if they had enough time left for re-nesting. Finally, results of aggression trials were consistent with predictions from the reproductive value-stimulus  value model (i.e. warblers were most aggressive to a female cowbird at stages when they are most vulnerable to cowbird parasitism). These findings suggest that warblers recognize cowbirds as a specific threat to their nests. Strong selection pressures due to cowbird parasitism have already yielded several specific anti-parasite behavioural traits in eastern North American yellow warbler populations.

TI HELPING-BEHAVIOR, REPRODUCTIVE VALUE, AND THE FUTURE COMPONENT OF
   INDIRECT FITNESS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The indirect component of an individual''s inclusive fitness incorporates the effects of the individual''s behaviour on the survival and reproductive success of non-descendent kin. Indirect fitness benefits may be particularly important in species in which helpers assist in the reproductive activities of close relatives. Although helpers can influence both present and future reproduction of recipients, future effects have received relatively little attention. In this paper a general method is developed for estimating the future component of indirect fitness in which activities of helpers in the present influence residual reproductive value and future reproduction by recipients. The future component of indirect fitness is the sum of these effects weighted by genetic relatedness between the helper and each recipient breeder and between each recipient and its offspring. This approach is illustrated by estimating the relative contributions of present and future components to total indirect fitness gained by non-breeding helpers in three species of cooperatively breeding birds, the Florida scrub jay, Aphelocoma coerulescens, pied kingfisher, Ceryle rudis, and splendid fairy-wren, Malurus splendens. The results of this study, along with those available for other species, suggest that the future component of indirect fitness may comprise 29-49% of the total gain in indirect fitness accruing to helpers. The effect of helping and other forms of aid-giving behavior on  the survival and future reproduction of recipients thus should be given considerably more emphasis in analysis of the selective costs and benefits of such behaviour.

   INTRASEXUAL KIN DISCRIMINATION IN MALE LABORATORY MICE, MUS-MUSCULUS L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relative importance of experience of self and of littermates'' cues in the development of the discrimination of unfamiliar same-sex kin by male mice was investigated by individually cross-fostering single pups between unrelated litters. The results suggested that learning the cues of familiar littermates (whether these animals were genetic relatives or not) was an important influence on discrimination by juveniles. The cues of self may also be learned and influence discrimination by juveniles. However, in contrast to previous studies, cross-fostered mice increased rather than decreased their performance of investigatory behaviours towards relatives. It may be that some degree of perceived similarity between the cues of self and those of familiar littermates is important for the development of the patterns of discrimination reported previously. Subject animals did not show any evidence for discrimination when adult. Cohabitation with non-kin until adult appeared to disrupt  the ability to recognize, or motivation to discriminate, on the basis of perdeived kinship. The results also suggested that a mouse carrying the cues of unrelated animal(s) may be misidentified as kin by these animals'' relatives. The effects of recognition cue transfer within subject litters appeared to be stronger in adult test pairings, and this may be a factor involved in the disruption of discrimination by adult subject animals.

   IRIDOMYRMEX-HUMILIS (MAYR)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To investigate the influence of the number of queens per colony on nestmate recognition in Iridomyrmex humilis, comparative assays were performed to study the attraction of workers to queens. These assays demonstrated that a phenomenon of recognition is superimposed on the attraction of workers to queens. Workers could discriminate non-nestmate queens from their nestmate queen to which they were significantly more attracted. This discrimination is probably based on the learning by workers of  queen and colony odour. The level of attraction of workers to non-nestmate queens was similar in monogynous and polygynous colonies, whereas the level of attraction of workers to nestmate queens was significantly lower in polygynous colonies. This difference in the level of attraction of workers to nestmate queens almost certainly resulted from a lower efficiency in nestmate recognition in polygynous colonies. It is hypothesized that the mixture of several pheromonal sources produced by less related individuals in polygynous colonies may result in a less distinct colony odour than in monogynous colonies. The results are discussed with regard to some implications of polygyny and particularly to the loss of intercolonial aggression in I. humilis as well as in other polygynous ant species.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The genetic mechanisms underlying territorial behaviour in the spider Agelenopsis aperta were investigated through study of the F1, F2 and backcross progeny of crosses between two populations that differed in the sizes of territories defended and in the level of territorial fighting exhibited. This work represented further testing of a two-tendency motivational model of the system in which phenotypic overdominance of the F1 involving two motivational states, ''fear'' and ''aggression'', was  assumed with the traits being independently inherited and exhibiting no individual overdominance. The model was based on the fact that the hybrid line exhibited higher fight costs and demanded larger territories than either parental line. The results of analyses completed on F2 generation hybrids and backcrosses to the parent lines supported the genetic model presented in 1984. Further, the two traits territory size and agonistic behaviour were identified as pleiotropic effects of the same  genes and data are presented that indicate aggression is determined largely by a sex-linked locus, or loci with intermediate inheritance, while fear is largely autosomal. The F2 and backcross generations were not more variable than the F1 or parental populations, indicating polygenic inheritance.

TI TERRITORY SHARING BY THE CARIBBEAN STRIPED PARROTFISH, SCARUS-ISERTI -
   PATTERNS OF RESOURCE ABUNDANCE, GROUP-SIZE AND BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Along the Caribbean coast of Panama, female groups of the striped parrotfish, Scarus iserti, codefend a common area against neighbouring territorial and roving non-territorial conspecifics. Unlike many other group territorial organisms, the individuals within these groups are unrelated to one another and express no parental care. This paper describes the patterns of resource abundance, territory size, group membership and activity associated with the territory sharing behaviour of these fish. These data are applied to a set of hypotheses which may explain the evolution of parrotfish group territorial behavior. The results suggest that groups form within territories because socially dominant individuals can exploit food resources more efficiently when others are present. This is due, at least in part, to the sharing of territorial defence, which allows individuals more time to feed. Other benefits of group-living, such as improved vigilance for predators or more efficient searching for food, may also enhance a territorial individual''s food intake, while dominance interactions limit the consumption of resources by subordinates. The potential interaction of these factors in determining individual payoffs invites further study on the specific costs and benefits associated with life in these non-kin territorial groups.

TI VOCAL PLASTICITY IN CAPTIVE BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEES - THE ACOUSTIC BASIS
   AND RATE OF CALL CONVERGENCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB During the winter months, the acoustic structure of the ''chick-a-dee'' call of black-capped chickadees, Parus atricapillus, is similar among flock members but varies significantly between different flocks. To investigate the process of within-flock convergence through which these differences arise, an experimental flock of birds previously unfamiliar with each other was established and maintained in captivity. The vocal behaviour of each individual was monitored over several weeks. Acoustic analyses revealed that significant vocal convergence occurred in less than 1 week after the birds were initially exposed to each other. No single individual appeared to provide a vocal model that other birds copied. Acoustic differences appeared in the spectral structure of the D-note of this complex call, especially in the frequency difference between adjacent overtones and in the bandwidth. Both of these acoustic features are attributable to specific physiological mechanisms of production. The significance of vocal plasticity in chickadees and its relationship to production and perception are discussed.

TI STIMULUS-CONTROL OF SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR IN MALE JAPANESE QUAIL,
   COTURNIX-COTURNIX-JAPONICA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three experiments were conducted to identify stimuli that control social proximity behavior and suppression of crowing in male Japanese quail. Visual access to a conspecific female through a narrow window stimulated both social proximity and suppression of crowing in male quail. These responses did not occur when male conspecifics, birds of other species, or an empty cage were visible through the window. Taxidermically prepared models of female and male quail elicited differential social  proximity behavior and crowing suppression similar to the differential responses elicited by live female and male conspecifics. Thus, static visual cues of female quail were sufficient to stimulate social proximity behavior and suppression of crowing in males. Much of the behavior elicited by female and male models was controlled by visual cues provided by the head and neck, which contain most of the sexually dimorphic feathers. Visual features of the head and neck appeared to be additive in their effects on social behavior.

TI INHIBITION OF SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR AMONG SUBORDINATE STUMPTAIL MACAQUES,
   MACACA-ARCTOIDES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A series of four experiments was conducted to examine rank-related differences in copulatory behaviour among male stumptail macaques, and to investigate the proximal mechanisms responsible for the reduced sexual activity among subordinate males. In the first experiment observations were made for 34 months on a group of 97 individuals. Lower-ranking males usually copulated surreptitiously and copulations attempted in view of higher-ranking males were more likely to be interrupted. Lower-ranking males also copulated more frequently when higher-ranking males were removed from their view; however even the presence of a restrained higher-ranking male was sufficient to inhibit their copulatory behaviour. Three experiments were performed on a second social group of 30 stumptails to replicate and extend the findings of experiment 1. Increases in sexual activity in the absence of higher-ranking males were specific to sexual behaviour, and were not caused by general excitement due to removal  or handling of animals. Female proceptive behaviour also increased in the absence of high-ranking males suggesting that the suppression of copulatory activity may not be solely due to behavioural changes in the males. These findings provide the first experimental support for the hypothesis that the copulatory behaviour of subordinate male stumptail macaques is suppressed by the presence of dominant males and that the absence of these males removes the suppression.

TI THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLAY IN GAZELLES - IMPLICATIONS
   FOR THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF PLAY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of play behaviour in Cuvier''s gazelle, Gazella cuvieri, is described and compared with that of other species. Play was sub-divided into four different types: locomotor play, sexual play, play-fighting and object play. Developmental trends in the types considered were different, supporting the hypothesis that play is a heterogeneous category. Locomotor play started at high frequencies, and accounted for a major proportion of total play, but both measures declined from early  months onwards. By contrast, sexual play and play-fighting were infrequent shortly after birth, increased thereafter reaching peaks between 4 and 6 months, and then decreased. The relative importance of these play types steadily increased until they became the predominant types of play. Object play remained infrequent at all ages, and accounted for a small proportion of total play. Young calves played mostly alone, but the proportion of social play increased with age, until all play became social. Before month 4 calves directed more invitations to play and sexual play than they received. Other peers were the major play partners of calves, followed by adult females. Calves directed a higher proportion of invitations and sexual play to adult females and males than they received from either class. These results are discussed in relation to other aspects of the calves'' behavioural and social development, and it is argued that they are best explained if play is considered to have  immediate benefits.

TI RULES TO LEAVE BY - PATCH DEPARTURE IN FORAGING BLUE JAYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, hunted for moths in projected images in a modified operant chamber. On each trial the jays could choose between two patches: (1) a non-depleting patch with a low, uniform prey density, and (2) a depleting patch that had a high initial prey density but depleted in a single step later in the session. The number of prey available in the depleting patch was varied across conditions. The jays typically started a bout in the depleting patch and finished in  the non-depleting patch, obtaining close to the maximum number of total available prey. Efficiency declined when conditions changed, then recovered. Relative efficiency was greatest in the condition with the fewest prey. The decision to leave the depleting patch appeared to be a function of both the length of the ''run-of-bad-luck'' and the number of prey found within the depleting patch.

TI HEARING IN THE SWAMP SPARROW, MELOSPIZA-GEORGIANA, AND THE SONG SPARROW,
   MELOSPIZA-MELODIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Operant conditioning techniques and a psychophysical tracking procedure were used to measure thresholds for pure tones in two congeneric species of sparrows: swamp sparrows and song sparrows. Thresholds were measured both in quiet conditions and in the presence of white noise. The two species were similar in their gross pattern of auditory sensitivity with most sensitive thresholds in the frequency region of 1.0-8.0 kHz and poor hearing above and below this range. However, the best sensitivity  occurred at 2 kHz for the song sparrows and at 4 kHz for the swamp sparrows. This pattern was also observed in song spectra of the two species. The songs of song sparrows had more power in lower frequencies than the songs of swamp sparrows. Masked auditory thresholds for both species were very similar, showing a generally increasing signal-to-noise ratio with increasing frequency. The similarity between swamp and song sparrows in these measures of basic auditory sensitivity suggests that the  primary mechanisms underlying selective vocal learning in these sparrows probably reside at higher levels than the peripheral auditory sensitivities.

TI THE CALLING SONG OF THE FIELD CRICKET, GRYLLUS-BIMACULATUS (DEGEER) -
   CONSTRAINTS ON TRANSMISSION AND ITS ROLE IN INTERMALE COMPETITION AND
   FEMALE CHOICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Field studies of calling male field crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, showed that males formed calling aggregations. Within aggregations males appeared to maintain an exclusive female-attraction zone about their burrows; calling song may thus serve as an aggressive signal to neighbouring males to maintain spacing. Calling song attenuates with distance. Furthermore, calls became degraded with distance by the loss of low frequency components and a reduction in the interval between chirps and  pulses due to reverberation. Playback experiments suggested that the predictable degrading properties of the call may serve as a distance-finding mechanism maintaining observed male spacing. The intensity of calls and the repetition rate of chirps and pulses was positively correlated with male size. While information contained within the intensity parameter of calls may prove unreliable due to unpredictable attenuation and irregular amplitude fluctuations, the repetition rate of chirps and  pulses was not affected by distance degradation. Playback experiments in which intensity was controlled suggested that females orientate preferentially to the calls of large males.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The activity of a natural population of the slug Limax pseudoflavus was monitored and related to variations in light intensity and temperature. The activity pattern was unimodal in conditions of both rising and falling temperatures and was similar in artificial conditions under constant temperature and a light:dark (LD) 12:12 cycle. Both crawling and feeding rhythms were entrained by LD cycles of 24 h, temperature cycles of 23 h and a combined temperature and light cycle of 23 h. A light  cycle of 19 h weakly entrained the crawling rhythm but failed to entrain the feeding rhythm. Under continuous light, weak rhythmicity was shown with a period less than 24 h. Stronger crawling and feeding rhythms with periods of greater than 24 h were shown under constant darkness. A temperature reduction to 4.degree. C was followed by bursts of crawling and the previously expressed rhythm was disrupted. A reduction to 1.degree. C caused a short burst of crawling followed by inactivity.

   AMONG WILD AGGREGATIONS AND RESPONSES TO NONKIN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB In laboratory experiments, wild-caught Rana cascadae tadpoles preferred to associate with members of their natural aggregation over members from a second aggregation collected from the same pond. Laboratory-reared tadpoles also preferred to associate nearest to a sibling stimulus group over a stimulus group containing no tadpoles. However, when tadpoles are given a choice of associating between a stimulus group containing conspecific non-siblings and an empty compartment, there was random association. This suggests that tadpoles are gregarious with kin, but are not as likely to form aggregations composed solely of non-kin.

TI QUEUING FOR MATES IN 13-LINED GROUND-SQUIRRELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When two male thirteen-lined ground squirrels pursue an oestrous female simultaneously, whichever of the males had been the first to locate the female has priority in copulating with her. Copulation by the later-arriving male is typically deferred until the departure of the earlier male, as if males ''queue'' for the opportunity to mate. In this study earlier males were often heavier than later-arriving males; perhaps more importantly, they were more competent in tracking the movements of the female than were later-arriving males. Order of arrival thus corresponds with the abilities of the males to maintain access to the female, and the convention of settling contests in favour of earlier-arriving males is consistent with predictions based on evolutionarily stable strategy analyses of contests where costs can be regulated continuously. Two simple models were developed to explore the evolutionary stability of the behaviour of early- and late-arriving males. In the first, later-arriving males toleration of the delay in mating was found to be highly advantageous relative to their alternative option of searching for an unaccompanied oestrous female. The second model indicates that the advantage to early-arriving males of resuming search after mating depends on either the effectiveness of their post-copulatory mate-guarding alternative or an advantage in sperm competition.

TI ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF COLONIALITY IN THE SWALLOW,
   HIRUNDO-RUSTICA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The advantages and disadvantages of coloniality in swallows, Hirundo rustica, were studied in 1971-1975 and 1977-1985. Nest sites were not limiting the local population density, and swallows tended to aggregate actively at specific sites. Colony size was positively correlated with local food abundance and the amount of lee for prevailing westerly winds. The amount of food per individual swallow decreased with colony size, and nestling feeding rates were lower for colonial than for solitary swallows. Social foraging effects, measured as individual feeding success in relation to the number of simultaneously foraging conspecifics, were not important. Extra-pair copulations and chases of female swallows by male non-mates of the colony were common in colonies. The percentage of time males spent mate guarding, the frequency of intraspecific nest parasitism and the percentage of time spent nest guarding during egg laying increased with colony size. Infanticide by unmated males occurred more frequently in larger colonies, being an important mortality factor. Mite infection causing nestling mortality and change of nest sites between first and second clutches, increased with colony size. Nest predation averaged only 1.2%. A stuffed owl predator was detected more quickly in larger colonies. Predation on fledglings and adult swallows may have been more important in large colonies. Old mated and young unmated males benefited from breeding in colonies. Young mated males and females may not benefit from colonial breeding. The asynchronous arrival pattern may leave some early-arriving swallows in a deteriorating breeding condition because the local food resource has to be divided between more individuals. All males should stay in their colony because a shortage of females means that these males may not obtain a mate at all, if they move to a new colony. Many of the females may likewise be making the best of a bad job when breeding in a colony.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Some male Pararge aegeria perch in patches of sunlit vegetation in woodland understorey and defend them from other males to increase their probability of obtaining virgin females. Others patrol in search of females. When air temperature is low or in sites where sunlit areas are scarce the predominant behaviour of males is perching. Where sunlit areas are abundant the predominant behaviour is patrolling. In this study, different males adopted different behaviours, depending on their upper  hind-wing spot phenotype. Those males with three upper hind-wing spots rarely defended sunlit areas from other males and wre most abundant in open woodland. Males with four hind-wing spots defended sunlit areas from other males and were most abundant in closed woodland, where sunlit areas are scarce. The relative frequencies of these two phenotypes changed throughout the season and seasonal changes in the behaviour of males were correlated with changes in the frequencies of hind-wing spot phenotypes.

TI EXTRA-PAIR FERTILIZATIONS IN A PREDOMINANTLY MONOGAMOUS BIRD -
   GENETIC-EVIDENCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Parentage in indigo buntings, Passerina cyanea, was examined by electrophoresis of soluble enzymes in muscle tissue. There were nine polymorphic loci which segregated independently. Of 257 offspring sampled in the 2 years, 37 (14.4%) had genotypes incompatible with one of the putative parents. Since evidence suggested that intraspecific egg parasitism did not occur, all of these offspring probably came from successful extra-pair copulations. More neighboring males had genotypes that fitted the genotypes of the excluded young than expected by chance. Most of these males already had nesting females of their own. The probability of cuckoldry depended on the male''s age but not on whether or not he was polygynous. Some males probably fathered many offspring through extra-pair copulations while others were cuckolded. These results are examined in light of behavioral observations on this species. Because parental exclusions underestimate the frequency of extra-pair fertilizations, an estimate of the actual rate of extra-pair fertilization is reported. The consequences of these results for theories about mating systems and sexual selection are discussed.

TI SEXUAL DISPLAY RESPONSE OF FEMALE WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS TO NORMAL,
   ISOLATE AND MODIFIED CONSPECIFIC SONGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys, were tested for their sexual display response to several song stimuli. Experiment I showed that subjects displayed more to normal conspecific song than to normal song of the song sparrow, Melospiza melodia, a co-occurring and closely related species. Experiment 2 showed that subjects did not respond differently to isolate conspecific song and isolate song sparrow song; response to these stimuli was low in general. The results of experiment 2 implied that isolate song did not contain sufficient information for conspecific song recognition by females. Experiment 3 tested female response to songs composed of both normal and isolate components. The general trend was that the number of female displays increased with the number of normal components substituted for isolate song components, but one particular component of normal song, the ''simple syllables'' appeared to elicit a large increase in female displays and thus may serve an  important function in the recognition of conspecific song by female white-crowned sparrows.

TI ARE OYSTERCATCHERS (HAEMATOPUS-OSTRALEGUS) SELECTING THE MOST PROFITABLE
   MUSSELS (MYTILUS-EDULIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Size selection by oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus) feeding on the edible mussel Mytilus edulis by hammering the ventral side is analysed and compared with the predictions of an optimal diet model. It is found that the oystercatchers select mussels between 30 and 45 mm long which are not overgrown by barnacles and which are thin shelled. However, after including waste handling events in both the profitability and the diet model, and estimating the prey population available to the  oystercatchers, a good agreement between the prediction and the data is found. These results are further discussed in the light of optimal foraging theory.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF REWARD SEQUENCE ON FLIGHT DIRECTIONALITY IN BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) were trained to collect food from arrays of artificial flowers. Experiments were carried out to investigate how different sequences of rewards (sugar solution) affect the flight directionality in the next inter-flower move (i.e. the tendency to keep to the same direction as in the preceding flight). In the texts, bees could visit a row of four or five flowers. At the end of the row, bees were given a choice of direction for their next flight (i.e. forward, left, right, or backward). I investigated the effect of a reward sequence in relation to (1) the average amount of ''nectar'' gathered in the last few flower visits, regardless of the sequence of occurrence, or to (2) the reward received in the most recent flower visits. A reward given at the choice point itself reduced flight directionality. Effects of rewards offered on preceding flowers, i.e. one, two, or three steps before the choice point, were not significant. There was, however, evidence for  their additional effect. It is concluded that the influence of a reward on flight directionality vanishes rapidly as more flower visits are made.

TI INFLUENCE OF PREDATION RISK ON DIET SELECTIONS - A SIMPLE EXAMPLE IN THE
   GRAY SQUIRREL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Current models of the optimal diet are special cases of a more general (and complex) model which incorporates the effects of predation risk on diet selection; this follows from an assumption implicit in current models that all prey items are eaten where they are encountered. Relaxing this assumption to that a forager might carry a prey item to protective cover for consumption leads to the conclusion that the value of a prey item is a function of its distance to cover as well as its energy  content and handling time. Such considerations can significantly alter the outcome of diet selection relative to that expected from simple diet theory. We found that grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) may reject more energetically profitable, but small food items in favour of locating larger, less energetically profitable items that can be carried to protective cover for consumption without greatly sacrificing foraging efficiency. The squirrel''s tendency to reject a more profitable item is a function of its distance from cover and the size of the less profitable items. Such behaviour is inconsistent with predictions of current diet models, but is consistent with our qualitative predictions based on a previously determined predation-risk-foraging-efficiency trade-off in the grey squirrel.

AB Reports of adoptions by parent herring gulls have raised doubts about the existence and adpativeness of a parent-young recognition system in this species. In experiments with 6-8-day-old young, we show that young do recognize their parents'' vocalizations. We suggest that the particular parent-young recognition system in this species has evolved as a behavioural strategy that functions to reduce the risk of making high-cost recognition errors that could result in a parent attacking its own  offspring.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individual males of the grasshopper, Chorthippus brunneus, differ significantly in several components of their calling songs which are used to attract and stimulate females. In a ''round robin'' experiment involving 21 males, the variance in male mating success was greater than expected by chance. Males were ranked and correlated were sought between this rank and characteristics of the males. A significant negative correlation was found between rank and deviation of individual males from the  overall mean syllable length, indicating stabilizing selection on this character, which may be involved in species recognition. In individual competitions between males there was a tendency for the more actively singing male to mate with the female.

TI SONG LEARNING IN ZEBRA FINCHES - SOME EFFECTS OF SONG MODEL AVAILABILITY
   ON WHAT IS LEARNT AND WHEN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study indicates that captive male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) normally learn their song during the juvenile period between independence from their parents and sexual maturity, from whatever suitable song model is available. Virtually nothing is learnt from the father before this time. Hybrid songs may develop if birds are removed from the father and given a new song model before song learning is complete. The absence of a song model during the juvenile stage appears to postpone the sensitive phase and an abnormal song is produced until a suitable model becomes available. Normal song will then develop, even in a sexually mature adult. This indicates that experience and not age is the important factor determining the timing of the sensitive phase for song learning in zebra finches.

TI SCENT-MARKING IN THE GREY SHORT-TAILED OPOSSUM (MONODELPHIS-DOMESTICA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The characteristics and social determinants of scent-marking behavior were studied in a laboratory colony of grey short-tailed opossums (M. domestica), a small Brazilian didelphid. Scent-marking was sexually dimorphic, occurring more frequently and displayed at higher levels in males. Sexually immature males did not scent-mark; males just past the age of puberty (5 mo.) marked at low levels; and older males marked at high levels using the head, flank and chest. Male M. domestica preferentially scent-marked objects and areas previously marked by other males. Females showed interest in the scent-marks of males. Similarities in scent-marking behavior between this marsupial species and commonly studied eutherian species, and the possible functional significance of scent-marking in M. domestica are discussed.

TI THE EFFECTS OF PREY DEPLETION ON THE PATCH CHOICE OF FORAGING BLUE JAYS
   (CYANOCITTA-CRISTATA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) were trained to hunt for non-cryptic moths presented in projected images. On each trial, the jays chose one of two patches to hunt in: (1) a uniform, ''non-depleting'' patch with constant prey density of 0.25; or (2) a ''depleting'' patch in which prey density changed during the foraging bout. In the depleting patch, the initial prey densityhw as 0.50, decling to zero in a single step part-way through each foraging bout (session). The patch choices of the jays were greatly affected by these conditions. The jays chose the depleting patch early in the session, and then switched to the uniform patch. They obtained nearly all of the prey available. Analysis of the events preceding switches between patches suggested that the jays used different rules to switch out of each of the two patches.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Worker honey bees (A. mellifera) performing field duties are known to possess individual task specializations. Little evidence has been forthcoming about individual specializations among the younger pre-foraging worker bees performing hive duties. This paper reports results obtained from behavioral observations of worker bees in 7 hives. An information-theory analysis of these data reveals that the divergence from independence (D2) of worker bee identity and behavioral pattern performed has  a low value in all of the experimental hives. Young worker bees performing hive duties do not possess detectable individual specializations. Environmental and life-history considerations that may account for this difference in behavior between field and hive worker bees are discussed.

TI INNATE DIFFERENCES IN SINGING BEHAVIOR OF SPARROWS REARED IN ISOLATION
   FROM ADULT CONSPECIFIC SONG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Innate differences in the singing behavior of male swamp (Melospiza georgiana) and song (M. melodia) sparrows were identified by rearing males from the egg in the laboratory under identical conditions, in complete isolation from adult conspecific song. Isolation-reared males of both species displayed several abnormal song features, including reduced numbers of notes per song, longer durations of notes and inter-note intervals, and fewer notes per syllable. Despite these and other  abnormalities, many species differences emerged that matched differences in the natural singing behavior of the 2 spp. These included differences in song repertoire size, song duration and degrees of segmentation, numbers of notes per song, durations of notes and inter-note intervals, and several measures reflecting the organization of songs into note complexes, syllables and trills. Although learning can influence all levels of organization of the motor patterns of song in swamp and song  sparrows, its contribution to the achievement of normal song behavior appears to be most crucial at the level of the fine structure of the notes and syllables from which the songs are constructed.

AB Mixed groups of dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) and grey-headed juncos (J. caniceps) were observed at baited sites in northern Arizona [USA] during the non-breeding season. In interspecific and inter-racial conflicts, J. caniceps dorsalis was dominant to J. caniceps caniceps and to 2 races of dark-eyed juncos. J. caniceps dorsalis also fed significantly faster than any of the other juncos. For both species, feeding rates were approximately the same in large and small mixed-species groups, though in larger groups, individual grey-headed juncos won conflicts at a higher rate and individual dark-eyed juncos lost conflicts at a higher rate. Also, dark-eyed juncos fed at a significantly lower rate in groups comprised mostly of grey-headed juncos than in groups of similar size but composed mostly of conspecifics. Residency times and recapture probabilites were similar for the 2 spp. suggesting little difference in over-winter survival.

TI SERIAL ORDER IN WOOD THRUSH SONG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a study of two captive male wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), I found that each bird had a preferred serial order of songs when it sang in isolation. This order could be disrupted by playback. When the stimulus was one of the subject''s own songs, the bird often answered with the song that followed the stimulus song in the preferred order. This result supports the following hypothesis: the preferred serial order of songs delivered by a wood thrush is based, in part, on a mechanism by which one song facilitates, via a loop involving audition, the production of the next song in the sequence. I gained further insight into this mechanism by analyzing the response of the birds to each other''s songs and to experimentally altered songs.

An age-related change in behavior from foraging to wandering is quantified by measuring larval locomotion at the early, middle and late 3rd instar in an environment where food is distributed in patches. Strain, moisture, food and inhomogeneities in the texture of the surface of the medium significantly influence larval  locomotory behavior.

TI AGE AND SEX-DIFFERENCES IN THE DIET AND FEEDING STRATEGIES OF THE GREEN
   MONKEY, CERCOPITHECUS-SABAEUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The diet and activity patterns of a group of green monkeys (C. sabaeus) living in the Parc National du Niokolo-Koba, Senegal, were studied over a complete annual cycle and some important age and sex differences were found. In the annual diet, no clear age-sex differences emerged for feeding on fruit, invertebrates or other (mainly foliage) foods, but adult males ate more flowers. In the annual time-budget, no sex differences were found among immature monkeys, but adult females spent less time  feeding than adult males. This difference is accounted for by the greater metabolic body-size of adult males. There were seasonal differences among the adults: males spent more time feeding than females in the dry season, but not in the wet season. Males ate more fruit and flowers in the dry season; females ate more foliage in the wet season. Lactating females fed less than nonlactating females. The differences between adults are attributed to superior competitive ability by males over 1st choice foods (fruit and flowers) and to alternative energetic and nutritional strategies of lactating females in response to increased protein requirements.

TI EFFECT OF INCREASING PERIODS OF FAMILIARITY ON SOCIAL INTERACTIONS
   BETWEEN MALE SIBLING MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of familiarity on social interactions between male sibling mice was investigated. Siblings were given increasing periods of familiarity within their own families then separated and allowed to inteact within mixed litters comprised of siblings and non-siblings. When tested as adults, previously separated siblings showed decreasing investigatory activity and increasing passive body contact as the period of familiarity increased. The effect of familiarity was particularly evident in  siblings given 21 days of familiarity or more. Unfamiliar siblings separated immediately after birth spent less time investigating each other and showed more passive body contact and total activity when compared with unfamiliar non-siblings. While familiarity seems to play an important role in social interactions between male sibling mice, the ability of these animals to recognize each other can develop without postnatal association between the animals involved or with parents. Familiarity with self or with other available siblings'' cues might contribute to this ability.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Within a troop of free-ranging yellow baboons (P. cynocephalus) seasonal changes synchronized with simultaneous changes that occurred in the pattern with which it used its range, and environmental factors within that range are described. The most females within the troop were impregnable and the most males emigrated and immigrated when: the troop''s pattern of range use was most likely to bring it into contact with other troops, visual contact with other troops was least restricted, juvenile  troop members may not have needed to be as close to adult males for protection from predators and the least amount of time was spent gathering food. Other troop members, particularly juveniles, consistently maintained closer proximity to adult males when dangers from predators may have been greatest as a consequence of a seasonal increase in both cover density and variability and an increase in the predictability of the location of the troop due to its pattern of range use being smallest in area and most clumped and to its frequent use of the same sleeping sites for several consecutive nights. Seasonal changes in the reproductive biology of troop members and the defensive spatial structure of the troop are adaptively synchronized with the changes in the patterns with which the troop uses its range and the environmental factors within that range.

TI DETECTION OF CUCKOLDRY IN RING DOVES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Several situational factors which contribute to the male ring dove''s (S. risoria) ability to detect cuckoldry were examined. Detection of cuckoldry as independent of the more general phenomenon of selection for mate synchrony between members of a potential pair was tested. Males behaved more aggressively toward females that had received prior exposure to other males, regardless of reproductive synchrony. Paired birds were also used to study the influence of pair-formation on cuckoldry detection. Paired males showed less wing-flipping and more pecking than did unpaired males when tested with paired (inseminated) females. The males'' ability to detect cuckoldry in their mates was examined. Paired birds responded in the same way to each other when reunited, regardless of whether females spent the separation period alone or with a new male. The length of the separation was salient to the males'' behavior. These results indicate that male ring doves can detect cuckoldry. The female''s behavior determines the degree to which the male will be successful.

TI GENETIC DISSECTION OF A MAMMALIAN BEHAVIOR PATTERN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Defined categories of grooming behavior were subjected to genetic studies using recombinant inbred strains of mice (Mus musculus). Three categories (prefacial forelimb tremor-contact, overhead stroke and repetitive facial grooming) were observed in a novel open-field situation. The frequency of occurrence of each category showed highly significant genetic variability and was presumably regulated by a polygenic system. Correlations attributable to environmental and genetic factors were low and nonsignificant between the grooming category frequencies. Component characters of complex mammalian behavior patterns may be inherited independently and each character may show genetic variability, providing a basis for phylogenetic modification of behavior patterns.

   (ZONOTRICHIA-ALBICOLLIS) RELEASED ALOFT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Migrant white-throated sparrows (Z. albicollis) were released from boxes carried aloft by balloon and tracked with radar. All birds were released on clear nights when winds were light and opposed to the normal migration direction for the season. Birds were treated in 1 of 2 ways: Lens-birds were fitted with frosted lenses prior to release; no-Lens birds were released without lenses. No-Lens birds that engaged in straight and level flight generally headed in the predicted migratory direction and as a group were not oriented with respect to wind direction. Lens-birds did not head in the predicted migratory direction, but instead oriented downwind. This orientation behavior is consistent with the relationship of orientation cues inferred from the field observations described earlier. Flying birds deprived of all detailed form vision can determine wind direction.

TI SOCIAL ASPECTS OF THE TERMINATION OF INCUBATION BEHAVIOR IN THE RING
   DOVE (STREPTOPELIA-RISORIA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of male and female ring doves (S. risoria) in the termination of incubation behavior was studied first by observing heterosexual pairs (male and female) and homosexual pairs (female and female) (experiment 1). Male/female pairs incubate for 22 days whether squab or unhatched eggs are in the nest; female/female pairs incubate for 25 days or more. Males take the lead in terminating incubation. Another group of doves, separated from their (heterosexual) partners late in incubation, were exposed to 1 of 4 stimulus conditions: an incubating dove, a reproductively-inactive dove; a reproductively-active dove and visual isolation. Females extended the duration of their incubation when exposed to the sight of another dove, except when the stimulus dove was reproductively active. Males did not extend their incubation in response to these social cues. These social stimuli terminating incubation behavior coordinate the withdrawal from the nest of male and female in preparation for the next breeding episode in this monogamous species.

TI SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION AND COMMUNAL BREEDING IN THE CHESTNUT-BELLIED
   STARLING (SPREO-PULCHER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Chestnut-bellied starlings (S. pulcher) live in social groups of 10-30 individuals and, during their breeding seasons, maintain group ranges which show little overlap with neighboring groups. A social group may contain 2-6 breeding pairs, non-breeding adults of both sexes, and immatures. Each breeding female has her own nest and she alone incubates. The parents and up to 12 other starlings feed the nestlings. Individual helpers may successively or simultaneously attend the nests of different breeders. The percentage of nests attended within a group differs for helpers of different sex, age and breeding status: immatures of 1-2 yr and non-breeding adult males help most and adult females least. Nests with more helpers have higher fledging success than those with fewer helpers. These results are discussed with reference to the tentative benefits of helping behavior and kinship relationships within the social group.

TI SLEEP IN THE HERRING GULL (LARUS-ARGENTATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sleep postures and eye state of free-ranging herring gulls (L. argentatus) were studied during the breeding season. Three mutually exclusive behaviors were observed, i.e., sleep, rest-sleep and rest postures. Arousal thresholds, eye blink rates and eye closure time were obtained during these behaviors. Significant relationships existed between eye blinking, eye closure and a raised threshold of arousal when birds were in the sleep and rest-sleep postures. During a natural disturbance, birds in the sleep posture remained in this posture but did not blink their eyes: this is called pseudo-sleep. Male gulls also exhibit a lower threshold of arousal while in the sleep posture compared with females. Rhythmic eye blinking is probably a good indication of sleep in herring gulls.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF VISUAL SPECIES IDENTIFICATION IN DUCKLINGS - WHAT IS THE
   ROLE OF IMPRINTING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The phenomenon of imprinting (a rapid form of exposure learning) is widely presumed to underlie the formation of normal, species-typical social preferences in precocial birds. To determine whether this is in fact the case, 24 h old domestic and semi-wild mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) were allowed to follow a stuffed hen of 1 of 3 sympatric waterfowl species for 20 min. The models used were mallard, redhead (Aythya americana), and pintail (Anas acuta) hens. When later tested for their preference for the familiar hen in simultaneous choice tests with 1 of the other 2 stuffed models, only those birds trained with mallard and tested with the mallard and pintail models (designated the mallard vs. pintail group) showed a preference for the familiar model. (That preference was shown by both domestic and semi-wild ducklings). In none of the other 3 groups (mallard vs. redhead, redhead vs. mallard, or pintail vs. mallard) was the imprinting procedure effective in producing a preference for the familiar model. When other ducklings were similarly trained with either the mallard model, a red-and-white-striped box, or a green styrofoam ball, a preference for the familiar model was found in all 4 groups (mallard vs. red box, red box vs. mallard, red box vs. green ball, and green ball vs. red box). Increasing the length of the training period from 20 min to 2 h and to 24 h did not produce a preference for the familiar mallard over the unfamiliar redhead. These results raise some doubt that imprinting as currently conceived is the behavioral mechanism of visual species identification as it occurs in nature.

TI STABILITY AND LABILITY IN THE EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIOR IN NEREID
   POLYCHAETES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Members of the family Nereidae have radiated into a variety of different ecological niches, but have retained basically similar patterns of tubicolous behavior. Nereis diversicolor, N. fucata and Platyneresis dumerilii behave in similar ways when kept under constant conditions, in feeding, in fighting and in reacting to closure and reopening of the water supply. These patterns of behavior have probably been retained in their behavioral repertoires because they continue to be effective in all tube- and burrow-living species. Reproductive habits are more diverse and have presumably been more labile in their evolutionary history. Such diversity may have arisen in response to selective pressures for species isolation and, in some cases, the need to adapt to life in fresh and brackish waters.

AB The effects of prior sexual experience on the probability that male guppies will court females with high or low intensity displays, or attempt rape were examined; female receptivity to this courtship was noted. There were no differences in behavior between males with a history of high copulation success and those with low copulation success. Males with receptive females exhibited higher levels of high intensity displays and fewer rape attempts than males with unreceptive females, regardless of prior experience. Sexual selection and the selective advantage of behavioral plasticity in which different sexual behavior patterns are chosen, with respect to the probability of a successful mating at a given time, were discussed.

Following a 2-3 day period of separation from their mates, 20 females were tested individually in 30 min simultaneous auditory choice tests. Of the birds that showed clear preferences as assessed via approach duration scores, 14 strongly preferred the song of their mate, and 2 preferred the song of a neighbor. Thus, one possible function of male zebra finch song, which is highly variable inter-individually, is to provide his mate with an acoustic basis of individual recognition that may serve to strengthen and/or maintain the pair bond.

TI INDIVIDUALITY AND STABILITY OF ISOLATION PEEPS IN SQUIRREL-MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Isolation peeps (IP) made by captive squirrel monkeys (S. sciureus) of both the Gothic and Roman type were analyzed by spectrographic and statistical methods designed to quantify the degree of individuality found in utterances from single individuals. Clustering analysis confirmed that in both groups of monkeys individually distinct combinations of acoustic features characterize the IP and that such unique combinations persist over periods of several years. Differences between the Gothic and Roman form of the IP were found in more aspects of acoustic structure than previously known. Information about the identity of the vocalizer may be contained in the IP.

TI LOCUST AS PREY - FACTORS AFFECTING THEIR VULNERABILITY TO PREDATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experiments were conducted to investigate 4 factors which could affect the vulnerability of nymphs of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria to predation. Three different vertebrate species of predator were used, humans, lizards and a chicken. The factors studied were the color and size/age of the locusts, the background on which the nymphs were presented and the numbers presented (singly or in groups of 5). These variables were each important to at least 1 of the species used, in modifying predation; different variables were important to different predators. The green nymphs surprisingly did not appear to be better protected on the green background than were the yellow and black nymphs.

TI MODELS OF PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT .2. PROMISCUITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The population genetics of Trivers (1974) concept of parent-offspring was examined for species in which the effects of the conflict are felt by future half-sibs, as in promiscuous mating systems in which the male shows no parental care. Whether or not a rare conflictor gene will spread in a non-conflictor population depends on f(m) > (m + 1)/(0.5 m + 1.5) for a dominant gene, and on f(m) > 1/4(m + 3) for a recessive gene; f(m) is the fitness gained by a conflictor relative to a non-conflictor offspring [f(m) > 1], and m is the amount of parental investment taken by a conflictor relative to m = 1 for a non-conflictor. The ESS [evolutionarily stable strategy] value for conflict (mo) in promiscuous species with zero male parental care has mo = f(mo)/4[df(mo)/dm0]. Where the male maintains the same harem for several breeding seasons, or where there is promiscuity but both sexes contribute equally to parental care, conditions for conflict are equivalent to monogamy.

TI CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF LIVING IN HETEROSEXUAL PAIRS AND MIXED GROUPS ON
   STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ATTRACTION IN SQUIRREL-MONKEYS (SAIMIRI)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The structure of social attrection was assessed in pair- and group-living squirrel monkeys (Saimiri) using paired-comparison and single-stimulus preference tests. Effects of the social environment were most prominent in females. Females housed with a single male showed sharply increased attraction to like sex strangers and less pronounced increase in attraction to opposite sex strangers, as compared to group-living females. Differences between pair- and group-living males were in the same direction found with females, but less extreme. Most group-living monkeys strongly preferred familiar animals to strangers regardless of sex and like sex to opposite sex families. Change in the structure of social attractions in response to variations in the composition of the social environment appears to be an important factor in the maintenance of the species typical grouping pattern in the squirrel monkey.

TI SOCIAL GROOMING PATTERNS IN 2 HERDS OF MONOZYGOTIC TWIN DAIRY-COWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Grooming patterns and the amount of social grooming occurring during daylight hours between herd members were recorded. Age and body weight were positively related to the giving of social grooming, as were age, body weight, milk weight, and milking order to the amount of social grooming received. The 2 members of a monozygotic twin pair have a similar social grooming rank with respect to the rest of the herd and the preferred partner of a herd member for social grooming is its twin. Social grooming may be used to uncover an affiliative or epimeletic scale of social distance within the cow herd as an alternative to scales of social distance based on agonistic encounters.

TI SELF-ANOINTING BY WILD HEDGEHOGS, ERINACEUS-EUROPAEUS, IN NEW-ZEALAND
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Of 929 wild hedgehogs examined, 19 bore signs of recent self-anointing. The spittle deposited on the hedgehogs'' backs usually gave off a sharp smell, clearly detectable some meters down-wind. Nestling animals anointed themselves when removed from their nests, possibly as a means of advertising their whereabouts to their mothers. The habit was not detected among newly-independent young animals nor among sub-adults. Among adult hedgehogs, self-anointing was confined to the breeding season, and on 5 occasions was elicited in the presence of other hedgehogs of the opposite sex. In this context self-anointing may serve as a form of sexual signal. When brought into captivity the self-anointing reflex is triggered by novel objects or odors and, in this unnatural context, it is argued that the behavior falls into the category of a displacement activity, being inappropriate to the situation and seemingly purposeless.

TI INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES IN FEEDING EFFICIENCIES AND FEEDING PREFERENCES
   OF CAPTIVE GREAT TITS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The preferences of 8, adult, hand-reared great tits [Parus major] for feeding on 4 different types of feeding sites were tested. There were significant differences between individuals in these preferences, and the preferences for the different objects were correlated with the birds'' individual feeding efficiencies on the objects. This correlation was thought to be a result of the birds'' experience and learning during training for the experiment. During the tests the birds tended to make runs of visits to the same object type. This effect was more marked for less-preferred objects, and when the birds had just made a successful visit.

TI COMPETITIVE DOMINANCE OF WILD AND DOMESTIC NORWAY RATS
   (RATTUS-NORVEGICUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Differences were determined in the relative dominance of wild and domestic Norway rats (R. norvegicus) when competing for food in inter-stock, round-robin pairings. Each day, after food-deprivation, wild and domestic rats were individually placed in a testing arena containing a slice of apple. On day 20 and every 4th day thereafter, 8 wild-domestic pairs were allowed to compete for the apple. Domestic subjects spent more time eating than did wild rats and were more often dominant. Competition tended to wane over test days in response to defeat in earlier trials. The outcome of competition trials was not changed by increasing the extent of food deprivation together with continuous pairing. A reduction in social inhibitions accompanying the domestication process provides the best explanation for the enhanced competitive potential of the domestic rat.

TI THE LOGIC OF ASYMMETRIC CONTESTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A theoretical analysis is made of the evolution of behavior strategies in contest situations. It is assumed that behaviour will evolve so as to maximize individual fitness. If so, a population will evolve an ''evolutionarily stable strategy'' (ESS), which can be defined as a strategy such that, if all members of a population adopt it, no ''mutant'' strategy can do better. A number of simple models of contest situations are analyzed from this point of view. In ''symmetric'' contests the ESS is likely to be a ''mixed'' strategy; that is, either the population will be genetically polymorphic or individuals will be behaviorally variable. Most real contests are probably asymmetric, either in pay-off to the contestants, or in size or weapons, or in some ''uncorrelated'' fashion; i.e. in a fashion which does not substantially bias either the pay-offs or the likely outcome of an escalated contest. An example of an uncorrelated asymmetry is that between the ''discoverer'' of a resource and a ''late-comer''. The ESS in asymmetric contests will usually be to permit the asymmetric cue to settle the contest without escalation. Escalated contests will, however, occur if information to the contestants about the asymmetry is imperfect.

AB A form of object-retrieval is described, in which the rat [Rattus norvegicus] transports a part of its own body, usually its tail, from the outside environment into its home cage. The 1st experiment reported shows that ''tail-hoarding'' can occur without previous hoarding experience. The 2nd indicates that this behavior is less frequent when the animals are deprived of food, as found previously for the hoarding of other non-food objects.

TI ETHOLOGICAL ISOLATION BETWEEN SYMPATRIC AND ALLOPATRIC SPECIES OF
   OBSCURA GROUP OF DROSOPHILA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mating within and between 6 species of the obscura species group of Drosophila was studied in Elens-Wattiaux observation chambers. Ethological (sexual) isolation is found between any 2 of these species, Although some cross-mating is observed in almost all combinations. The degree of the isolation is, however, by no means proportional to the morphological or to the chromosomal differences between the species, or to their ability to produce viable hybrids if and when the cross-mating does take place. Three sibling species living sympatrically in western North America are isolated from each other at least as strongly as they are isolated from the much less closely related Japanese and European species. The 2 sibling species, sympatric in Hokkaido, Japan, are again quite strongly isolated from each other. Natural selection promotes ethological isolation and other premating isolating mechanisms between related species exposed to the challenge of hybridization.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Five female beagles were tested with 5 males during 2 estrous periods and preferences of each bitch for particular males were noted. Each female preferences were consistent from 1 period of heat to the next. Females reacted to non-preferred males with threat (snarl, bark, lunge and snap) or with attack (bite, chase). Some males were accepted by all females and others were rejected by the majority, but no male was rejected by all bitches. Rejection did not necessarily prevent a male from copulating with the rejecting female but did markedly reduce the frequency of successful matings.

TI SUN COMPASS ORIENTATION OF NORTHERN CRICKET FROG ACRIS CREPITANS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When released in water at the center of a 50-ft circular pen, frogs from natural shores oriented on a compass course (Y-axis) that bisected the home shore at right angles. Movement in closed containers, in view of the sky, and a 115-mile displacement did not affect per-formance. Specimens from opposite shores oriented to their respective Y-axis, even when released simultaneously. Frogs held in darkness for periodic release during a 24-hr. period continued to orient. Orientation of frogs held in darkness at a constant temperature (30 hr - 7 days) declined in accuracy and culminated in a random pattern after 7 days, presumably due to differences in phase synchronization with local time. Orientation was reestablished by exposing "dephased" specimens to the normal light-dark regime or to daily temperature and humidity fluctuations. A normal photo-period 6 hr. early or late, relative to local time, reestablished orientation, but on a Y-axis 90[degree] to the left or right. A daily exposure to 10 min. indirect light reestablished orientation in 8 days.

TI OBSERVATIONS ON SENSE OF TASTE IN ARMADILLO (DASYPUS NOVEMCINCTUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In 2-bottle preference tests, armadillos were in-different to solutions preferred by many other spp. and described by man as "sweet" (saccharin and sucrose). Furthermore, these animals avoided maltose, a sugar which is selected by rats, dogs and man. They were also indifferent to quinine hydrochloride at a concentration which is rejected by other animals. While the responses to "bitter" and "sweet" suggest the taste pattern found in the fowl and other members of the class Aves. the armadillo rejected hydrochloric acid at a concentration preferred by many mammals. Collectively the information indicates that the armadillo has a sense of taste differing from that of other animals for which data are available.

TI NEGATIVE GEOTAXIS IN MICE - EFFECT OF BALANCING PRACTICE ON INCLINE
   BEHAVIOUR IN C57BL/6J MALE MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three groups of 15 male C57BL/6J mice were given 30 days of differential training prior to a test for negative geotaxis on inclines of 20[degree], 30[degree], 40[degree], 50[degree], 60[degree], and 70[degree] from the horizontal. One group received no special handling; another group received practice on wide elevated runways; and a third group received practice on narrow elevated runways which required continual bodily adjustments in order to remain on the runways. Twenty-four hr. after the last practice period each animal was tested for negative geotaxis on all 6 inclines. When every orientation up the incline was averaged for each animal, a trend analysis indicated a significant variation for the effects of practice. The group receiving balancing practice on the narrow runways responded at a steeper orientation up the incline than the other 2 groups. The trend for linearity was highly significant, indicating that as the angle of the incline steepened, the orientation progressed toward the vertical. These same animals were given an additional 10 days of differential experience, as before, and again tested, but this time only at the 20[degree] incline. The results were similar to those of the 1st test, indicating that balancing experience increases the steepness of the orientation up the incline. This time 3 different methods of measuring orientation were used. Identical defecation scores on the runways of the first test suggest that the difference displayed due to balancing is not related to an emotional response. Body weight was equal for all groups as were the weights for the cerebrum and cerebellum. Balancing practice was noticed to create a phenocopy of genetic differences found in arboreal and non-arboreal species of Peromyscus mice.

TI ANTICIPATORY FEEDING BEHAVIOUR IN BULLFROG (RANA CATESBEIANA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The feeding behavior in a laboratory colony of bullfrogs was studied by means of time-lapse photography. It was found that the animals evidently anticipate time and place of feeding, since they aggregate near the feeding site in advance. It is shown that this behavior is a conditioned response, the conditioned stimulus being the start of a working day. The response does not occur on holidays, and can be manipulated by changing the time and site of feeding. The animals learn such a change fairly rapidly; acquisition of the new response takes some 5-7 trials, extinction of the old response 3-4 trials. Relearning of a previously extinguished response takes longer and seems to involve a latent period during which no anticipatory activity is evident. The significance of the results for understanding frog survival is discussed.

TI RELEASERS OF COURTSHIP AND TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOUR IN SIDE BLOTCHED LIZARD
   UTA STANSBURIANA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The value as social releasers of body form, color pattern, behavior and odor in Uta stansburiana was investigated. Males established territories in large wooden boxes. Female Uta, models, and males of other closely related species were then introduced for short periods of time as non-residents and the reactions of the resident noted. The non-residents were treated in various manners to isolate the above 4 factors. The results indicated that male Uta stansburiana possess strong ability to distinguish the sex of non-resident Uta on the basis of color pattern and behavior of the latter. Territorial behavior was released by either male Uta color pattern or rapid flight by the non-resident. When it was released by the former it required reinforcement by the latter, and since the rapid flight was not continuous, the presence of both seemed imperative to stimulate continuous territorial behavior. The factors releasing courtship behavior were less obvious than those releasing territorial behavior but were probably a combination of Uta-like body form, relatively quiescent behavior and female Uta color pattern. Odor did not play an important role in stimulating either territorial or courtship behavior in the resident. Other small male iguanid lizards provided stimuli that released courtship rather than territorial behavior in male Uta. Resident males copulated only with females that were relatively submissive. Male Uta were not observed to actively chase females.

TI DISINHIBITION OF DRINKING DURING SATIATION OF FEEDING BEHAVIOUR IN
   BARBARY DOVE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The onset of satiation of operant feeding behavior in the Barbary dove is characterized by a pause during which no feeding behavior occurs. If water is present in the test-cage, the birds will drink, but the presence of water does not affect the time at which the pause occurs. Birds which have been deprived of water as well as food drink more water during the pause than birds deprived only of food, but again the position of the pause is not affected. It is argued that the pause is a true indication of the satiation of feeding behavior, and that it is caused by a shift of attenti on during which drinking is disinhibited. The implications of the results for physiological theories of food satiation are discussed in detail; it is concluded that there are 2 types of interaction between the feeding and drinking systems of the Barbary dove; a short-term type and a long-term type.

TI BEHAVIOUR OF JUVENILE RHESUS MONKEYS IN GROUPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Frequency and duration scores were collected on 11 juvenile Macaca mulatta maintained as a group in a 40 ft x 24 ft x 8 ft outdoor compound. An adult male was added to the group and data collection repeated. Data were also compared with that for a hetero-gneeous age group. In the presence of adults, juveniles patterns more closely resemble adult activity patterns than in the absence of adults. The juvenile group displays typical rhesus activities with some juveniles filling adult roles. The patterns in these animals are, however, incomplete and mixed with typical juvenile activities. Typical juvenile activities appear to be emphasized when adult animals are not present.

AB The likelihood of hybridization after secondary contact is reduced when assortative mating is strong and fitness of hybrids is low; thus, maintaining reproductive isolation. To this end, signals that convey population identity may enhance recognition and reduce hybridization by promoting assortative mating. Here, we studied visual and acoustic signals, plumage colour and song, that commonly mediate species recognition in birds to evaluate their role in reproductive isolation in a recently diverged clade of Neotropical birds. Subspecies of the variable seedeater, Sporophila corvina, that differ dramatically in plumage colour have established secondary contact at two independent contact zones in Costa Rica and Panama. We first evaluated divergence in song in allopatric populations close to the most recent contact zone (Costa Rica), where the two subspecies do not hybridize, and found significant differences in song structure and composition of song elements between subspecies. Then, we used an experimental approach to measure a territorial male's aggressive response to visual and acoustic signals, as a proxy of the role of divergent secondary sexual traits in reproductive isolation. These playback experiments did not show clear effects of divergent colour or song on aggressive response: we found no effect of plumage coloration or song in one subspecies and males of the other subspecies were more aggressive towards homotypic songs but, unexpectedly, also more aggressive towards to heterotypic plumages. Separately, we also characterized the song structure of hybrid individuals from the Panamanian contact zone to evaluate how songs covary given evidence for gene flow. These hybrid individuals sang songs of different element composition than allopatric subspecies but did not differ in most acoustic characteristics. Overall, our experiments suggest that reproductive isolation based on secondary sexual signals is weak in this group, and after secondary contact, the breeding phenology may synchronize and divergent acoustic signals may homogenize, facilitating further hybridization.

AB Disturbance cues are chemicals released by disturbed but uninjured prey. These cues elicit increased vigilance when detected by conspecifics, similar to the better-known damaged-released alarm cues. Many studies on predation risk expose prey to cues from whole-body homogenates as an indicator of predation risk. Such homogenates are known to contain alarm cues but presumably also contain disturbance cues, although their contribution to responses elicited by homogenates is unstudied. Here, we first attempted to quantify the relative contribution of disturbance cues to the behavioural response to whole-body homogenates, by exposing larval woodfrogs, Lithobates sylvaticus, to homogenates from conspecifics that were either undisturbed (contained disturbance cues), or that just received a disturbance from a simulated predator chase (which presumably depleted disturbance cues). Both sets of homogenates elicited similar antipredator behaviour (reduced activity) in receivers, suggesting that disturbance cues either made little contribution to the responses or were not depleted by the chase. Responses to homogenates were also stronger than responses to disturbance cues alone, suggesting that tadpole alarm cues were the primary risk indicator in the homogenates, and that alarm cues are more potent than disturbance cues. Although the chemistry and release mechanisms of disturbance cues remain poorly understood, research suggests they are pulses of nitrogenous waste. Hence, in experiment 2, we investigated the physiological limitation of disturbance cue communication. Disturbance cues were collected after each of two chasing events, separated by either a short (5 min) or long (2 h) time delay, giving tadpoles either a short or long opportunity to replenish their disturbance cues. Unexpectedly, tadpoles maintained their response intensity to disturbance cues after the shorter replenishment period and showed a weakened response after the longer period. These findings indicate that disturbance cues in tadpoles are not immediately depleted by a chasing event and instead may be released slowly. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB The behavioural response of individuals to a predator should be related to their long-term predation risk. However, few studies have tested whether and how parents adjust nest defence intensity according to regional nest predation pressure. By monitoring Japanese tits, Parus minor, breeding in artificial nestboxes, we investigated nest predation pressure across China in Jilin (44 degrees N), Liaoning (39 degrees N), Henan (31 degrees N) and Hainan (18 degrees N), and compared nest defence behaviours of parent tits to nest predators among the four populations by conducting dummy experiments. We found that nest predation pressure faced by tits varied geographically. Liaoning tits performed weaker, and Henan tits stronger, defence behaviour against snakes (local high predation risk) than against chipmunks, Tamias sibiricus (local medium/low predation risk). Among populations, Liaoning tits performed the weakest defence behaviour against snakes (regional high predation risk) and Henan tits performed the weakest defence behaviour against chipmunks (regional low predation risk). In addition, hissing behaviour was mainly used to defend against chipmunks, and was rarely shown in Henan where rodent predation risk was low. We conclude that tits adjusted and most likely reduced their defence effort when local nest predation risk was extremely high or low, and reduced the costly hissing behaviour when predation pressure was relaxed from rodents.

AB In mammals, robust connection between mothers and offspring plays pivotal roles in physiological and socioemotional development. Our study investigated the consequences of early maternal deprivation on social play behaviour in immature chimpanzees, examining expected and unexpected findings. In line with the predicted hypothesis, orphaned individuals exhibited lower frequencies of social play than mother-reared chimpanzees, supporting traditional notions of the indispensable role of maternal influence in the correct expression of social behaviours. However, the absence of discernible differences in the variability and roughness of playful patterns, tested for the first time in orphan and mother-reared chimpanzees, suggests that the presence of adult models may not be fundamental for expanding and regulating immature playful behavioural repertoire. Escalation into overt aggression did not differ between orphan and mother-reared chimpanzees, challenging the idea of the crucial role of maternal investment in developing self-restrain abilities during play. Orphans engaged in shorter sessions compared with mother-reared subjects; this strategy is naturally adopted by wild and captive chimpanzees when they need to cope with the risk of escalation during play fighting. Although maternal deprivation has been linked to anxiety-related and depressive behaviours in primates, our results reveal a degree of behavioural resilience in orphans that are still able to adhere to social rules during play, particularly when having contact with their peers. Although play behaviour development can arise from the multifaceted interconnection between early experiences, social dynamics and individual propensity to interact socially, our findings support the view, emerging from a plethora of studies on many social mammals, that play has an irreplaceable role in an individual's life history.

AB Development and maintenance of neural architecture supporting learning and memory, as well as active storage of learnt information, are predicted to carry significant energetic costs. Here we explored whether the demands of learning about fitness-relevant stimuli come at a cost to the reproductive success of an insect model. Bumble bee (Bombus spp.) queens found nests alone, and early in the colony cycle must invest simultaneously in learning about rewarding floral resources and colony founding. We exposed queens of Bombus terrestris audax emerging from diapause to a 6-day reversal learning task and compared colony founding success of these individuals to two control groups that did not learn but received equal food. Additionally, we limited carbohydrate intake in half of queens across all treatments. Nutritionally stressed queens had a lower probability of egg laying, delayed nest initiation and lower offspring production compared with nutritionally unrestricted queens, suggesting resource availability at this life cycle stage is crucial to founding successful colonies and population growth. Nevertheless, potential energetic demands of learning did not reduce colony founding success in a laboratory set-up, even in nutritionally stressed groups. Our findings provide a rare real-world test of the costs associated with learning and suggest they do not affect reproductive potential in bumble bee queens. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB The cognitive process of innovation in animals produces new or modified behaviours in response to new challenges. Common raccoons rely on their problem-solving ability to exploit anthropogenic resources that are not freely available. As a result, they are often involved in human-wildlife confiict. We used two food extraction tasks of varying difficulty levels to measure problem-solving ability in wild raccoons living in three Canadian protected areas. We conducted experiments in two distinct locations within each park based on human footprint: recreation and preservation zones. We also looked at the effect of the presence of conspecifics and of two behavioural traits (exploratory diversity and persistence) on performance. Performance differed between the puzzles, with one of them being easier to solve based on success rate and time to success. The zone (presence of humans) did not affect problem-solving performance, while there was a tendency for solving time to increase with the presence of conspecifics. Exploratory diversity was positively related to success rate and time taken to solve. Contrary to predictions, persistence did not improve performance. There were also individual differences in performance in term of success rate and time to completion. We encourage using multiple concurrent tests to evaluate problem solving with wild individuals. Overall, we provide additional evidence that raccoons are apt problem-solvers, with the potential to adapt to new foraging opportunities, and a relevant species to study innovation in mammals.

AB Odour serves as a long-lasting cue or signal that animals with developed olfactory systems rely on heavily for communication. The ability to discriminate a particular odour modulates the social behaviours of a receiver. Animals investigate odours from unfamiliar conspecifics more than they do those from familiar ones, either as a means of choosing a mate or to avoid competition. The African painted dog, Lycaon pictus, which is known for its sophisticated sociality and extremely strong body odour, appears to rely heavily on odour communication. However, empirical research on odour-related behaviour in this species is limited. We investigated whether captive African painted dogs discriminated between their own odours and those of conspecifics, between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics, and between the sexes. Our behavioural experiments showed that subjects investigated other conspecifics' odours longer than they did their own odour. Detailed analysis showed that they spent more time investigating unfamiliar conspecifics than familiar ones. The effect of donor sex on the investigation duration was not significant when comparing odours from males and females. However, the investigation time of odours from females was longer than that of their own, with no such difference observed between odours from males and their own. This study is the first to demonstrate that the African painted dog is capable of discriminating its own odour from the odours of conspecifics, between familiar and unfamiliar animals and between the sexes. This research provides fundamental knowledge of odour communication in this species. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social species rely on acquiring appropriate social skills to navigate their social environment. Developmental plasticity allows individuals to develop an appropriate phenotype by receiving cues from their social and nonsocial environment. However, committing to a specific phenotype early in life may prove maladaptive if there is a mismatch between the early and future environment. To address potential mismatches, multiple or extended sensitive periods provide opportunities for individuals to gather the necessary information in changing and predictable environments. Cooperative breeders, like the highly social cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, typically experience changing environments especially during dispersal. While we know that early development is critical for the acquisition of social competence, it remains uncertain whether a second or extended sensitive period exists around the time of dispersal decisions in cooperative breeders. Here we manipulated the early and late life social environment of N. pulcher and asked whether individuals retain plasticity to adjust their social phenotype around sexual maturation. Juveniles were raised for 2 months with or without adults and tested for social competence. Shortly before reaching sexual maturity, they were randomly assigned to be housed alone, with siblings or with a social group for an additional 2 months before undergoing further social competence testing. Aggressive and submissive behaviours were assessed in two social contexts. Fish raised with a large group exhibited greater social competence compared to those raised only among siblings, regardless of subsequent social experiences. This suggests that either early life cues reliably predict future environments in nature or that constraints on late life plasticity exist. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Urbanization imposes significant challenges upon wildlife worldwide, highlighting the need to understand how species and individuals respond to urban environments. Because animal behaviour is not fully plastic, these behavioural responses may also reflect consistent differences between individuals (behavioural types, BTs), or affect the covariation of different BTs in the population (behavioural syndromes, BSs). Here, we focused on the spur -winged lapwing, Vanellus spinosus, a common resident occupying diverse habitats. We caught breeding lapwings from sites throughout central and northern Israel and calculated their urbanization scores (built-up area around the nest). In an aviary, we subsequently performed three commonly used behavioural assays: (1) 'latency to emerge', (2) 'open-field' test and (3) respond to conspecific model. We repeated the sequence three times at weekly intervals. After determining that behaviours were indeed repeatable (i.e. they establish BTs), and reducing dimensions through principle component analyses, we found that the behaviours observed during both the 'openfield' and the 'response to conspecific' assays were affected by the interaction between an individual's sex, body condition and urbanization score. Lapwings from more urban areas displayed stronger sexdependent behaviours (with urban males being calmer in the 'open-field' test and more tolerant of the conspecific threat compared to urban females). Finally, urban lapwings showed stronger BSs than nonurban ones, with stronger covariation between their latency to emerge and calmness BTs during the two subsequent assays. Overall, our study sheds light on the patterns of behavioural changes associated with urbanization, demonstrating how both the behaviours themselves (BTs) and their dependencies (BSs) may be influenced, while also highlighting the potential interaction of behavioural changes with individuals' physiological condition and sex. Such detailed knowledge can inform mitigation strategies of the issues encountered by wild animals inhabiting urban areas, and to understand why some species are more resilient to urbanization than others.

AB Individual variation in the timing of activities is increasingly being reported for a wide variety of species, often measured as the timing of activity onset in the morning. However, so far, the adaptive significance of consistent variation in temporal phenotypes (i.e. the chronotype) remains largely elusive. Potentially, differences in timing of activities may arise as a result of competition among individuals for resources. Less aggressive individuals may try to avoid competition by becoming active earlier during the day when other individuals are still inactive, leading to a positive correlation between chronotype and aggressive personality type (i.e. a behavioural syndrome). To investigate this, we assessed the chronotype of female great tits, Parus major, by measuring emergence time from the nestbox in the morning and experimentally tested their levels of same-sex aggression through simulated territorial intrusion tests. Contradicting our initial hypothesis, consistently more aggressive females became active earlier during the day compared to less aggressive females, which could be caused by shared underlying mechanisms, like pleiotropic effects of sex hormones or gene pleiotropy, which potentially impose constraints on the independent evolution of both traits. Surprisingly, on the within-individual level we found an opposing correlation between emergence time and aggression. Our findings highlight the need for further investigations into the interplay between chronotype and aggression that take the underlying mechanisms into account in order to understand the adaptive significance of this trait association.

AB In many animals, contest winners are more likely to win subsequent matches while contest losers tend to lose their later fights. Such winner and loser effects can have long-lasting impacts on individual behaviour and fitness. Recent observations suggest that winner and loser effects may occur in humans, and we thus critically tested this proposition in two experiments involving video games and reading comprehension. We randomly assigned human participants to either win or lose in phase 1 by manipulating their task difficulty. Then we tested their performance in phase 2, which was moderately difficult for all participants. In both experiments, randomly assigned phase 1 winners performed significantly better in phase 2 than did randomly assigned phase 1 losers. The effect size was higher in the video game experiment than in the reading comprehension test, perhaps because the former involved an overt contest with one winner and one loser. Finally, men and women exhibited similar magnitudes of winner and loser effects. Our experimental approach as well as further critical experiments with humans can help us better understand winner and loser effects in general as well as their possible important influence on human performance.

AB Research on biological rhythms has revealed widespread variation in diel timing within populations. Repeatable individual chronotypes have been linked to performance in humans but, in free-living species, benefits of chronotype are poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated fitness correlates of incubation patterns in female songbirds (great tit, Parus major) at urban and forest sites. We confirm repeatable chronotypes (r > 0.31) and show novel links between chronotype and reproductive success. In both habitats, females that started activity earlier in the day raised more fledglings. We also observed that forest females started their day at a similar time throughout the breeding season, whereas urban females tied their onset of activity closely to sunrise. Our study points to possible mechanisms that underlie chronotype variation and provides sought-after evidence for its relevance to fitness.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Territorial behaviour is fundamental in the lives of many animal species. In many monogamous birds, mated pairs defend year-round territories in a cooperative fashion; however, most current knowledge is limited to the breeding season. Many species that cooperatively defend territories exhibit complex vocal interactions known as 'duets', in which one member of a pair overlaps its partner's song. The functions of duetting, however, are often unknown or incompletely understood. To develop a thorough under-standing of territorial behaviour in these species we must determine (1) the roles of each pair member in territorial defence, (2) whether responses are biased towards individuals of same or opposite sex and (3) the function of duetting behaviour. In this study, we investigated these aspects using a stereo playback experiment to study the territorial responses of pairs of Carolina wren, Thryothorus ludovicianus, to playback of male solo vocalizations, female solo vocalizations and male-female duets. Our analyses show that males were more aggressive than females, except during playback of female solos. Both sexes exhibited stronger responses to same-sex versus opposite-sex vocalizations. Finally, females were more likely to create duets in response to playback of male and female solos than in response to playback of duets. This pattern in duetting behaviour is consistent with a partnership guarding function and counter the predictions of a joint territorial defence function. We discuss and interpret our results in light of the different costs experienced by males and females during territorial intrusions.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In contrast to sexually size-dimorphic species, monomorphic ones rarely show sexual differences in foraging behaviour as such variations have been primarily attributed to dissimilar body size. To inves-tigate this aspect, we analysed foraging behaviour in breeding gull-billed terns, Gelochelidon nilotica, a monomorphic seabird adapted to rural habitats. We equipped 19 breeding birds with GPS devices and assessed differences in foraging behaviour and habitat use according to sex and breeding stage. Foraging trip distance and duration and daily frequencies were influenced by both breeding stage and sex, with females, but not males, performing closer, more frequent and shorter duration trips during chick rearing than incubation. Females, but not males, increased the repeatability of foraging metrics from incubation to chick rearing, while both sexes increased individual foraging site fidelity between the two breeding stages. Agricultural fields were the most exploited habitat for both sexes, but females made more use of aquatic habitats than males, especially during chick rearing. By foraging in different ways and in different habitats, the breeding pair can provide a wider range of prey types to their offspring, maximizing the chances of delivering high quantity and quality of food items under different environmental conditions. Our work provides new additional evidence of sex differences in foraging behaviour of monomorphic species, while highlighting the need to better understand underlying mechanisms driving foraging niche divergence and the consequences for fitness.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Noncopulatory cannibalism, which occurs when females attack and consume males instead of mating with them, could persist if it increases female fecundity more than it exacerbates reproductive failure. However, females that are facultatively parthenogenetic may be able to cannibalize indiscriminately since securing a mate is not necessary for reproduction when parthenogenesis is possible. We used an experimental approach to examine the economics of cannibalism with and without mating for female Miomantis caffra, a facultatively parthenogenetic mantis that shows high rates of noncopulatory cannibalism. If noncopulatory cannibalism is maintained by fecundity enhancement, we predicted that eating a male would boost female fitness regardless of mating status. If noncopulatory cannibalism persists by facilitating total mating avoidance, then we predicted that mating would be costly, and females would perform better via parthenogenesis than via sex. Contrary to our predictions, we found that mating once led to dramatically higher fitness than not mating, and cannibalizing a single male provided no overall fitness benefit to either mated or unmated females. Our results suggest that precopulatory cannibalism persists in M. caffra for reasons other than fecundity enhancement or total mating avoidance.

AB Predation risk profoundly shapes how animals behave and is one of the main forces driving the formation or maintenance of groups. For some species, group living may be facultative, and individuals may live solitarily or aggregate with conspecifics or heterospecifics, but the advantages of each strategy are still poorly known. Here, we investigated whether a predominantly solitary breeding species, the European roller, Coracias garrulus, acquires antipredator benefits from nesting in mixed-species colonies dominated by lesser kestrels, Falco naumanni. We compared the risk-taking behaviour of solitary rollers and rollers breeding in colonies by conducting two experiments. First, we investigated rollers??? latency to resume incubation when presented with a novel object, and second assessed their latency to resume chick provisioning and their investment in mobbing behaviour towards a predator model. We additionally compared the breeding performance and nest predation rate of rollers in each social context (solitary versus colonial) using data from 300 breeding attempts across 6 years. We found that rollers breeding in colonies returned to their nests sooner during the presentation of both the novel object and the predator model and attacked the predator model less frequently than solitary rollers, suggesting they can use heterospecifics as cues in deciding whether it is safe to return to their nests. In addition, rollers in colonies suffered less nest predation than solitary ones, but this did not translate into a higher productivity. Future studies should investigate whether breeding in colonies provides other advantages to rollers, such as increased adult survival or fitness. ?? 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Collective close calling mediates group cohesion in foraging meerkats

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID SURICATA-SURICATTA; BEHAVIOR
AB During group movements, many socially living and group-foraging animals produce contact calls. Contact calls typically function to coordinate and maintain cohesion among group members by providing receivers with information on the callers' location or movement-related motivation. Previous work suggests that meerkats, Suricata suricatta, also produce short-range contact calls, so-called ???close calls???, while foraging to maintain group cohesion. Yet, the underlying mechanism of how meerkats coordinate cohesion via close calling is unclear. Using a combination of field observations and playback experiments we here show that foraging meerkats adjusted the call rates of their continuously produced close calls depending on their spatial position to group members. Specifically, meerkats called at higher rates when foraging at a closer distance to and when surrounded by conspecifics; however, the number of calling individuals or their call rates did not affect a subject's close call rate. Overall, close call playbacks elicited a call response in receivers and attracted them to the sound source. Our results suggest that differences in individual close call rates are determined by a meerkat's proximity to other group members, being assessed through their vocal interactions. We discuss how local differences in individual call rates may extrapolate to the group level, where emerging ???vocal hotspots??? indicate areas of high individual density, in turn attracting and potentially guiding group members' movements. Hence, the described pattern illustrates a so far undocumented call mechanism where local differences in the call rates of continuously produced close calls can generate a group level pattern that mediates the cohesion of progressively moving animal groups. ?? 2021 The Authors.

AB Animals living near urban habitats face many pressures linked with human disturbance. While individuals vary in their ability to cope with disturbance, it is predicted that individuals in highly disturbed environments will be bolder and more aggressive than those in less disturbed environments. Using little penguins, Eudyptula minor, we investigated whether individual aggressiveness was consistent across trials and whether aggressiveness was greater in colonies that experience higher levels of unregulated human disturbance. We scored aggressiveness at the nest, based on the penguins' response to a standardized nest intrusion experiment, across four penguin colonies in South Australia. Nest defence scores were significantly repeatable over two trials, suggesting that it was a good indicator of personality in little penguins. Island was a significant predictor of nest defence score, with little penguins on Granite Island (the island with the greatest amount of unregulated human disturbance) being more aggressive than those on Troubridge Island (the island with the lowest amount of human disturbance). Considering that humans increasingly interact with animals, whether directly or indirectly, understanding the mechanisms behind nonrandom distribution of behaviours may have important implications for population management and conservation.

AB In mammals and birds, interindividual variability in inhibitory control is often explained by developmental changes and personality. Teleost fish exhibit one of the highest levels of intraspecific variability in inhibitory control described in vertebrates, but the underlying causes have not been fully described. We investigated the effects of development and personality on inhibitory control of a teleost fish, the guppy. In experiment 1, we compared the performance of 10-, 20-, 40-and 90-day-old guppies in the cylinder task, which requires subjects to inhibit the tendency to swim towards a food reward. We found that guppies of all ages tested were capable of executing the motor inhibition required by the task. However, there was a U-shaped effect of age on performance: 10-and 90-day-old guppies had lower inhibitory control compared to 20-and 40-day-old guppies. In experiment 2, we correlated guppies' inhibitory control performance with three tests aimed to assess different personality trials: boldness (scototaxis test), exploration (open-field test) and sociability (mirror test). We found a significant covariation only for the open-field test, which might indicate that more explorative guppies exhibited greater inhibitory control. Overall, this study suggests that ontogeny and personality may have a role in determining interindividual differences in a teleost fish similar to that described in mammals and birds.

AB Vocal communication is often used to signal willingness to escalate into a physical fight during territorial conflicts. In songbirds, starting to sing when an opponent already sings (song overlapping) has been suggested to signal aggressive intent (willingness to escalate). We used a multiyear data set to test whether song overlapping predicts aggressiveness in great tits, Parus major. Territorial males were subjected twice to a simulated territorial intrusion when their mate was in the egg-laying phase, and twice when she was incubating. Males were presented with a taxidermic mount and a noninteractive playback of a conspecific song near their nestbox. The experiment was conducted over 3 consecutive years, resulting in repeated measures for males that bred across multiple years. The estimated minimum approach distance to the intruder, a repeatable and heritable trait that predicts the likelihood of physical attack, was used as a measure of aggression. We determined the duration of song overlapping by the focal male relative to values expected by chance. Against expectations, we found that birds that over -lapped were less (rather than more) aggressive. In addition, variance partitioning demonstrated that this link resulted from a within-individual effect: when birds became less aggressive from one observation to the next, they also overlapped more. There was no among-individual effect: individuals that were on average more aggressive did not, on average, overlap either more or less than others. Our results thus imply that song overlapping is linked to aggression but opposite to expectations, and not among in-dividuals. Furthermore, the majority of birds overlapped at or below chance levels. Overall, song over-lapping may not signal aggressive intent but rather 'nonengagement', or result from interference avoidance, allowing aggressive residents to better hear an intruder's acoustic output during territorial intrusions.

ID DECISION-MAKING; RATIONAL CHOICE; PAPAYA FRUIT; VIOLATIONS; MEMORY;
   SELECTION
AB In models of choice, animals are expected to evaluate options in absolute terms and assign some fitness related value to different options. These expectations are similar to those of economic rationality, and both predict consistent decisions across variable contexts. Evidence from humans and other animals suggests that decision-making mechanisms can lead to context-dependent choices, which are considered economically irrational. While there is widespread evidence that these mechanisms may influence animal decision making, we can now explore how the presence and degree of these biases may arise in different animals based on their taxonomy and ecology. Here, we investigated context-dependent decisions in wild Jamaican fruit bats, Artibeus jamaicensis. We found that bats were sensitive to the context of the choice, showing shifts in preference upon the addition of an irrelevant decoy option. These results contrast previous findings in a close relative, the frog-eating bat, Trachops cirrhosus, indicating that diet may play a critical role in these behaviours. We argue that comparative studies exploring the role of diet on these decision-making biases are critical for understanding how animals make foraging decisions in the wild.

AB Studying and quantifying behaviour is important to understand how animals interact with their environments. However, manually extracting and analysing behavioural data from the large volume of camera footage collected is often time consuming. Deep learning techniques have emerged as useful tools in automating the analysis of certain behaviours under controlled or laboratory conditions, but the complexities of using raw footage from the field has resulted in this technology remaining largely unexplored as a possible data analysis alternative for animals in situ. Here, we use deep learning techniques to automate the analysis of fish grazing behaviour from real-world field imagery. We collected video footage in sea grass meadows in Queensland, Australia, and trained models on a training data set of over 3000 annotations. We used a combination of dense optical flow to assess pixel movement in underwater footage, spatiotemporal filtering to increase accuracy, and deep learning algorithms to classify grazing behaviour of luderick, Girella tricuspidata. When tested on novel videos the model had not seen in training, the model correctly identified nearly all individual grazing events. Deep learning shows promise as a viable tool for determining animal behaviour from underwater videos, and with further development offers an alternative to current time-consuming manual methods of data extraction.

AB Synchronous digging activity and emergence from underground nests is important for sea turtle hatchlings, as it reduces predation risk and decreases energy consumption. However, patterns of underground hatching and diel digging activity prior to emergence are invisible and remain largely unknown. In this study, we acoustically monitored the activity of green turtle, Chelonia mydas, hatchlings from hatching to emergence in the field and laboratory. During the hatching period, we did not observe characteristic acoustic events corresponding to pipping and hatching. Hatchlings started digging even though there were still unhatched eggs above them, indicating that green turtles did not hatch as one synchronous group. This observation did not support our hypothesis that synchronized hatching facilitates synchronous emergence. Digging activity tended to increase at night as the hatchlings approached the sand surface and nest emergence became imminent. It is not surprising that there was diel variation in digging activity as the hatchlings approached the surface because diel fluctuations in sand temperature can provide a diel cue. Surprisingly, a diel change in digging activity was also observed when hatchlings were still at a sand depth where temperature remained relatively constant throughout the day (that is, a few days before emergence) and in the laboratory at a constant temperature. This study suggests that the diel activity pattern of hatchling green turtles may occur even in the absence of a diel temperature fluctuation cue.

AB Humans are outstanding in their ability to achieve mutual cooperation for direct benefits. One often quoted factor driving our unique cooperation skills is our ability to delay gratification for future benefits, which is supposedly linked to our advanced cognitive abilities relative to other species. The established experimental paradigm used to test delayed gratification in primates and birds is to give subjects access to a small food reward, which can be exchanged for a larger (quantitative task) or better quality (qualitative task) food reward after a time delay. Here we used this paradigm to test primarily the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus for its ability to delay gratification. The specific ecology of cleaners makes them ideal candidates for this task: cleaners remove ectoparasites from visiting 'client' reef fish although they prefer to eat client mucus. This eating against preference is equivalent to delayed gratification as clients that have their ectoparasites removed (as opposed to their mucus) will both stay longer with a specific cleaner and return to it for later inspection. Cleaners performed very well in the quantitative task, i.e. similarly to monkeys. In contrast, they performed poorly if the delayed reward was of higher quality. Using the quantitative task to test other wrasse species, we found that another cleaner species and noncleaner wrasse also performed well, the latter despite no evidence that they need such ability to cooperate in nature. However, only the two cleaner species showed evidence for making decisions early on about whether to wait or to directly eat the immediate reward. We conclude that the ability to delay gratification does not warrant advanced cognitive abilities that require endotherm-specific brain morphology, although the underlying mechanisms vary between species.

AB Individuals with high social rank within a dominance hierarchy often have priority access to resources relative to subordinate individuals, but these rank-dependent fitness effects may depend on the stability of the social hierarchy. Here we studied temporal changes in network structure and social relationships in experimentally perturbed social hierarchies of the cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni. By removing a dominant male in replicate groups, we triggered more status changes compared to control, subordinate male removal groups. At the individual level, we found that dominant male removal resulted in dominant males significantly increasing the rate of chases ('chase strength'), but there was no significant increase in the rate of display ('display strength'). Dominant male removal also led to several changes at the group level: network reciprocity and network stability decreased in response to dominant male removal, while network density was not affected by our treatment. However, in contrast to the individual level network measures, these group level effects were present in display networks but not in chase networks. Display networks mostly connect dominant males within the network, making display networks more sensitive to changes in the hierarchy. Together, our results provide novel insights into complex social dynamics in experimentally altered social dominance networks.

AB Episodic memory of scatter-hoarding animals involves encoding and storage of memories of cached food items, in conjunction with subsequent retrieval or recovery. Although the reward values mediate the interaction of item memory and source memory, whether nonhuman animals divide their spatial memory resources between cached items of different values has never been tested. Here, we used a unique scatter-hoarder/seed system to test our ?cache value hypothesis?, which proposes that scatterhoarding animals will preferentially allocate spatial memory resources towards higher-valued caches. By making Edwards's long-tailed rats, Leopoldamys edwardsi, anosmic, using Triton X-10 0, we showed that L. edwardsi recovered more caches containing large nuts than those containing small ones, although the two kinds of nuts were equivalently cached. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that scatterhoarding animals allocate more spatial memory resources to caches containing high-valued items. This is one of the few studies to investigate how item memory regulates source memory (order information) in the context of food storing and recovery by animals, especially by scatter-hoarding rodents. That highvalued items were remembered better than low-valued ones in our study suggests that item memory appears to be contextually associated with order information of items in animal memory processes, which is not in agreement with a previous suggestion that order information is independent of content or item information.

AB Coevolutionary arms races between brood parasites and hosts can evolve along several distinct trajectories. To understand why, host-parasite interactions must be examined at every stage of the breeding cycle. While there have been numerous studies of interactions at the egg and nestling stages, studies of preparasitism ?frontline? interactions have received less attention. Frontline defences in hosts should be widespread, both because they can preserve the entire host clutch (while postparasitism defences, such as egg or chick rejection, do not) and because they tend to overlap with defences against nest predation. We investigated whether parasitism by the little bronze-cuckoo, Chalcites minutillus, has selected for frontline defences in large-billed gerygones, Gerygone magnirostris, a host that rejects cuckoo chicks. We considered three possible defences: (1) mobbing of adult cuckoos near the nest, (2) ?decoy nest clustering? of active nests alongside old nests and flood debris, and (3) cryptic nest architecture. Gerygones were more likely to mob a mount of a cuckoo near the nest than that of a hawk or harmless sympatric passerine. The role of nest traits in repelling parasitism was equivocal; gerygones built their nests alongside previously used nests more often than expected by chance. The experimental addition of decoy nests did not reduce parasitism rates but did lead to a significant delay in latency to predation. Although large-billed gerygones build large nests compared to other gerygones species, we found that larger nests were more likely to be parasitized than smaller nests. We conclude that parasitism has selected for a portfolio of defences in large-billed gerygones, comprising both low-cost, but mostly ineffective, frontline defences (mobbing, some nest traits), and a high-cost, but highly effective, chick stage defence (chick rejection). Thus, the relatively low effectiveness of frontline and egg stage defences may explain why some hosts evolve the rare defence of chick rejection. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Startle response behaviours are important in predator avoidance and escape for a wide array of animals. For many marine invertebrates, however, startle response behaviours are understudied, and the effects of global change stressors on these responses are unknown. We exposed two size classes of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis x trossulus) to different combinations of temperature (15 and 19 degrees C) and pH (8.2 and 7.5 pH(T)) for 3 months and subsequently measured individual time to open following a tactile predator cue (i.e. startle response time) over a series of four consecutive trials. Time to open was highly repeatable in the short term and decreased linearly across the four trials. Individuals from the larger size class had a shorter time to open than their smaller-sized counterparts. High temperature increased time to open compared to low temperature, while pH had no effect. These results suggest that bivalve time to open is repeatable, related to relative vulnerability to predation and affected by temperature. Given that increased closure times impact feeding and respiration, the effect of temperature on closure duration may play a role in the sensitivity to ocean warming in this species and contribute to ecosystem level effects.

AB Making fast and accurate group decisions under uncertain and risky conditions is a fundamental problem for groups. Currently, there is little empirical evidence of how natural selection (such as environmental predation risk) has shaped the mechanisms of group decision making. We repeatedly tested individually marked guppies, Poecilia reticulata, from the upper and lower reaches of the Aripo and Turure rivers in a Y-maze and found that populations that had evolved under different predation regimes differed in their decision-making speed. All groups decreased decision time over successive trial rounds, but fish from low-predation environments did so at a greater rate than fish from high-predation environments. This effect was only significant when fish were tested in groups of eight, not when tested individually. Decision-making accuracy was not significantly different between high- and low-predation populations. Group behaviour differed according to predation risk and trial round, most notably with low-predation groups reducing the amount of positional switching over successive trial rounds at a greater rate than high-predation groups. While fish from both predator risk environments had repeatable within-shoal positioning behaviour as they swam down the maze, only fish from the high-predation groups had repeatable finishing positions. Meaningful measures of information transfer (mean pairwise transfer entropy) were only recorded in low-predation groups, and here there was a significant effect of source river on information flow within groups. Aripo groups increased information flow over successive trial rounds, while Turure groups did not. Variation in mean pairwise transfer entropy increased over successive trial rounds for both low-predation populations, suggesting that information used to make movement decisions became less homogeneously distributed and increasingly directed through a subset of individuals. Predation pressure is a ubiquitous selection force, and these findings may apply to a variety of natural social groups. (C) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Acoustic signalling is vital to courtship in many animals, yet the role of female vocalizations is understudied. Here, we combine observational and experimental methods to assess the courtship function of the female chatter call in brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. While the chatter call is likely multifunctional, it is frequently used in social interactions and overlapping duets with males during the breeding season. Based on a combination of focaland scan-sampling data from large naturalistic aviaries, we did not find support for the hypothesis that the chatter call elicits male attention or encourages continued courtship. However, we did find evidence that the chatter call plays a role in pair bond formation, as females preferentially chattered in response to songs from pair-bond males in the 2 weeks leading up to the median date of first copulation. Females were less selective in male-directed chatter use after copulations began. We also found support for the hypothesis that chatter is used to signal-jam male songs. Frame-by-frame video analysis revealed that the majority of female chatter calls were tightly time-locked to song, occurring less than 500 ms after male vocal onset. To test the effect of signal jamming on male song potency, we designed a laboratory experiment in which male song playbacks were jammed by various recorded stimuli. Natural chatter calls more effectively reduced female copulatory responses to song than high-pass filtered chatter calls, suggesting that the low frequencies in natural chatter (2-4 kHz) are important for interfering with male song and reducing its potency. Our results suggest that sexual conflict is operating in cowbird courtship, with signal jamming serving as a mechanism by which females guard, resist or select their mates. We also discuss ways in which cowbird vocal interactions may function cooperatively to coordinate reproduction or transition females into breeding condition.

AB Bird nests often consist of stronger materials to maintain nest structure and a softer layer of lining materials to reduce heat loss. We studied whether early learning affected the use of nest materials by cross-fostering between two tit species with similar breeding ecology, the blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, and the great tit, Parus major, in a woodland area provided with nestboxes in Norway. In both species, only the female builds the nest. From previous studies, we know that early social learning affects a number of traits in these birds, including song repertoire, mate choice, foraging behaviour and nest site choice. Nests of the two species are similar but blue tits use more feathers than great tits. This was confirmed in the present study; however, female blue tits raised by great tit foster parents also supplied their nest with feathers, and female great tits raised by blue tits used few feathers. The only treatment effect was that fewer feathers were found in nests of cross-fostered females in both species than in nests of controls. This may have been caused by time and energetic constraints during nest building because cross-fostered birds seemed to forage less efficiently than controls. The amount of hair was slightly greater in blue tits than in great tits, but it was not affected by the cross-fostering either. We conclude that no cultural transmission was found in the use of lining materials in the nest of the two species, perhaps because young birds hatch after their parents have stopped constructing the nest.

AB Many group-living animals use precisely coordinated vocalizations to signal group quality and cohesion. However, the timing of these signals depends not only on the precision of signallers, which has been studied in detail, but also on the geometric location of both signallers and receivers. This is because the timing of notes within signals is affected by the speed of sound and relative location of senders and receivers, yet these spatial effects have not been examined experimentally. We studied how spatial separation of signallers affects production of and response to vocal duets in Australian magpie-larks, Grallina cyanoleuca. We specifically tested whether the visual displays that accompany duets reduce spatial effects on the production of natural duets and enhance the listener's perception of note coordination within experimental, multimodal playbacks of duets. Visual displays are not subject to time lags on a biological scale, because of the speed of light, and so might be used to compensate for the slow speed of sound during both production and reception of signals. Observations of natural duets suggest that the visual component of these multimodal displays reduces the effect of partner separation on duet tempo, which would otherwise decline linearly with separation, and enhances the regularity of duets. Acoustic playbacks with robotic models showed in turn that visual displays reduced the effect of spatial separation of partners on the response to their duets. Spatial separation of robots led to temporal offset within duets from the perspective of the listener, yet the visual display ameliorated the negative effect of offset on response. In addition, a greater tempo of vocal duets, which is promoted by visual coordination during production, increased response to duets. We conclude that the visual component of duet displays helps compensate for the effects of spatial separation of partners during the production and response to duets.

AB Naked mole-rats are eusocial mammals that live in hierarchies consisting of one breeding female, one to three male consorts and their reproductively suppressed offspring. A 'disperser morph' subcaste has been suggested with a subset of nonbreeders exhibiting motivation to leave their natal colony and mate with unfamiliar conspecifics. To test the hypotheses that intrinsic colony variables (e.g. population density, sex ratio, queen temperament) influence the dispersal phenotype, and that males and females differ in responsiveness to these variables, we evaluated dispersal behaviour in 17 laboratory colonies. Queen aggression was associated with the number of female, but not male, dispersers, although dispersers were not themselves targets of queen aggression. Female dispersers were more aggressive than their nondispersing sisters, although still less aggressive than queens overall. Following outpairing with an unfamiliar opposite-sex animal, dispersers and nondispersers produced litters at similar rates, demonstrating that motivation to leave the colony, and not anticipatory reproductive maturation, is the key to successful dispersal. Collectively, these data suggest that aggressive naked mole-rat queens motivate dispersal in their daughters and that female dispersers show traits consistent with successful queens (e.g. aggression).

AB Animal signallers are subject to audience effects when they alter communication due to changes in the presence or characteristics of receivers. Studies aimed at understanding audience effects have typically examined effects of conspecific audiences on signaller communication. Less work has focused on heterospecific audiences, which present an important avenue of research for species that participate in mixed-species groups. Here we experimentally tested mixed-species flocks of Carolina chickadees, Poecile carolinensis, and tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor, for conspecific and heterospecific audience effects. Birds were trapped from naturally occurring flocks and held in seminatural outdoor aviaries, where we recorded calling. We found that chickadees and titmice were sensitive to the number of conspecifics in flocks when communicating via 'chick-a-dee' calls, which are social cohesion calls produced by both species. Chickadees also were sensitive to the number of titmice in flocks, but chick-a-dee calling behaviour in titmice did not differ with regard to the number of chickadees in flocks. Furthermore, when subject to playbacks of simulated risk, chickadees and titmice produced more chick-a-dee calls when more titmice were in a flock. After these playbacks, chickadees produced fewer chick-a-dee calls with increasing numbers of conspecifics in flocks, whereas titmice produced more chick-a-dee calls with increasing numbers of conspecifics in flocks. These results suggest that chickadees and titmice are sensitive to social factors within their mixed-species flocks when communicating, and that chickadees appear more sensitive to heterospecific presence than do titmice. We suggest this is due to the dominance status of the species in these flocks, where titmice are typically dominant over chickadees. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   nuts
AB The sense of olfaction has been traditionally considered of low relevance in bird biology. In particular, the location of cached seeds by scatter-hoarder corvids is assumed to depend on spatial memory, whereas no study has demonstrated the use of olfaction to detect these seeds. In this study we tested whether olfaction might play a role in the precise location of cached nuts by magpies, Pica pica, a scatter-hoarder corvid species. We conducted an experiment under natural conditions where nuts belonging to four treatments were buried, simulating natural caches, and we monitored the rate of nut detection by magpies. Three of the treatments included nuts with natural odour or odour of a strong-smelling substance (untreated nuts, nutshells filled with soil and nuts soaked in diesel), whereas the fourth treatment consisted of 3D-printed fake nuts made of polypropylene. The experiment was replicated in two sites and in several breeding territories, using a total of 624 nuts. Motion-activated cameras were installed to identify the animals foraging in the plots. The results show that magpies detected untreated nuts, nutshells or nuts soaked in diesel ca. three times more than 3D-printed fake nuts. Among detected and unburied nuts, the 3D-printed nuts were largely abandoned on site, followed by nutshells without a kernel, natural nuts and nuts soaked in diesel. All this strongly supports the hypothesis that magpies use olfaction to pinpoint cached nuts, either for nut recovery or pilfering, but once a nut is detected they may use other senses such as vision or touch for selection. Given the strong changes in landscape features that may occur under natural conditions between the time of nut caching and nut retrieval, we suggest that the use of olfaction might be crucial to help spatial memory in determining the location of cached nuts in corvids.

AB Dispersal is a fundamental ecological process that, on an individual level, is associated with intrinsic and fixed personality traits such as 'boldness'. However, it is unknown whether personality traits or behavioural syndromes might change as a consequence of dispersal itself. We analysed 14 GPS-collared grey wolves, Canis lupus, in Finland that dispersed from their natal territories and settled in new territories, as well as 22 time-matched nondispersing controls. We used wolf avoidance of low-use forest roads, high-use primary roads and houses as proxies for boldness, and we estimated wolf responses to these features across spatial scales and across dispersal phases. Wolves, which already occupy portions of Finland with low human density, expanded into more human-impacted areas, but with a strong large-scale selection for relatively low human presence. At the finer scale, avoidance of human elements varied as a function of dispersal phase. During dispersal, avoidance of forest roads, primary roads and houses was substantially lower than in natal territories, reflecting the need to take more risks while moving in a small group (alone or with a single mate) in unfamiliar environments. After settling in new territories, the strength of avoidance of those elements continued to be lower than in natal territories, even after controlling for changes in availability. These results suggest that experiences gained across a major life-history transition, such as dispersal, might themselves influence personality traits.

AB Sex differences in anxiety-related behaviours have been documented in many animals and are notable in human populations. A major goal in behaviour research is to understand why and how sex differences in cognitive-emotional states like anxiety arise and are regulated throughout life. Anxiety allows individuals to detect and respond to threats. Mating is a candidate regulator for anxiety because threats are likely to change, often in sex-specific ways, when individuals shift to a postmating reproductive state. However, we know little about how mating mediates anxiety-related behaviour in males and females, or about how males might influence female anxiety via seminal proteins transferred during mating. To address this gap, we examined anxiety-related behaviour in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an emerging model animal for anxiety, with respect to sex, mating and sex peptide, a seminal protein known to modulate a host of female postmating responses in fruit flies. We assayed anxiety-like behaviour using the open-field assay to assess individual avoidance of the interior of an arena ('wall-following' behaviour). We found sex differences in activity level, but no evidence for sex differences in wall-following behaviour. We found no effects of mating in either sex, or of the presence of the sex peptide receptor in females, on wall following. Our results suggest that anxiety is not one of the cognitive-emotional states regulated by mating and sex peptide in fruit flies, and that researchers need an alternative model for sex differences in anxiety.

AB Anosmic birds' homing ability is impaired when challenged to navigate over unfamiliar areas. Nevertheless, anosmic pigeons, Columba livia, show unimpaired navigation when released within a familiar area, suggesting that they may rely on familiar visual landmarks for navigation. However, direct evidence for the reliance on familiar visual landmarks during homing in anosmic birds has never been provided. In this study we tracked pigeons subjected singly to one training flight from each of three locations. Prior to their second release from each site, half of the birds were made anosmic while the others were not manipulated. The level of route fidelity was analysed separately for three phases of the homing process, in which familiar visual cues may have different relevance and may be used within different cognitive strategies: (1) 'Initial decision making'; (2) 'En route navigation'; (3) 'Local navigation around home'. Compared to control birds, the anosmic birds flew significantly closer to previously overflown locations in the 'En route navigation' phase, while no difference in route fidelity emerged during phases (1) and (3). Our results showed that a single experience is sufficient for pigeons to learn release site features, and that familiar visual landmarks constitute a critical source of navigational information in olfactorily deprived birds during the homing process.

ID MALE MATING SUCCESS; PLASTICITY; VARIABILITY; PHENOTYPES
AB Courtship displays have been traditionally considered stereotyped behaviours. Many elaborate courtships are displayed in specific locations or in courts prepared by the displaying individuals. Sudden environmental events may alter the spatial structure of the displaying site, and individuals should be able to cope with such disruptions. In some mating systems, courtship is the only or main trait used in mate choice. This is the case in lek mating systems where male mating success is highly skewed and intense sexual selection may drive the evolution of elaborate courtship. The golden-collared manakin is a lekking species of the Neotropical forests. Males have an elaborate courtship display that includes a series of acrobatic jumps within a court delimited by small saplings. The courtship ends with a jump on one of the saplings, called the mating sapling, which invites the female to copulate. The display of each male follows a consistent routine that males establish at the beginning of the reproductive season. We hypothesized that males possess behavioural flexibility to adapt their courtship behaviour to unpredictable environmental changes. We investigated the effects of a sudden disruption of the court configuration by placing a piece of bark on the mating sapling. Males gradually established a new display sequence with an alternative mating sapling, demonstrating a high level of behavioural flexibility that suggests the involvement of motor learning. When the bark was removed, some males reverted to the original sequence, showing retention of the original display sequence. Our study provides evidence for the involvement of motor learning in the establishment and adjustment of elaborate courtship displays. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Social interactions among individuals play a central role in behavioural ecology and studying cohesion of monogamous pairs is important to understand their social relationships. Here, we tested five hypotheses to investigate patterns of pair cohesion in an obligate monogamous mammal, the Eurasian beaver, Castor fiber. We hypothesized that pair cohesion is related to the spatial structure of the territory, territory defence, resource competition, offspring provisioning and the age difference between pair members. We analysed GPS data of 14 beaver pairs and calculated the distance between pair members, and the proportion of territory and core area overlap. While overall territory size was similar between partners and overlap was high, the distance between pair members was large, averaging 500 m, and increased with increasing territory size. Moreover, the proportion of core area overlap was comparatively low and decreased with territory size, also indicating low pair cohesion. Pair members were closest at the beginning and end of their nightly activity periods, suggesting that variation in pair cohesion was caused by the spatial structure of territories with the lodge serving as a central place. We found no support for the other hypotheses, but the overall low pair cohesion might nevertheless serve to increase territory defensibility and reduce intrapair competition for resources. Ultimately, low pair cohesion might be caused by the obligate monogamous mating system of beavers, leading to the defence of spatially structured territories rather than the defence of a partner.

AB Parasitoids need to find their plant-feeding hosts in complex environments that contain multiple other plant and insect species. They usually rely on herbivore-induced plant volatiles to locate herbivoreinfested plants from a distance and their foraging efficiency may be reduced when volatile information is not available. Downwind foraging during times when high wind speeds prevent odour-guided upwind flights may create foraging situations with limited accessibiliy to volatile information. We hypothesized that parasitoids forage less efficiently by landing on nonhost-damaged or undamaged plants when they are forced to fly downwind and tested this in a wind tunnel experiment. We released the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) either upwind or downwind of a plant stand and observed their foraging behaviour. During downwind foraging, parasitoids were less successful in host finding and needed more time until they managed to oviposit in a host caterpillar compared to the upwind foraging situation. The observed increase in foraging time was caused by prolonged foraging on nonhost-infested and undamaged plants in the downwind situation, indicating that parasitoids leave an unprofitable patch that does not contain host caterpillars earlier, when they perceive volatiles from other herbivore-infested plants located upwind. Volatile information on the availability of herbivore-infested plants within a plant stand seems to be crucial for efficient foraging in plant stands that contain a mixture of host-infested, nonhost-infested and undamaged plants. Parasitoid foraging efficiency may thus be strongly reduced when high wind speed prevents odour-guided upwind flight. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Personality traits (i.e. consistent individual differences in behaviour) often covary, forming behavioural syndromes. Such associations, if driven by an underlying proximate mechanism, could limit the independent evolution of each behaviour. In contrast, a behavioural syndrome may be the result of selection favouring the behavioural correlation under certain ecological circumstances. In this context, investigating the stability and the potential drivers of behavioural syndromes is a fundamental step towards understanding how they might shape the evolution of behaviours. We assessed syndrome stability across time in two subpopulations of free-ranging juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris. We measured two behaviours, exploration in an open field and sociability in a group, over 5 years. We tested whether these behaviours were associated in a behavioural syndrome, how stable this syndrome was and whether its strength was predicted by ecological conditions in this system: predator abundance, juvenile survival, newborn recruitment and total subpopulation size. We found that a behavioural syndrome was only observed in the subpopulation where predatory shark abundance was higher. Across years, newborn recruitment was the main driver for the strength of the syndrome. During years of low recruitment, the subpopulations probably experienced lower competition due to fewer newborns joining the population. In these years, sharks that were more explorative were also less social. These results indicate that the behaviours we tested were plastic and responsive to ecological conditions. Since this could signify that they are only favoured under certain ecological conditions, we argue in this case that the correlation of two behavioural traits is adaptive.

AB Traditionally it has been suggested that sexual selection can cause sexual size dimorphism (SSD). However, a recent review in gastropods shows that SSD itself can also cause sexual selection (Ng et al., 2019. Animal Behaviour, 148, 53-62). This may be the case if mate choice exists, with males preferring to mate with females similar in body size but somewhat larger than themselves (female-biased preference). We formally investigated this verbal explanation by computer simulations using a Gaussian mating preference function. Parameters of that function were also estimated from empirical data. Our results suggest that sexual selection (estimated as selection differential) is strong when mate choice is high and exerted by only one of the sexes, being influenced by SSD and the magnitude of the female-biased preference. All these factors cause a negative relationship between SSD and the (sexual) selection differential, similar to that observed in Ng et al.'s review on gastropods. Empirical estimates of male mate choice from wild-captured mating pairs of different gastropod species confirm that mate choice by males is biased towards females slightly larger than themselves. Our results also illustrate that if mate choice is truly involved in determining SSD, present-day sexual selection cannot be used to estimate the past magnitude of mate choice, as SSD influences present-day patterns of sexual selection.

AB In insects, cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles are complex phenotypic traits with several functions: they provide protection against pathogens and water loss and convey information about insect identity. They are particularly important in ants as they are the basis for colony-specific signatures, which allow nestmate recognition and thus help colonies protect their resources from competitors. Several studies have shown that levels of n-alkanes are strongly influenced by the environment and that, alongside methyl-branched alkanes, n-alkanes are involved in various signalling tasks. Here, we analysed the CHCs of the ant Aphaenogaster iberica along an elevational gradient running from sea level to 2000 m. Across this gradient, we found a considerable difference in mean daily temperature of more than 10 degrees C between the populations on either end of the gradient as well as a marked degree of genetic structuring among populations. Moreover, genetic distance between populations increased with elevational distance but was independent of horizontal distance. Low-elevation populations had larger amounts of heavier compounds, including nonacosane (C29), and smaller amounts of lighter compounds, including hexacosane (C26) and heptacosane (C27). The level of aggression among non-nestmates increased with elevational distance, horizontal distance and CHC dissimilarity. However, mean within-population aggression (i.e. among colonies of the same population) did not differ across elevation. We also found that aggression was related to CHC levels: the correlation between the level of aggression and CHC dissimilarity remained significant even after we accounted for the correlation between genetic distance and aggression. We propose that climatic differences at different elevations may constrain CHC diversity and, consequently, the process of nestmate recognition.

AB In many species, males produce sounds to attract a female. In a chorus, males actively adjust their acoustic production depending on the presence and number of mating rivals. Plasticity in signal features might then be advantageous as males could tune their signalling activity to the contest intensity. However, the ability to exhibit plastic behaviour might be constrained and interindividual variation in plasticity can occur. In this field study, we examined the influence of body mass and social environment on the signal expression of male bushcrickets, Poecilimon veluchianus veluchianus. We tested whether differences in signal features of rivals of different body mass and number led to changes in the competition pressure perceived by focal males and, consequently, in their acoustic responses. We used the first principal component from a principal component analysis, reflecting verse duration, duty cycle and syllable number, as a measure of acoustic output. We found that the rivals' acoustic output depended only on their number, being higher for two rivals than one. However, the response of heavy focal males depended on the rivals' body mass. Contrary to what we expected, heavy males produced shorter verses with fewer syllables when competing against two heavy rivals than when competing against one or two light rivals or one heavy rival. Facing light competitors, heavy focal males responded more to two rivals than to one. In contrast, light focal males did not vary their signal features depending on competition conditions. These results indicate that body mass and social context drive interindividual variation in the capacity of P. v. veluchianus males to adjust their signal features to competition levels. We compare these findings with those previously obtained on congeneric species and discuss the outcomes' similarities and discrepancies. Lastly, we provide suggestions for future studies of socially induced plasticity in sexually selected acoustic signal features. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social learning about predation threat during early ontogeny can be beneficial in developing appropriate antipredator behaviours. While such learning can be achieved through direct interactions between offspring and parents, it is unknown whether young animals can also learn appropriate responses towards different heterospecifics posing different levels of threat through inadvertent information obtained from witnessing parental interactions with these heterospecifics. In this study, we split sibling groups of the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher and raised them with or without parents. Both rearing groups repeatedly received visual and olfactory cues from four types of fish (predators, egg predators, herbivores and conspecifics) during a 4-week experience phase. After a 'neutral phase' of 4 months under identical conditions and without further fish stimuli, individuals from both rearing conditions were tested for their response towards the same four stimulus species. Unlike those reared with parents, the fish reared without parents spent significantly more time in safety and were more vigilant towards the predator, whereas responses to the other three species did not differ. As during the experience phase parental responses towards the stimulus fish were unexpectedly low and indiscriminate, our results suggest that young N. pulcher reverse their innate fear of predators when observing parents being unresponsive to a threat ('observational conditioning'). We suggest that learned reduction of fear can be a potent mechanism to prevent responding to false alarms and mitigate potentially harmful effects of chronically elevated predation stress.

AB Maternal reproductive effort can be adjusted through the transfer of hormones into the eggs, where they influence embryo development, mediating short- and long-term maternal effects on offspring phenotype. While studies usually explore how females can increase their reproductive success through an allocation of yolk testosterone (T) under external environmental variability, it is less clear whether intrinsically driven interfemale differences in yolk T deposition may themselves predict female reproductive decisions. In our study, we used Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, lines divergently selected for high (HET) and low (LET) egg T concentrations to examine whether this genetic variation in yolk T levels is linked to female mating decisions. First, we analysed line differences in male-typical reproductive behaviour and how this behavioural response is affected by female line identity. Males were tested with females from the same (match pairs) and opposite (cross pairs) lines. Next, female mate preferences were evaluated in a two-choice test in which females were allowed to choose between males from the same and opposite lines. We found no line differences in male copulatory behaviour. Interestingly, a shorter latency to copulate and a higher number of copulations were recorded in LET males when they were mated with HET than LET females. No differences between match and cross pairs were found in HET males. In the two-choice test, LET females displayed a preference for males from the same over the opposite line, but HET females did not discriminate between LET and HET males. Collectively, these results demonstrate that genetically high yolk T deposition is related to higher receptivity and reduced choosiness in female mate preferences in Japanese quail. Moreover, our results indicate an important link between maternal investment, reproductive physiology and female mating decisions, pointing out evolutionary implications and a role of variation in female mate choice in sexual selection.

AB Division of labour allows group-living species to efficiently complete tasks while minimizing resource expenditure. This generally involves task allocation between individuals. In territorial defence and parental care specifically, division of labour can be completed using different strategies, often involving one or more individuals defending the territory while others care for offspring. Little is known, however, about division of labour by monogamous and biparental mammals. We investigated labour division strategies across territorial defence and pup retrievals by monogamous, biparental, territorial California mice along with the role of vocal communication in coordinating these behaviours. Male and female pair-bonded California mice display aggression towards same-sex intruders and retrieve pups while alone, but how pairs complete these tasks while together remains unknown. We found that California mouse pairs used one of two strategies during territorial defence: (1) joint defence or (2) divided defence. Overall, these strategies were not altered by the intruder sex or the birth of pups. However, postpartum individuals spent more time alone in the nest and pairs spent less time together investigating intruders. Pup retrievals, conversely, followed a sex-specific strategy where mothers retrieved pups in 89% of pairs while males retrieved pups in 11% of pairs. This study shows for the first time that a monogamous and biparental rodent uses different strategies to divide labour during vital tasks of territorial defence and pup retrieval. Moreover, we found that vocal communication via sustained vocalizations were predictive of aggressive behaviour but not retrieval behaviour, indicating that vocalizations may only play a role in coordinating specific behaviours. Importantly, these strategies were task dependent and robust across intruder sex and parental status, providing a framework for better understanding division of labour in mammals.

AB It is well established that animals often differ consistently from one another in their behaviour. Most work has focused on consistent differences in average behaviour, generally referred to as 'animal personality'. However, individuals may also differ consistently from one another in how they change their behaviour over time or across environments, that is, plasticity, as well as in the predictability of their behaviour. How these three sources of behavioural variation are linked is rarely explored. Here we tested 80 wild-caught three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, repeatedly over a 10-week period for their tendency to explore an open arena from the safety of cover, generally termed 'boldness'. Using a mixed-modelling approach, we detected consistent individual differences in boldness, as well as in the extent to which fish changed this behaviour over time, that is, temporal plasticity. Boldness and plasticity were negatively correlated, with shy fish spending increasing amounts of time out of cover while bold fish changed little over time. After accounting for variation in personality and plasticity, we still detected individual differences in intraindividual behavioural variation ('IIV'), that is, individual predictability. This residual variation was linked to fish' boldness score, with shy fish having higher IIV and thus being less predictable in their behaviour than bold fish. After a 4-week break from testing, individuals on average decreased their time out of cover again to baseline levels. However, shyer, more plastic fish showed the largest changes in behaviour. Statistical simulations show that our experimental data set has sufficient statistical power to provide accurate and precise variance parameter estimates. Together, our results provide strong evidence that individual variation in boldness is linked with behavioural plasticity and predictability. Establishing the evolutionary causes as well as fitness consequences of these links in behavioural variation is an exciting challenge for future research.

AB Animals living in social proximity often have similar vocalizations. For many bird and several mammal species, at least part of the vocal similarity is socially learned during ontogeny. Little is known, however, about the ontogenetic origin of vocal similarities among siblings in polytocous mammals. We investigated the influence of social environment and genetic relatedness on the development of acoustic similarities among suckling piglets. To examine whether the common acoustic features are innate or learned by postnatal vocal convergence in the same litter, we cross-fostered piglets among pairs of mother sows immediately after birth and recorded contact calls (grunts) of both the cross-fostered and the noncross-fostered piglets during the suckling period. Acoustic distances of the cross-fostered piglets to their new littermates remained longer than those among noncross-fostered siblings and were as long as those between piglets from different litters. The results show that after being neonatally cross-fostered to another litter, the piglets did not converge acoustically with their new littermates even after several weeks of cohabitation. This is in contrast to the presence of vocal plasticity during the ontogeny of other mammals including other ungulates, indicating that use of vocal learning may vary even in closely related species, perhaps in relation to its adaptive utility within the life history and social organization of the species.

AB Animals may form groups for different reasons, and one major benefit of grouping in many species is reduced predation risk. In diurnal species, vigilance is used to detect predators, resulting in a trade-off between feeding activity and predation risk. Species can reduce the cost of this trade-off with low-quality vigilance - performing another behaviour while vigilant - in comparison to high-quality vigilance (only being vigilant). Two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses explaining an inverse relationship between individual vigilance and group size are the dilution effect, where predation risk decreases in larger groups, and collective detection, where larger groups have more individuals that may detect a predator. Two predictions that support collective detection but not the dilution effect are that (1) overall group (collective) vigilance will increase with increasing group size, even while individual vigilance decreases, and (2) at least one group member must be vigilant to detect potential danger and communicate that information to group members. To test these predictions, we recorded behavioural data on low- and high-quality vigilance and alarm calling in the gregarious Barbary ground squirrel, Atlantoxerus getulus. Barbary ground squirrels allocated more time to high-quality vigilance than lowquality vigilance. The collective detection hypothesis was partly supported: as group size increased, individual low- and high-quality vigilance did not decrease, but collective high-quality vigilance did increase. Furthermore, we found that repetitive alarm calling warned group members of terrestrial threats. Our results show that this invasive species displays specific antipredator behaviours to different aerial and terrestrial predators compared to predators in their endemic range. The low level of time allocated to low-quality vigilance indicates that natural selection strongly favours high-quality vigilance in this species despite the trade-off with foraging. Our study broadens our understanding of antipredator and risk-sensitive behaviour. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In facultative partial migration, flexibility of wintering behaviour throughout the bird's lifetime (i.e. switching between migrant and resident tactics and vice versa) may be considered an advantage because it allows individuals to cope with environmental conditions. Quantifying the extent of flexibility of wintering behaviour and identifying the related factors (environmental and individual variables) are crucial issues. The present study addressed these issues in a European subpopulation of a shorebird species, the pied avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta, that displays three distinct wintering tactics: strictly resident, locally resident and migrant. We explored tactic fidelity over consecutive years from the bird's first winter by testing the influence of age and estimating more specifically the long-term consistency of the first wintering tactic. We also explored tactic-related survival. Based on a 10-year ringing study carried out on five French colonies and on capture-recapture modelling, we showed that birds were highly faithful to their first wintering tactic over consecutive years and when a change occurred, it was mainly to wintering in the French Atlantic area. We also found a moderate decrease in fidelity to the migrant tactic over consecutive years with age. Complementarily, the fidelity of locally resident and migrant individuals to their first wintering site was remarkably high. Finally, survival over winters was particularly high and did not depend on tactic. At the individual scale, flexibility of wintering tactic was therefore limited over the study period. Despite a slight age effect, other biological information failed to support the 'arrival time and dominance hypotheses', commonly suggested to explain age-differential migration. Additional factors, including the absence of harsh winters, habitat quality and advantages of site familiarity, can be put forward to interpret the main results.

AB Cognitive processes related to the collection, storage and use of information (e.g. learning, memory) contribute to reducing uncertainty about the environment and can thus be key to survival and reproduction. However, information processing is rarely cost-free, and thus cognitive adaptations are expected to be fined-tuned to prevailing ecological and social conditions. Models and laboratory experiments underline the importance of environmental variability in determining the value of information; however, we still know very little on the link between environmental variability and cognitive abilities in wild populations. Here we outline a series of studies in which we assessed information use and learning in conspecifics living along two ecological gradients that impact variability of the food supply: elevation and urbanization. While low- and high-elevation great tits, Parus major, were found to differ in accuracy in a reversal learning task, the difference was in the direction opposite to our prediction, with low-elevation birds outperforming their high-elevation counterparts. Furthermore, we found no relationship between urbanization and spatial memory accuracy in black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, despite urban habitats being known to harbour more stable food supplies during the winter and, thus, potentially providing lower incentive to invest in food hoarding and spatial memory. However, as predicted, chickadees in urban habitats explored a new environment faster and seemed to rely less heavily on social information about novel food patches compared to forest chickadees. Our results point to the need to better link predictive models with experienced fluctuations in food availability for individual foragers and to take into account social as well as ecological variables that can impact the value of information and may covary along natural gradients of harshness.

AB Communication and sleep are important for humans and honey bees alike. Despite this, studies reporting consequences of sleep loss on animal communication - both signalling and receiving - are surprisingly limited. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) can famously signal the destination of a food source with a waggle dance, but when sleep-restricted, dancers perform directionally less precise dances. We analysed dance follower behaviour with respect to a dance's directional precision and whether or not the dancer had been sleep-restricted. Followers were more likely to switch dances if following an imprecise dance and more likely to exit the nest if following a precise dance. Followers were also more likely to exit the nest after following a dance composed of more iterations (waggle phases), but only if the dancer was sleep-restricted. Bees appeared to follow fewer waggle phases of a dance that was less precise, but, again, only if the dancer was sleep-restricted. Following fewer waggle phases has been shown to decrease a bee's flight accuracy, so our results suggest that cues associated with sleep loss could affect a follower's foraging success. This study presents a unique case of sender-receiver effects of sleep loss in an invertebrate, and a possible precision-dependent vulnerability in colonies of honey bees.

AB It is widely accepted that receptivity to mating may be asymmetrical between the sexes. While reproductive benefits for males are cumulative, females may not benefit equally from polyandry, especially in species where females can store sperm. Female psyllids (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) are reportedly polyandrous. However, the adaptive significance of this mating strategy has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies involving other insect species indicate that polyandry may be driven by benefits (direct or indirect) or by the need to minimize costs associated with male harassment. Drooping she-oak psyllids, Aacanthocnema dobsoni (Triozidae), use substrate-borne vibrations for mate attraction but they are not a prerequisite for mating. We suspected that polyandry in this species could be driven by male harassment because males exhibit indiscriminate mating behaviour (consistent with a scramble competition mating strategy), often mating with unresponsive (mated) females. We investigated relationships between calling, feeding and mating status to test whether females mate to minimize harassment by males and whether they gain any direct benefits from polyandry. We found that lone calls were commonly, but reciprocal calls were rarely followed by mating. As reciprocal calls should reflect female receptivity, copulations without them highlight the existence of sexual conflict over mating. Observations revealed that feeding females were less likely to resist mating than nonfeeding females. We did not find that females obtained any direct benefits from polyandry. Our results suggest that polyandry in this species may be a consequence of male harassment and that mated females, while feeding, may remate for convenience to minimize costs associated with stylet retraction/penetration and location of new feeding sites.

AB Melanin-based coloration is associated with aspects of phenotype, including conspecific aggression and hormone concentrations. These relationships could arise as a result of genetic and/or biochemical links between melanin production and other traits. Additionally, anthropogenic change, including urbanization, exposes animals to novel conditions that can alter pigmentation, behaviour or hormones, potentially disrupting relationships between coloration and other traits. We examined relationships among the extent and darkness of melanin spotting on the breast of male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, territorial behaviour, plasma testosterone and corticosterone concentrations to determine whether coloration was reliably associated with phenotype in this species. We conducted this study in urban and rural populations to determine whether relationships between coloration, behaviour and hormones varied between habitats. Males in urban habitat had more extensive brown spotting than rural males. The relationship between melanin coloration and territoriality differed in urban and rural habitats. In rural sparrows, territoriality was negatively correlated with spotting area, while in urban sparrows territoriality was positively associated with spotting darkness. Regardless of habitat, males with more extensive spotting increased testosterone secretion more in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration and males with darker spotting had greater handling restraint-induced release of corticosterone. This suggests that plumage coloration is associated with underlying physiology, but the relationship between coloration and behaviour may shift between habitats.

AB Necrophagous flies breeding on carcasses face high selection pressures and therefore provide interesting opportunities to study social adaptations. We postulated that gregariousness in necrophagous blow fly larvae is an adaptive response to the environmental constraints of fresh carcasses. Cooperation is indeed believed to be key to the global success of social species. To test this idea, the development of Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae) larvae growing on low- or high-digestibility food substrate (control or trypsin-added ground beef muscle, respectively) at different larval densities was monitored. Results showed that larvae developed faster and had decreased mortality at high than low larval density. Furthermore, aggregation had no deleterious effect on the morphological characteristics (e.g. size) of postfeeding larvae and adult flies. We concluded that increased density positively affected population fitness, which is a conclusion consistent with the predictions of the Allee effect. Compared with those fed on regular food, larvae fed on high-digestibility food had reduced mortality and faster development on average. From these results, we postulated that collective exodigestion might be an adaptive response allowing blow flies to colonize fresh carcasses before the arrival of other insects and the multiplication of microbes. This hypothesis is consistent with the idea that cooperation may enable species to expand their niches. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Some territorial animals recognize familiar neighbours and are less aggressive to established neighbours than they are to strangers. This form of social recognition produces a 'dear enemy' effect, which may allow animals to reduce the costs of territory defence. The dear enemy effect is thought to reflect either the decreased threat posed by neighbours relative to strangers (the relative threat hypothesis) or the decreased need for escalation with increasing familiarity between neighbours (the familiarity hypothesis). We tested for a vocally mediated dear enemy effect in male brilliant-thighed poison frogs, Allobates femoralis. In this species, the familiarity hypothesis predicts a dear enemy effect, because males defend long-term stable territories and should be familiar with the calls of their neighbours. In contrast, the relative threat hypothesis does not predict a dear enemy effect, because neighbours and strangers both represent competitors for mates and likely pose equivalent threats. Acoustic analyses showed that males produce individually distinctive advertisement calls. Two playback experiments were conducted to determine whether territorial males respond less aggressively to neighbours' calls than to strangers' calls based on this acoustic identity information. In the first experiment, males pursued acoustically simulated neighbours and strangers to similar distances when calls were played both from the direction of the neighbour's territory and from a direction with no neighbours. In the second experiment, males responded aggressively to neighbours' and strangers' calls at similar threshold amplitudes and pursued these calls to similar distances. Hence, two different playback experiments failed to find evidence of a vocally mediated dear enemy effect. Our results support the hypothesis that territorial animals respond to the relative threat posed by neighbours and strangers regardless of their level of familiarity with neighbours.

AB White rhinos, Ceratotherium simum, use dung odours to transmit information about their sex, age, territorial status (males) and oestrous state. Moreover, as white rhinos defecate in communal middens (i.e. dung heaps, or latrines) it has been suggested that these middens may act as information centres. However, it is uncertain which individuals primarily transmit information via middens, or for whom this information is intended. Using video-recording camera traps, we investigated the behaviour of white rhinos at middens. We hypothesized that territorial adult males would visit, defecate and sniff other dung more than other adults. In line with this, we found that they visited and defecated more than other individuals. Moreover, territorial males and potential male challengers were the main individuals to investigate dung piles. These olfactory investigations focused primarily on territorial male and adult female dung (male-male and female-male communication). Although investigating less often, investigation by adult females and subordinate males was also focused on territorial male and female dung, suggesting male-female and female-female communication. In addition to olfactory signals, there was a spatial aspect to midden use, where territorial males defecated only in the centre of a midden, while other individuals defecated primarily around the periphery. Yet, subordinate males also tended to defecate in the centre, suggesting an indication of residency. Lastly, territorial males defecated more frequently than any other adult, and were able to do so by regulating their dung output (i.e. producing smaller volumes per deposit). Our results indicate that middens act as information centres, where the primary function seems to be for territorial males to transmit and obtain information. However, nonterritorial males may also assess female reproductive state, while females may be assessing the quality of all males, and the number of other females using a midden. Ultimately, our results highlight the importance of middens in white rhino communication. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) should have an important role at maintaining equal fitness among different alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) at an evolutionarily stable state (i.e. equilibrium). Empirical evidence to support both NFDS and equal fitness in the same system is limited. Using the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus we examined the hypotheses that NFDS may play an important role in maintaining the genetically influenced ARTs in this species at equal fitness. With a mesocosm study we found that sneaker males had a significantly lower reproductive success when they were more common, as expected. Field estimates of relative reproductive success also supported NFDS: the reproductive success of each tactic decreased when they were more common. We then used the field estimates of relative reproductive success and age to sexual maturity in a modified version of the Euler equation to determine whether the relative fitness of the two ARTs was equal in two different periods. Our analysis incorporated both the zero class of males and the invisible fraction, which are often missing from studies of the maintenance of polymorphisms. We found that the population was not at equilibrium during one sample (sneaker frequency 86%) but was at equilibrium during another (sneaker frequency 38%). We discuss factors that may be driving the fluctuations around the equilibrium, including variation in female preferences for courier males, while NFDS may be producing a stable limit cycle around it.

AB Directed social learning suggests that information flows through social groups in a nonrandom way, with individuals biased to obtain information from certain conspecifics. A bias to copy the behaviour of more dominant individuals has been demonstrated in captive chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, but has yet to be studied in any wild animal population. To test for this bias using a field experiment, one dominant and one low-ranking female in each of three groups of wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus, was trained on alternative methods of opening an 'artificial fruit'. Following 100 demonstrations from each model, fruits that could be opened either way were presented to each group and all openings were recorded. Overall, the dominant females were not attended to more than low-ranking females during the demonstrations, nor were their methods preferentially used in the test phase. We conclude that these monkeys show no overall bias to copy high-ranking models that would lead to a high-ranking model's behaviour becoming more prevalent in the group than a behaviour demonstrated by a low-ranking model. However, by contrast, there were significant effects of observer monkeys' rank and sex upon the likelihood they would match the dominant model. Additionally we found that the dominant models were more likely to stick to their initially learned method than were low-ranking models. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In species where females do not associate spatially with other females, males usually range over an area including the home ranges of multiple females or defend the home range of one female. Nevertheless, social polyandry (multimale-unifemale grouping) occurs in some species. We examine an ecological constraints model relating habitat quality to facultative social polyandry in siamangs, Symphalangus syndactylus, by testing predictions of two hypotheses: (H1) variation in the size and density of important food trees affects the size of siamang home ranges and areas of exclusive use; (H2) socially polyandrous groups benefit from cooperative defence of the home range and area of exclusive use. Crown volume/ha of freestanding or strangler figs (Ficus), the most important siamang food, was negatively related to the size of the home range but not to the size of the area of exclusive use. Density and crown volume/ha of the second-most important plant food, Dracontomelon dao, was not related to the size of the home range or to the size of the area of exclusive use. Multimale groups had larger home ranges and areas of exclusive use than unimale groups, and the home ranges and areas of exclusive use of multimale groups encompassed more freestanding or strangling figs than those of unimale groups. Models of home range size including fig abundance (density or crown volume/ha) and the number of males as predictor variables suggested that multimale groups have larger home ranges than predicted by the relationship between fig abundance and home range size alone. While some other facultatively polyandrous species have larger home ranges in areas of poorer habitat quality, our results suggest a more complex situation for siamangs at our study site. Specifically, the density of large figs may constrain siamang ranging patterns, but multimale groups live in home ranges with more figs than those of unimale groups. Our results suggest that multimale groups may defend higher-quality territories than unimale groups. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Learning by observing others is especially beneficial for young and naIve individuals. The relationship to the social partner is thus important. While peers are often used as demonstrators to test for social learning abilities in a species, thereby studying horizontal transmission of information, this study focused on the vertical transmission of information, i. e. learning across generations, in a highly social species. Half-a-year-old piglets of the Kune Kune breed, Sus scrofa domesticus (in contrast to the usual subjects in studies on pigs raised and kept in seminatural conditions), were first exposed to their mother or aunt pushing one of two differently coloured bars to either the left or right side to open a sliding door, and were then tested after 1 min, 1 h and 1-day retention intervals. Results indicated that subjects recalled the movement of the door, rather than using local or stimulus enhancement. A second test series revealed that the pigs used the demonstrated opening technique and even remembered it after a delay of 24 h. Nonexposed piglets did not show a side bias during their first encounters with the apparatus; however, habit formation was at play during later test sessions and was possibly the reason for long-term memory of the self-acquired techniques. Altogether, this study revealed that piglets learned how to solve a manipulative foraging problem from both their mother and their aunt, probably by acquiring some information through observation and then memorizing it for up to a day.

AB Objectively measuring the effects of parasitism on animal health is challenging, especially in the wild. Analyses of behavioural organization are increasingly used for this purpose, to identify animals in pathological or otherwise challenged states. Here, we investigated the possible impact of gastrointestinal helminth infection on the behaviour of wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, by applying fractal analysis to their feeding patterns. We predicted that higher intensity of strongylid infection should be associated with altered organizational complexity in temporal sequences of behaviour. We observed 15 habituated male chimpanzees in Kalinzu Reserve Forest, Uganda, and collected behavioural time series via focal animal sampling. We quantified the number of strongylid eggs per gram of faecal sediment using a modified simple sedimentation method to estimate the intensity of infection with strongylid nematodes. We used detrended fluctuation analysis ( DFA) to explore long-range dependence in binary sequences of feeding behaviour as an index of organizational complexity along a stochastic-deterministic gradient. We then built several generalized linear mixed models to examine the relationship between behavioural organization and strongylid infection. Our results indicate that chimpanzee feeding sequences are long-range dependent and antipersistent, i.e. short bouts tended to be followed by long bouts and vice versa. Furthermore, the complexity of chimpanzee feeding sequences and the intensity of infection with strongylid nematodes were positively related: individuals with more intense infections exhibited more stochastic feeding sequences. In contrast, more conventional analyses did not reveal any relationship between parasitism and chimpanzee behaviour, nor did a survival analysis find variation in the probability of switching between behaviour states across chimpanzees with varying infection phenotypes. This work suggests that strongylid nematodes do pose a challenge for wild chimpanzees, manifest as altered organizational complexity in behaviour sequences, and provides further evidence that fractal analyses can have a valuable role in animal health monitoring.

AB Tool use is widespread among animals and has been under intense study due to its prominence in human society and evolution. A lack of detailed genetic information for wild populations has perpetuated assumptions regarding associations between individual differences in tool use and cognition and learning processes. However, captive birds and mammals can use tools in the absence of opportunities for social learning, indicating a genetic basis. Here, we used animal models and relatedness analysis to disentangle the role played by genetics and learning in tool use in an insular population of a long- lived vulture, Neophron percnopterus. Our results show a low heritability in this behaviour, perhaps because of the low variability observed among birds. However, not all individuals used stones to break eggs, and those that did so behaved consistently. Importantly, there was no evidence of learning at the timescale considered. Our results suggest that repeatability in tool use within individuals may indicate a link with some personality traits, with strong evolutionary and ecological consequences.

AB Cooperation in biological systems is frequently maintained by social enforcement mechanisms, where individually egoistic and group-costly behaviour is mutually suppressed by other group members. One of the best examples in nature is worker policing in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, where workers selectively remove or ` police' eggs laid by workers that egoistically try to produce their own offspring instead of working for the good of the colony. It has long been suggested that worker policing behaviour should be genetically determined, as theory has shown that queen polyandry in the honeybee would be expected to give rise to clear indirect genetic or ` inclusive fitness' benefits of worker policing, thereby causing genes for policing to spread in the population. In the present study, we tested the theory that worker policing should have a genetic component by determining whether workers belonging to different patrilines, derived from different fathers, differ in their tendency to police eggs. This analysis showed that variation in policing behaviour indeed has a genetic basis, with the trait having an estimated broadsense heritability of 0.25 ([0.013-0.46] 95% confidence limits). In addition, there was clear individual specialization in policing, as just a few individuals within each patriline were observed to police. Remarkably though, there was no evidence for age specialization, as workers of all ages, except those younger than 10 days and older than ca. 40 days, engaged in policing. This contrasts with most other behaviours in the honeybee, which usually follow a strict age-linked pattern of division of labour. Overall, we conclude that worker policing behaviour in the honeybee is genetically heritable and that workers of all ages engage in policing to help maintain the social order in the colony.

AB Migratory birds are known to be capable of adjusting their heading direction to compensate for wind drift and their airspeed adaptively with respect to head and tail winds. High-flying nocturnally migrating common swifts, Apus apus, have been shown to compensate for wind drift, but they failed to adjust airspeed as expected (increase in head wind and decrease in tail wind in relation to neutral wind). We report on new measurements of diurnally migrating common swifts at a coastal site in the Baltic, where the birds did adjust airspeed adaptively during spring and autumn migration. During autumn migration, they compensated for lateral wind drift by adjusting heading direction similarly to high-altitude migrants in autumn. We also recorded flight speed and wind compensation during a summer weather-elated exodus, when the birds behaved similarly to those during autumn migration, although they showed a small degree of wind drift. Why birds failed to adjust airspeed adaptively at high altitude is discussed, and we argue there is a threshold in the sensory system to detect small changes in optic flow based on visual landmarks.

AB Alarm calling is a widespread antipredator behaviour, but it is not always a reliable indication of real danger. Individuals must decide when to respond to alarm calls as a function of the relative costs and benefits, but experiments investigating contextual influences are rare. We used playback experiments in conjunction with supplementary feeding and the presentation of direct predator cues to examine variation in receiver responses to alarm calls in a habituated population of wild dwarf mongooses. First, we investigated whether individuals adjust their response to alarm calls depending on their own satiation level and spatial position of the caller. Individuals were more likely to respond to alarm calls when they had received supplementary food, and hence could prioritize minimization of predation risk over starvation. There was also increased responsiveness to alarm calls given by individuals from elevated positions compared to those on the ground; sentinels (raised guards) are more likely to detect potential predators than foragers, and alarm calls from elevated positions are probably perceived as more reliable. When individuals did respond, they were more likely to flee following an alarm call given from ground level; foragers are likely to detect predators in closer proximity than sentinels, requiring more urgent escape responses. Second, we examined how individuals combine social information provided by alarm calls with personal information relating to predator presence. Receiver responses to terrestrial and aerial alarm calls did not differ when they followed interaction with an olfactory predator cue compared to an olfactory control cue. Following interaction with a terrestrial predator cue, however, latency to nonvigilance was significantly longer after hearing an aerial alarm call than after hearing a terrestrial alarm call, potentially because of social information novelty. Our results provide experimental evidence that receivers respond flexibly to alarm calls depending on receiver, signaller and external factors.

AB Neophobia is an important personality trait that allows animals to minimize exposure to threat. We investigated the existence of consistent individual differences in the level of neophobia in captive roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, using an experimental set-up. Our main objective was to explore the link between an individual's level of neophobia with behavioural and physiological responses measured during a stressful situation, i.e. capture and restraint, to facilitate characterization of neophobia in the wild. We found that the probability of initiating a feeding bout and the feeding efficiency over bouts both decreased in the presence of a novel object. However, there was pronounced variation in the degree to which individuals were affected by the experimental treatment. First, feeding efficiency decreased the most among individuals that reacted less markedly to an acutely stressful situation (capture). Second, latency between the first visit and the first feeding bout increased the most among individuals that had a higher concentration of fructosamine in their blood, an indicator of chronic stress. Our results indicate that individuals that are more neophobic (high latency to first feeding bout and low feeding efficiency in the presence of a novel object) are also less proactive (low behavioural response to capture, high levels of fructosamine), suggesting the existence of a behavioural syndrome. We conclude that behavioural and physiological parameters measured during capture provide reliable indicators of neophobia for roe deer, providing an exciting new avenue for the study of animal personality in the wild.

AB Many species use antipredator vocalizations to signal information about potential predators, including the level of threat posed by a particular predator. It is not clear, however, why only some prey species do this. Because they use multiple mechanisms to encode threat-specific information about predators, North American Paridae species have been a particularly useful model for studying antipredator signals. Paridae as a group are also useful for examining phylogenetic conservation of vocal signals because all of these species (at least those studied previously) employ similar ways of encoding information about predator threat. To test whether the ways in which predator threat information is encoded (here measured by a bird's vocal output) are conserved across a family with similar vocalizations, we used taxidermy mounts to simulate low-and high-threat predators to induce mobbing in six species across five genera of British Paridae. We found that, like North American species, British tits all increased their call rate in response to predators compared with nonthreatening control mounts, but they all varied in the number and types of additional ways they encoded this information. Some species (blue and willow tits) used all four ways to differentiate between different threat predators, while others used only two (crested tits), one (great and coal tits) or none at all (willow tits). The variation in the way each species encoded predator threat information in their calls was not explained by phylogenetic relatedness or by variation in life history. To better understand patterns of information encoding across related species, we suggest that playback experiments to determine how encoded information is used by conspecifics and heterospecifics might provide insights about why some species encode information about predator threat in multiple ways.

AB Colour patterns displayed by animals frequently comprise multiple elements, including hue, pattern, luminance and texture. Predators' perception of and learning about visual stimuli has important implications for the evolution of animal coloration, including aposematism and mimicry. This study investigated how a coral reef fish, the triggerfish Rhinecanthus aculeatus, learnt different elements of colour patterns. Fish trained to associate a food reward with blue, yellow and green patterns on a grey background selected novel stimuli by chromaticity, rather than pattern or luminance contrast. By comparison, when presented with small orange spots the fish appeared to learn luminance, which is consistent with findings in other animals, including bees, birds and humans, that for small objects the achromatic component of the signal is more salient than chromaticity. While internal pattern did not appear to be learnt in our first two experiments, a subsequent test showed that fish could distinguish between spotted and striped patterns over various sizes, up to the limits of their visual acuity. These results are discussed in relation to visual processing of colour patterns and the evolution of visual signals in the marine environment.

AB Sexual conflict theory expects females to avoid nonoptimal mating attempts by males. Although female vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, can resist direct mating attempts, higher-ranking males still have more mating opportunities than lower-ranking ones. We presume that rank-related access reflects male-emale competition that may conflict with female reproductive objectives. We extend an earlier report of codominance in this species to show that powerful females can undermine the restrictions imposed through maleemale competition by improving the dominance rank of preferred male associates. We found that the dominance hierarchies of the sexes were comprehensively interdigitated and that males who had more female spatial associates, and who groomed with well-connected females, were more likely improve their Elo-ratings, which we use as an index of male power. The effects of partner number and integration, which predicted the probability of the initiation of aggression by lower-ranking males, suggest that association with females offered the prospect of protected threat if this likelihood increased. Although female rank and aggression were not directly consequential for males, we argue that female power and influence are intertwined and that both stem from the strength of female reproductive control.

AB Sexual selection can drive the evolution of conspicuous visual signals that advertise individual quality to prospective mates. Reproductive strategy can influence the balance between selective pressures and whether sexually selected signals evolve. Alternatively, visual signals can serve other functions, including predator deterrence, species recognition and differentiating genetically determined morphs. In the dimorphic white-throated sparrow, Zonotrichia albicollis, we explored how selection on conspicuous coloration changes with reproductive strategy, and whether visual signals of morph identity are discrete from sexually selected signals of individual quality. In this species, white morph birds have more colourful plumage than tan morph birds, and white males are more promiscuous and aggressive than tan counterparts. White females are also more aggressive than tan females. White males with more contrasting coloration achieved higher lifetime fitness, whereas the opposite relationship occurred among tan males. Linear selection gradients indicated strong, positive selection on plumage contrast in white males, but negative selection on contrast in tan males. For both morphs, relationships between female coloration and fitness were weak. Results demonstrate disruptive selection on a visual signalling trait in a colour-polymorphic species and suggest that signals associated with an aggressive morph can also evolve to indicate individual quality within that morph.

AB To manage the costs of aggression, territory holders confronted by intruders commonly adjust their aggression according to the perceived level of threat. Yet, we currently know surprisingly little about heterospecific interactions or sex differences with regard to adjustment of aggression, particularly in the context of the 'dear enemy' phenomenon, in which familiar individuals are treated less aggressively than unfamiliar ones. To address these knowledge gaps, we experimentally manipulated territorial intrusions in a biparental cichlid fish, the moga, Hypsophrys nicaraguensis, in their natural habitat. We found that aggression by both females and males decreased quicker when the focal fish was sequentially presented with the same heterospecific intruder stimulus than when it was presented on each round with a different stimulus. We also found a significant sex difference: the decrease in aggression over subsequent encounters was quicker in males. Such patterns of adjustment in aggression can have important ecological implications by affecting the territory-holding success of the interacting individuals, and, in the case of heterospecific interactions, patterns of species coexistence at the community level.

AB The goal of this study was to clarify whether social experience affects developmental changes in call usage in Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata. We focused on vocalizations primarily used as greeting signals, such as grunts, girneys and coo calls. We hypothesized that the degree of interaction with adult females other than mothers would facilitate selective call usage towards less familiar individuals in young monkeys. To test this, we conducted observations on female monkeys from infancy to full adulthood in a free-ranging group, and found that young adult and full adult subjects produced calls more frequently when approaching unrelated, than related, adult females. In contrast, subadults, juveniles and infants did not produce calls selectively towards unrelated adults. Monkeys older than juveniles were more likely to engage in affiliative interactions after approaching unrelated females with than without calls, indicating that calling can be beneficial for signallers. Individuals who had more frequent interactions with unrelated adult females used calls more frequently towards unrelated adult females in subsequent observation years, an effect that was stronger in older animals. These findings suggest that calling towards unrelated adult females is facilitated through tangible interactions with these females. The interactions with related adult females did not influence calling towards relatives or nonrelatives, indicating that interaction with relatives did not facilitate call usage. We conclude that social experience with unrelated adult females modifies vocal greeting behaviours, which, in turn, may mediate social relationships between unrelated individuals.

AB Alloparenting, in which adults help to raise nondescendent offspring, is the hallmark of both cooperatively breeding and eusocial animal groups. Previous studies of the small carpenter bee, Ceratina calcarata, showed that mothers sometimes produce very small daughters, reminiscent of eusocial workers, suggesting retention of a complex social trait, alloparenting, in this secondarily solitary bee species. We tested the hypothesis that small daughters can act as alloparents by removing mothers from nests just prior to brood emergence, creating conditions under which small daughters should behave as alloparents. In 25 of 43 orphaned nests, a daughter took over the mother's role, foraging for pollen to feed her siblings. Alloparenting never occurred in control nests with surviving mothers. Alloparenting also did not occur when mothers disappeared before brood emerged as adults, as this invariably resulted in complete brood mortality. A second experiment demonstrated that post-eclosion feeding is necessary for overwintering survival. The expression of alloparenting in experimental nests suggests that alloparents could represent maternal insurance to ensure that adult offspring are fed before winter, and that alloparents could achieve indirect fitness from sibling care through assured fitness returns. However, complete nest failure in orphaned control nests demonstrates that brood only survive if their mother survives as well, which obviates the need for alloparenting. Therefore, alloparenting behaviour appears to represents the retention of an ancestral social trait that appears to have no current adaptive benefit in circumstances that highly favour solitary nesting and maternal brood care.

AB Paternal care is less common than maternal care because male fitness usually depends on the number of mating opportunities with distinct females. Yet, males also invest in parental care when offspring survival depends on paternal contribution for protection and/or brood nutrition and mating opportunities with new females are scarce. Although the second condition is common in spiders, male contribution to the survival of spiderlings is very rare. However, males of Manogea porracea build their webs above female webs, where they capture prey throughout the reproductive period. In addition, both sexes may have contact with eggsacs and attack predators that approach them. This unusual extended period of co-occurrence between males and their offspring may favour the establishment of paternal care. Here, we investigated (1) the mortality factors influencing offspring survival, (2) how the presence of parents affects offspring survival, (3) how males affect web integrity and protect eggs against predation and (4) variations in operational sex ratio (OSR) during the reproductive season, along with the proportion of eggsacs in webs occupied by males alone before the dispersal of spiderlings. We found that (1) four kleptoparasitic/araneophagic spider species invaded webs and attacked eggsacs, (2) parental care significantly improved offspring survival, (3) males maintained web integrity and protected offspring against the attacks of two araneophagic species and (4) the OSR became quickly biased towards males, and that these remaining males assumed exclusive care of 68% of the eggsacs produced during the season. The ability of males to protect the offspring and the reduced availability of receptive females at the end of the reproductive season might represent the possible causes of male care in M. porracea. We propose that web building by males and their rapid access to the eggsacs create unique conditions that may favour the evolution of paternal care in Cyrtophorinae.

AB Several laboratory studies have revealed functional hemispheric lateralization in birds performing visual tasks. However, the role of functional brain asymmetries in spatial behaviour in natural settings is still poorly investigated. We studied monocularly occluded homing pigeons, Columba livia, to investigate potential differences in the hemispheric control of navigational performance. We GPS-tracked monocularly occluded and control binocular homing pigeons during seven group training releases and a final solitary release from each of two sites. The pigeons were then given one last release from each site after a phase shift of the light-dark cycle under binocular conditions, to distinguish compass-based orientation from landmark-based pilotage. Overall, pigeons homing with the left eye/right hemisphere (RH) displayed a greater fidelity to the familiar space previously experienced than pigeons homing with the right eye/left hemisphere (LH). Another difference between the two monocular groups is that LH pigeons were more likely than RH pigeons to fly with other pigeons during the group training releases. The data support the hypothesis that the left eye/right hemisphere plays a more substantial role as pigeons develop fidelity to certain routes to home from familiar release sites, an enhanced fidelity that may be supported by superior memory for familiar landmarks.

AB Vigilance is important for survivorship and reproductive success and is common and conspicuous within hundreds of species across a diverse array of taxa. Vigilance can involve either scanning for predators (antipredator vigilance) or watching conspecifics (social vigilance). From observations of marked Gunnison's prairie dogs, Cynomys gunnisoni (Sciuridae), living under natural conditions at Valles Caldera National Preserve, New Mexico, U.S.A., we compared results from the two most common sampling methods used by behavioural ecologists to measure vigilance: focal sampling (i.e. observing an individual for a specific amount of time and recording the amount of time spent vigilant) and scan sampling (i.e. observing all individuals in an area at a single moment and recording whether each individual at that moment is vigilant or nonvigilant). Information from different individuals and from the same individuals over time both revealed that estimates of vigilance from scan sampling were consistently and significantly higher than estimates from focal sampling. These differences probably resulted because nonvigilant behaviours were more difficult to detect in scan samples than in focal samples. Our results have important implications for behavioural ecologists who want to make intraspecific or interspecific comparisons of vigilance.

AB Genetic polymorphism in males has long been considered paradoxical because sexual selection is expected to deplete additive genetic variation. Although studies have shown how divergent selection between populations can make that work, it is very rare to find disruptive selection within one population. Since intersexual selection can have a significant effect on the phenotypic morphospace of the opposite sex, we analysed the role of female preference as a disruptive selective force. In this study we evaluated how female preference acts on anatomical and sex-related behavioural traits of two male morphs in the jumping spider Maevia inclemens. We used mate choice trials to analyse how female preference for the two morphs varied. The tests indicated that females preferred opposite values of two anatomical and two behavioural traits for each male morph. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to show disruptive sexual selection in Arachnidae and significantly expands the realm of disruptive selection, by adding one more case to the very few documented instances. These processes, which act entirely within a species, are of particular interest because they could contribute to the evolution of reproductive isolation and sympatric speciation by sexual selection, a controversial topic in evolutionary biology.

AB Here, I provide a practical overview on some statistical approaches that are able to handle the constraints that frequently emerge in the study of animal behaviour. When collecting or analysing behavioural data, several sources of limitations, which can raise either uncertainties or biases in the parameter estimates, need to be considered. In particular, these can be issues about (1) limited sample size and missing data, (2) uncertainties about the identity of subjects and the dangers posed by pseudoreplication, (3) large measurement errors resulting from the use of indicator variables with nonperfect reliability or variables with low repeatability, (4) the confounding effect of the within-individual variation of behaviour and (5) phylogenetic nonindependence of data (e.g. when substitute species are used). I suggest some simple analytical solutions to these problems based on existing methodologies and on a consumable language to practitioners. I highlight how randomization and simulation routines, generalized linear mixed models, autocorrelation models, phylogenetic comparative methods and Bayesian statistics can be exploited to overcome the inefficient performance of some conventional statistical approaches with typical behavioural data. To enhance the accessibility of these methodologies, I demonstrate how they can be brought into practice in the R statistical environment, which offers flexible statistical designs. Although the primary motivation behind this discussion was to help animal behaviourists who address questions in relation to conservation, I also hope that researchers working on the evolutionary ecology of behaviour will also find some material useful.

AB Wolbachia are a major symbiont of arthropods and nematodes. They can manipulate host reproduction in order to spread in host populations, but Wolbachia manipulation often incurs costs to the host species itself and/or provides benefits to the host. Because the fitness effects of Wolbachia infections differ between host species, fitness components of the host have to be carefully investigated. However, it is still relatively understudied. Here, we investigated effects of Wolbachia infection on life history and reproductive traits in Callosobruchus chinensis. This is a host in which the prevalence of Wolbachia and the cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) it causes have been well reported. However, excluding research related to CI, there is little information about the effects of Wolbachia infection on traits of C. chinensis. We found that Wolbachia infection had positive effects on the life history and reproductive traits of C. chinensis males and females, with the exception of a negative effect on female fecundity. Nevertheless, Wolbachia-infected females are thought to have the advantage of reproduction because of complete CI in eggs from an uninfected female mated with an infected male. These results suggest that Wolbachia infection affects the life history and sexual selection of C. chinensis populations. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many territorial animals are less aggressive towards neighbours than they are towards strangers. This phenomenon is known as the 'dear enemy' effect and it occurs because strangers represent a considerably higher threat to territory take-over compared to neighbours. Some evidence has suggested that large repertoires may constrain neighbour-stranger discrimination. We tested whether songbirds with large repertoires exhibit neighbour-stranger discrimination, conducting a playback study on a songbird with a large vocal repertoire, and a comparative analysis of the dear enemy effect across all published studies of songbirds. In our playback study, we broadcast neighbour and stranger songs within the breeding territories of red-eyed vireos, Vireo olivaceus, a songbird species with a large song repertoire (ca. 50 songs per individual). Vireos responded significantly more aggressively to playback of stranger versus neighbour songs; subjects approached closer to the loudspeaker, had a lower latency to approach the loudspeaker, spent more time near the loudspeaker and sang more soft songs during stranger trials than during neighbour trials. We examined song sharing between red-eyed vireos and found low levels of song sharing between neighbours, suggesting that red-eyed vireos may discriminate among conspecifics based on individually distinctive song types. We then conducted a comparative analysis of neighbour-stranger discrimination across the published literature on songbirds, using a phylogenetically controlled analysis to explore whether species with large repertoires are less likely to discriminate between neighbours and strangers. Across 34 species, we found no evidence that songbirds with large repertoires are constrained in their ability to distinguish between neighbours and strangers. We conclude that large song repertoires do not inhibit neighbour-stranger discrimination in red-eyed vireos specifically, or songbirds generally.

AB Cetacean watching from tour boats has increased in recent years and has been promoted as an ethically viable alternative to cetacean viewing in captive facilities or directed take. However, short- and long-term impacts of this industry on the behaviour and energetic expenditure of cetaceans have been documented. Although multiple studies have investigated the acoustic response of dolphins to marine tourism, there are several covariates that could also explain some of these results and should be considered simultaneously. Here, we investigated whether common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, inhabiting Walvis Bay, Namibia vary their whistle parameters in relation to boat presence, surface behaviour and/or group composition. We detected an upward shift of up to 1.99 kHz in several whistle frequency parameters when dolphins were in the presence of one or more tour boats and the research vessel. No changes were demonstrated in the frequency range, number of inflection points or duration of whistles. A similar, although less pronounced difference was observed in response to engine noise generated by the research vessel when idling, suggesting that noise alone plays an important role in driving this shift in whistle frequency. Additionally, a strong effect of surface behaviour was observed, with the greatest difference in whistle parameters detected between resting and other behavioural states that are associated with higher degrees of emotional arousal. Group composition also contributed to the variation observed, with the impact of boats dependent on whether calves were present or not. Overall these results demonstrate high natural variation in the frequency parameters of whistles utilized by dolphins over varying behavioural states and group composition. Anthropogenic impact in the form of marine tour boats can influence the vocalization parameters of dolphins and such changes could have a long-term impact if they reduce the communication range of whistles or increase energy expenditure.

AB Many animals communicate using multimodal signals, which simultaneously address different senses. Components may prompt similar or different responses when used alone, whereas the composite signal may have a similar meaning to one or both components, or a novel meaning. We used robot models to dissect the roles of visual and vocal components in the multimodal duets of Australian magpie-larks, Grallina cyanoleuca. Mated pairs produce antiphonal vocal duets, and coordinate them with visual duets, which usually entail alternating wing movements. Previous playback experiments show that purely vocal duets have a territorial function, but the role of visual displays is unknown. We measured territorial responses by pairs to each component independently, as well as to the multimodal signal, and analysed the choice of song and visual display used by partners during duets. Acoustic and multimodal playbacks prompted the same, strong territorial response, entailing both flight and vocal duetting by the resident pair. By contrast, purely visual playbacks did not prompt a strong territorial response. Furthermore, pairs used the same visual display within multimodal displays, independent of song type, implying that birds watch their partners when choosing the visual display, and suggesting that it could be a within-pair signal. We conclude that the vocal component of duets is a territorial signal to other pairs, whereas the visual component might either coordinate vocal duets within pairs, analogous to a conductor's baton, or have a restricted role in communication between rival pairs, perhaps especially at long range.

AB Risk taking and neophilia affect many aspects of an individual's life trajectory, including social rank, philopatry, reproductive success and mortality. We investigate mechanisms by which early life socialization may have lasting impacts on behaviours across contexts by assessing the relationship between social rank and neophilia at different stages of development. In the cooperatively breeding Arabian babbler, Turdoides squamiceps, age is positively correlated with dominance and reproductive skew. Early life socialization, here represented by social rank order relationship to clutch-mates, may provide a major additional source of variation within age cohorts in overall social opportunities and the resulting reproductive strategies. We test the hypothesis that novelty-seeking behaviour is related to intrabrood rank in Arabian babblers; we presented familiar versus novel stimuli (stationary objects, moving objects and sounds) to birds. To examine intrabrood dominance as a potential predictor of later-life neophilic behaviours, we constructed a multimodal index of novel stimulus approach behaviour for fledglings and juveniles living in an individually marked population, and compared it against an intrabrood rank metric based on scramble competition (rank index) to allow comparisons between different broods and groups. All birds were more likely to react to novel stimuli than to familiar stimuli. Intrabrood rank index positively predicted the frequency of novel stimulus approach, with individuals of higher intrabrood rank more frequently approaching novel stimuli. Juveniles made more approaches to novel stimuli and made those approaches earlier in the trial than did fledglings; approaches by all young birds were more frequent when an adult was present versus absent at the beginning of the presentation. These findings suggest an interaction between novelty-seeking behaviour by young birds and displays related to social rank and/or competitive ability. In this way, novelty-seeking behaviours in early life may be connected with lifetime social and reproductive trajectory. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Research over the past two decades suggests that polyandry is almost ubiquitous in nature. In some cases, females can gain direct and indirect (genetic) fitness benefits from mating with multiple males. However, when females accept superfluous matings without gaining any clear benefit, polyandry has been interpreted as a strategy to mitigate the costs of resisting or avoiding matings, a situation known as convenience polyandry. When females mate out of 'convenience' the mating rate is expected to be plastic, since females should mate at a higher rate when the costs of resistance or avoidance are high, for instance when males occur in high densities and/or around resources required by females such as oviposition sites. Here we show that remating in Nasonia vitripennis, a species of wasp that is largely monandrous in the wild but that evolves polyandry under laboratory culture, is dependent upon the availability of hosts for oviposition and upon male density. We found that females mated at a higher rate when male density was high but only if a suitable oviposition substrate was available. Outwardly this seems suggestive of convenience polyandry. However, females that remated under these conditions did not gain more time to oviposit than females that resisted superfluous matings. The results of this study highlight the importance of comprehensively assessing the costs and benefits of mating before attributing the observed behaviour to convenience polyandry. Furthermore, these results add to the growing body of evidence that the ecological context under which sexual interactions occur is critical to the economics of mating. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Theory predicts that in polyandrous species males that invest more in traits enhancing postcopulatory success should have less energy to invest in mating acquisition, leading to trade-offs between pre- and post-copulatory episodes of sexual selection. Although such trade-offs are well studied, the potential constraints that postcopulatory sexual selection imposes on alternative mating tactics are rarely considered. In guppies, Poecilia reticulata, individual males can obtain matings by performing energetically costly courtship displays or by using less costly forced copulations. In this study we manipulated a component of social environment (namely, the presence of females) to experimentally elevate sperm production in males. We found that male guppies rapidly compensated by reducing their reliance on courtship in favour of forced matings. As both tactics differ in mating and fertilization success, the consequences of this trade-off may have important ramifications for male reproductive fitness.

AB Coloration of animals often includes spectacular markings that supposedly decrease predation risk. Many vertebrates have eye stripes that have been suggested to conceal the noticeable shape of the eye from predators. Another salient mark in a wide range of taxa that sometimes co-occurs with an eye stripe is the eyespot. Some eyespots divert strikes of attacking predators, but whether the eyelike appearance is essential for the divertive effect is not known. Although numerous species of fish provide iconic examples of spectacular coloration, experimental studies on the protective function of coloration against fish predators are scarce. We investigated the divertive potential of prey marks, using artificial prey and three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, as a model for predator perception and behaviour. A significant proportion of attacking fish directed their strike towards an eyespot, but when compared to a square-shaped mark, the bias was not significantly stronger. Importantly, a stripe running through the eyelike mark strongly influenced the attacking fish. When presented simultaneously, the fish directed their strikes towards an intact eyelike shape and away from an eyelike shape disrupted by a stripe. Our results demonstrate that marks of different shapes differ in their divertive potential, and this may contribute to the wide occurrence of eyespots in prey. Importantly, they also show that a stripe can effectively decrease the salience of an eyelike pattern, which provides the first experimental evidence for the adaptive benefit for eye stripes. Moreover, the joint effect of the eyespot and the disruptive eye stripe indicates that prey marks with different functions can form adaptive constellations to manipulate the attack behaviour of predators.

AB In mating systems where sexual selection is intense, providing information on identity and quality to congeners may strongly influence reproductive success. In the lekking North African houbara bustard, Chlamydotis undulata undulata, males perform a spectacular courtship that includes highly visible displays and low-frequency vocalizations called booms. Booms are individualized and may play a role in individual recognition. However, this hypothesis is valid only if boom parameters are fixed phenotypes that do not change over time. It is also possible that they convey information about male quality. Using captive birds, we investigated whether the characteristics of booms vary over time, and whether they are related to physiological, physical and behavioural traits of the males. We showed that booming calls varied over the breeding season and that the males producing the lowest frequency booms were the heaviest and displayed the most. Using playback experiments in the field, we tested whether wild males use the frequency of rival booms as an indicator of their opponent's condition. We found that males' behavioural responses were significantly different according to the frequency of the signals played back. Males responded to booms simulating heavier intruders (lower frequency), which presumably represented a bigger threat, by increasing the duration of their running phase and by decreasing the duration of their booming phase, potentially bluffing on their own condition. Thus, booms convey information on male quality rather than identity, and are key acoustic signals in the agonistic relationships between lekking males.

   CONSEQUENCES; MAMMALS
AB Differences in animal behaviour can arise from individual variation in energy resource allocation decisions. Because energy is essential to fuel all processes that permit behaviour, it is necessary to consider metabolism for a more complete understanding of behavioural ecology. Although many studies have explored interspecific relationships between metabolic rate and behaviour, few studies have evaluated within-species relationships between metabolism and sleep. We investigated the relationship between basal metabolic rate (BMR) and components of sleep behaviour measured in wild great tits, Parus major, during winter and the prebreeding period. Individuals with higher metabolic rates may partially offset their costs by using sleep as an energy conservation strategy, where individuals with higher BMR may sleep more. On the other hand, the energetic savings of longer sleep may not be worth the lost foraging opportunities and therefore higher BMR individuals may sleep less. Our results suggest that the relationship between BMR and sleep behaviours may depend on sex. Female great tits displayed a positive relationship between metabolic rate and sleep duration consistent with energy conservation, or protection, while male great tits displayed a negative relationship. Differences in sleep duration came about largely due to a sex-specific interaction between BMR and sleep onset time; we found no relationship between BMR and time of awakening in either sex. Nor did it appear that individuals compensated for changes in duration of sleep with changes to quality of sleep, measured as frequency of night-time awakenings. This suggests that male and female great tits use different sleep strategies based on their metabolic requirements which may contribute to variation in sleep behaviour within a species. Sex-specific differences in metabolic physiology, or fitness-enhancing behaviours throughout the circannual cycle may contribute to variation in energy-balancing strategies within and between the sexes.

AB Nocturnal animals frequently possess seemingly conspicuous colour patterns that can function in a variety of ways (e.g. prey attraction, camouflage, predator avoidance, etc.). The use of colour patterns in intraspecific signalling, especially reproductive activities, in nocturnal animals has received relatively little attention. This study tested for a dual function of colour in the nocturnal fishing spider, Dolomedes raptor (Araneae: Pisauridae), whose males develop dimorphic white stripes at sexual maturation. We tested for a role in foraging as well as mate assessment. First, quantifications of the natural variation of male stripes indicated a correlation between stripe area and male body size and weight. Subsequent diet experiments confirmed that the area of a male's white stripes are body size-dependent and thus could potentially convey information to choosey females about male quality. Field experiments used dummies resembling D. raptor in appearance to test a prey attraction function of the white stripes. We found that dummies with the white stripes present attracted significantly more prey than those without stripes. Finally, we used males with manipulated phenotypes in laboratory mating trials and found that males with intact white stripes were significantly more likely to be accepted by females than those with the white stripes eliminated. Together, our results document a nutrient-dependent trait that functions not only in strengthening foraging success, but also in a mating context, increasing male mating success. We suggest that the role of these male white stripes in reproduction has been facilitated by their function in foraging. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sociability in animals provides benefits such as reduced predation risk and increased foraging efficiency. During the early stages of invasion, individuals are often vulnerable as part of a small population (Allee effects); associations with native heterospecifics could mitigate some of the disadvantages of small population size and thereby increase the chances of establishment success. Here we explored two potential benefits of heterospecific association to guppies, Poecilia reticulata, a very successful invasive species. We first investigated whether guppies can exploit visual cues from morphologically similar heterospecific individuals as effectively as those from conspecifics. We next tested whether willingness to explore an unfamiliar environment depends on whether guppies are accompanied by conspecifics or heterospecifics. Our results show that guppies can acquire information on food availability from another species, as well as from conspecifics. We also found that guppies engaged in exploratory behaviour more quickly if the habitat had plants in it, and were more likely to associate if it was unstructured; there was, however, no difference in the frequency with which the focal fish was accompanied by a conspecific or a heterospecific individual. These results show that guppies respond to these heterospecifics as they do with conspecifics. Our study reveals some of the traits that could make an invader successful and potentially help to identify species with a higher potential to become established outside their native range.

AB The sensory systems of organisms are shaped by selective pressures imposed by their performance in a variety of contexts. Female frog-biting midges use the mating calls of anurans to locate their host to obtain a blood meal. Although the use of sound in foraging is well documented in this group, it is unknown whether sound is used in other contexts. To investigate the ability to use sound in nonforaging contexts, we experimentally tested the prediction that frog-biting midges (Corethrella appendiculata) use sound in mating. We recorded their wing beats while swarming, in controlled tethered conditions and during different- and same-sex pair interactions. Our results show sexual differences in the acoustic properties of flight tones, with male midges having higher frequency wing beats than females. Wing beats of free-flying individuals were significantly higher in frequency than those recorded from tethered individuals, cautioning the interpretation of recordings obtained following this widely used technique. In addition, interacting, tethered opposite-sex pairs altered their flight tones to match their upper harmonics, converging at the third and fourth harmonic frequencies of males and females, respectively. In male-male interactions, however, the frequency of their wing beats diverged. Therefore, flight tones in frog-biting midges may function as courtship signals attracting conspecific females and deterring rival males. We discuss the use of sound in multiple contexts in these midges and potential factors leading to their ability to eavesdrop on anurans. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Hunting by humans can be a potent driver of selection for morphological and life history traits in wildlife populations across continents and taxa. Few studies, however, have documented selection on behavioural responses that increase individual survival under human hunting pressure. Using habitat with dense concealing cover is a common strategy for risk avoidance, with a higher chance of survival being the payoff. At the same time, risk avoidance can be costly in terms of missed foraging opportunities. We investigated individual fine-scale use of habitat by 40 GPS-marked European red deer, Cervus elaphus, and linked this to their survival through the hunting season. Whereas all males used similar habitat in the days before the hunting season, the onset of hunting induced an immediate switch to habitat with more concealing cover in surviving males, but not in males that were later shot. This habitat switch also involved a trade-off with foraging opportunities on bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus, a key forage plant in autumn. Moreover, deer that use safer forest habitat might survive better because they make safer choices in general. The lack of a corresponding pattern in females might be because females were already largely using cover when hunting started, as predicted by sexual segregation theory and the risk of losing offspring. The behavioural response of males to the onset of hunting appears to be adaptive, given that it is linked to increased survival, an important fitness component. We suggest that predictable harvesting regimes with high harvest rates could create a strong selective pressure for deer to respond dynamically to the temporal change in hunting risk. Management should consider the potential for both ecological and evolutionary consequences of harvesting regimes on behaviour. (C) 2015 The Authors.

   ORIENTATION; NAVIGATION; MECHANISMS
AB Many animals, and birds in particular, are thought to use directional information from the sun in the form of a time-compensated sun compass, with predictably deviated orientation under clock shift being regarded as the litmus test of this. We suggest that this paradigm obscures a number of other ways in which solar-derived information could be important in animal orientation. We distinguish between the known use of the sun's azimuth to provide absolute geographical direction (compass mechanism) and its possible use to detect changes in heading (heading indicator mechanism). Just as in an aircraft, these two kinds of information may be provided by separate mechanisms and used for different functions, for example for navigation versus steering. We also argue that although a solar compass must be time-referenced to account for the sun's apparent diurnal movement, this need not entail full time compensation. This is because animals might also use time-dependent solar information in an associatively acquired, and hence time-limited, way. Furthermore, we show that a solar heading indicator, when used on a sufficiently short timescale, need not require time compensation at all. Finally, we suggest that solar-derived cues, such as shadows, could also be involved in navigation in ways that depend explicitly upon position, and are therefore not strictly compass-related. This could include giving directionality to landmarks, or acting as time-dependent landmarks involved in place recognition. We conclude that clock shift experiments alone are neither necessary nor sufficient to identify the occurrence of all conceivable uses of solar information in animal orientation, so that a predictable response to clock shift should not be regarded as an acid test of the use of solar information in navigation.

AB Coping efficiently with novelty is essential for survival. Although ageing is a universal process, its impact on exploration, gathering information and assessing potential risks in novel and stressful situations is still not well understood. In the mound-building mouse, Mus spicilegus, the dispersal process involves two age classes (2-month-old and overwintered 6-month-old individuals). We compared exploration and risk-taking behaviour of four age groups of these mice in both sexes: young and overwintered dispersers and two older groups (12-month-old and 24-month-old animals) to investigate long-term age-related effects. Responses of these animals to novelty and anxiogenic situations were tested by three different tests: open field, elevated plus-maze and novel object exploration test. As expected, 2-month-old individuals displayed a low level of freezing and a high exploration of aversive places and of a novel object. This risk-taking profile may enable young individuals to disperse efficiently. At 6 months old, although no change was found in males, females already showed signs of anxiety, indicating a sex difference in anxiety development in this species. When 12 months old, both sexes were risk-averse and displayed strong emotional responses. We thus conclude that ageing processes lead to an increase in anxiety in the mound-building mouse. Against all expectations, 24-month-old females and males showed a similar profile to 2-month-old individuals revealing that ageing and anxiety may present a U-shaped relationship. Because the relationship between ageing and anxiety may be nonlinear, a multiple-point approach might be systematically applied in ageing research.

AB Parental care is common in vertebrates, but less common in invertebrates, tending to occur in species that have relatively few young that can be protected from the physical or biotic environment. Individuals will be selected to trade off current and future reproductive success, leading to adaptive changes in brood care behaviour in response to predation risk. Investment in brood care may also be reduced as a result of costs of parasitic infection. Here we investigated the impact of predator cues and of parasite infection on brood care behaviour in amphipod crustaceans. We found no evidence for any reduction in brooding behaviour or reproductive success in response to infection by vertically transmitted microsporidian parasites. This may reflect the mechanism of parasite transmission, as vertically transmitted parasites rely on host reproduction to pass to the next generation. However, we found evidence for changes in brood care behaviour in response to increased risk of predation. Larger Crangonyx pseudogracilis females, with higher oxygen demands for their broods, showed a reduction in active brood care when exposed to predator cues. Additionally, Gammarus duebeni were found to reduce brooding duration in response to predator cues; we suggest that this earlier release of juveniles is likely to enhance survival of the brood, by spreading the risk of predation on juveniles.

AB This paper presents an alternative approach to studying signaller-receiver interactions. The conventional approach focuses on signal reliability; instead, we focus on receivers' willingness to tolerate imperfect reliability (receiver tolerance). Both approaches aim to explain what promotes and maintains communication. We define receiver tolerance as following a signal in the face of reduced reliability. We used experimental signalling games with blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata, subjects to demonstrate whether uncertain environments generate receiver tolerance for imperfect reliability. Many models of signalling games ignore environmental certainty or predictability, but this certainty is a key part of understanding receiver tolerance. For example, low environmental certainty should increase tolerance since receivers are more uncertain about which action to take. We also tested whether signallers exploit receiver tolerance by signalling dishonestly. The results show that receivers are more likely to heed signals when environments are uncertain. Moreover, signallers are sensitive to this receiver tolerance and, when signallers and receivers have opposing material interests, low environmental certainty promotes dishonest signalling and high certainty restricts it. Our results highlight the usefulness of an approach emphasizing receiver tolerance and demonstrate the critical importance of environmental certainty for signaller-receiver interactions.

AB Many birds show biparental incubation patterns in which male and female parents alternate their incubation bouts. We constructed prospective sealed bid (rather than negotiation) models of optimal (both cooperative and ESS) incubation bout lengths for each sex ('the incubation game') to examine whether the asymmetry in incubation efficiency can generate sex biases in incubation bout lengths. This model may apply generally when two individuals cooperate in alternating bouts to complete a task requiring a fixed total effort, but where one individual accomplishes more per unit time spent on the task than the other, and where bout lengths can be varied strategically. Both the cooperative (suitable for true monogamy) and the (more realistic) ESS versions predict that the less efficient partner should perform shorter bouts, although the ESS model predicts that both partners should perform shorter bouts than the cooperative model. We explored these predictions with field data on house sparrow, Passer domesticus, incubation. Previous work has shown that male bouts are typically shorter than female bouts. Here, we tested the model's prediction that such an asymmetry in parental care may result from differences in the relative competence of each sex at transferring heat during incubation. Females were notably more efficient incubators: they warmed the nest more than males during the first 4 min of their bouts, increased mean nest temperatures more per degree starting temperature and, by the end of their bouts, they had elevated both final nest temperature and mean nest temperature more per minute than males. Thus, even in the absence of sex differences in parentage, asymmetries in parental effectiveness can promote disparities between the sexes in cooperative investment. We discuss the implications for sexual conflict of parental asymmetries in the value of care. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Males generally outperform females in spatial tasks. This difference in spatial performance may reflect differences in cue preference because males often use both spatial cues 9distance and direction) and feature cues, whereas females prefer to use feature cues. However, studies in birds are few and results are conflicting. As wild male rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, prefer to use spatial cues to relocate a rewarded flower, in the present study we tested free-flying wild female hummingbirds of three different species 9rufous, white-eared, Hylocharis leucotis, and magnificent hummingbird, Eugenes fulgens) and males of one species 9white-eared) for their cue preference in the same task in which rufous males have been tested previously. Birds were allowed to feed once from a four-flower array in which only one flower was rewarded. When the birds returned, the colour and the spatial cue designating the rewarded flower had been dissociated. Although we had expected females to visit the flower of the correct colour 9feature cue) first, during the test phase most of the birds 9males and females) went to the correct spatial location 9spatial cue). It appears, then, that preference for spatial cues is not specific to males and it seems more likely to depend on the relevance or value of a cue to the solution of the task.

AB Ecological factors like demography can shape competition for mates, altering the strength and direction of sexual selection via changes in courtship behaviour, choosiness and postcopulatory mechanisms. Demography is also quite dynamic, frequently changing within the life span of individual organisms. In this paper, I ask whether and how female experience with mate availability and female age interact to influence both male and female mating decisions. I housed female Acheta domesticus crickets individually at low or high density throughout their adult lives in screen cages that allowed low- and high-density crickets acoustic, visual and tactile contact with conspecifics. I assessed mating behaviour in courtship trials with naive (untreated) males at two time points, early and late in life. Females that experienced high and low density initiated courtship by approaching and contacting males more frequently than did females that were housed in isolation. Older females also initiated courtship more often than young females. Female mating decisions (whether the female mounted the male and her latency to mount), however, did not depend on experience with population density, age, or their interaction, perhaps because females remained virgin throughout the experiment. Naive males were able to assess females' prior experience, perhaps through variation in how frequently females approached them, and preferentially courted females that experienced high density. They did not differentially court females depending on their age or the interaction of age and population density. My results suggest that males assess mate competition using sociosexual cues derived from potential mates and adjust their behaviour accordingly.

AB How do bees employ multiple visual cues for homing? They could either combine the available cues using a view-based computational mechanism or pick one cue. We tested these strategies by training honeybees, Apis mellifera carnica, and bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, to locate food in one of the four corners of a box-shaped flight arena, providing multiple and also ambiguous cues. In tests, bees confused the diagonally opposite corners, which looked the same from the inside of the box owing to its rectangular shape and because these corners carried the same local colour cues. These 'rotational errors' indicate that the bees did not use compass information inferred from the geomagnetic field under our experimental conditions. When we then swapped cues between corners, bees preferred corners that had local cues similar to the trained corner, even when the geometric relations were incorrect. Apparently, they relied on views, a finding that we corroborated by computer simulations in which we assumed that bees try to match a memorized view of the goal location with the current view when they return to the box. However, when extra visual cues outside the box were provided, bees were able to resolve the ambiguity and locate the correct corner. We show that this performance cannot be explained by view matching from inside the box. Indeed, the bees adapted their behaviour and actively acquired information by leaving the arena and flying towards the cues outside the box. From there they re-entered the arena at the correct corner, now ignoring local cues that previously dominated their choices. All individuals of both species came up with this new behavioural strategy for solving the problem provided by the local ambiguity within the box. Thus both species seemed to be solving the ambiguous task by using their route memory, which is always available during their natural foraging behaviour.

AB In birds and mammals, juvenile and adult foragers are often found apart from each other. In this study, we found this is also true for red knots, Calidris canutus canutus, wintering on the intertidal flats of Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania. Not only did juveniles feed separately from adults, they also fed at places where they were more vulnerable to predation by large falcons. That the dangerous areas used by juveniles were no better feeding areas led us to reject the food-safety trade-off that explained age-related distribution differences in many earlier studies. Instead, juveniles were displaced by adults in dyadic interactions which suggests that they suffered from interference from adults. Juveniles retreated to feeding areas that were more dangerous and yielded lower intake rates, and coped by extending foraging time by using higher, nearshore intertidal areas that were exposed for longer. When disturbed by predators in these nearshore areas, juveniles continued feeding whereas adults left. Thus, rather than compensating for increased predation danger by higher intake rates, on the Banc d'Arguin red knot juveniles foraged for longer.

AB In both humans and apes, the production of communicative gestures appears to be controlled by cerebral structures in the left hemisphere that would be distinct from those involved in noncommunicative actions. Whether communicative gestures also rely on specific lateralized systems in monkeys remains unclear. We assessed manual laterality for requesting gestures, i.e. pointing, and for grasping actions in two species of Old World monkeys, Campbell's monkeys, Cercopithecus campbelli, and red-capped mangabeys, Cercocebus torquatus, using the Bishop QHP task. The food items were placed at five positions in front of the monkeys and they were located at out-of-reach, far or close distance from the monkeys, to induce pointing gestures and grasping actions requiring full or low arm extensions, respectively. The mangabeys that exhibited the greatest skills for pointing referentially were more right-handed for pointing gestures than for grasping actions. We propose that in Old World monkeys, as in humans and apes, the production of intentional and referential gestures may rely on the activation of specific regions of the left hemisphere specialized in the processing of communicative signals. Subjects from both species preferred to use the hand that was closest to the item for grasping actions requiring low arm extension whereas they used the contralateral hand for grasping actions requiring full arm extension and pointing gestures. These results are discussed in relation to hypotheses on postural control and arboreality. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aggression plays an important role in survival and reproduction. It can be measured using mirror and dyadic tests, but there is some debate about whether interactions with a mirror image and with a real opponent measure the same aspects of aggressiveness. Variation in aggressiveness among individuals has been linked to behavioural lateralization. Lateralization, the preference for one side of the body over the other, has been reported widely in vertebrates. During aggression, individuals may use their right or left eye to view their opponent, but results vary among vertebrates; while some show a left-eye preference, others show a right-eye preference, with some individuals being more strongly lateralized than others within a population. In this study, we determined whether adult male and female zebrafish, Danio rerio, showed similar levels of aggression towards a mirror image as towards an opponent, and whether there were differences in eye use when the fish displayed aggressive behaviours. We found no difference in the rate of aggression shown towards a mirror image and an opponent, indicating that both tests are representative of the same measure. Furthermore, the sex of the zebrafish and the aggression test they experienced had a significant effect on eye use. Eye use by the females when viewing their opponent was similar to that of the males when they viewed an image and an opponent, but males used their left eye more.

AB Phenotypic plasticity in decision making should be selected for when reliable information on current conditions is available. When current information is unreliable, however, selection should favour unresponsive behavioural phenotypes, which might lead to the emergence of personalities. We tested the hypothesis that personality will affect decision making when information is unreliable, but not when it is reliable. We measured two personality traits, boldness and anxiety, in 55 wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, by quantifying responses to a novel food and a mild threat, respectively, in repeated field experiments. To assess decision making under different information reliabilities, we recorded foraging decisions in two contexts. We followed the baboons as they foraged naturally with reliable information about their environment (>8900 decisions) and, to manipulate information reliability experimentally, we performed a large-scale in situ foraging experiment during which we provided the study troops with access to experimental food patches (>10 000 decisions). Importantly, the baboons could not see the food in the experimental patches until close inspection of them, and thus had unreliable information about patch quality. We found plastic foraging decisions in the presence of reliable cues, but personality-dependent decisions in the absence of such cues. Specifically, bold individuals were more likely to produce, and shy individuals scrounge, in the experimental arena but there was no effect of personality on foraging decisions under natural foraging conditions. Our results clarify the importance of information reliability in the evolution of personality and plasticity. These findings also contribute to our understanding of how individuals, and thus populations, might respond to environmental change in the future.

AB Humans are commonly concerned with social status, and often cooperate in the presence of others in an attempt to signal their potential as a social or reproductive partner. Whether or not cooperation might signal prestige in nonhuman animals is seldom tested and poorly understood. We investigated whether male chestnut-crowned babblers, Pomatostomus ruficeps, that are unrelated to the breeding female, and hence most likely to benefit from signalling their parenting ability to her, strategically adjust their actual or perceived contributions to nestling rearing. Male contributions to nestling rearing were unaffected by either their reproductive status (breeder versus nonbreeder) or, in the case of nonbreeding helpers, their relatedness to the breeding female (related versus unrelated). In addition, we found little support for the possibility that current breeders or unrelated helpers adjusted their nestling provisioning rates in the presence of actual or potential reproductive competition in the group, at least in a manner consistent with the social prestige hypothesis. Finally, we found no evidence to suggest that unrelated (breeding or nonbreeding) males attempted to increase the breeding female's perception of their provisioning behaviour by timing their feeds to her presence. We conclude that, in chestnut-crowned babblers, patterns of male provisioning behaviour are not obviously consistent with advertising their parenting ability, and that social prestige is likely to have limited power in explaining male care in this system.

AB Hierarchical signalling may be a common adaptation for aggressive signalling. In this strategy an animal progresses through a series of discretely different signals of escalating level of threat before eventually proceeding to physical aggression. A model of such hierarchical aggressive signalling has been proposed for song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, in which a core part of the sequence is: song type match -> soft song -> attack. The model predicts that song type matching is a strong predictor of soft song, but only a weak predictor of attack. We used a two-part playback design to test these predictions, with an initial edge playback from just off the subject's territory using a song type that the subject could match, followed by a centre playback from a speaker placed well within the territory. Each male was tested twice with this design. We found that matching the edge playback did not predict soft song production at the centre. A second strong threat, wing waving, was actually negatively associated with matching. Matching the edge playback also was not associated with physical measures of aggression such as approach and latency to approach. Thus, this particular model of hierarchical aggressive signalling was not supported for our study population. Song type matching in our study population may have some function not associated with aggressive signalling to the matched individual, or no function at all.

AB Investigations carried out in the 1950s on the use of polarized light by sandhoppers as a compass reference did not reach convincing results. Therefore, polarized light compass orientation in the sandhopper Talitrus saltator seems to be a traditional attribute more than a solid demonstration. Our tests carried out under artificial and natural conditions of illumination using different polarizing and neutral density (grey) filters demonstrated that T. saltator perceives polarized light; however, it does not use the skylight polarized light as a cue for menotactic orientation. However, since the sky spectral and luminance gradients were not completely eliminated in our tests, a possible influence of these two celestial factors of orientation could still be present. Therefore, we conclude that this species, in this experimental paradigm at least, does not use a polarized light compass mechanism, despite a very good sun compass system of orientation.

AB Acoustic noise has the potential to cause stress, to distract and to mask important sounds, and thus to affect behaviour. Human activities have added considerable noise to both terrestrial and aquatic habitats, and there is growing evidence that anthropogenic noise affects communication and movement patterns in a variety of species. However, there has been relatively little work considering the effect on behaviours that are fundamental to survival, and thus have direct fitness consequences. We conducted a series of controlled tank-based experiments to consider how playback of ship noise, the most common source of underwater noise, affects foraging and antipredator behaviour in the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. Ship noise playback was more likely than ambient-noise playback to disrupt feeding, although crabs experiencing the two sound treatments did not differ in their likelihood of, or speed at, finding a food source in the first place. While crabs exposed to ship noise playback were just as likely as ambient-noise controls to detect and respond to a simulated predatory attack, they were slower to retreat to shelter. Ship noise playback also resulted in crabs that had been turned on their backs righting themselves faster than those experiencing ambient-noise playback; remaining immobile may reduce the likelihood of further predatory attention. Our findings therefore suggest that anthropogenic noise has the potential to increase the risks of starvation and predation, and showcases that the behaviour of invertebrates, and not just vertebrates, is susceptible to the impact of this pervasive global pollutant.

AB Sandra Vehrencamp's (1983) Animal Behaviour paper provided a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding reproductive partitioning within animal societies by focusing on the limits to reproductive competition over reproductive shares among group members. The central idea is that the degree of inequity in reproductive shares is limited by the option of group members to leave the group and reproduce elsewhere. This central idea has been retained in extensions of her model, and unification of these extensions with rival models has been developed to accommodate new data and alternative starting assumptions. Although some criticism has been directed towards skew theory, as presented both in the original Vehrencamp model and in subsequent syntheses, we show that many of these criticisms have been misguided. Synthetic skew theory, with Vehrencamp's model as its cornerstone, stands as our most general and complete, yet still largely untested, framework for understanding the evolutionary forces shaping the evolution of reproductive partitioning in animal societies.

AB While human-induced rapid environmental changes are putting many organisms at risk of extinction, others are doing better than ever. This raises the question of why organisms differ in their tolerance to environmental alterations. Here, we ask whether and how behavioural adjustments assist animals in dealing with the urbanization process, one of the primary causes of biodiversity loss and biotic homogenization. Based on a literature review, we present both theoretical and empirical arguments to show that behavioural adjustments to urban habitats are widespread and that they may potentially be important in facilitating resource use, avoiding disturbances and enhancing communication. While a growing number of studies report behavioural differences between urban and nonurban animals, very few studies directly address the underlying mechanisms. In some cases, the changes in behaviour occur very rapidly and involve learning, and hence can be attributed to behavioural plasticity. In other cases, however, it cannot be ruled out that behavioural differences between urban and nonurban animals result from natural selection or nonrandom sorting of individuals by behavioural traits that affect dispersal, habitat selection or establishment. Because the urbanization process is expected to continue to threaten biodiversity in the near future, there is some urgency to improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which behaviour helps animals to cope with such environmental alterations.

AB The elaborate design of animal signals is challenging to explain. In 1991, Guilford and Dawkins published their iconic paper on 'receiver psychology' in Animal Behaviour (42, 1-14), and proposed that the ways in which animals detect, discriminate and learn about relevant stimuli in their environment would have a significant influence on signal evolution. In this essay, I review the impact of this paper on the study of animal communication, and in particular how highlighting the tactical design of animal signals has been important in changing the way in which we think about and study animal signals. Although there has been some recent criticism of receiver psychology, I think it continues to be a powerful approach that generates exciting areas for future research.

AB Mating systems in animal societies contain both social and genetic components. Deviations between these components may have important ramifications for our understanding of the evolution of reproductive strategies and their ecological correlates. However, although there is ample evidence for discrepancies between genetically assigned paternities and social associations in birds, relatively few studies have documented such differences in mammals. Moreover, few studies have addressed how deviations between social mating associations and mating activities influence male and female resource utilization patterns. The aardwolf, Proteles cristatus, is a socially monogamous hyaenid that exhibits polygamous mating behaviour. We show that temporal patterns in aardwolf den use, an important resource for protecting offspring, relate to predictions from polygamous mating rather than social monogamy. Males used more dens, changed dens more frequently and stayed in dens for shorter periods than females during both wet and dry seasons. We suggest that lower male den fidelity is caused by males trying to maximize female encounters and to monitor female activity, or that it is a nonadaptive behaviour related to elevated androgen levels. Our results did not point to territorial defence or space use optimization causing the observed sex differences, as we found no sex or seasonal differences in the spatial patterns of utilized dens. We suggest that aardwolves may have been ecologically constrained to exhibit social monogamy but that polygamous mating is maintained through extrapair copulations. We recommend that the evolutionary stability of these two conflicting strategies of male fitness maximization is further investigated. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Context can have a powerful influence on decision-making strategies in humans. In particular, people sometimes shift their economic preferences depending on the broader social context, such as the presence of potential competitors or mating partners. Despite the important role of competition in primate conspecific interactions, as well as evidence that competitive social contexts impact primates' social cognitive skills, there has been little study of how social context influences the strategies that nonhumans show when making decisions about the value of resources. Here we investigate the impact of social context on preferences for risk (variability in payoffs) in our two closest phylogenetic relatives, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and bonobos, Pan paniscus. In a first study, we examine the impact of competition on patterns of risky choice. In a second study, we examine whether a positive play context affects risky choices. We find that (1) apes are more likely to choose the risky option when making decisions in a competitive context; and (2) the play context did not influence their risk preferences. Overall these results suggest that some types of social contexts can shift patterns of decision making in nonhuman apes, much like in humans. Comparative studies of chimpanzees and bonobos can therefore help illuminate the evolutionary processes shaping human economic behaviour. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Aquatic organisms are exposed to highly variable light environments, which can affect the efficacy of colour patterns that are used for communication or camouflage. Specifically, dissolved organic matter that is common in turbid freshwater habitats tends to absorb short wavelength light causing a shift towards environments that are rich in long wavelengths (orange/red). We investigated how changes in the intensity and wavelength of light affect colour pattern expression and shoaling behaviour in a colourful freshwater fish, the western rainbowfish, Melanotaenia australis. We used light filters to simulate environments rich in organic matter (yellow filters: long wavelength dominated, reduced luminance), habitats with full-spectrum lighting but with reduced luminance (neutral-density filters) and a control in which no changes in the light environment occurred (no filters). We measured changes in the area and brightness of colour patterns using digital photography and spectrometry and we evaluated the effect of lighting on fish social (shoaling) behaviour. Rainbowfish in the dissolved organic matter treatment showed an increase in the area and brightness of their colour patterns and individuals shoaled further apart than those in the control group. The increased brightness of red colours in environments rich in organic matter could act to enhance colour pattern conspicuousness, allowing individuals to maintain communication in altered visual environments. However, an understanding of the species' visual system is required to determine levels of contrast of the colour patterns with respect to variable background environments.

AB Behavioural innovation is believed to be an important way in which animals devise solutions to new problems, yet the factors underpinning individual differences in innovation remain unclear. Here, we asked how motivational states and emotional responses to novelty shape the innovation process with a series of experiments in common mynas, Sturnus tristis. To this aim, we measured experimentally the willingness of adult individuals to eat a new food (consumer innovation) and to develop a new foraging technique (motor innovation), as well as their degree of neophobia, exploration, shyness, motivation and activity levels. Common mynas showed some propensity for consumer and motor innovations, with 55% and 22% of individuals solving the respective tasks. Moreover, individuals that solved the task significantly decreased their latency to solve it subsequently, indicating that learning had occurred. Differences in problem-solving performance were not related to sex, and individuals that solved the consumer task did not solve the motor innovation task faster. The likelihood of solving the motor task increased with propensity of the individual to explore the test apparatus, suggesting that the task was solved by trial and error. Exploration increased with the motivation to feed and decreased with the degree of neophobia. Thus, while differences in innovation propensity between individuals may result from cognitive differences, our results highlight that they may also reflect particular motivational states or emotional responses of individuals to novel situations. 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals living in groups will profit most from sociality if they coordinate the timing and nature of their activities. Self-organizing mechanisms can underlie coordination in large animal groups such as insect colonies or fish schools, but to what degree these mechanisms operate in socially complex species that live in small stable groups is not well known. We therefore examined the collective departure of wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, from their sleeping sites. First, in line with previous observations, the departure process appeared to be coordinated through the cue of individuals 'moving off', with no role for specific vocal or visual signalling. Second, we employed network analyses to explore how interindividual relationships influenced departure patterns, and found that a local rule, to follow the movements of those baboons with whom they shared a close social affiliation, determined when the baboon group departed. Finally, using an agent-based model, we were able to simulate mathematically the observed patterns of collective movements based upon the emergent rule that we identified. Our study adds weight to the idea that social complexity does not necessitate cognitive complexity in the decision-making process, consistent with heuristic decision-making perspectives studied by cognitive psychologists and researchers studying self-organization in biological systems.

AB Building a complete model of animal behaviour requires knowing both the internal and external factors that influence behaviour. As recent genomic and neural studies begin to establish the northern swordtail, Xiphophorus nigrensis, as a model for proximate explorations of female mate preference, it is important to recognize the complexity of other factors that can drive variation in female preference. In this study, we determined how different experiential and social factors correlate with interindividual variation in female mate preference: female body size, sexual experience and male behavioural displays. We found a significant positive correlation between female size and female preference for large males, as well as a significant relationship between male activity and female preference. We also demonstrate that copulating at least once may be sufficient to increase preference for large males. Our identification of these relationships emphasizes the multiple and diverse types of mechanisms that can influence variation in female mate preference and encourage their consideration in future studies when trying to assess why and how females choose males.

AB We investigated which mechanisms of learning about foraging from the mother are important in piglets, Sus scrofa. The first experiment compared observation of the sow versus participation during eating. Piglet pairs could observe (observation piglets) or participate (participation piglets) with the sow while she was eating a flavoured feed in a test room for 10 min/day for 5 days. Piglet pairs that could eat food without cues from the sow and control piglets that had neither cues nor food were also exposed to the test room with their sow present but unable to eat. Piglets were tested over 3 days for 90 min/day and could choose between the sow's food and another flavoured food. Observation and participation piglets showed shorter latencies to eat and higher consumption of, and preference for, the flavour eaten by the sow than control and no-cue piglets. The second experiment compared local versus stimulus enhancement. Piglets observed the sow eating a flavoured feed from one of two feeders on different sides of the room for 10 min/day for 5 days. During the test phase there was a match or mismatch between location and the flavoured food eaten by the sow. Match piglets showed more behaviour towards, and a higher consumption from, the feeder where the sow was eating, while this was not true for mismatch piglets, suggesting a role of both local and stimulus enhancement. Observation, participation, local and stimulus enhancement thus all seem important for piglets to learn from the sow. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural syndromes (correlations between suites of behavioural traits) have been documented in a wide range of animals and are important for the understanding of evolution and ecology. Previous research has focused primarily on behavioural syndromes composed of individual animals: we investigated behavioural syndromes at the individual, caste and colony levels in Myrmica ants. We first related an individual's position on a behavioural syndrome (i.e. its behavioural phenotype) to the role it took within the colony (i.e. its caste). At an individual level, behavioural phenotype was strongly related to task allocation: individuals from the patroller caste were bolder, more aggressive and more active than individuals from both the foraging-recruit and brood-carer castes, which did not differ from each other. Second, the patroller caste exhibited a boldness-aggression syndrome that was not present in brood carers. Finally, at a colony level, sociability was correlated with boldness. Colonies containing individuals that spent more time interacting with one another were also composed of individuals that responded boldly to an introduced alarm stimulus. Furthermore, the mean behavioural scores of the patroller and brood-carer castes were positively correlated in many key behaviours, including activity level, aggression, sociability and response to an alarm, which suggests that colonies were internally concordant (behaviourally consistent across castes). Our results show conclusively that ants exhibit behavioural syndromes not only at the individual level but also at the caste and colony levels. This raises the intriguing possibility that other highly social animal groups may similarly exhibit group-level behavioural syndromes. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The study of avian signalling systems is an important avenue for research on animal communication. More specifically, the use of plumage traits to signal status or fighting ability has been extensively investigated for over 30 years. Yet, little is known about how strong and general the relationship between dominance and plumage traits is across different bird species. We conducted meta-analysis and metaregression analysis to investigate the relationship between dominance and plumage characteristics, using published literature on avian species. Our analyses tested possible moderators of this relationship, such as plumage trait and plumage colour, plumage manipulation, study location, type of dominance interaction, the use of model birds, type of dominance assessment and dominance context (breeding or nonbreeding). Our results revealed a significant effect size for the association between dominance and plumage. We found that the relationship between dominance and plumage was significantly influenced by the dominance assessment method used in the source study (direct or indirect). Furthermore, our analyses provide evidence that the role of plumage signalling may be similarly important during the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. We conclude that plumage signalling is a ubiquitous form of communicating status or fighting ability across bird species with different plumage types.

AB Social animals may develop behavioural strategies that are based on individualized relationships among members. In these cases, there might be selection pressures for the development of identity signals and mechanisms that allow discrimination and recognition of particular individuals. Female sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, live in long-term, stable social units. Differential interactions among unit members suggest the need for an individual discrimination system. Sperm whales produce stereotyped series of click sounds called codas, which are thought to be used for communication. Although codas were initially proposed as individual signatures, later studies did not support this hypothesis. Using linear discriminant functions and Mantel tests, we tested variation within coda types as a means for individual identification, using recordings where codas were assigned to individual whales. While most coda types showed no indication of individual-specific information, individual differences that were robust to variation among recording days were found in the 5 Regular coda type. Differences in individual-specific information between coda types suggest that different coda types may have distinct functions. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mixed-species flocks result from coevolved relationships between participants: interspecific gregariousness that varies in strength in different species pairs or groups. Such interspecific associations of birds are a characteristic of most avian communities, observed in diverse habitats from forests to grasslands and from estuaries to the open ocean, both at high latitudes and in the tropics. We explore the consequences of mixed-species flocks in shaping the selection environment and discuss whether the participants in flocks should be identified as niche constructors. As a result of the decision to associate with other species, a bird alters its relationship with competitors, potentially gains access to resources, becomes safer from predators and may change microhabitat use. The recurrent patterns in the behaviour of disparate unrelated species active in mixed-species flocks have led investigators to conclude that similar selection pressures have shaped their behaviour. However mixed-species flocks are variable in their characteristics, the birds active in them are diverse in form and behaviour, and the selection pressures that have shaped their propensity to join mixed-species flocks must be various. In forming mixed-species flocks, species with specialized roles at the centre of flocks are creating a complex social environment that represents an important biotic selection force shaping their own ecology and behaviour, and that of other species within the avian community. In this review, we consider how the spectrum of interspecific relationships in mixed-species flocks makes them an interesting focus for further studies of niche construction by relocation.

AB The evolution of female ornaments in species with a female-biased operational sex ratio (OSR) and intense female competition is well understood. In contrast, the adaptive value of female ornaments in species with a male-biased OSR and male competition remains largely unresolved. Mutual mate choice is one proposed explanation for the evolution of ornaments expressed in both males and females, a hypothesis supported by the increasing empirical evidence of mutual mate choice in species with a male-biased OSR. None the less, the evolution of female ornaments remains constrained, as investment in ornaments may detract from any direct benefits being signalled to males and females may fail to reap benefits sufficient to outweigh the costs of signalling. We used phenotypic engineering (i.e. manipulation of ornament size) to ask whether both sexes show a preference for sexually homologous ornaments in the polygynous mosquito, Sabethes cyaneus. We found a directional male preference for ornamented females, but no female preference for ornamented males. There was no evidence of assortative mating based on ornament size. We discuss these results within the framework of current sexual selection theory, addressing implications for both the evolution of male mate choice and the evolution of female ornaments.

AB Collective decision making is important for social insects living in highly organized societies. However, often only a few individuals acquire information relevant for the entire colony. In the slave-making ant Protomognathus americanus, single scouts search for colonies of their Temnothorax hosts, which are subsequently attacked by a group of raiding workers. Scouts and raiders risk being killed by host workers defending their colony. Considering both the raiding risk and the potential benefit, that is, host pupae that could be taken to serve as slaves after eclosion, scouts must decide whether or not a discovered host colony is worth attacking. We investigated the occurrence of slave raids, host colony assessment and the final decision making by P. americanus colonies during choice trials in the laboratory. We confronted slavemaker colonies with two host colonies of different demographic composition to analyse which host colony attributes are considered during the scouts' decision process. Slavemaker colonies showed increased raiding activities when the slave to slavemaker ratio inside the slavemaker colony was low. Slavemakers did not favour host colonies with more pupae, but preferentially attacked colonies with more workers. These represent riskier raiding targets, but as larger colonies usually contain more brood in the field, the increased benefit may necessitate fewer raids, decreasing the total risk during a raiding season. However, confronted with two host colonies that showed more distinct benefit to risk ratios, their decision shifted. Thus raiding behaviour and decision making in P. americanus are affected by a combination of external and internal stimuli. (c) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Traditionally, male signals have been thought to function in satisfying female choice by conveying meaningful information about a potential mate. However, the male signal, rather than merely providing raw material for female evaluation, may actively modulate a female's intrinsic preferences or decision-making capabilities in favour of a given male. We propose two broad mechanisms by which male signals could modulate female behaviour: (1) specific augmentation of sexual motivation or (2) heightened general arousal. Specifically, we investigated the ability of a generic male pheromone mix to elicit changes in general activity or affinity for different classes of stimuli in female terrestrial salamanders (Plethodon shermani). Attraction to male olfactory stimuli was significantly increased by pheromones, but attraction to visual stimuli and nonsexual olfactory stimuli remained unaffected, as did locomotor activity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sex pheromones activate specific behavioural subsystems associated with augmented sexual motivation. This pheromone action may still function within the context of information-transfer signalling, for example, if pheromones influence female choice by affecting (1) sensory processing of relevant stimuli, (2) the value assigned to a set of sexual stimuli, or (3) the criteria used to decide whether to mate.

AB Inbreeding avoidance mechanisms such as mate choice should be selected for when inbreeding produces fitness costs. Several studies, however, suggest that animals tolerate inbreeding despite its costs. We studied inbreeding avoidance in bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, on Ram Mountain, Alberta, Canada, a population with limited dispersal. We used a randomization procedure to simulate a mean inbreeding coefficient of lambs if mating was random every year, and compared these random mating scenarios with known pairings from 1996 to 2007. We considered three sets of candidate males: all males aged 2 years or more, only males known to reproduce, and all males but accounting for age differences in reproductive success. In all cases, mean cohort inbreeding coefficients did not differ from those expected under random mating. We found no evidence of avoidance of mating between close relatives (half-cousins and higher degrees of relatedness). Mate choice was possibly constrained by the generally high level of relatedness among individuals in the population. Selective pressures for inbreeding avoidance, however, may also be weak for this species because of sex-differential costs of inbreeding, limited opportunities of meeting close relatives and breeding migrations of males. The apparent lack of inbreeding avoidance has important implications for the conservation of small and isolated populations of bighorn sheep, where high levels of inbreeding should be expected.

AB To evaluate the use of spatial and temporal information in dictating quantitative search patterns, we investigated the male mate-searching behaviour of a braconid wasp, Alabagrus texanus. Specifically, we asked whether these individuals use recently acquired information when establishing their use of space during searching routines. Males find virgin females by patrolling the habitat for pheromone cues, with scramble competition following. To simulate emergences, we placed just-eclosed females in fine-meshed bags that permitted pheromones to disperse. Upon presentation, male swarms formed, reaching maximum numbers within the first few minutes. Males subsequently left the swarming site, and few revisited. Females were removed after 5 min and replaced by a second female. Male numbers remained low, but when the second female was then presented 15 m away, she attracted many males. Repeating the initial experiment with a hiatus of 30 min between first and second females, the second female attracted few males, but with a hiatus of 60 min between females, the second female attracted many males. There was no increase in the number of males that responded to a second female presented closer than 5 m from that of the first female. Wasp emergence patterns revealed that more than one female seldom eclosed within a diameter of 5 m on the same day. Thus, males show short-term memory of space and time that decreases their attention to sites that are unlikely to yield a mating. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Experience is known to influence female mating in a variety of vertebrate animals; however, the effects of experience on mate choice have been less well-studied in invertebrates. In a series of recent studies conducted on spiders, it was shown that females develop preferences for novel, artificially modified male phenotypes when exposed to them as juveniles. However, because Schizocosa wolf spiders are known to respond to multiple sensory cues in mate choice, concerns have been raised about the use of nail polish to modify male visual phenotypes. Here we attempted to repeat the earlier experiment, but address effects of chemical versus visual learning separately, using the wolf spider species Schizocosa rovneri. Results indicate that exposure to novel visual/chemical male phenotypes influenced adult female mate preference for visual and to some extent chemical phenotypes, but in this case, females avoided familiar male phenotypes and preferred those to which they had not been exposed. Our results suggest that female mate preferences may be based on more factors than previously recognized, and that experience may reinforce behavioural isolation of species by increasing avoidance of mating with visually or chemically distinct male phenotypes.

AB A great deal of variation is known to underlie the vocalizations of animals. Calls can for example vary between individuals or between social and behavioural contexts. Calls also have the potential to vary between groups. Many group-living animals are known to produce stereotyped group-specific calls and such group signatures are thought to play a role in territory defence or indeed mate choice. Group signatures are generally found in long-distance call variants that work to maintain contact between group members, sometimes referred to as 'contact calls'. Cooperatively breeding, territorial meerkats, Suricata suricatta, also use contact calls, potentially to maintain social organization during foraging. However, these contact calls are generally quieter than long-distance calls in other species, and better described as 'close calls'. We investigated whether these similar call types also possess group-specific signatures and whether any such variation is used by receivers. We recorded close calls from 71 individuals belonging to 10 meerkat groups. We found that such close calls indeed possessed group signatures, but that this underlying variation did not appear to be used by receivers, possibly because meerkats use other sensory systems to identify nongroup members. We stress the importance of conducting playback experiments when investigating group-specific vocal signatures and use our results as a basis for predicting which animals may rely on group information encoded within close calls.

AB Ink secretion of sea hares, Aplysia californica, is a mixture of ink from the ink gland and opaline from the opaline gland. Its defensive mechanisms against predatory spiny lobsters include deterrent compounds that are unpalatable and amino acids that stimulate appetitive responses (phagomimicry) or interfere with chemoreception (sensory disruption) by predators. The current study aimed to identify mechanisms whereby sea hares use ink secretion to defend against a fish predator, in this case the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum. We show that inking by live sea hares decreased the probability that wrasses strike sea hares. Ink protected sea hares by affecting two phases of feeding. First, an ink cloud between a wrasse and food decreased the probability that the wrasse captured the food. Second, if the wrasse captured food treated with ink, then that food was less likely to be accepted. In neither assay did opaline have a significant effect. Inactivating the olfactory sense of fish through nares occlusion eliminated the deterrent effect of ink on food capture but not the effect of ink on food acceptance, thus showing that olfaction mediates responses to deterrents during the capture phase of feeding and that nonolfactory chemical senses mediate responses to deterrents during the acceptance phase. These nonolfactory chemical senses may be intraoral senses, as fish did not reject pellets until after they were captured. Ink did not protect through phagomimicry, since neither ink nor opaline was accepted, despite the fact that mixtures containing the amino acid components of ink and opaline were accepted.

AB One of the big challenges for group-living animals is to find out who in a group has pertinent information (regarding food or predators) at any moment in time, because informed individuals may not be obviously recognizable to other group members. We found that individuals in human groups were capable of identifying those with information, and this identification increased group performance: the speed and accuracy of groups in reaching a target. Using video analysis we found how informed individuals might have been identified by other group members by means of inadvertent social cues (such as starting order, time spent following and group position). Furthermore, we were able to show that at least one of these cues, the group position of informed individuals, was indeed correlated with group performance. Our final experiment confirmed that leadership was even more efficient when the group members were given the identity of the leader. We discuss the effect of information status regarding the presence and identity of leaders on collective animal behaviour. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The intensity of a signal is crucial for animal communication because a high signal-to-noise ratio improves signal reception. However, variation in amplitude may also have signalling value. In songbirds, song amplitude varies considerably between males but little is known about the causes and consequences of this variation. One of the main functions of birdsong is mate attraction, but whether and how amplitude variation (beyond reception thresholds) affects female choice at all is poorly understood, as this parameter is notoriously difficult to measure in the field. However, levels of signal amplitude at the source and at the receiver's end can be reliably controlled under laboratory conditions. Here we addressed the question whether differences in male song amplitude may influence female choice. Song preferences of female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were tested in an operant conditioning task involving sets of four song stimuli, in each case derived from one original song. Within a set, stimuli differed in amplitude or in level of degradation but not in song phonology or syntax. We found that females preferred songs with higher sound pressure level within the tested range of naturally observed amplitude variation regardless of the two reverberation levels. As song preferences are highly predictive of mate choice in this species, our results suggest that female zebra finches may use song amplitude as a criterion in mate choice. This raises the question what information the naturally occurring variation in amplitude between males in this and other songbird species conveys about the singer.

AB This study tests predictions of the hypothesis of evolution of paternal care via sexual selection by using the Neotropical harvestman Pseudopucrolia sp. as the model organism. Females use natural cavities in roadside banks as nesting sites, which are defended by males against other males. Females leave the nests after oviposition, and all postzygotic parental care is accomplished by males, which protect the eggs and nymphs from predators. We provided artificial mud nests to individuals in the laboratory and conducted observations on the reproduction of the species. Male reproductive success was directly related to nest ownership time: the longer a male held a nest, the higher his chances of obtaining copulations. All males that succeeded in mating and obtaining one clutch eventually mated with additional females that added eggs to the clutch. Thus, desirable males were not limited to monogamy by paternal care. Experimental manipulations demonstrated that guarding males were more attractive to females than were nonguarding males and also that males guarded unrelated eggs. Finally, we found that females and nonguarding males spent more time foraging than guarding males. We use our data to contrast hypotheses on the origin and maintenance of paternal care and to provide a critical assessment of the hypothesis of the evolution of paternal care via sexual selection.

AB Signal design can reflect the sensory properties of receivers. The death adder, Acanthophis antarcticus, attracts prey by wriggling the distal portion of its tail (caudal luring). To understand the design of this deceptive signal, we explored perceptual processes in a representative prey species: the Jacky dragon, Amphibolurus muricatus. We used 3D animations of fast and slow death adder luring movements against different backgrounds, to test the hypothesis that caudal luring mimics salient aspects of invertebrate prey. Moving stimuli elicited predatory responses, especially against a conspicuous background. To identify putative models for caudal luring, we used an optic flow algorithm to extract velocity values from video sequences of 61 moving invertebrates caught in lizard territories, and compared these to the velocity values of death adder movements. Caudal lures had motion characteristics that matched common invertebrate prey speeds, each corresponding to a peak in a bimodal distribution. Subsequent video playback tests using animations of crickets showed that significantly more attacks were evoked by stimuli moving at common than at rare invertebrate speeds. Overall, these results suggest that biases in the nervous system of the receiver, originally selected for prey recognition, might have been exploited by the design of the caudal luring signal. We suggest that viewing caudal luring from this perspective, rather than thinking of it as aggressive mimicry per se, may help us understand the function and evolutionary origin of this behaviour.

AB Food limitation induces severe competition for obligate seed-feeding insect larvae that are unable to leave the seed selected by their mother. The number of eggs laid per seed and the number of larvae hatched from the eggs are important determinants of whether larval behaviour within the seed will be of the scramble or the contest type. In maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais, few adults emerge per seed regardless of the number of eggs laid, which may arise from scramble competition, if the optimum egg density (i.e. egg density leading to maximum total larval fitness) is low compared to the number of eggs laid per seed, or from contest competition due to direct interference among the larvae. The behavioural process and the ecological outcome of competition were assessed in two strains of the maize weevil. Neither strain showed a reduction in body mass with increased competition, and they had similar optimal egg densities (two eggs per seed). There was a hump in the larval fitness curve suggesting a scramble competition, but this conclusion is compromised because the optimum egg density was small (two eggs per seed). X-ray imaging of seeds was used to observe interactions of larvae within the seed and showed direct interference, with aggression among the larvae. This provides evidence of contest-like competition within seeds even when egg density was low. Hence, one should be cautious in inferring the underlying type of competitive behaviour from variables such as body mass and initial egg density per seed. Direct observation of behaviour is required to make such an inference. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In social mammals, grooming is used not only for hygienic purposes; it also serves social functions. We examined the grooming patterns of dominant males in groups of cooperatively breeding meerkats, Suricata suricatta, to test the hypothesis that the distribution of grooming reflects the value of social relationships. Grooming between dominant individuals was the most commonly observed interaction. Grooming by the dominant male was less common when the dominant female was in oestrus. Grooming between dominant males and subordinates was asymmetrical, with dominant males receiving more grooming and providing less grooming to subordinates. Because subordinate males defend the group against extragroup males, the dominant male was predicted to groom subordinate males more often than to groom subordinate females. Although the sex of a subordinate did not affect the probability of grooming occurring, dominant males groomed subordinate males for longer than they groomed subordinate females. The duration of grooming by a dominant male was longer in small groups than large groups, suggesting that grooming activity is constrained by time. In contrast, subordinates groomed dominant males for longer in larger groups, and as a result, the asymmetry of grooming exchanges was exaggerated in larger groups. This result is consistent with the biological market theory, which predicts that the value of subordinates is dependent on group size and that subordinates will alter grooming efforts accordingly. These results suggest that meerkat grooming serves several social functions, such as the maintenance of valuable and/or fitness-enhancing relationships.

AB Ectotherm antipredator behaviour might be strongly affected both by body temperature and size: when environmental temperatures do not favour maximal locomotor performance, large individuals may confront predators, whereas small animals may flee, simply because they have no other option. However, integration of body size and temperature effects is rarely approached in the study of antipredator behaviour in vertebrate ectotherms. In the present study we investigated whether temperature affects antipredator responses of tegu lizards, Tupinambis merianae, with distinct body sizes, testing the hypothesis that small tegus (juveniles) run away from predators regardless of the environmental temperature, because defensive aggression may not be an effective predator deterrent, whereas adults, which are larger, use aggressive defence at low temperatures, when running performance might be suboptimal. We recorded responses of juvenile (small) and adult (large) tegu lizards to a simulated predatory attack at five environmental temperatures in the laboratory. Most differences between the two size classes were observed at low temperatures: large tegus were more aggressive overall than were small tegus at all temperatures tested, but at lower temperatures, the small lizards often used escape responses whereas the large ones either adopted a defensive posture or remained inactive. These results provide strong evidence that body size and temperature affect the antipredator responses of vertebrate ectotherms. We discuss the complex and intricate network of evolutionary and ecological parameters that are likely to be involved in the evolution of such interactions.

AB Women's preferences for masculine characteristics in men's voices and men's preferences for feminine characteristics in women's voices are thought to reflect adaptations that identify high-quality (e.g. healthy) mates. Consistent with this proposal, we found that men had stronger preferences than women for women's voices with raised pitch (i.e. feminized female voices) and that women had stronger preferences than men for men's voices with lowered pitch (i.e. masculinized male voices). Importantly, however, no such opposite-sex bias was evident for attributions of dominance to voices with raised and lowered pitch; men's and women's voices with lowered pitch were perceived to be more dominant than those with raised pitch and these effects were equivalent for male and female listeners. Collectively, our findings suggest that preferences for voice pitch may function, at least in part, to identify high-quality mates and show that opposite-sex biases in preferences for voice pitch cannot be explained simply by greater general sensitivity to manipulated pitch in opposite-sex voices than in own-sex voices.

AB Mate location strategies vary between species. Among butterflies two strategies are recognized: 'patrolling' males spend their life on the wing searching for females and 'perching' males stay at a specific site waiting to intercept passing females. In the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria, two alternative male strategies have been described: dominant males adopt a perching strategy monopolizing large sunspots on the forest floor, and subdominant males adopt a patrolling strategy. However, comparative analyses have shown that body design differs between perching and patrolling species, hence constraining opportunity for within-species variation in mate location strategy. We tested whether males differ in their propensity to adopt perching or patrolling behaviour by recording time spent flying during 30 min when alone in a large cage with only one large sunspot and many smaller ones, and whether subdominant males adopt a patrolling strategy by allowing dyads of males to interact in the cage for 60 min and recording the same behaviours again. All males adopted perching behaviour when alone, and subdominant males in dyads spent only a short time in extended flights after losing contests over territory ownership, soon returning to a perching strategy and making the best of a bad job from the vantage point of a small sunspot. We argue that previous descriptions of subdominant male P. aegeria adopting a patrolling strategy are based on too short observation periods, and have mistaken males in temporary transit for males adopting patrolling behaviour.

AB Lunar cycles give rise to cues that can be recognized by animals, including changes in light intensity, geomagnetism and gravity. Many environmental variables affect reproductive timing in amphibians and we tested the hypothesis that lunar cycles provide one of the cues for amphibian breeding phenology. For several species of anurans, the number of individuals arriving, amplexed or spawning at breeding sites in Italy and the U. K. were recorded each day over several breeding seasons. Data on various aspects of reproductive phenology were also collated from the published literature, for several anuran and urodele species. Large arrival, amplexus and spawning events were more frequent around the full moon than the new moon in anurans, although the date that the first spawn was observed showed no lunar periodicity. Anurans could be responding directly to lunar light, or could have a lunar-synchronized endogenous cycle. First sightings and peak arrivals of urodeles occurred more frequently around new and full moons, but less frequently during the third quarter of the lunar cycle, while departure dates did not show lunar periodicity. Newts could be using gravitational and/or geomagnetic changes related to the lunar cycle to time their arrivals. Synchronization of reproduction in this way may function to maximize spawning success by ensuring the temporal and spatial proximity of breeding adults, or by reducing predation on individuals. Few studies of amphibian breeding phenology consider lunar phase and our results have important implications for the prediction of amphibian mass movements and conservation strategies.

AB We examined how short-term impacts of experimentally increased foraging effort by one parent reverberate around the family in a monomorphic seabird (little auk, Alle alle), and whether these effects depend on offspring sex. In many species, more effort is required to rear sons successfully than daughters. However, undernourishment may have stronger adverse consequences for male offspring, which could result in a lower fitness benefit of additional parental effort when rearing a son. We tested two alternative hypotheses concerning the responses of partners to handicapping parents via feather clipping: partners rearing a son are (1) more willing or able to compensate for the reduced contribution of their mate, or (2) less willing or able to compensate, compared to those rearing a daughter. Hypothesis 1 predicts that sons will be no more adversely affected than daughters, and the impact on parents will be greater when rearing a son. Hypothesis 2 predicts that sons will be more adversely affected than daughters, and parents raising a son less affected. Although experimental chicks of both sexes. edged in poorer condition than controls, sons attained higher mass and more rapid growth than daughters in both groups. Clipped parents lost a similar proportion of their initial mass regardless of chick sex, whereas partners of clipped birds lost more mass when rearing a son. These results support hypothesis 1: impacts of increased foraging effort by one parent were felt by offspring, regardless of their sex, and by the partners of manipulated birds, particularly when the offspring was male.

AB When nest fates are correlated among years, individuals may use information on the success of conspecifics (public information) to evaluate the relative quality of nest sites. In wood ducks, Aix sponsa, conspecific nest parasitism can reduce success at a nest site, especially at high nesting densities. Therefore, parasitism may influence the correlation of nest fates among years, as well as the quality and use of information. We examined the use of public information by wood ducks in four populations nesting in nestboxes placed at high (18-40 boxes/km) and low densities (5-9 boxes/km) along streams. Nest success was negatively related to density, but previous success did not consistently predict future success. Nests failed most frequently as a result of desertion, which was associated with nest parasitism. Nestbox use was higher for previously used boxes and at high-density sites. Clutch size, which we used as an index of parasitism, was higher in previously unsuccessful nests and was positively related to nestbox density. Thus, at high nestbox densities, nests that were abandoned, perhaps in response to parasitism, were also parasitized the following year and met with mixed success. Likewise, successful nest sites were not necessarily successful the following year. These findings might explain why wood ducks do not select nestboxes based on conspecific success. Contrary to results published for other cavity-nesting species, current success did not provide information about future success at sites with high densities of nestboxes.

AB Little is known about social roles of urine marking and mark investigation in interpack communication in canids beyond mate acquisition, or of the influence of gonadal hormones on interpack urinary communication. We studied the responses of male and female, intact (nonoestrous) and gonadectomized Labrador retrievers to urine from unfamiliar dogs of the same four reproductive categories. We compared two measures of subject social status within subjects' home groups and measured the effect of subject status on urine investigation duration. We also compared the responses of subjects to urine from familiar and unfamiliar dogs. All subjects showed high interest in unfamiliar urine samples, but differed in their preference for particular unfamiliar urine types. Intact males, intact females and spayed females investigated urine from intact males and females equally, whereas neutered males investigated urine from intact males longer than urine from intact females. Urine from intact males and females elicited longer investigation than did urine from gonadectomized sources. Males showed no difference in investigation of familiar and unfamiliar urine, whereas females showed a nonsignificant tendency to investigate urine from unfamiliar dogs longer than urine from groupmates. Low-status subjects investigated urine longer than high-status subjects. Sex, status and familiarity patterns suggest that males and females, both intact and gonadectomized, have strong interest in unfamiliar urine and investigate urine to assess unfamiliar conspecifics in multiple social contexts, including mate and threat assessment. These results also suggest that gonadal hormones may affect urine investigation patterns both by increasing sexually motivated urine investigation in males and by creating signals in urine that allow assessment of potentially risky conspecifics.

AB Drone congregations are a widespread phenomenon among stingless bee species. Such congregations can consist of more than 1000 individuals and persist for several days or even weeks. Because congregations often form directly outside of conspecific colonies, it has been hypothesized that the presence of a virgin queen inside the colony triggers the aggregation of the drones. Here we used drone congregations of the Neotropical stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana to test this hypothesis. We performed behavioural experiments where the drones of a given congregation could decide between a previously chosen colony and an unknown colony as the site of formation for a congregation. Our results show that drone congregations are not associated with a particular colony (or its content) but rather with specific sites at the test location. Thus, the content of a colony (e. g. the presence of a virgin queen) is unlikely to be the trigger for the formation of a congregation. Furthermore, we found that pheromonal markings were used for short-distance orientation of drones towards a given site. Choice experiments of individual drones in the laboratory showed that drones were attracted to groups of other drones, although they did not react to groups of workers. These results imply that once a given site is chosen by some drones, they will attract more drones via positive feedback from the visual presence and odours of increasing numbers of drones.

AB Obligate avian brood parasites lay their eggs in nests of other species, which thereafter provide all parental care. Brood parasites synchronize parasitism with host laying and remove or puncture host eggs to increase their reproductive success, but the benefits of these behaviours may depend on hosts characteristics such as body size. We experimentally analysed the effects of synchronization between parasitism and host laying and reduction in number of host eggs on hatching success and chick survival of shiny cowbirds, Molothrus bonariensis (50 g), in two common hosts that differ in body mass: chalk-browed mockingbirds, Mimus saturninus (75 g), and house wrens, Troglodytes aedon (13 g). We found no effect of synchronization of parasitism or of the number of host eggs removed on parasite hatching success in either host. However, survival of cowbird chicks in mockingbird nests was lower when cowbird chicks hatched after host chicks and when there was no removal of host eggs. In contrast, in wren nests, there was no effect of hatching asynchrony or egg removal on cowbird survival, but asymptotic weight was higher in nests without egg removal. In natural nests, the proportion of cowbird eggs laid during host laying was higher and the number of host eggs punctured per parasitic event was greater for mockingbirds than for wrens. These differences between hosts in the extent of synchronization between parasitism and host laying and the intensity of egg punctures suggest that shiny cowbirds may adaptively adjust these behaviours to host characteristics.

AB Vocal variation may be important in population divergence. We studied geographical variation in contact calls of parrots of the crimson rosella, Platycercus elegans, complex, which is characterized by striking geographical plumage coloration variation. This complex has long been considered a rare example of a ring species (where two divergent forms coexist in sympatry but are connected by a chain of intermediate populations forming a geographical ring). We tested whether contact call variation is consistent with the ring species hypothesis. We recorded calls throughout the ring, including several sites from the three main population groups forming the ring and interfaces between them. We analysed duration, peak frequency, fundamental frequency and frequency modulation. We found significant differences, particularly in fundamental frequency and frequency modulation, at multiple biogeographical scales ranging from local populations to subspecies level. Discriminant function analyses showed some populations could be reliably discriminated from call structure. However, our results provided little support for three key predictions of the ring species hypothesis: (1) calls of the terminal, most divergent forms were not significantly different in three of the four acoustic variables, and differences did not appear to be maintained in sympatry, (2) phenotypically/geographically intermediate populations were not characterized by intermediate calls, and (3) call variation was not concordant with geographical sequence around the ring from one terminal form to the other. Our results underscore the emerging view that the evolutionary histories and phenotypic variability of many long-held ring species may be inadequately described by the ring species hypothesis and require alternative explanations.

AB Recognition systems are involved in a range of evolutionary and biological processes, and animals use a variety of visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory cues to determine the status of others. The use of chemical cues is widespread, occurring among mammals, fish, reptiles and birds, but particularly among insects. Yet chemical cues may be influenced by diet and environment, and can change over time, potentially limiting their reliability as recognition cues. Nevertheless, they play a key role in colonymate recognition among social insects. We created colony isolates from large multinest colonies of weaver ants and asked (1) whether colony spectral profiles (determined using near-infrared spectroscopy) changed over time, (2) whether spectral profiles of colony isolates diverged from those of original colonies, and (3) whether the behaviour of original colonies towards colony isolates changed over time. Although we detected changes in the spectral pro. le of original colonies and colony isolates, they did not diverge significantly from each other. As far as we are aware, this is the first time that such parallel changes in colony odour have been observed. Aggression towards individuals from colony isolates did not increase, although levels of trophallaxis did. This demonstrates that colonymate recognition among weaver ants was unimpaired by temporal variation in recognition cues. We discuss the characteristics of weaver ants that might give rise to this system. We also discuss the implications for other organisms when, for example, ontogenetic changes in the expression of individual cues may hamper their usefulness as kin recognition cues.

AB The phenomenon of musth in male elephants involves increased sexual activity, heightened aggression and nearly continuous dribbling of pungent smelling urine. Urine chemistry during musth is altered, suggesting that urine may signal the musth status of the individual. Signalling musth remotely may benefit individuals if it reduces the likelihood of physical confrontation between males, which can lead to injury and even death. Few studies, however, have asked whether and how male elephants respond to urine of other males. We tested two predictions of the hypothesis that urine signals musth status to male conspecifics: (1) that male African elephants differentiate musth and nonmusth urine, and (2) that males differentiate between urine dribbled during early and late musth. The second prediction stems from the observation that males lose weight and presumably body condition during musth. We conducted two related bioassays with 26 captive nonmusth males ranging from 13 to 52 years of age. In each assay, subjects were simultaneously presented with three urine samples (nonmusth, early musth, late musth), each from a different donor male, and a control. We found that subjects differentiated between musth and nonmusth samples using their vomeronasal organ system, but did not discriminate between the samples using their main olfactory system. Males did not differentiate early from late musth. In addition, we found that subject contextual factors, specifically age, dominance status and social grouping, significantly predicted response. We discuss these results within the framework of male elephant longevity and social relationships and their importance to reproductive success.

AB In many bird species with biparental care for young in the nest, hungry chicks beg repeatedly and parents adjust their feeding rate to the call rate of young. Repetitive calling also occurs in fledglings and in some mammals where offspring follow provisioners. It is not yet clear whether, in mobile systems with dispersed young where adults cannot compare the vocal behaviour of all young simultaneously, the calls represent a signal of need. We investigated repetitive begging by cooperatively reared meerkat, Suricata suricatta, pups that foraged with the group. Pups produced two types of begging calls: repeat calls over long periods and high-pitched calls mainly confined to feeding events. Food-deprived pups stayed closer to feeders, and begged for longer and more intensely by calling at a higher rate. Hungry pups increased both the rate of repeat calls, which were given continually, and the number of high-pitched bouts, but adults increased their food allocation only in relation to the rate of repeat calls. Our study indicates that hunger may lead to several changes in vocal behaviour, only some of which may be used by adults to assess need. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mullerian mimicry is the mutualistic resemblance between two defended species, while Batesian mimicry is the parasitic resemblance between a palatable species (the mimic) and an unpalatable one (the model). These two kinds of mimicry are traditionally seen as extreme ends of a mimicry spectrum. For the range in between, it has been suggested that mimetic relations between unequally defended species could be parasitic, and this phenomenon has been referred to as quasi-Batesian mimicry. Where a mimetic relation is placed along the mimicry spectrum depends on the assumptions made about predator learning. We used a variant of the Rescorla-Wagner learning model for virtual predators to analyse the different possible components of the mimicry spectrum. Our model entails that the rate of associative learning is influenced by variation in the stimuli to be learned. Variable stimuli, that is, unequal defences, can increase the predator learning rate and thus lead to an increased level of mutualism in a mimetic relation. In our analysis, we made use of the concepts of super-Mullerian mimicry, where the benefit of mimicry is even greater than in traditional Mullerian mimicry, and quasi-Mullerian mimicry, where mimicry by a palatable mimic is mutualistic. We suggest that these types of mimicry should be included in the mimicry spectrum along with Mullerian, Batesian and quasi-Batesian mimicry.

AB Foraging individuals can benefit from recruiting conspecifics to food sites, but must balance potential benefits against increased competition. Foragers in fission-fusion societies may recruit others to food resources by calling and can reduce the relative cost of this behaviour by selectively recruiting preferred conspecifics. Observational studies of the brown-throated conure on the island of Bonaire showed that overflying groups were much more likely to settle in the area when a foraging group called to the overflying group. However, foraging groups did not call to every overflying group, and food abundance alone did not determine whether foraging groups would call. Playback experiments indicated that conures can respond preferentially to social partners. Observational and experimental data suggest that brown-throated conures may use loud contact calls selectively to recruit conspecifics to currently available foraging sites.

AB Alarm calls facilitate some antipredatory benefits of group living but may endanger the caller by attracting the predator's attention. A number of hypotheses invoking kin selection and individual selection have been proposed to explain how such behaviour could evolve. This study tests eight hypotheses for alarm call evolution by examining the responses of tufted capuchin monkeys to models of felids, perched raptors and vipers. Specifically, this study examines: (1) differences between individuals in their propensity to call in response to different threat types, (2) whether there is an audience effect for alarm calling and (3) the response of conspecifics to alarms. Results indicate that the benefits likely to be afforded to the caller vary with stimulus type. Alarm calling in response to felids is most likely selfish, with calls apparently directed towards both the predator and potential conspecific mobbers. Alarm calling in response to vipers attracts additional mobbers as well, but also appears to be driven by kin selection in the case of males and parental care benefits in the case of females. Alarm responses to perched raptors are rare, but seem to be selfish, with callers benefiting by recruiting additional mobbers. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB During a mating season, individuals encounter potential mates that have varied copulatory experiences. Such experience may influence the likelihood and nature of subsequent reproductive behaviour and sperm release within a female/male dyad. We examined the influence of an individual's sexual experience on its subsequent mating activities and that of a potential partner in a cobweb spider, Nesticodes rufipes. Our results suggest that an individual's prior sexual experience influenced its own subsequent motivation, but had little effect on that of the potential partner. For females, their prior experience decreased receptivity and increased aggressiveness towards the second male, while having little effect on the subsequent male's motivation (i.e. approach). Specific aspects of a female's initial mating experience (i.e. plug formation) did however influence the nature of subsequent copulation, which in turn influenced sperm release. For males, their prior experience decreased the latency to approach the female and increased the efficiency of pedipalp insertion, but male experience had little effect on the behaviour of the female. Our results suggest that mating experience may benefit both sexes in that (1) females that are not sperm limited may incur high costs from remating (time) and (2) males show experience-related improvement in copulatory efficiency.

AB Invasive species may reduce biodiversity in the long term by displacing resident species. Previous studies of geckos have suggested that invasive species can displace residents by monopolizing limited resources, and this competitive advantage may be exacerbated in structurally simple human-altered habitats. Lepidodactylus lugubris is a parthenogenetic gecko that comprises four major clones. On many Pacific islands A-clones have recently become numerically dominant over several other clones. We tested the general hypothesis that A-clones displace B-clones in structurally simple habitats owing to behavioural differences that influence foraging and aggression. Based on previous studies and the pattern of invasion, we predicted that A-clones would consume more insects and show higher levels of aggression and social dominance than would B-clones. We also tested the hypothesis that increasing topographic structure would affect clone behaviour asymmetrically and reduce the advantages of invading A-clones. We found that A-clones consumed more insects and initiated foraging faster compared to B-clones. However, A-clones were not consistently socially dominant over B-clones. Habitat structure affected foraging tactics, reduced aggression and decreased activity, but clones were affected equally and A-clones remained superior foragers in the structurally complex habitat. Although B-clones were more active, they were also more shy. They occupied and defended shelter more, which may partially explain their persistence in forested habitat. We conclude that part of the advantage A-clones have in structurally simple human landscapes stems from their innate boldness, which increases their ability to exploit limited food resources.

AB Previous studies have shown that squamates (lizards and snakes) are capable of spatial learning, but only after extensive training. In nature, squamates' capacity to learn may be better than that suggested by laboratory studies, because they have the opportunity to become familiar with the location of important landmarks and vital resources as they wander through their home range. I conducted three laboratory experiments to test the hypothesis that prior experience with a habitat improves spatial learning in little brown skinks. Individual lizards were subjected to a simulated predatory attack and tested for their ability to take refuge under one of two cardboard retreats (experiment 1) and to choose the 'correct' retreat without prior experience (experiment 2) and with 48 h of prior experience (experiment 3) in the 'habitat'. Although little brown skinks learned to take refuge under cardboard retreats (experiment 1), inexperienced lizards did not learn to take refuge under the 'correct' retreat (experiment 2). However, experienced lizards did learn to take refuge under the correct retreat (experiment 3) and did so after only a few trials. I discuss the influence of experience, the ecological relevance of stimuli used in learning experiments, and other methodological issues. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The handicap principle of sexual selection theory states that colourful phenotypic traits signal aspects of individual quality because only individuals in prime condition can afford to produce and bear conspicuous traits. Melanin-based pigments participate in the elaboration of many secondary sexual characters and, given their role in sexual selection, melanin-based coloration may therefore honestly reject individual quality. Although the expression of melanism is usually under genetic control, in some species it is condition dependent. However, the underlying physiological mechanism is yet unknown. Based on the negative feedback link between corticosterone and melanogenesis ( melanocortins, tyrosinase) in response to stressful environmental factors, we hypothesize that corticosterone mediates the condition-dependent component of melanism. This hypothesis predicts that stressful factors induce a rise in circulating corticosterone which inhibits the secretion of melanocortins and tyrosinase and in turn melanin production. We tested this prediction by manipulating the level of corticosterone at the time of melanin production in nestling barn owls, Tyto alba, a species showing heritable variation in the degree of phaeomelanism from reddish-brown to white. The finding that corticosterone-implanted nestlings produced feathers with less phaeomelanic coloration than placebo-implanted nestlings is consistent with the hypothesis that the environment-mediated reduction in the degree of melanism is, at least in part, caused by a rise in corticosterone. In species in which the expression of melanin-based coloration is condition dependent, we now need a test showing that individuals with less corticosterone and more melanin-based signals are individuals in better condition.

AB With a combination of both experimental ( caged, hours/daily) and field ( free-ranging, several months) studies, we tested the high-tannin hypothesis that hoarding animals prefer to eat more low-tannin food items immediately but hoard more high-tannin items for later consumption. We studied two common rat species ( Edward's long-tailed rat, Leopoldamys edwardsi; and chestnut rat, Niviventer fulvescens) and two nut species ( Henry's chestnut, Castanea henryi; and cork oak, Quercus variabilis) that show varying tannin levels ( 0.6% versus 11.7%) but are similar in other traits. Based on the high-tannin hypothesis, we predicted that ( 1) both rat species would eat more low-tannin C. henryi nuts instantly but fewer high-tannin Q. variabilis nuts and ( 2) after harvesting a given nut, they would prefer to hoard more Q. variabilis nuts and fewer C. henryi nuts. The first prediction was firmly supported in our study: both rat species ate more C. henryi nuts than Q. variabilis nuts under all conditions. However, the second prediction was supported only in the field study, which lasted over several months, in contrast to the experiments conducted in seminatural enclosures ( only 1 day). We found that high-tannin Q. variabilis nuts, in contrast to low-tannin C. henryi nuts, had a significantly higher probability of being hoarded and surviving as seedlings in the field. We conclude that experimental conditions used here are less likely to result in natural feeding preferences of tested animals and the high-tannin hypothesis is supported especially in the field setting.

AB The conspicuousness of bird plumages may vary with the ambient light. Therefore, two behavioural predictions of the sensory drive hypothesis are that males should prefer to display and that females should prefer to visit males under specific ambient light conditions that enhance communication efficiency. Here we investigate patterns of male display and female attendance at male display sites under different ambient light conditions in a clade of five closely related species of manakins (Pipridae). Continuous focal observations and video recordings showed that in four of five species, the frequency of male display in different ambient light conditions correlated with their availability at their display sites, and that males showed no preference for displaying under specific ambient light conditions. But in Corapipo gutturalis, males showed a strong preference for displaying in shade and sunny gap environments females showed no preference for visiting male display sites under specific ambient light conditions, nor did they prefer males with the strongest ambient light display preferences. Male display and female visiting patterns for most of the manakin species studied were inconsistent with behavioural predictions of sensory drive. However, male C. gutturalis have evolved a preference for displaying in specific light conditions that is a derived behaviour novelty within the clade. As predicted by sensory drive, this behavioural novelty is phylogenetically congruent with a change in sensory environment: a decrease in the frequency of cloudy conditions at display sites. Behavioural and environmental novelties in C. gutturalis are not phylogenetically congruent with the evolution of the glossy, blue-black and white plumage in the ancestor of all Corapipo further tests of the sensory drive hypotheses are recommended, such as whether display sites are nonrandom samples of the sensory environment or whether male plumage colours are adapted for efficient signalling in specific ambient light conditions. 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Nestmate recognition cues can derive from genetic and/ or environmental factors and can be context-dependent rather than fixed over time. We examined the influence of genetic relatedness and environment on nestmate recognition and its seasonal variations in a natural population of the polydomous ( multiple- nests per colony) ant Plagiolepis pygmaea in southern France. Recognition between colonies was measured by testing aggression levels during encounters between five workers of colony A and one of colony B and vice versa. The combination of genetic data, spatial data and aggressive behaviour data shows that nestmate recognition cues have principally a genetic component. Whereas workers from different nests of the same colony are never aggressive to each other, they are always hostile to alien conspecifics regardless of the spatial or genetic distance between the colonies. Our results also reveal significant seasonal variations in the levels of aggression among workers of different colonies, probably according to the biological cycles of the species. Surprisingly, despite the mode of colony reproduction being budding in P. pygmaea, the population of Tarabel is not genetically structured.

AB Social predation (hunting in groups) presents a collective action problem. If nonhunters can obtain meat following a kill, it is unclear why an individual would choose to incur hunting costs. We explored this question using long-term data on chimpanzees from Kanyawara (Kibale National Park, Uganda) to test why hunting probability increases with chimpanzee party size. Social predation was not simply a function of the additive probability of intrinsic individual hunting rates. The potential for sharing meat with preferred social partners or sexually receptive females did not increase hunting probability, and there was no evidence of collaboration. Instead, individual variation in hunting motivation was critical for predicting hunting. Two 'impact' males had persistently high hunting rates, and hunts rarely occurred in their absence. When present, these males acted as hunting 'catalysts'. We argue that the profitability of social predation for chimpanzees differs from social carnivores, for which energy maximization is the expected goal. Since meat contains valuable micronutrients that complement a predominantly plant-based diet, obtaining even a small amount of meat is likely to be beneficial to a chimpanzee. We found that the probability that a male obtained meat increased with the number of hunters, and thus social predation was economically profitable. However, in the largest parties, hunters and nonhunters were equally likely to obtain meat, suggesting that there was incentive to refrain from hunting. Together, our results show that the catalytic action of impact males promotes cooperative hunting to a degree, but the collective action problem persists in large parties.

AB A prey animal has the alternative of fleeing or feigning death to survive when it encounters predators. We found that fleeing by an artificial threat, locomotion and feigning death are pleiotropically correlated with a genetic factor related to a biogenic amine in the red. our beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Walking distance of adults was significantly lower in strains artificially selected for longer ( L strains) than shorter duration ( S strains) of death-feigning. Crosses showed that S-strain adults were dominant in the frequency and duration of death-feigning and locomotor activity compared to those of L strains, suggesting that death-feigning and activity have the same genetic basis. S-strain adults fled, but L-strain adults feigned death, when they encounter artificial threat. Not only adults that were directly selected for the duration of death-feigning, but also the larvae of L strains frequently showed tonic immobility, when they were dropped onto the ground: the larvae of S strains showed this behaviour less often. This suggests that chemical modulators of behaviour present in these insects before and after metamorphosis control both general locomotor activity and death-feigning. Brain levels of the candidate neuromodulator dopamine were, in fact, found to be significantly higher in S strains compared to L strains in the two selection replications. Thus, we suggest that two alternative behaviours related to antipredator strategies, fleeing or feigning death, are associated with the pleiotropic effects of a neuroactive substance in T. castaneum.

AB Facultative change in mating decisions can result from both exogenous and endogenous factors. The hermaphroditic roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, is a model system for many areas of biology, yet, aspects of its reproductive biology are not well understood. Here, we present data suggesting that the reproductive behaviour of hermaphrodites changes with self-sperm status. Self-sperm containing hermaphrodites are more likely to eject male ejaculate after insemination than self-sperm depleted hermaphrodites, presumably reducing the likelihood of fertilization by male sperm. Self-sperm depleted hermaphrodites are more likely to mate, and mate in a shorter period of time than self-sperm containing hermaphrodites. This increase in the willingness to mate is correlated with self-sperm depletion, but not hermaphrodite age. Hermaphrodites that have exhausted their self-sperm also show a lower rate of sprinting away from males than self-sperm containing hermaphrodites, indicating a lower level of mating resistance. The combined results suggest that self-sperm containing hermaphrodites are more likely to show precopulatory mate avoidance as well as postcopulatory mechanisms to avoid fertilization by males than sperm-depleted hermaphrodites, presumably to delay outcrossing until self-sperm is exhausted. Thus, there appears to be a shift in hermaphrodite mating behaviour based on reproductive status. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, we investigated whether historical, refugial isolation may have caused current, large-scale geographical variation in the song frequency and structure in the chowchilla, Orthonyx spaldingii, or whether this variation can be better explained by the influence of isolation-by-distance, vegetation type and/or body size and mass. We recorded songs from 15 locations across the species' range, covering five historically isolated populations (Pleistocene refugia) and two areas of post-Pleistocene recolonization. We measured six spectrotemporal characteristics of 773 songs and used a multivariate approach to test for differences between refugia. Historically isolated populations could be clearly distinguished by their spectral characteristics, particularly bandwidth and peak frequency. In addition, we found striking song divergence across the Black Mountain Corridor, a known historical climatic barrier. Northern refugia showed significantly narrower bandwidths and higher peak frequencies than southern refugia. Spectral characteristics were not influenced by geographical distance, broad habitat differences or body size. This study shows that spectral song characteristics were at least in part influenced by historical isolation in refugia. Given the known history of population isolation in these refugia, cultural drift is the most likely explanation for the differences in spectral characteristics in chowchilla song.

AB Meerkats, Suricata suricatta, engage in cooperative territorial defence, including olfactory demarcation with latrines. Males from neighbouring groups frequently approach resident groups, but, due to high levels of reproductive skew, the potential fitness costs and benefits of deterring these males vary according to the sex and breeding status of residents. Although all individuals visited latrines for similar durations, latrine scent mark composition was highly male- biased. Male behaviour supported a mate- defence function as males scent marked at significantly higher rates than females and preferentially overmarked female scent marks. In contrast to males, female competition is most intense within the group, and females invested heavily in scent mark investigation, but did not selectively overmark existing scent marks of either sex. Monitoring of other females, particularly their reproductive status, may therefore be an important function of latrine visits for females. Rather than cooperatively contributing to territorial defence, individuals appear to participate selfishly at latrine sites, with ultimate explanations for scent marking potentially being related to both the sex and breeding status of group members.

AB Despite the recent explosion of interest in sexual conflict, the effect of environmental conditions on the intensity of sexual conflict within populations has been largely ignored. Reproductive encounters within coelopids are characterized by sexual conflict in the form of intense harassment by males, usually resulting in a vigorous premating struggle. We investigated the effect of habitat composition and duration of exposure to oviposition sites on the level of sexual harassment by males and mating success in two species of European seaweed flies, Coelopa frigida and C. pilipes. The wrack beds inhabited by these two species are dominated by two genera of brown algae, Fucus and Laminaria, the relative proportions of which can vary considerably between wrack beds. Fucus is known to stimulate harassment by males, increase copulation duration and induce females to oviposit in both species. In this study Laminaria stimulated a higher level of harassment by male C. frigida than Fucus did. However, a similar effect was not observed in C. pilipes, with the main additional factor affecting harassment in this species being the age of the male. Our study highlights the potential importance of environmental conditions on the intensity of sexual conflict within a population. We discuss the evolutionary significance of these observed effects in seaweed flies. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behavior. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nectar-foraging bees frequently face the choice of which flowers to visit and which to avoid. One possible mechanism by which bees could discriminate between flowers before visiting them is by detecting nectar via its odours. To test this idea, we observed visits by solitary bees in the genus Osmia (Megachilidae) to flowers of Pensteinon caesius (Scrophulariaceae) in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California. We observed that free-foraging Osmia bees visited flowers containing nectar seven times more frequently than they visited nectar-depleted flowers. To test whether bees could detect the presence of nectar via odour cues, we compared floral preferences between trials where we blocked the olfactory capabilities of bees by coating their antennae with nontoxic silicone and where bees foraged with uncovered antennae. We randomly assigned the order of the silicone treatments and attempted to test 32 bees at P. caesius arrays containing nectar-depleted flowers, nectar-depleted flowers with added water and nectar-rewarding control flowers. Bees with uncovered antennae visited more than twice as many control flowers as they did either group of nectar-depleted flowers. In contrast, bees foraging with silicone-covered antennae visited all treatment flowers equally. Bees that completed both trials visited nectar-rewarding control flowers twice as frequently while foraging with uncovered antennae as they did while foraging with silicone-coated antennae. Theme results are consistent with the idea that solitary Osmia bees are capable of perceiving nectar volatiles to identify nectar-rewarding Penstemon flowers.

AB Achieving a high social rank may be advantageous for individuals at high population densities, because dominance status may determine the priority of access to limited resources and reduce individual loss of body mass. The establishment of dominance relationships between individuals involves variable levels of aggressiveness that can be influenced by resource availability. The relationship between social rank and aggressiveness and the impacts of resource abundance on aggressiveness are, however, poorly understood, but may be relevant to understand the mechanisms determining dominance relationships between individuals. We experimentally simulated, in seminatural enclosures, a deterioration of winter forage quality induced by a high-density deer population and examined the effects of (1) social dominance and (2) diet quality on aggressiveness, forage intake and body mass loss of white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, fawns during two winters. Within diet-quality treatments, fawns were consistently organized into linear hierarchies and showed clear dominance relationships. Dominants initiated more interactions and showed higher aggressiveness than subordinates, but subordinates had higher forage intake than dominants throughout winter. Social rank did not influence cumulative body mass loss of fawns. During both winters, fawns fed the control diet maintained their aggressiveness level, whereas fawns fed the poor-quality diet decreased it. Our experimental approach revealed that white-tailed deer responded to a reduction in winter forage quality by modifying their aggressiveness, indicating that ungulates may show plasticity not only in their foraging behaviour in response to decreased resources but also in their social behaviour.

AB Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, increase their ventilation rate in response to predator odour cues. We measured the ventilation response of newly hatched Atlantic salmon to odours of high- and low-risk predators at. ve concentrations (10-200%). Concentration may be interpreted as predator proximity and/or number of predators present and thus represents a gradation of predation risk. Predator species ( pike, Esox lucius, and minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus) and predator odour concentration affected the number of individuals responding and the strength of individual response. Fewer individuals responded to minnow odour than pike odour, and the proportion of individuals responding also declined with odour concentration. Salmon responded more strongly to high-risk predator (pike) odour than the low-risk (minnow) odour for a given concentration, and ventilation rate generally increased with increasing concentrations of both odours. This study shows that Atlantic salmon have the innate ability to evaluate risk in terms of odour concentration and predator species.

AB Faces and bodies are thought to be signals of mate quality in humans. Most research on attractiveness has focused on faces or bodies separately, whereas our preferences have evolved based on both seen together. A fundamental requirement of studying face and body attractiveness independently is that there is no interaction between the two. This study is the. rst to investigate whether the interaction between rated attractiveness of the face and the body predicted ratings of overall attractiveness. We found that the face and body did not interact when an overall attractiveness judgement was made. We also investigated the independent contributions of rated attractiveness of the face and the body to ratings of overall attractiveness. Face and body attractiveness each made significant independent contributions to overall attractiveness in males and females. For both sexes, face attractiveness predicted overall attractiveness more strongly than did body attractiveness, and this difference was signi. cant in males. The contributions of components of face and body attractiveness (symmetry, sexual dimorphism and averageness) to overall attractiveness were also examined using principal components analysis. A component associated with attractive traits in the male face, and in females both a face and body component, significantly predicted overall attractiveness. Our results validate the assumption that studying faces and bodies separately in the context of mate choice will produce biologically meaningful results and suggest that face and body attractiveness may convey potentially independent signals about an individual's mate quality.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Migratory birds appear to have relatively smaller brain sizes compared to sedentary species. It has been hypothesized that initial differences in brain size underlying behavioural flexibility drove the evolution of migratory behaviour; birds with relatively large brains evolved sedentary habits and those with relatively small brains evolved migratory behaviour (migratory precursor hypothesis). Alternative hypotheses suggest that changes in brain size might follow different behavioural strategies and that sedentary species might have evolved larger brains because of differences in selection pressures on brain size in migratory and nonmigratory species. Here we present the first evidence arguing against the migratory precursor hypothesis. We compared relative brain volume of three subspecies of white-crowned sparrow: sedentary Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli and migratory Z. l. gambelii and Z. l. oriantha. Within the five subspecies of the white-crowned sparrow, only Z. l. nuttalli is strictly sedentary. The sedentary behaviour of Z. l. nuttalli is probably a derived trait, because Z. l. nuttalli appears to be the most recent subspecies and because all species ancestral to Zonotrichia as well as all older subspecies of Z. leucophrys are migratory. Compared to migratory Z. l. gambelii and Z. l. oriantha, we found that sedentary Z. l. nuttalli had a significantly larger relative brain volume, suggesting that the larger brain of Z. l. nuttalli evolved after a switch to sedentary behaviour. Thus, in this group, brain size does not appear to be a precursor to the evolution of migratory or sedentary behaviour but rather an evolutionary consequence of a change in migratory strategy.

AB Female East African chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, tend to range apart from each other in dispersed core areas, and they have dominance interactions with each other so rarely that it is difficult for observers to assess a dominance hierarchy. Nevertheless female chimpanzees can have high variance in fitness. Here, we test the hypothesis that female chimpanzee fitness variance is associated with variation in the foraging quality of their ranges. We studied range usage of 21 wild adult female chimpanzees within the Kanyawara community, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Core areas of individuals remained stable over a 9-year period and varied in their density of preferred foods. Females in neighbourhoods containing more preferred foods had elevated ovarian hormone production, shorter birth intervals and higher infant survivorship. Our results thus suggest that superior access to food may have enabled some community females to reproduce more successfully than others. Although dominance interactions are less frequent among females than among males of this species, we propose that the intensity of selection on intrasexual competition may be similar between the sexes. We discuss potential applications to other fission-fusion species. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, produce numerous species-atypical signals when raised in captivity. We examined contextual elements of the use of two of these vocal signals, the 'raspberry' and the extended grunt. Our results demonstrate that these vocalizations are not elicited by the presence of food, but instead function as attention-getting signals. These findings reveal a heretofore underappreciated category of animal signals: attention-getting sounds produced in novel environmental circumstances. The invention and use of species-atypical signals, considered in relation to group differences in signalling repertoires in apes in their natural habitats, may index a generative capacity in these hominoid species without obvious corollary in other primate species.

AB Response facilitation is an alternative learning process that could account for some imitative phenomena. It occurs when the presence of a conspecific performing an act temporarily increases the probability that an observing animal will perform the same act. This process could have important implications for social-learning research, because it provides a plausible means by which social learning could occur in animals, yet it superficially resembles imitation and consequently affects the interpretation of current popular 'two-action' tests of imitation. However, there is little good evidence on response facilitation effects, because cases of behavioural synchrony can usually be explained by other factors, so some researchers remain sceptical as to the importance of the process. We conducted an experimental study of social-learning processes in domestic fowl to evaluate whether response facilitation is a plausible explanatory term. Strong behavioural synchrony was observed in hens in preening, sitting and dustbathing behaviour. In the case of preening, we found strong evidence that this synchrony was unlikely to be accounted for by alternative social-learning processes or by external factors influencing birds in the same way. We conclude that there is compelling evidence for response facilitation in the domestic fowl. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Animals often face trade-offs during reproduction between activities such as parental care and territory defence. In species that are socially monogamous, males and females are faced with the additional problem of coordinating their respective contributions to such activities. Here, we examined male incubation behaviour in a passerine that shows genetic monogamy and in which males incubate extensively. Male incubation is rare in North American passerines and little is known about how males defend their territories during the incubation stage and whether females compensate for lower male incubation during territorial intrusions. Blue-headed vireo males contribute 50% of incubation time during the day. We performed playbacks to simulate intrusions to males while they were on the nest and off the nest during the incubation period. On average, males took 18 min to arrive at the playback location while on the nest incubating, but took less than 2 min when not incubating. In addition, only 44% of the males sang while on the nest, whereas all males sang in response to the playback when off the nest. This result suggests that males probably delay territory defence until females return to the nest to avoid exposing the nest to predators. Females returned to the nest to relieve their mates from incubation duties sooner during experimental intrusions than during control periods, which also allowed males to pursue intruders sooner. Genetic monogamy may underlie this apparent cooperation and the sex-role convergence exemplified in this species. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When females mate with multiple partners, the risk of sperm competition depends on female mating history. To maximize fitness, males should adjust their copulatory investments according to this risk. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, the female cuticular hydrocarbon (CH) profile changes when females mate, and males use this to assess female mating status. I tested whether this cue influenced the time males spent copulating with females and if this affected male fertilization success and female fitness. I manipulated female mating status by transferring CHs from either virgin or mated females to virgin females. Males copulated significantly longer with virgin females that had been coated with CHs from mated females (experimental group) than with virgin females coated with CHs from other virgin females (control group). Copulation duration did not differ between females from the experimental group and females that had already mated. To test whether differential investment in copulation affected male sperm defence and female fitness, experimental and control females were mated once to wild-type males and then either housed with males carrying a genetic marker (experiment 1) or alone (experiment 2). In experiment 1 male sperm defence was elevated when males perceived their partner as mated, and this was mainly due to females remating less. Increased male investment in copulation duration also affected female fitness, although this was reversed between experiments 1 and 2. Finally, these results also indicate that copulations are costly to males, since manipulated males copulated for longer with virgin females than they normally would, resulting in higher fertilization success.

AB We investigated the ranging behaviour of two groups of wild mangabey monkeys (sooty mangabeys, Cercocebus atys atys, and grey-cheeked mangabeys, Lophocebus albigena johnstoni) relative to a number of preselected target trees within their home range. We observed the groups' visiting patterns and speed when they approached within a critical distance of a target tree as a function of the tree's fruiting state. For both groups, the likelihood of coming into sight or actually entering these trees was significantly higher if fruit was available. Target trees with fruit were also approached significantly faster than were trees without fruits. These behavioural differences were unlikely to be the result of auditory, visual or olfactory cues available over long distances, suggesting that monkeys relied on spatial memory to relocate fruit trees and distinguish between trees that had and had not carried fruit in the immediate past. Results further indicated that the monkeys clearly distinguished between different types of fruit-bearing target trees. We suggest that the monkeys used memory of previous feeding experience to assess each tree's differences and were able to anticipate changes in fruit quality. We found no evidence that individuals belonging to a particular age or sex class led the group towards trees with fruit more often than did others.

AB All copulations in the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, are coercive-and-achieved by force. Female G. holbrooki never appear to cooperate with males, but vigorously resist matings at all times. We examined the role of females within a sexually coercive mating system by investigating the ability of female G. holbrooki to resist forced copulations after acclimation to 16 degrees C and 32 degrees C for 4-5 weeks. We also examined burst swimming performance of female G. holbrooki after acclimation, as this trait is likely to underlie a female's ability to resist forced matings. We predicted that if female G. holbrooki indiscriminately resist matings from all males, acclimation would enhance female resistance at their acclimation temperature. However, we found that it did not. We also predicted that if females are able to influence the outcome of mating interactions, acclimation to an optimal thermal environment may induce females to reduce resistance. In support of this prediction, females acclimated at 32 degrees C were able to modify their resistance behaviour between exposure to 16 degrees C and 32 degrees C. The rate of copulations experienced by 32 inverted perpendicular C-acclimated females was 2.5 times greater at 32 degrees C than at 16 degrees C. In addition, acclimation at 32 degrees C significantly enhanced burst swimming performance at 32 degrees C but no effect of acclimation was observed at 16 degrees C. Our results suggest that female G. holbrooki are able to play a greater role in determining the outcome of sexual coercive mating interactions than previously thought.

AB Rogers (2000, Brain and Language, 73, 236-253) suggested that the ubiquity of cerebral lateralization could be explained by the advantages it provides to individuals in coping with two simultaneous tasks, because in lateralized individuals each task could be carried out by a different hemisphere. To test this hypothesis, we compared lateralized and nonlateralized fish, obtained through selective breeding, in a situation requiring the sharing of attention between two simultaneous tasks, prey capture and predator vigilance. Food-deprived individual Girardinus falcatus had to enter a compartment adjacent to the home tank to capture live brine shrimps either in the presence or in the absence of a live predator placed at some distance. When no hazard was present, lateralized and nonlateralized fish did not differ in rate of prey capture. However, when the predator was visible, lateralized fish were twice as fast at catching shrimps as were nonlateralized fish. A fine analysis of fish movements revealed that lateralized fish tended to monitor the predator with one eye and to use the other eye for catching prey, whereas nonlateralized fish swapped between tasks, using each eye for both functions.

AB Food-storing animals hide food in times of abundance and rely on memory to recover those caches several days if not months later when supplies are scarce. This review focuses on the different models that have been proposed to explain the evolution of food caching, specifically those models that describe how food caching might have evolved in an environment of cache pilferage. We discuss the use of cache protection behaviours in cachers, and the success of these behaviours in bringing about a reduction in cache theft, before looking at the behaviours of prospective thieves that facilitate cache pilferage. Finally, we consider the insights these behaviours give us into the cognitive abilities of food-storing animals. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study orAnimal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Through a cross-fostering experiment, we studied song learning of blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, and great tit, Parus major, males reared by heterospecific parents. This was done in the wild, and so potential song tutors, territorial neighbours, potential mates and other social factors were all natural and not affected by the treatment. Normally, the song repertoires of the two species are completely discrete. However, the cross-fostered great tit males altered their song in several aspects, including repertoire size and composition, and temporal and frequency parameters, thus becoming intermediate between the normal songs of the two species. For the cross-fostered blue tit song, only repertoire composition was affected. However, an analysis of repertoire size in both species proved this to be larger in cross-fostered than in control males. This increase in repertoire size shows that repertoire size is influenced by social conditions in these species and is not strictly constrained by memory capacity. Furthermore, several of the cross-fostered great tit males included trilled songs in their repertoires. In these two species, trilled songs have been regarded as unique to the blue tit. In conclusion, our results show the importance of early social experiences for song learning in these wild tits. (c)\ 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB As extreme generalists, cockroaches mix their diet from foods that vary greatly in their nutrient composition. It might thus be predicted that these insects have evolved robustness to enforced periods of nutritional imbalance and a well-developed ability to redress imbalances by compensatory food selection. We investigated these predictions for German cockroaches, Blatella germanica, using synthetic foods ranging in their balance of the macronutrients protein and carbohydrate. We first confined cockroaches for the duration of the final larval stadium either to a near-balanced food (% protein:% carbohydrate = 15:45), or one of four imbalanced foods (47:13 or 24:36 = excess protein; 13:47 or 4:56 = excess carbohydrate). All insects survived, but nutritional imbalance resulted in slowed development and skewed body composition. We then investigated the compensatory responses of nymphs confined during the first 48 h (approximately the first quarter) of the stadium to one of three nutritionally imbalanced foods, and thereafter allowed to select an intake from all three. Macronutrient intake was measured after 4, 10, 24, 48 and 120 h. Within 48 h all groups had entirely redressed the respective imbalances accrued during the 2-day pretreatment period, and thereafter consumed an indistinguishable balance of macronutrients. Our results show in B. germanica remarkable robustness to nutritional imbalance, and provide the first evidence of such effective compensation through complementary food selection for nutritional imbalance accrued over a timescale of days.

I investigated the relation between male mating success and the size of the accessory glands in the flightless firebug, Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.). Differential mating success of macropterous and brachypterous adult males depended on age. Brachypterous males had an early mating advantage (on days 3-14 after adult ecdysis), but macropterous males later gained this advantage (days 21-28 after ecdysis). The developmental patterns of mating success of the two wing morphs and the size of their accessory glands were positively related. The accessory glands were smaller and mating success lower in food-deprived brachypterous males than in normally feeding brachypterous males. Allatectomy of brachypterous males led to the accessory glands shrinking, whereas methoprene increased the size of the accessory glands of these males to that observed in same-aged controls. Mating success and the size of the accessory glands in macropterous males were also increased after methoprene treatment. This is the first report of endocrine control of a wing morph-related difference in mating success and its relation to the maturation rate of the accessory glands in wing-polymorphic insects.

AB In cooperatively breeding species, parents may be assisted by other individuals to feed the young. How breeding parents react when they receive help is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that parents usually maintain their feeding effort when starvation of chicks is common, and reduce it when other risks such as predation are more important for chick survival, although some recent examples do not fit this pattern. In no case, however, have parents been found to increase their effort when they have helpers. We investigated this issue in a rarely studied cooperative breeder, the azure-winged magpie, Cyanopica cyanus. Breeders increased their provisioning rate when aided by helpers. However, chick starvation was rare and it was equally so in nests with and without helpers. The incidence of predation, conversely, was significantly lower in the presence of helpers. Helpers provisioned at a lower rate than parents but buffered the effect of adverse conditions in bad years in the nests they assisted. To our knowledge, these findings show for the first time that parents can increase their investment in the current brood in the presence of helpers, a result that does not seem to have been covered by current theory of cooperative breeding.

AB Male crustaceans must find and identify receptive females to mate successfully. Sex recognition depends mainly on sex pheromones, which are detected by antennae and antennules. Distance (soluble) pheromone mediates mating behaviour of some decapod crustaceans. Contact pheromone (an insoluble coating on the body surface) has been proposed but not confirmed to be used by male decapod crustaceans to detect females. Here we report for the first time the involvement of both distance and contact pheromones in the mating processes of a decapod crustacean, Lysmata wurdemanni, a protandric simultaneous hermaphrodite. Euhermaphrodite-phase (EP) shrimp can mate only as females during the small window of the post-moult period, during which they secrete both distance and contact sex pheromones to attract males. Male shrimp tracked, recognized and courted the receptive EP shrimp based on both distance and contact sex pheromones, but responded aggressively to newly moulted male shrimp. Male shrimp with their chemosensory appendages ablated appeared unable to identify EP shrimp and neither courted nor copulated with them. As reported for other decapod crustacean species, the outer flagella of the antennules house the receptors of the distance pheromone, whereas both antennae and antennules can detect the contact pheromone. Shrimp could still mate successfully without the distance pheromone. These results suggest that contact pheromone, in addition to distance pheromone, is involved in mediating the mating behaviour of L. wurdemanni. Moreover, contact pheromone may be more important than distance pheromone in the mating process. Selection of the sex pheromone system of L. wurdemanni may be driven by social environment.

AB Associative learning may help to offset costs of unnecessary escape behaviour by providing accurate information about the current risk to potential prey. We investigated innate antipredator behaviour and cue association learning in naive gastropods. Juvenile laboratory-reared great pond snails, Lymnaea stagnalis (L.), were exposed to odour cues from a natural predator, tench, Tinca tinca (L.), and crushed conspecifics. The snails showed an innate antipredator behaviour to odour from T tinca, by crawling above the water line (crawl-out response). This crawl-out response was significantly increased in the presence of alarm cues (crushed conspecifics). In a second experiment, juvenile L. stagnalis were exposed to tench odour and alarm cues in aquaria before being tested in behavioural assays. The behavioural responses to tench cue alone were similar to those seen in response to tench plus alarm cues presented together during the first experiment. Hence, L. stagnalis is apparently capable of relating potential predation risk to recent experience. In a final experiment snails were removed from pre-exposure cues for periods of 1, 4 and 8 days prior to behavioural assays. A raised level of avoidance persisted for at least 8 days, suggesting that this behaviour may be retained over timescales relevant to predation risk in the natural environment. The ability of organisms to modify antipredator behaviour based on recent experience, as found in L. stagnalis, would allow costs associated with unnecessary responses to be reduced while still allowing the organisms to avoid active predators.

AB Sharing food with nonkin is detrimental to a food donor's fitness, unless it is matched by compensatory benefits. I evaluated two explanations for nonkin meat sharing among wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii. Reciprocal exchange proposes that a possessor relinquishes food in exchange for past or future sharing or for items of a different currency (e.g. grooming, alliances or copulations). The second hypothesis is the sharing-under-pressure/harassment model, which proposes that an individual shares to avoid the costs of defending a food item against persistent beggars. At Gombe National Park, Tanzania, I collected dyadic grooming and association data during focal follows of adult male chimpanzees. I videotaped meat-eating bouts, subsequently extracting detailed begging and sharing data. There was mixed support for the reciprocal exchange hypothesis. Sharing with males was not influenced by overall association and grooming rates. Female sexual receptivity did not affect the probability of sharing, nor did sharing increase the probability of mating. Meat possessors shared larger amounts, and were more likely to share actively with frequent female grooming partners. However, this pattern may have resulted from increased harassment by these individuals. In contrast, the sharing-under-pressure hypothesis was consistently supported: the possessor's feeding rate decreased with the number of beggars, the probability of sharing increased with the occurrence and duration of harassment, and harassment decreased following sharing events. I conclude that the pattern of meat sharing among the Gombe chimpanzees is largely explained by the sharing-under-pressure hypothesis, while the significance of reciprocal exchange remains unclear.

   MEMORY; PERCEPTION
AB Four experiments examined the discrimination performance of four pigeons in two means-end tasks. The pigeons were required to discriminate between two ribbon/food dish assemblies in a simultaneous discrimination. In the connected condition, the ribbon was attached to an out-of-reach food dish, allowing it to be retrieved by the pigeon pulling it with its beak. In the unconnected condition, the ribbon was unattached to the dish, preventing it from being used to retrieve the food. In experiment 1, the pigeons learned this means-end task in fewer than 160 trials. Experiment 2 established that this discrimination was controlled by the gap between the ribbon and dish, and, to a limited extent, by the ribbon's colour. Experiment 3 showed no transfer of this prior means-end training to a second means-end task using a different physical arrangement of 'connectedness'. Experiment 4 revealed that control of this second task was also related to the perceptual features of the gap between the ribbons. The results indicate that the pigeons did not comprehend the conceptual nature of connectedness across these means-end tasks, but did successfully learn each discrimination based on its relevant perceptual features.

AB There is growing evidence that females that are engaged in mating may be more vulnerable to predation than males. This suggests that females facing a high risk of predation are less receptive to male courtship, which in turn leads males to alter their courtship behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether predators selectively attacked females. We used a jumping spider, Jacksonoides queenslandicus, from Queensland in Australia as prey and Portia fimbriata, another species of jumping spider, as predator. We then investigated the differential effects of male and female exposure to predation risk from P. fimbriata on the courtship and mating behaviour of males within J. queenslandicus pairs. We found that when given a choice between a male and a female J. queenslandicus, P. fimbriata preferred the female. When only females were exposed to predation risk before the trials, J. queenslandicus males displayed to females for less time than the controls (in which neither the male nor the female was exposed to predators). However, when only males were exposed to the predators, they showed no significant difference in either frequency or duration of courtship display compared to the controls. This study provides evidence that the female's perception of predation risk can be at least as important as that of the male in changing male mating behaviour in J. queenslandicus.

AB Mating with close relatives generally results in reduced reproductive success (inbreeding depression) because it increases the risk that rare deleterious recessive alleles will be expressed in offspring. None the less, incest may occur when animals have incomplete knowledge about relatedness or when the costs of avoiding inbreeding are high. Over a 17-year period, Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, in an island population rarely paired incestuously (9 of 1110 pairs, 15 of 1609 nesting attempts). All but one case of close inbreeding (coefficient of inbreeding, F >= 0.25) involved 1-year-old males breeding for the first time, whereas more than half of the cases involved females that were 3 years old or older. Father-daughter matings were avoided completely. Incest avoidance was apparent in the choice of genetic as well as social mates. Paternity analysis using microsatellites revealed that birds nearly always refrained from choosing close relatives as genetic mates. These results support a model of asymmetrical incest avoidance, which predicts differences in the likelihood of incestuous matings as a function of sex, age and relationship, even when coefficients of inbreeding are identical. The model and results also emphasize the importance of distinguishing types of inbreeding and considering the social and historical context of animals' mating choices. The model may help to explain such patterns as female-biased natal dispersal in birds. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Herbivory is central to ecosystem function, and herbivores, through diet selection, exert a major influence on vegetation composition with consequent effects for associated fauna and human livelihoods. Understanding diet selection behaviour is therefore important to allow effective prediction of herbivore impacts on vegetation under different scenarios. Herbivores learn about foods by associating them with the positive postingestive effects of nutrients and the negative postingestive effects of toxins. However, the extent to which trade-offs are made between positive and negative effects, occurring simultaneously, and how this trade-off might be altered by the underlying nutritional status of herbivores are unclear. We investigated these effects using 36 goats, Capra hircus, half of which were on a low nutritional regime and half were moderately well fed. We offered three conifer species to the goats, on 3 consecutive days per week for 3 weeks. While the goats were consuming the conifers, they received one of three levels of a positive nutritional stimulus, simulating nutritional rewards, and one of three levels of a negative stimulus, simulating the effects of plant secondary compounds. Goats preferred conifers paired with positive effects and avoided those paired with negative effects in a dose-dependent way. Underlying nutritional status did not influence the response to the positive and negative postingestive effects. We conclude that diet choice in response to learning about postingestive effects represents a simple integration of the positive and negative consequences of consuming particular plants and that this balance is not greatly influenced by minor differences in nutritional status.

AB The direction and speed of escape locomotion can affect the ability of an animal to evade a predator, and variation in habitat structure often affects speed. Consequently, the escape paths chosen by animals may affect their performance and subsequent survival. Arboreal locomotion is well suited for gaining insight into the choice of escape routes because of the discrete paths formed by branches. Decreased branch diameter and increased angles between branches can significantly decrease locomotor speeds, but no previous study has determined whether arboreal lizards selectively choose alternative paths. We quantified choice of escape paths and locomotor performance of four syntopic species of arboreal Anolis lizards in their natural habitat and in the laboratory. In the field, species with shorter limbs occurred more commonly on narrow perches than did long-limbed species, but all species favoured escape paths with larger-diameter perches and straighter interperch angles. Thus, short-limbed species used narrower perches than long-limbed species merely as a result of what they encountered, rather than as a result of a biased choice at branching points. In natural vegetation, choosing branches with the largest diameter often results in the straightest path. However, in the laboratory, most lizards preferred large-diameter perches with a sharp turn to continuing a straight path onto a small-diameter perch. Although an overriding preference for larger perch diameter may optimize escape speed within a single perch, a maladaptive side-effect could be a compromise of the overall rate of gaining distance from starting points in paths with turns.

AB Colonies of the ant Temnothorax (formerly Leptothorax) albipennis can collectively choose the best of several nest sites, even when many of the active ants who organize the move visit only one site. Previous studies have suggested that this ability stems from the ants' strategy of graded commitment to a potential home. On finding a site, an ant proceeds from independent assessment, to recruiting fellow active ants via slow tandem runs, to bringing the passive bulk of the colony via rapid transports. Assessment duration varies inversely with site quality, and the switch from tandem runs to transports requires that a quorum of ants first be summoned to the site. These rules may generate a collective decision, by creating and amplifying differential population growth rates among sites. We test the importance of these and other known behavioural rules by incorporating them into an agent-based model. All parameters governing individual behaviour were estimated from videotaped emigrations of individually marked ants given a single nest option of either good or mediocre quality. The time course of simulated emigrations and the distribution of behaviour across ants largely matched these observations, except for the speed with which the final transport phase was completed, and the overall emigration speed of one particularly large colony. The model also predicted the prevalence of splitting between sites when colonies had to choose between two sites of different quality, although it correctly predicted the degree of splitting in only four of six cases. It did not fully capture variance in colony performance, but it did predict the emergence of variation in individual behaviour, despite the use of identical parameter values for all ants. The model shows how, with adequate empirical data, the algorithmic form of a collective decision-making mechanism can be captured.

AB The evolution of polyandry remains controversial. Various hypotheses that account for its evolution assume heritable variation in polyandry. We compared the frequency of female remating in 10 strains of the adzuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis, then made crosses between populations of high and low remating frequencies to investigate the mode of inheritance of polyandry. We found significant heritable variation in polyandry between the strains. Lower levels of polyandry were found in populations derived from long-term laboratory cultures than in those from recently established ones, suggesting that a selection pressure favoured monandry in the laboratory cultures. F, offspring from reciprocal crosses between strains with high and low frequencies of female remating had frequencies similar to that of the strain with a high remating frequency, suggesting that polyandry is inherited with dominance in C. chinensis, unlike any other species reported to date. This study indicates that polyandry can evolve in response to selection in C. chinensis.

AB Substrate colour choice can provide a means of predator avoidance through crypsis. We investigated background colour choice in the Pacific treefrog, Hyla regilla, a species that shows a complex colour polymorphism. Individuals from a single population can be fixed in body colour (the nonchanging green or brown individuals) or they can show an ability to change colour between green and brown (colour-changer morph). In the laboratory, we tested background choice behaviour of the nonchanging green and nonchanging brown frogs to determine whether these frogs have a preference for the matching background substrate. Nonchanging green frogs preferentially selected a matching background colour. Such a preference, however, was not observed in nonchanging brown frogs. When tested in the presence of a predator cue, small samples of both nonchanging green and nonchanging brown frogs showed a preference for the matching substrate. We also investigated whether colour-changers have a preference for a background that matches their own body coloration (phenotype matching) at the time of testing. Colour-changers did not select matching substrates. An alternative to phenotype matching is that substrate colour preference (i.e. that shown by nonchanging green frogs) could result from a sensory bias that is genetically linked to body colour. One possible cause of differences in spectral sensitivity and/or hue discrimination is a photopigment polymorphism in the retina. We used electroretinogram techniques to characterize the spectral sensitivity of the retina but found no evidence for differences in spectral sensitivity curves among the three morphs that would suggest a visual pigment polymorphism.

AB Within a female-defence polygynous mating system, males of the lizard A. carolinensis use an array of stereotyped signals and aggressive tactics to acquire and defend long-term territories containing multiple, sedentary females. In competition, body size appears to be important because size of free-ranging males correlates positively with volume of male territories and number of patrolled females. Therefore, an ability to assess body size during territorial contests should be an adaptive attribute that would influence the tactics of intermale aggression. To examine this premise, we staged contests between 10 pairs of males matched for size (i.e. symmetric contests) and 10 pairs mismatched for size (i.e. asymmetric contests), while all 20 pairs of males were matched for habitat resources, a mate, and resident status. Overall, we found (1) contest profiles best fit the features of a 'fixed-phase, sequential assessment' model of game theory, (2) body size and mass were highly correlated with contest outcome, (3) none of 12 signal variables predicted contest, outcome, and (4) paired males generally matched aggressive tactics and signalling behaviours. We also examined the asymmetric contest profiles for deviations from the profiles of symmetric contests. We tested the proposition that smaller males of size-mismatched contests would assess their disadvantage and choose a bluff strategy to mitigate risky behaviour and avoid fighting. We found, however, that the risk-mitigation hypotheses were unsupported. Smaller males were not playing a bluff strategy, but rather a hawk strategy. They initiated risky tactics by (1) invading the habitats of their larger opponents, an act that invited retaliation, (2) showing no tendency' to stay away from larger opponents, (3) maintaining high levels. of aggressive signalling as encounters intensified, and (4) engaging larger opponents in physical fighting, despite losing 90% of their encounters. These empirical results support a recent game theoretical construct ('Napoleon complex') that models size-asymmetric contests in which smaller males initiate fights that they usually lose. Our data suggest that, if smaller males of A. carolinensis have breeding territories, then they will engage in costly contests, despite a low probability of defeating larger and equally motivated opponents.

AB We assessed the effects of different situational or social determinants on the regulation of female-female competition. We carried out a laboratory study to examine aggression and reproductive success of pairs of wild female mice, Mus musculus domesticus spp., as a function of the timing of settlement of females relative to that of males and the genetic relatedness and familiarity between females (sibling versus nonsibling females). After a few days of cohabitation with a male, females were highly aggressive towards, and intolerant of, any intruder female, regardless of relatedness and familiarity. In this condition, monogamy was the resulting mating pattern in approximately 80% of cases. Conversely, pairs of females who made contact With each other at the same time, or prior to cohabitation with a male, showed comparatively little aggression and a high degree of reciprocal tolerance. Only in these latter conditions did genetic relatedness and familiarity between females influence their behavioural interactions and reproductive success. Although nonsibling pairs showed higher frequencies of aggressive interactions than siblings, polygyny resulted in 97% of cases. However, in most sibling groups both the females weaned young and had greater reproductive success than nonsiblings. Nonsibling females appeared to compete for reproduction through the inhibition of reproduction or infanticide. These findings suggest that the timing of male/female settlement in a deme determines the level of female competition, which, in turn, affects the resulting mating pattern. Only when females showed social tolerance did genetic relatedness and familiarity influence reproductive success. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour-Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB 'Sex pheromones' are most commonly seen as mate attraction signals. However, there is growing evidence that chemical signals may also advertise mate quality. Theory predicts that for mate quality signals to be reliable they should be costly, a mechanism that is likely to drive condition-dependent expression of the signal in question. We investigated the relation between pheromone production and life span in Drosophila grimshawi, a lekking fruit fly where males deposit pheromones on the lekking arena. We manipulated pheromone production by subjecting males to another male, a female or no companion twice a week for the duration of their adult lives. We found that long-lived males deposited pheromones for a greater proportion of their lives across treatments. Males that met other males, rather than females or no flies, also deposited pheromones for a greater proportion of their lives. However, this greater investment seemed to be costly since these males also had shorter life spans, presumably as a result of increased pheromone production. Thus, our results support the notion that pheromone production may act as an honest signal of quality. Furthermore, we show that the pheromone has multiple functions and that male D. grimshawi appear to adjust their investment in pheromone production in relation to their social environment.

AB In human voices, low fundamental frequency is thought to be a cue to masculinity and reproductive capability and large vocal tracts are associated with large body size of the speaker. Female preferences for males with low fundamental frequencies and large vocal tract lengths are potentially adaptive. Although sexually dimorphic characteristics of male voices have been studied, the impact of manipulations of secondary sexual characteristics on preferences for male voices has not. We manipulated fundamental frequencies and apparent vocal tract lengths of young adult male voices, both independently and simultaneously, and assessed their impact on female ratings of masculinity, size, age and attractiveness. Lowering the fundamental frequencies and/or increasing apparent vocal tract lengths of male voices increased females' ratings of the masculinity, size and age of the speaker. Peer group females preferred male voices with (1) lowered fundamental frequencies to those with raised fundamental frequencies, and (2) original frequencies to male voices with raised fundamental frequencies and decreased apparent vocal tract lengths (a combined manipulation to reflect acoustic characteristics of 16-year-old male voices). This suggests that male voices with acoustic characteristics that reflect full sexual maturity may be attractive. Although no general preference was observed for male voices with increased or decreased apparent vocal tract lengths, female preferences for male voices with increased apparent vocal tract lengths were positively related to females' own body size. This latter finding may indicate assortative preferences for acoustic cues to body size. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The availability of high-quality egg-laying substrates is likely to determine female reproductive success in insects. The egg-laying substrate may also be a conspecific, which is the case in the golden egg bug Phyllomorpha laciniata, Vill. Female bugs oviposit mainly on nonparental males and other females. Conspecifics are clearly preferred to the bug's food plant. We tested the effect of conspecific density, on female egg laying in two experiments where an egg-laying focal female was accompanied by males, females or both in two sizes of enclosures for 8 days. Fewer eggs were laid in large enclosures than in small ones and an increase in number of conspecifics resulted in more eggs being laid on them. This study shows that conspecifics are an important resource for female golden egg bugs in terms of egg laying. In addition, egg survival is likely to be affected by the female's chances of laying eggs on conspecifics. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Since egg production is nutritionally and energetically expensive, differential allocation theory predicts that females should allocate more resources at laying when mated to an attractive male. Females are also predicted to invest more in sons than in daughters under such conditions, because male offspring should have higher fitness returns than female offspring when fathered by an attractive male. We examined primary resource allocation in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, when mated to both an attractive and an unattractive male. In the first breeding round, as predicted, females mated to attractive males laid heavier eggs, and there was a positive relation between female mass and egg mass. In contrast, for females mated to unattractive males there was no correlation between egg mass and body mass. Mate attractiveness did not affect clutch size or yolk androgen investment. Unexpectedly, in the second breeding round, in which the same females were paired with different males of opposite attractiveness to those in the first round, females did not alter their individual patterns of investment in egg mass. Therefore, we suggest there may be a physiological carryover effect and that females were primed by their first reproductive experience. In both rounds of breeding there was no difference in egg mass or yolk androgen concentration between male or female eggs in either treatment. Similarly, the primary sex ratio did not differ between treatments. This suggests that females do not differentially invest in male and female offspring in relation to the attractiveness of their mate in this species.

AB We used socially learned food preferences of Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, to examine two common predictions of formal models of social learning in animals: (1) that animals living in relatively stable environments should be more attentive to socially acquired information than animals living in highly variable environments, and (2) that older demonstrators should have greater influence than younger demonstrators on the behaviour of young observers. Old and young demonstrators were equally effective in modifying the food preferences of juveniles that interacted with them. However, food choices of rats that were moved daily from one cage to another and fed at unpredictable times for unpredictable periods were less affected by demonstrators than were rats maintained in stable environments. Our results thus provided experimental support for the first, but not the second, prediction from theory. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Parent birds often feed from predictable sites at the nest and nestlings compete for access to positions close to them. Such scrambling for stable parentally favoured positions may relate to optimal foraging theory. For efficient foraging, nestlings should be able to associate begging payoffs with the available positions in the nestcup and use this information to position themselves before parental arrival at the nest. We tested this prediction experimentally in the great tit by keeping nestlings temporarily in the laboratory where they were housed individually in nestboxes identical to their natural boxes. After a period of food deprivation, we quantified their positioning, taking the nest entrance as a reference. Parental feeding locations were measured from videos made at the natural nests, again relative to the nest entrance. As predicted, nestlings in the laboratory boxes chose positions significantly closer to parental feeding sites than expected by chance. Thus, they had knowledge about their parents' habit of feeding from predictable sites, enabling them to navigate and forage efficiently in the nestcup.

AB Most studies of asymmetric contests have focused on interactions between individuals. We examined territorial contests between groups of green woodhoopoes, Phoeniculus purpureus, which take the form of vocal rallying displays. The distribution of encounter durations was bimodal: interactions were generally either decided within 5 min (short contests) or took longer than 15 min to reach an outcome (extended contests). As short contests progressed, there was an escalation in the length of rallies, and these encounters were longer when the competing groups were more evenly matched in size. Residents won the majority of short contests, whereas the difference in the sizes of the competing groups was not a significant predictor of the outcome. The resident group appeared to match the rally length given by the intruding group, tending to lose the contest when it no longer achieved this. In extended contests, there was no further escalation in rally length after the first 5 min. There was also no resident advantage, but larger groups were more likely to win. These extended contests may be a test of stamina. To achieve a similar length of rallying, individuals in smaller groups must contribute more effort than those in larger groups. We discuss the possibility that physiological constraints prevent smaller groups from sustaining the same level of rallying as larger groups, and that this difference decides the outcome of extended contests. We consider the different possible functions of short and extended contests, and discuss our findings in relation to existing models of agonistic interactions.

TI Long-range visibility of greater sage grouse leks: a GIS-based analysis
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID COLOR PATTERNS; AMBIENT LIGHT; DISPERSION; PREDATION; DISPLAY
AB We investigated whether male greater sage grouse, Centrocercus urophasianus, select lek locations on the basis of topographic features that affect their visibility to both conspecific females and a major avian predator, the golden eagle, Aquila chrysaetos. We mapped locations of displaying males at all leks in a local population and used a Geographic Information System (GIS) and digital elevation model (DEM) to generate 'viewsheds' around male locations within a boundary set by the estimated maximal visual acuity of the viewer. Areas visible around leks were compared to those visible around random sites with the same conformation of displaying males. Male sage grouse displayed at sites where surrounding topography both diminished long-range visibility (>1000 m) and enhanced short-range visibility (<500 m) to ground observers. These characteristics could (1) force eagles to monitor lek activity from the air, where they may be more visible to their prey, (2) make displaying males more visible to females and (3) allow males to monitor predators approaching the lek more easily. These results suggest that, in open habitats, visually signalling animals may exploit local topography to control both their visibility to receivers and the visibility of their immediate surroundings.

AB Distress calls were recorded from three sympatric species of pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus nathusii, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus) in England and Northern Ireland. At foraging sites, we conducted playback experiments, consisting of experimental distress call sequences from each species and control sequences of random noise and sound recorded with no bats present. We measured response by simultaneously recording ultrasound during playbacks and counting the echolocation pulses above a predetermined threshold which were then identified to species. All three species responded to each other's calls. The number of recorded echolocation pulses of all species increased eight-fold, on average, during the playback of distress call sequences compared with the playback of ultrasonic noise, and four-fold compared with the playback of silence. In a separate playback experiment, the number of echolocation pulses of P. pygmaeus increased 14-fold during the playback of distress calls of four endemic species of bat from Madagascar (Emballonura atrata, Myotis goudoti, Miniopterus majori and M. manavi) compared with the playback of silence. This increased response might have been caused by the high calling rates of the Malagasy species. Distress calls of P. nathusii, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus were structurally convergent, consisting of a series of downward-sweeping, frequency-modulated elements of short duration and high intensity with a relatively strong harmonic content. Selection may favour convergence in the structure of distress calls among bat species, if attracting heterospecifics increases the chance of repelling predators by mobbing.

AB In most seabird species incubation shifts shorten when hatching approaches, a behavioural response allowing the chick to be fed soon after hatching. Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain these shortened absences: endogenous timing, a response to embryo signals or a seasonal increase in food availability. I tested these hypotheses by cross-fostering eggs between two sibling species: the northern Macronectes halli and the southern M. giganteus giant petrels; the former normally breeds 5-6 weeks earlier than the latter but both have an incubation period of 60 days. The length of the last trip before hatching was unaffected by the timing of hatching, suggesting that trip length was not related to the increase in food availability with the progress of the season. Furthermore, northern giant petrels reduced their last trip lengths regardless of whether they were incubating their own developed or the southern undeveloped egg (with embryos not developed enough to signal). Parents presumably, therefore, possess endogenous control allowing them to predict hatching date and to reduce trip duration accordingly, regardless of the communication with the embryo. Nevertheless, shorter last trips before hatching in southern giant petrels incubating northern giant petrel eggs suggest that parents use embryo signals for a fine-tuning synchronization of the internal timer to the natural variability in the length of the incubation period.

AB Do chimpanzees tailor their communication in accordance with the attentional status of a human observer? We presented 57 chimpanzees with three experimental conditions in randomized order: an experimenter offered a banana to the focal subject (Focal), to a cagemate of the focal subject (In-Cage) and to a chimpanzee in an adjacent cage (Adjacent) while a second experimenter recorded the first and second responses of the focal subject in all three conditions. The chimpanzees' behaviour was mostly visual or bimodal in the Focal condition, changing to auditory behaviour or disengagement in the In-Cage and Adjacent conditions. Thus, with no explicit training and on their first trials in all instances, the chimpanzees tactically deployed their communicative behaviours in the visual and auditory domains in accordance with the manipulated attentional and intentional status of a human observer.

AB Predation risk may compromise the ability of animals to acquire and maintain body reserves by hindering 14 foraging efficiency and increasing physiological stress. Locomotor performance may depend on body mass, so losing mass under predation risk could be an adaptive response of prey to improve escape ability. We studied individual variation in antipredatory behaviour, feeding rate, body mass and escape performance in the lacertid lizard Psammodromus algirus. Individuals were experimentally exposed to different levels of food availability (limited or abundant) and predation risk, represented by reduced refuge availability and simulated predator attacks. Predation risk induced lizards to reduce conspicuousness behaviourally and to avoid feeding in the presence of predators. If food was abundant, alarmed lizards reduced feeding rate, losing mass. Lizards supplied with limited food fed at near-maximum rates independently of predation risk but lost more mass when alarmed; thus, mass losses experienced under predation risk were higher than those expected from feeding interruption alone. Although body mass of lizards varied between treatments, no component of escape performance measured during predator attacks (endurance, speed, escape strategy) was affected by treatments or by variations in body mass. Thus, the body mass changes were consistent with a trade-off between gaining resources and avoiding predators, mediated by hampered foraging efficiency and physiological stress. However, improved escape efficiency is not required to explain mass reduction upon predator encounters beyond that expected from feeding interruption or predation-related stress. Therefore, the idea that animals may regulate body reserves in relation to performance demands should be reconsidered. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   PREFER; ORNAMENTS; FITNESS; MALES
AB It is widely assumed that male competition and female choice select for elaboration of the same male traits and that fighting ability is synonymous with high quality in terms of benefits to females. Under these assumptions, females are expected to use the same traits that reflect fighting ability to choose the most dominant male, even if females are not privy to actual male-male interactions. Few studies, however, have explicitly investigated female choice in relation to male fighting ability. I conducted experiments separating the effects of male competition and female choice in a freshwater fish, the Pacific blue-eye, Pseudomugil signifer, to test whether females prefer dominant males and whether females obtain higher egg hatching success by being choosy. When females were precluded from witnessing agonistic encounters between two potential mates, they did not appear to use traits correlated with fighting ability to choose competitively superior males. However, even when females were privy to competition, witnessing male interactions did not induce a preference for dominant individuals. Lack of preference for superior fighters may be because there was no difference in hatching success between eggs guarded by dominant and subordinate males. Instead, females appeared to prefer males that spent a greater proportion of time engaged in courtship and, in so choosing, enjoyed higher egg hatching success. These results indicate that dominant males are not necessarily more attractive than subordinates nor do the former necessarily guarantee or deliver the kind of benefits that females may seek.

AB The effects of predation on the use of social foraging tactics, such as producing and scrounging, are poorly known in animals. On the one hand, recent theoretical models predict increased use of scrounging with increasing predation risk, when scroungers seeking feeding opportunities also have a higher chance of detecting predators. On the other hand, there may be no relation between tactic use and predation when antipredator vigilance is not compatible with scanning flockmates. We investigated experimentally the effects of predation risk on social foraging tactic use in tree sparrows, Passer montanus. We manipulated predation risk in the field by changing the distance between shelter and a feeder. Birds visited the feeder in smaller flocks, spent less time on it and were somewhat more vigilant far from shelter than close to it. Increased predation risk strongly affected the social foraging tactic used: birds used the scrounger tactic 30% more often far from cover than close to it. Between-flock variability in scrounging frequency was not related to the average vigilance level of the flock members, and within-flock variability in the use of scrounging was negatively related to the vigilance of birds. Our results suggest that in tree sparrows, the increased frequency of scrounging during high predation risk cannot simply be explained by an additional advantage of increasing antipredator vigilance. We propose alternative mechanisms (e.g. increased stochasticity in food supply, and that riskier places are used by individuals with lower reserves) that may explain increased scrounging when animals forage under high predation risk.

AB Female pollinating fig wasp (foundress) reproduction is often reduced when multiple foundresses oviposit in figs, owing to oviposition site limitation or the extra time spent searching for unused sites. In species where foundresses cannot re-emerge from figs (meaning that all reproduction takes place in a single fig), they might therefore be expected to defend sites from competitors. For the first time, we explicitly documented defence by foundresses. Larger Platyscapa awekei foundresses (pollinators of Ficus salicifolia) in two-foundress figs prevented smaller foundresses from ovipositing by holding them in their mandibles while ovipositing themselves, and deposited the same number of eggs as when ovipositing in isolation. Smaller foundresses deposited around 30% fewer eggs. The onset of defence in two-foundress figs depended on larger foundress body size, implying that they made decisions based on their own size relative to the population mean (i.e. the average probability of being successful). Defence was less common in three- than in two-foundress figs, probably because the presence of a third competitor reduced the benefits accrued. We discuss why foundresses use such tactics, and identify other species in which defence may occur. Qualitative behavioural observations and comparative morphology suggest that defence is common, occurring in four pollinator genera. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although courting males are under intense selection to recognize the sex of potential partners, mistakes sometimes occur. Using descriptive and experimental data on garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, from courting aggregations around a communal den in Manitoba, we tested two previously proposed hypotheses that suggest evolutionary significance to such mistakes. One idea, that female mimicry enables a 'she-male' to confuse his rivals within a mating ball, predicts that many mating balls will concurrently contain both she-males and females; where both types of sexual targets are present, males will frequently align their bodies with she-males rather than females. The second idea, that small body size confers a selective advantage to males because it facilitates sex recognition and thus reduces misdirected courtship by other males, predicts that larger males will receive more courtship than their smaller rivals within mating balls. Our results falsify these predictions. Natural courting groups rarely contained both females and female-mimicking males. When both potential sexual targets were present, males essentially ignored she-males. Similarly, male snakes rarely attracted courtship even when they were larger than females. The sensitive chemosensory apparatus of male garter snakes enables these animals to focus their courtship on females, ignoring males that resemble females either physically (body size) or chemically (pheromones). The degree to which a male garter snake resembles females thus has little or no significance for his mating success within a communal mating ball; further work is needed to evaluate the generality of this conclusion for other snake species.

AB In addition to seasonal changes in morphology, physiology and behaviour that occur in predictable annual cycles, there are facultative responses to unpredictable events known as labile (i.e. short-lived) perturbation factors. These rapid behavioural and physiological changes have been termed the 'emergency life-history stage' and serve to enhance lifetime fitness. There are four major components: (1) proactive/reactive coping styles for responding to psychosocial stress, predation, and so forth; (2) fight-or-flight responses to rapid emergencies such as an attack by a predator or sudden severe storm; (3) 'take-it-or-leave-it' behavioural and physiological responses to longer-term perturbations of the physical environment; and (4) sickness behaviour and fever designed to respond to infection. Glucocorticosteroids interact with cytokines and with other hormones in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cascade and in the autonomic nervous system to initiate and orchestrate the emergency life-history stage within minutes to hours. Some traits of the emergency life-history stage include: redirection of behaviour from a normal life-history stage to increased foraging, irruptive-type migration during the day, enhanced restfulness at night, elevated gluconeogenesis, and recovery once the perturbation passes. These physiological and behavioural changes allow an individual to avoid potential deleterious effects of stress that may result from chronically elevated levels of circulating glucocorticosteroids over days and weeks. Thus, acute rises in glucocorticosteroids following perturbations of the environment may serve primarily as 'antistress' hormones, potentially allowing individuals to avoid chronic stress. Several field studies in diverse habitats indicate that individuals in free-living populations show elevated circulating levels of corticosteroids when they are in an emergency life-history stage. Some simple models based on food availability, body condition, social status and life-history stage, may allow predictions of sensitivity of the hypothalamopituitary-adrenal axis to labile perturbation factors. Although there is now extensive evidence for behavioural components of the emergency life-history stage in birds, there remains much to be learned about how other vertebrate groups, especially fish, cope with perturbations of the environment. Because of the unpredictable nature of these perturbations, systematic study of behavioural responses to them is not possible and investigators need to be 'opportunistic'. There is also a growing need to expand our knowledge of these phenomena because human disturbance, global climate change and pollution are all major perturbations of the environment. How vertebrates respond to the unpredictable in general will thus have important conservation value for the future. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Polyandrous females often mate with more than two males, and yet most studies of postcopulatory sexual selection involve only two males. In insects, second-male sperm precedence is usually taken as evidence of overall last-male sperm precedence despite some studies to the contrary. Furthermore, the processes or mechanisms causing the patterns are often unknown and yet are important when estimating how postcopulatory sexual selection might act on males. Whether the patterns and processes change in normal sperm competitive situations and the effects of other factors besides mating order need to be examined to better assess the evolutionary potential of postcopulatory sexual selection. In this study, I assessed the effects of mating interval and number of mating males on sperm precedence patterns and their causal mechanisms in the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor. Last-male sperm precedence was the same when two or three males mated, but also depended on mating intervals and hence mechanisms of paternity bias. However, when females mated with many males, one of the mechanisms no longer created last-male sperm precedence. This example illustrates the importance of knowing both the patterns and mechanisms of paternity bias and whether they change depending on female mating frequency to make reasonable inferences about the potential for postcopulatory sexual selection on males.

AB Ballooning is a widespread behavioural trait in invertebrates, which enhances passive aerial dispersal. We investigated the influence of common lineage (family effect) and postnatal environmental conditions on latency to initiate preballooning tiptoe behaviour (ballooning latency) in the dwarfspider Erigone atra (Blackwall, 1841). The ballooning latency of individual spiders was tested in a specially designed test chamber. In a 3-week experiment, in which the spiders were fed only during the first day of each week, ballooning latency had low repeatability at weekly intervals. Ballooning latency declined with increasing food deprivation during the first week but not during the second and the third weeks. At intervals of less than I h, however, ballooning latency showed high repeatability. We also investigated whether maternal and postnatal environmental conditions (i.e. during juvenile development) influence phenotypic variation in ballooning latency. We reared offspring of several families under two feeding and two temperature conditions. Environmental conditions explained more variation in ballooning latency than family. Ballooning latency was lower in spiders reared at 20degreesC than in those reared at 15degreesC. In addition, spiderlings fed four prey per 3 days were faster ballooners than those fed only four prey per week. An interaction between factors was present, indicating the existence of different reaction norms between the two environmental conditions. The expression of ballooning latency behaviour thus strongly depends on current nutrition, feeding history and the feeding and temperature conditions during juvenile development.

AB We investigated the fitness consequences of divorce in oystercatchers. We made a distinction between two types of divorce: in desertions the disruption of the pair bond is initiated by one of the pair members, and in usurpations by a conspecific individual. Survival and reproduction prospects for oystercatchers are largely determined by their social status (nonbreeder or breeding bird at a site of a specific quality). Changes in social status in relation to divorce showed that birds taking the initiative to leave their mate increased in fitness, relative to birds that were forced to leave their partner. Status of individuals that remained in their territory after divorce was unaffected if their mate was expelled, but declined if their mate deserted. Survival after divorce was significantly lower for birds that were expelled than for those deserting. Divorce rate, and especially desertion rate, was higher among occupants of low- than high-quality territories. In general, divorce rate increased following elevated mortality. In high-quality territories usurpations increased with increasing breeder mortality, but at low-quality territories this relation was absent. Desertion rates were similarly related to mortality in both territory types. Divorce participants thus differed strongly in their fitness prospects, depending on the type of divorce, the role played in the divorce and the quality of the territory where divorce took place. Studies that do not observe the birds during divorce cannot determine the type of divorce and the role played by the individuals, and this may lead to misleading conclusions on the costs and benefits of divorce.

AB Alliances between reproductive males have been described in both cetacean and terrestrial mammal societies, and kin selection theory has often been invoked to explain these stable male coalitions. However, recent studies of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Australia suggest that mechanisms other than kinship are fundamental in the formation of male alliances. We supplemented skin biopsy sampling with the collection of faecal samples from individually recognized wild bottlenose dolphins, T. truncatus, to assess the role of kin selection in alliance membership in the northeast Bahamas. Stable alliances between pairs of males were identified based on association analyses of individual photoidentification data collected over 4 years. Molecular genetic analyses of tissue samples revealed highly significant correlations between patterns of association and both mitochondrial DNA haplotype identity and microsatellite relatedness, indicating that males within long-term alliances are more closely related than expected by chance. These data reinforce the high degree of plasticity previously reported within the genus Tursiops, and suggest that social and ecological differences between populations can markedly affect the role of kin selection in determining social alliances between male bottlenose dolphins.

AB During the incubation period, white-chinned petrels, Procellaria aequinoctialis, repeatedly make foraging trips of several thousand kilometres in the open ocean from their small isolated breeding island. To test whether these birds rely on geomagnetic information to home, we displaced five individuals and released them in the open sea 300-360 km from home. They were prevented both from using route-based information during the passive displacement from the breeding island to the release site, and from using the geomagnetic field at the release site and on their way home (by carrying a mobile magnet on the head). They were equipped with satellite transmitters to record their homing movements. The five petrels homed efficiently (in 17-32 h) along paths that were on average slightly less than twice the homing distance. This showed that, at least when within a few hundred kilometres of home, white-chinned petrels are able to home successfully by relying only on nongeomagnetic site-dependent information.

AB Some fish, including the guppy, have the ability to perceive ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Female guppies prefer to associate with males that are viewed under light conditions that include UV-A, in preference to conditions lacking these wavelengths. We used reflexion spectrophotometry to show that male guppies reflect UV light from both their structural (purple, green and white) and pigment (orange) colour patches and that males differ in the levels of UV light reflected. Varying components of UV may affect both the brightness and hue of particular colour patches. This may produce nonspectral colours that are visible to the guppy but that are outside human perception. We used video analysis to quantify male reflexion in the UV and visible wavebands. Male guppies with high and low UV reflexion, but similar human-visible coloration and area of coloration, were paired for use in mate choice experiments. Female guppies shown pairs of males differing in their levels of UV reflexion had no preference for either high or low UV reflexion. This suggests that UV reflexion does not provide particularly significant information relating to male quality or influence female preference in this population of guppies.

ID AGONISTIC DISPLAYS; FIGHTING BEHAVIOR; COMMUNICATION; STRATEGY;
   DOMINANCE; EVOLUTION; HONEST
AB It is generally accepted that threat displays have signal function and serve to repel opponents, but why they should have such an effect is a matter of debate. Using videotaped interactions from 2 years and nine flocks each year, we analysed the pattern of occurrence of agonistic displays and attacks in captive flocks of wintering great tits, Parus major. One currently influential perspective is to view threat interactions as sequences of distinct moves and countermoves, in which stronger threats can reliably indicate aggressive motivation because they carry a cost of eliciting counterattacks from certain opponents. We found little evidence for this kind of mechanism operating in great tits. Another possibility is that social dominance is important in ensuring reliable communication, for instance because an individual needs both to display and to attack to maintain its rank. It would be hard to test the importance of this kind of mechanism directly, but our observations were consistent with such an idea. Dominants won the majority of bouts of interaction and had higher rates of display and attack than subordinates, but a subordinate could temporarily overcome a dominant through intense aggression. We also found that the level of displaying in one bout provided information about the rate of aggression in following bouts. As a general interpretation of great tit aggressive behaviour, we suggest that particular displays form part of a graded signal of motivational state, so that a greater rate of displaying or a greater proportion of intense displays, together with a greater rate of attacking, correspond to a greater aggressive motivation.

AB We investigated age-related changes in exploratory drive and anxiety in a plus-maze paradigm. We observed the behaviour of outbred CD-1 mice, Mus musculus, of both sexes at three ages: juvenile (35 days), adolescent (48 days) and adult (61 days). Juvenile and adult mice strongly avoided the open arms of the apparatus, suggesting high levels of anxiety. In contrast, adolescents spent similar amounts of time in both open and closed arms. They also entered the open arms more quickly and more often than the other age groups. No age-related differences were found in the frequency of the stretched-attend posture, a behavioural pattern considered to indicate risk assessment. The data can be interpreted in terms of either an increased exploratory drive or reduced environment-related anxiety, or both, during the adolescent period. This is consistent with previous evidence of elevated levels of novelty seeking and reduced behavioural and physiological responses to stressful situations in mice and rats around this age.

AB We examined genetic consequences of basic predictions of life history and sexual selection theory in a wild population of redfronted lemurs. Because group living in lemurs evolved independently from other primates, and because polygynous lemurs deviate in several sexually selected traits from theoretical predictions, data on genetic correlates of their social and mating systems can make important contributions to studies of convergence in social evolution, but such data are not available from wild populations. We extracted DNA from tissue samples obtained from 59 animals living in Kirindy forest, Madagascar, and examined individual variability at several microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial D-loop. We found that closely related females of a single matriline formed the core of the four main study groups. Virtually all haplotypes of adult males differed from those of coresident females, and many male haplotypes were represented by only one or two individuals. Paternity analyses for infants from groups with detailed behavioural data revealed that a disproportionate share of infants were sired by the central, dominant male of a group, despite promiscuous mating. Extragroup paternities were not detected. The skew in male reproductive success cannot be reconciled with the lack of sexual dimorphism and the even adult sex ratios. We therefore conclude that these group-living lemurs converge with many other primates in sex-specific life history trajectories, including female philopatry and male dispersal, but that the observed skew in male reproductive success makes the apparent lack of adaptation to intrasexual selection in certain behavioural; demographic and morphological traits even more puzzling.

AB The maintenance of female polyandry has traditionally been attributed to the material (direct) benefits derived from male mating resources (e.g. nuptial gifts) accrued by multiple mating. However, genetic (indirect) benefits offer a more robust explanation since only polyandrous, not monandrous, females may gain both material benefits from multiple mating and genetic benefits from multiple sires. Discriminating between material and genetic benefits is essential when addressing the mechanism by which polyandry is adaptively maintained, but are difficult to disentangle because they affect fitness in similar ways. To test the hypothesis that genetic benefits maintain polyandry, we compared four components of fitness (longevity, fecundity, hatching success and survivorship) between monandrous and polyandrous females in the ground cricket, Allonemobius socius. We discovered that females derived nongenetic benefits from mating multiply, in that the magnitude of the nuptial gift was positively, associated with the number of eggs produced. However, polyandrous females had over a two-fold greater hatching success and a 43% greater offspring survivorship, leading to a significantly higher relative fitness than the monandrous strategy. These results were independent of the confounding effects of material benefits, implying that genetic contributions play a large role in the maintenance of polyandry and potentially in the antagonistic coevolutionary relationship between polyandry and male nuptial gifts.

AB Free-flying honeybees, Apis mellifera, learn visual stimuli in the appetitive context of food search. Visual compound stimuli are relevant in nautre as bees learn flower images that consist of many visual elements. We studied whether elemental associations between each visual element and the reinforcement (elemental approach) are enough to explain the solving of visual discrimination problems that raise ambiguity at the elemental level. We asked whether bees could solve three different visual discriminations: (1) positive patterning (A-, B-, AB+); (2) negative patterning (A+, B+, AB-); and (3) biconditional discrimination (AB+, CD+, AC-, BD-). In experiments 1 and 2 bees had to discriminate a yellow-violet chequerboard from the yellow or the violet squares alone. In experiment 3, four different gratings combining one colour (yellow or violet) with one orientation (vertical or horizontal) had to be discriminated. In all three problems binary compounds were trained in such a way that each element appeared equally often as rewarded and nonrewarded. Bees could solve the three discrimination problems. They always chose the reinforced stimulus despite ambiguity at the level of the elements. For solving positive patterning, elemental processing could be used. For negative patterning and biconditional discrimination, nonelemental processing strategies (unique-cue or configural approach) are necessary to account for these results. Although we cannot decide between a configural and a unique-cue interpretation, we can clearly reject purely elemental processing in these cases.

AB The ability to discriminate odour cues from different conspecifics has been demonstrated in a variety of small mammalian species. We used a habituation-dishabituation procedure to investigate whether 10-week-old female pigs, Sus scrofa, are able to discriminate between urinary odours from similar-aged conspecifics that were unfamiliar (not encountered for at least 7 weeks). We also examined whether environmental factors can affect the ease with which urine fro m different individuals is discriminated.. Subjects receiving urine samples from the same unfamiliar individual in two successive 2-min exposures separated by a 15-min interval showed habituation in their investigation response to, the urine in the second exposure. This habituation was maintained in a third 2-min exposure, 15 min later, if the urine sample was again from the same individual. However, if the urine sample was from a different unfamiliar individual, there was a dishabituation of the investigation response. This,was taken to indicate an ability to discriminate the two samples. These data indicate that young pigs could use urinary cues to discriminate other individuals. Effective individual discrimination should facilitate the formation and maintenance of stable social groupings but could be disrupted if, for example, animals from the same group share common odour cues that mask individually distinctive scents. However, urine samples from individuals living in the same group appeared to be no more difficult to discriminate than those from individuals living in different groups.

TI Collective control of nest climate parameters in bumblebee colonies

ID CARBON-DIOXIDE; APIS-MELLIFERA
AB We examined two aspects of the social control of nest climate in bumblebee colonies: which parameters of nest climate bumblebees actively down-regulate by fanning and the dynamics of the colony response as colony size increased. Colonies of. Bombus terrestris were exposed to an increase. in carbon dioxide, temperature or relative humidity. We performed 70 temperature trials (six colonies), 58 CO2 trials (four colonies) and four humidity trials (two colonies). An increase in CO2 concentration and temperature elicited a fanning response whereas an increase in relative humidity did not. This is the first report of fanning in bumblebee colonies to control respiratory gases. The number of fanning bees increased with stimulus intensity. The colony response to a CO2 concentration of 3.2% was comparable to the colony response to a temperature of 30degreesC. A marked fanning response occurred at 1.6% CO2, a concentration never exceeded in a large field nest during a pilot measurement of 10 days. We investigated the colony response over a wide range of colony sizes (between 10 and 119 workers). The proportion of the total workforce invested by colonies in nest ventilation did not change significantly; thus, the number of fanning workers increased with colony size. Furthermore, as colony size increased, the dynamics of the colony response changed: colonies responded faster to perturbations of their environment when they were large (60 or more individuals) than when they were small (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We quantified the acoustic characteristics of the habitats of two wild populations of pygmy marmosets, in Amazonian Ecuador to evaluate their effects on vocal signal structure. We obtained measures of ambient noise, sound attenuation and reverberation through recordings and broadcasts of exemplars of two short-range vocalizations and one long-range vocalization of the marmosets. Ambient noise levels differed among habitats. The calls of pygmy marmosets had frequencies that coincided with relatively quiet regions of the ambient noise spectra of the habitats. The three vocalization types were degraded similarly in all habitats. The two short-range signals, with a pulsatile structure, were more affected by reverberation than was the long-range, less pulsatile vocalization. This degradation could be used by the marmosets to estimate the distance of the caller animals. We obtained data on context of vocalizations from six groups of pygmy marmosets, three from each population, in both the dry and rainy seasons. The use of Trills, J calls and Long calls was related to the distance between the calling animal and the potential receivers suggesting that marmosets are using the calls in a way appropriate to the effects of habitat acoustics.

AB Experimental analyses of dynamic visual signals have to overcome the technical obstacle of reproducing complex motor patterns such as those found in courtship and threat displays. Video playback offers a potential solution to this problem, but it has recently been criticized because of sensory differences between humans and nonhuman animals, which suggest that video stimuli might be perceived as deficient relative to live conspecifics. Quantitative comparisons are therefore necessary to determine whether video sequences reliably evoke natural responses. Male Jacky dragons, Amphibolurus muricatus, compete for territories using complex displays delivered in a rapid stereotyped sequence. We evaluated video playback as a technique for studying this visual signal. Digital video sequences depicting a life-sized displaying male were indistinguishable from live male conspecifics in the rate and structure of aggressive displays evoked. Other measures of social behaviour suggested that video stimuli were more effective in this context. Lizards produced significantly more appeasement displays and had higher rates of substrate licking and locomotor activity in response to video playback than to confined male opponents, which failed to produce aggressive displays. Lizards tracked temporal changes in the display rate of video stimuli and were also sensitive to individual differences in morphology and behaviour between video exemplars. These results show that video stimuli are appropriate for the experimental analysis of Jacky dragon aggressive displays. We compare the potential shortcomings of video playback with those of other techniques and conclude that no approach offers a panacea, but that several have complementary characteristics.

AB Patterns of time allocation to different activities can help reveal how natural selection has solved optimality problems that involve simultaneous environmental constraints. To investigate how time budgets of desert birds are affected by ambient temperature, lack of drinking water and low food availability, we provided food and water to hoopoe-larks, Alaemon alaudipes, in the Arabian Desert during years in which no larks reared young. We followed birds continuously from sunrise to sunset on unsupplemented and supplemented days, and recorded their behaviour every 15 s. Taking into account the variation in temperature between days, hoopoe-larks decreased foraging time by 13-29% of total daytime, and increased resting and preening time by 7-16 and 8%, respectively, when they had access to supplemental food. When birds had access to extra food, they began and ended their midday resting period when shade temperature was on average 2.2degreesC lower, and operative temperature was on average 3.1degreesC lower, than on unsupplemented days, a significant effect of food supplementation. We concluded that birds optimized time spent on foraging and thermoregulating based on a combination of physiological state variables, including body temperature, hydration state and level of energy reserves. Our results do not support a previous hypothesis that activity budgets of desert birds are dictated by thermal constraints alone. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Females failed to show a preference for conspecific males with swords when presented with live males naturally varying in sword length, with live males of manipulated sword length, and with synthetic animations of males expressing natural variation in sword length. Females showed a significant bias against swords when presented with synthetic animations bearing supernormal sword characteristics. The reduced preference for swords, relative to closely related fish, may result from an increase in the cost of choice due to predation risk, selection against mating with heterospecifics, or changes in the spatial and contrast properties of the conspecific signal.

   SELECTION; PARASITES; TRAITS
AB Carotenoid colour displays are widely assumed to be honest indicators of individual health or quality, primarily in mate attraction. Here we show that sexually dimorphic carotenoid ornamentation functions as an agonistic signal in male red-collared widowbirds, Euplectes ardens. Mounted mate models differing (within natural limits) in the intensity of carotenoid signalling were presented to wild resident males as simulated intruders, perched or made to 'fly' across the territory with the elongated tail folded or keeled. Perched mounts were generally ignored, and stronger aggression towards 'flying' models with a keeled tail (i.e. as in courtship display) than a folded tail suggests the tail display is used to assess the intention of intruding males. Territory owners were less aggressive towards models with intense collar display, suggesting that carotenoid coloration functions as a badge of status in this species. The level of aggressive response was also related to the resident's own badge in that males with larger, redder collars responded more aggressively to the models. In addition, males with a larger collar signal defended larger territories and spent less time in territory defence. Apart from the collar size and 'redness', no other morphological variable predicted the aggressive response of territorial males. Given the previously demonstrated insignificance of the collar in female mate choice, we suggest that the nuptial carotenoid coloration is an honest signal of dominance or fighting ability, sexually selected through male contest competition over territories.

   <i>Sycoscapter australis</i>
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID LOCAL MATE COMPETITION; SEX-RATIO; CONSTRAINTS; VIRGINITY; SIZE
AB Fatal fights are rare in the majority of animal species but are a common component of mate competition between wingless males of some species of fig-associated wasps. We investigated fatal fighting in Sycoscapter australis, a nonpollinating fig wasp found in the syconia (inflorescences) of the Moreton Bay fig, Ficus macrophylla. Overall, about 25% of males sustained fatal injuries during the mate competition period. Measurement and analysis of 349 males revealed a sevenfold difference in mandible size between the largest and smallest individuals, as well as evidence for dimorphism in the mandibles, which showed positive allometry in relation to other body parts. Small and large males did not differ significantly in their injury levels. Mandibles are the main weapons used in fights and injury levels were highest in syconia where males on average had larger mandibles. Injury levels also increased with the estimated operational sex ratio in a syconium, although this variable explained little of the variation. In contrast to the usual assumptions about wingless male fig wasps, a significant number (17%) of males emerged from their natal syconia. Females emerged at a fairly constant rate over many hours, consistent with contest competition between males for access to matings. In contrast, the more numerous females of the pollinating wasp species Pleistodontes froggatti showed a strong peak in emergence, consistent with scramble competition between males for access to mates.

AB Hygienic behaviour, an intranidal task performed by middle-aged worker bees is an important behavioural mechanism of resistance to disease and to attack by Varroa destructor, an ectoparasitic mite. We studied the effect of a colony's genotypic composition on the expression of this behaviour among worker bees by creating normal age-structured colonies with different proportions of bees belonging to hygienic and nonhygienic lines. We established four colonies with 0, 25, 50 or 100% of worker bees belonging to the hygienic line. Analyses of the behaviour of hygienic bees in these colonies indicated that the performance of hygienic behaviour depended on the proportion of hygienic bees in the colony. Hygienic bees in the 25% hygienic colony performed the behaviour well beyond middle age and were more persistent at the task compared with bees from the same genetic line in the other colonies. However, the colony with all worker bees from the hygienic line was more efficient in achieving the task despite a lack of persistence. We also observed that in the colony with 50 and 100% hygienic bees, the behaviour was partitioned into subtasks, and some bees performed the subtask of uncapping cells at higher frequencies than the subtask of removing cell contents. These results suggest that a colony's genotypic composition influences the performance and partitioning of hygienic behaviour. We propose that the performance of hygienic behaviour and its partitioning into subtasks could be determined by response thresholds of individual worker bees and that the rate of behavioural ontogeny may be controlled by the demand for specific tasks.

TI Roaring and social communication in African lions: the limitations
   imposed by listeners
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID RED DEER; EVOLUTION; PLAYBACK; MALES
AB In some social mammals, loud calling not only serves to advertise ownership of a territory and attract mates but also plays a vital role in allowing social companions to maintain contact when they are separated by long distances. Under these circumstances, individuals that are not territory owners but that call in the context of social cohesion or mate attraction could risk inviting escalated contests from territorial competitors. Here we present observations and playback experiments demonstrating that nomadic male lions (Panthera leo) do not roar despite the likely importance of roaring in maintaining social ties with other males in their coalition, on which their subsequent reproductive success depends. Instead, roaring is confined to males that are resident in prides and prepared to escalate in contest situations. Roaring is a flexible behaviour that is sensitive to temporal changes in status; resident males remain silent outside of their territories even when presented with playbacks of unfamiliar males roaring, and nomadic males start roaring only when they are taking over a pride. Our study suggests that individuals of social species may avoid giving important long-distance signals in circumstances where it would pay them to conceal their presence from eavesdroppers.

AB Increased mortality in the presence of stress may result from stress-reduced availability of energy for immune function, coupled with the presence of pathogens or parasites. We tested the hypothesis that stress reduces antiparasite responses of damselflies Ischnura verticalis (Hagen) to their ectoparasitic mites Arrenurus pseudosuperior (Marshall). Numbers of colonizing mites did not differ between nutritionally stressed and unstressed damselflies. However, unstressed damselflies successfully removed more attached mites than nutritionally stressed host larvae. Furthermore, certain damselfly behaviours increased in the presence of nonfeeding mite larvae. Some of these behaviours were effective in defending against mites, but were reduced by nutritional stress. These results are-sufficient to explain inverse relations found between damselfly condition and intensity of mite parasitism seen in nature, and are likely to be applicable to other host-ectoparasite associations.

AB Long-call vocalizations have been hypothesized to serve as communicative signals both within and between tamarin species. Prior evidence for the use of long calls as interspecific signals, however, is based solely on observations of apparent countercalling between species. I conducted playback experiments with groups of wild saddle-back tamarins, Saguinus fuscicollis, and emperor tamarins, S. imperator, to test the hypothesis that long calls function as interspecific signals between tamarin species forming polyspecific associations. Results show that in the absence of any other external cues, lone groups of saddle-back tamarins and emperor tamarins respond to the playback of long calls from both conspecific group members and heterospecific tamarins with which they associate. Playback of long calls from heterospecific tamarins elicited long calls and approaches towards the speaker. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that long calls serve as interspecific signals between associating tamarin species. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We studied chacma baboons', Papio cynocephalus ursinus, responses to conspecific 'barks' in a free-ranging population in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. These barks grade from tonal, harmonically rich calls to calls having a noisier, harsher structure. Tonal or clear barks are typically given when the signaller is at risk of losing contact with the group or when a mother and infant have become separated ('contact barks'). The harsher variants are given in response to predators ('alarm barks'). In both contexts, however, we also observed acoustically intermediate forms. Using the habituation-recovery method we tested whether baboons discriminated between (1) clear contact barks versus harsh alarm barks, and (2) clear contact barks versus intermediate alarm barks. Calls were selected according to the results of a discriminant function analysis conducted on a suite of acoustic parameters. In these experiments, animals showed a significant recovery of response only after playback of the harsh alarm call. We performed another set of experiments using single exemplars of clear and intermediate contact barks, or intermediate and harsh alarm barks. Animals responded only to the playback of a harsh alarm bark. Apparently, only this harsh variant was placed in a category that warranted a response. We hypothesize that baboons' responses were to a large degree influenced by their assessment of context. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated size-dependent mate choice in the stalk-eyed fly Cyrtoniopsis dalmanni. In this species, females prefer to mate with males with larger eyespans. We experimentally manipulated female eyespan by rearing larvae at different densities. The mating preferences of females with small and large eyespans were compared in choice chambers containing two males that differed in eyespan. Neither type of female distinguished between males with small differences in eyespan ((X) over bar =1.45 mm), but both preferred the male with the wider eyespan when the difference between males was large ((X) over bar =3.17 mm). When presented with an intermediate difference in male eyespan ((X) over bar =2.40 mm), large-eyespan females showed a significantly stronger preference than small-eyespan females for the male with the wider eyespan. Size-dependent mate choice in stalk-eyed flies is probably caused by small-eyespan females being less able to discriminate differences between males. It may also reflect female condition, as eyespan is highly correlated with body size, which is a strong predictor of developmental conditions.

AB We investigated the effect of the calls of male Mallorcan midwife toads, Alytes muletensis, on the reproductive condition of females. We used three groups of gravid laboratory-reared females. One group was kept in silence, one group was played heterospecific male calls and one group was played conspecific male calls. Only the females that heard conspecific male calls continued to ripen and mature their eggs while females in the other two groups reabsorbed resources from their eggs. We conclude that conspecific male calls have a stimulatory effect on the reproductive physiology of females, such that gravid females hearing the calls maintain their reproductive condition. The calls of male frogs have previously been shown to act only in male-male competition and to attract females. This is the first experiment to show that the call of a male frog affects the reproductive status of females. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Winter residency is characteristic of the majority of cooperatively breeding birds, but the composition and dynamics of winter groups have been examined in relatively few. In 1996-1998, we examined winter territoriality in the western bluebird, a year-round resident that shows a limited degree of helping behaviour in central;coastal California, U.S.A. Ln spring, most western bluebirds breed as socially monogamous pairs, but a small proportion of pairs (3-16%) have additional breeding-age males helping at the nest, usually assisting parents or brothers. We found that year-round residents commonly wintered; in family groups that defended territories similar to those used in spring. Winter groups had an even sex ratio and formed early in the autumn, when hatch-year birds dispersed. More females than males left their natal groups to be replaced by an influx of immigrant hatch-year birds. Winter groups typically consisted of breeders and one or two sons from the prior breeding season along with one or more immigrant females. A second period of dispersal-occurred in spring when winter groups broke up and most birds other than the breeding pair left the winter territory. When they bred, yearling males and females often bred with unrelated individuals from their winter groups. Sons were more likely to remain on the study area as yearlings when they wintered with both parents than when they wintered with just one parent. We suggest that young males stay the winter due to benefits of remaining in family groups on mistletoe-based winter territories. Subsequent localized dispersal of sons then leads to opportunistic kin-based interactions later in life. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Migrating insects may fly over large bodies of water that lack landmarks, but little is known about their ability to navigate in such a fluid environment. Using boat navigation instruments to measure compensation for fluctuations in crosswind drift, I investigated the ability of butterflies (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae, Nymphalidae and Pieridae) to orient with and without landmarks as they migrated naturally over the Caribbean Sea. I used the presence or absence of landmarks or clouds to evaluate their use by the butterflies as guides for compensation. Forty-one per cent of the butterflies compensated for crosswind drift, whereas only 16% did not compensate. No conclusion could be drawn for the remainder. Without landmarks or clouds, butterflies were significantly less likely to compensate for drift than when these local cues were present. Butterflies were more likely to compensate fully in the presence of a landmark than when only clouds were present. Phoebis sennae butterflies drifted in the morning and over-compensated for drift in the afternoon, a pattern found both within and between individuals independent of landmarks. Although I cannot exclude the use of clouds, this would probably result in undercompensation. Hence, a ground reference in conjunction with a sun or magnetic compass is the most likely orientation cue. In the absence of clouds, one butterfly compensated, at least in part, indicating that it was using ripples on the sea surface as a ground reference in conjunction with a sun or magnetic compass.

AB Male Puget Sound white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys pugetensis, form large vocal dialects along the Pacific northwest coast of North America. Most adult males sing a single song dialect throughout their lives. To determine how dialects are maintained in this species, I studied two populations at the Columbia River mouth in a contact zone between two dialects. Singers of each of the two dialects clustered together in space, forming local song 'neighbourhoods'. Two hypotheses for the maintenance of dialects were tested. The late acquisition hypothesis predicts that yearling or adult male immigrants memorize their song from the territory neighbours they settle next to. The selective attrition hypothesis predicts that males memorize a variety of dialects early in life, overproduce song dialects upon arrival, and later selectively retain the one prelearned dialect that best matches what their neighbours sing. In 1997 and 1998, 35-40% of new territory occupants sang two dialects upon arrival in April, and then over the course of days to several weeks, discarded one dialect from their repertoire. Fourteen of 16 (88%) kept as their adult song the dialect that matched the dialect sung by the majority of their neighbours. No male added a new dialect to his repertoire after arrival, nor did males alter their retained dialect to more closely resemble their neighbours' songs. New arrivals that overproduced dialects upon arrival were significantly more likely to match their neighbours' dialect than males that did not overproduce upon arrival. In a playback experiment, males in the overproduction stage engaged in matched countersinging to the dialect played to them. These observations and the experiment support the selective attrition hypothesis: males visit and memorize a variety of dialects, probably in their hatching-year summer, overproduce dialects upon arrival the next spring, and then selectively retain the one dialect that matches the local song culture. Vocal plasticity late in life is not the result of a late sensitive phase for song memorization, but rather results from behavioural selection operating on a pre-existing repertoire of song dialects.

AB We describe temporal patterns of change in paternal behaviour and urinary concentrations of the steroid hormones testosterone (T) and oestradiol (E-2) in male black tufted-ear marmosets, Callithrix kuhlii, relative to the birth of their young, and test predictions of the hypotheses that (1) high levels of T are incompatible with paternal care and (2) levels of T and E2 vary with a father's prior experience in his family group. After young were born, levels of urinary T and E-2 remained near prepartum concentrations and rates at which fathers carried infants were below peak levels until the approximate time that postpartum mating ordinarily occurs, suggesting a possible trade-off between readiness to mate and paternal behaviour in C. kuhhi. Infant-carrying behaviour of fathers occurred at its highest rate 3-4 weeks after parturition and coincided with significant declines in urinary levels of T and E-2 providing preliminary support for the hypothesis that these hormones are antagonistic to paternal behaviour. Urinary T and E2 declined among fathers regardless of whether their young survived to weaning or died at birth, indicating that variation in these hormones after parturition occurs even in the absence of continued stimuli from infants. When adjusted for declines ordinarily associated with aging, urinary T tended to be lower among fathers with a great deal of prior experience caring for young compared with fathers having little or no experience, suggesting that either experience affects T levels of fathers, or that T levels influence fathers' chances of successfully rearing infants. Overall, our results suggest that in male C. kuhlii, T, and possibly E-2, play an important role in balancing the expression of paternal care with that of other reproductive behaviours.

AB Conspicuous behaviour, such as sexual advertisement, exposes animals to predation; mate attraction thus often conflicts with antipredator behaviour. We investigated whether an avian predator, the brown skua, Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi, uses the mate attraction calls of colonial seabirds, the petrels. The majority of petrels attract mates at night and vocalizations are their main way of communicating. At our study sites, skua predation on nocturnal petrels was heavy, and concentrated particularly on a single species, the blue petrel, Halobaena caerulea. Using playback experiments, we showed that skuas can use male petrel calls as a cue for prey location and selection. This listening behaviour of skuas probably imposes a major constraint on advertising petrels, and especially on single males which face a trade-off between attracting females (which respond by calling in flight) and avoiding predation. We also investigated the consequences of this predation risk on the behaviour of petrels: a second set of playback experiments showed that the most heavily preyed on petrel species could use skua territorial calls to infer predation risk and stop calling thereafter, which may reduce conspicuousness and predation risk.

ID CAPTIVE FLOCKS; SPICE FINCHES; GAME; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIOR
AB When foraging together, animals are often observed to feed from food discoveries of others. The producer-scrounger (PS) game predicts how frequently this phenomenon of food parasitism should occur. The game assumes: (1) at any moment all individuals can unambiguously be categorized as either playing producer (searching for undiscovered food resources) or scrounger (searching for exploitation opportunities), and (2) the payoffs received from the scrounger tactic are negatively frequency dependent; a scrounger does better than a producer when the scrounger tactic is rare, but worse when it is common. No study to date has shown that the payoffs of producer and scrounger conform to the game's assumptions or that groups of foragers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of scrounger, whereby both tactics obtain the same payoff. The current study of three captive flocks of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata, provides the first test of the PS game using an apparatus in which both assumptions of the PS game are met. The payoffs to the scrounger, measured as feeding rate (seeds/s), were highly negatively frequency dependent on the frequency of scrounger. The feeding rate for scrounger declined linearly while the rate for producer either declined only slightly or not at all with increasing scrounger frequency. When given the opportunity to alternate between tactics, the birds changed their use of each, such that the group converged on the predicted SEF of scrounger after 5-8 days of testing. Individuals in this study, therefore, demonstrated sufficient plasticity in tactic use such that the flock foraged at the SEF of scrounger. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Antipredator behaviour of prey costs time and energy, at the expense of other activities. However, not all predators are equally dangerous to all prey some may have switched to feeding on another prey species, making them effectively harmless. To minimize costs, prey should therefore invest in antipredator behaviour only when dangerous predators are around. To distinguish these from harmless predators, prey may use cues related to predation on conspecifics, such as odours released by a predator that has recently eaten conspecific prey or alarm pheromones released by attacked prey. We studied refuge use by a herbivorous/omnivorous thrips, Frankliniella occinentalis, in response to odours associated with a generalist predatory bug, Orius laevigatus, fed either with conspecific thrips or with other prey. The refuge used by thrips larvae is the web produced by its competitor, the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, where thrips larvae experience lower predation risk because the predatory bug is hindered by the web. Thrips larvae moved into this refuge when odours associated with predatory bugs that had previously fed on thrips were present, whereas odours from predatory bugs that had fed on other prey had less effect. We discuss the consequences of this antipredator behaviour for population dynamics. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Theory suggests that male fitness generally increases steadily with mating rate, while one or a few matings are sufficient for females to maximize their reproductive success. Contrary to these predictions, however, females of the majority of insects mate multiply. We performed a meta-analysis of 122 experimental studies addressing the direct effects of multiple mating on female fitness in insects. Our results clearly show that females gain directly from multiple matings in terms of increased lifetime offspring production. Despite a negative effect of remating on female longevity in species without nuptial feeding, the positive effects (increased egg production rate and fertility) more than outweigh this negative effect for moderate mating rates. The average direct net fitness gain of multiple mating was as high;as 30-70%. Therefore, the Evolutionary maintenance of polyandry in insects can be understood,solely in terms bf direct effects. However, our results also strongly support the existence of an intermediate optimal female mating rate, beyond which a further elevated mating rate is deleterious. The existence of such optima implies that sexual conflict over the mating rate should be very common in insects, and that sexually antagonistic coevolution plays a key role in the evolution of mating systems and of many reproductive traits. We discuss the origin and maintenance of nuptial feeing in the light of our findings, and suggest that elaborate and nutritional ejaculates may be the result of sexually antagonistic coevolution. Future research should aim at gaining a quantitative understanding of the evolution of female mating rates, (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) share food even if separated by a mesh restraint. Pairs of capuchins were moved into a test chamber in which one of them received apple pieces for 20 min, and the other received carrot pieces for the next 20 min. Previous research had shown a correlation between the rate of food transfer in both directions across female-female dyads. The present study confirmed this result. Reciprocity across dyads can be explained, however, by symmetry in affiliative and tolerant tendencies between two individuals, provided these tendencies determine food sharing. The present study was designed to exclude this symmetry-based explanation by testing each pair (N=16) of adult females on six separate occasions. There existed a significant covariation across tests of sharing in both dyadic directions, a result unexplained by relationship symmetry. Moreover, control procedures (i.e. testing of a food possessor without a partner, or testing of two individuals with the same food or two different foods at the same time) indicated that behaviour during food trials is not fully explained by mutual attraction or aversion. The monkeys take the quality of their own and the partner's food into account, and possessors limit transfers of high-quality foods. Instead of a symmetry-based reciprocity explanation, a mediating role of memory is suggested, and a mirroring of social attitude between partners.

AB The ecological constraints hypothesis is widely accepted as an explanation for the evolution of delayed dispersal in cooperatively breeding birds. Intraspecific studies offer the strongest support. Observational studies have demonstrated a positive association between the severity of ecological constraints and the prevalence of cooperation, and experimental studies in which constraints on independent breeding were relaxed resulted in helpers moving to adopt the vacant breeding opportunities. However, this hypothesis has proved less successful in explaining why cooperative breeding has evolved in some species or lineages but not in others; Comparative studies have failed to identify ecological factors that differ consistently between cooperative and noncooperative species. The life history hypothesis, which emphasizes the role of life history traits in the evolution of cooperative breeding, coffers a solution to this difficulty. A recent analysis showed that low adult mortality and low dispersal predisposed certain lineages to show cooperative behaviour, given the right ecological conditions. This represents an important advance, not least by offering an explanation for the patchy phylogenetic distribution of cooperative breeding. We discuss the complementary nature of these two hypotheses and suggest that rather than regarding life history traits as predisposing and ecological factors as facilitating cooperation, they are more likely to act in concert. While acknowledging that different cooperative systems may be a consequence of different selective pressures, we suggest that to identify the key differences between-cooperative and noncooperative species, a broad constraints hypothesis that incorporates ecological and life history traits in a single measure of 'turnover of breeding opportunities' may provide the most promising avenue for future comparative studies.

AB Sex-specific predation on adult individuals is often predicted by different behaviour in males and females resulting from different reproductive strategies and social systems. High predation pressure and the need for biparental care are considered a possible ecological basis for the evolution of monogamy, the most puzzling social system in mammals. In species where adults and offspring are vulnerable to the same predators, males and females-may protect their offspring to different extents because of conflicting demands of investment in current and future offspring. I present the first empirical data on age- and sex-specific predation pressure by top predators on a monogamous rodent and the sex-specific behavioural responses of the prey species to different rates of predation. During an annual predation peak, only offspring and adult males were killed but no females. Whereas males and females travelled similar distances at night before the period of high predation on offspring, males moved further during this period. At the same time, males and females increased their distance from their offspring but males stayed closer to them than females. As a consequence, the distance between the members of the pair increased during the predation peak. The males' behaviour could lead to their encountering predators more frequently which would reduce survival prospects. The different behaviour of males and females provides empirical evidence that males invest in the welfare of current offspring at the cost of higher predation risk whereas females protect their residual reproductive value.

AB We investigated the ability of honeybees, Apis mellifera, to use olfactory information gained in a given experimental context, in other contexts. First, restrained bees were subjected to a Pavlovian associative learning procedure, based on the conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), where a floral odour was paired with a sugar reward. We observed the orientation behaviour of conditioned and naive bees in a four-armed olfactometer with four contiguous fields either scented with the conditioning odour or unscented. Information transfer was clearly shown, conditioned bees: orienting towards the conditioning odour, whilst naive bees shunned it. Second, the effect of passive olfactory exposures during the bees' development was assessed in two behavioural contexts: either orientation in the olfactometer ok a PER conditioning procedure. Two exposure periods were applied: (1) the pupal stage (9 days before: emergence); (2) the early adult stage (8 days after emergence). No effect of preimaginal exposure was recorded, but exposure during the early adult stage induced a higher choice frequency of the odour field in the olfactometer, and lower learning performance in the PER conditioning assay. These observations show that olfactory information gained during development can modify bees' later behaviour in different contexts: this is another instance of olfactory information transfer in bees. These results also suggest that nonassociative learning phenomena, taking place at a critical period during development, might be involved in the maturation of the bees' olfactory system, and in the organization of odour-mediated behaviours.

AB Stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) is a computational technique that has been used to model daily routines of foraging in small birds. A diurnal bird must build up its fat reserves towards dusk in order to avoid starvation during the night, when it cannot feed. However, as well as the benefits of avoiding starvation, storing fat imposes costs such as an increased predation risk and higher flight and metabolic costs. There is therefore an optimal level of fat reserves for a bird to reach at dusk in order to survive overnight without being left with excessive fat reserves at dawn. I tested a prediction common to all SDP models of daily foraging routines, that a bird will attempt to reach this level at dusk, regardless of its fat reserves the previous dawn. I provided supplementary food to manipulate the fat reserves at dawn of free-living European robins, Erithacus rubecula. Diurnal changes in body mass (a reliable estimate of fat reserves! were then monitored remotely. Robins provided with an ad libitum food supply reached almost exactly the same body mass at dusk, regardless of their body mass at dawn, supporting the prediction that birds attempt to reach a target level of reserves at dusk.

AB Juvenile thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus, are less vigilant (i.e. they spend less time visually scanning the environment) than adults. To determine whether nutritional need was a potential cause of this difference, we supplemented two groups of free-ranging juveniles during the predispersal stage, while juveniles were still near and around the natal burrows. The high-energy food group (HEF: 11 squirrels) received peanut butter and oats while the low-energy food group (LEF: seven squirrels) received lettuce. Adults (14 squirrels) were also supplemented, but due to their greater home range sizes, it was not feasible to classify them as either HEF or LEF. To evaluate the effect of supplementation on antipredator vigilance, the behavioural act of visually scanning for predators, we videotaped individuals while they were foraging above ground during 5-min observation periods. Each squirrel was observed and weighed during three time periods over 23 days. From the videotape, we extracted measures of time spent vigilant, locomoting and foraging. All three categories of squirrels gained mass over the study period, but the HEF juveniles rapidly exceeded that of the LEF juveniles. Early in the study, LEF and HEF juveniles did not significantly differ in either body mass or time budgets, and, initially, both juvenile groups were similar to adults in the amount of time devoted to vigilance. Later in the study, the behaviour of HEF juveniles closely resembled that of adults (increased time devoted to vigilance and decreased time devoted to foraging), while LEF juveniles decreased vigilance and increased their foraging time. This study indicates that for thirteen-lined ground squirrels the lower vigilance of juveniles is due, at least in part, to the greater nutritional needs of young animals with consequent increases in foraging, which is largely incompatible with vigilance.

ID INDIVIDUAL ODORS; KIN RECOGNITION; RATS; PREFERENCES; ONTOGENY; URINE
AB The retention of social memory during long periods of separation, such as hibernation or migration, has not been well documented, despite evidence for long-term social relationships in migrating species or in long-lived sedentary species. We investigated the ability of captive Belding's ground squirrels, Spermophilus beldingi, to remember previously familiar individuals as well as littermates after 9 months of isolation. Before hibernation, young ground squirrels discriminated between odours of familiar and unfamiliar individuals, as shown by greater investigation of a novel individual's odour. The following spring, these yearlings did not respond differentially to odours of previously familiar and unfamiliar individuals, suggesting that memory for familiar conspecifics was lost during hibernation. In contrast, both female and male yearlings continued to discriminate between odours of littermates and previously familiar nonlittermates. Thus, recognition of close kin was maintained during prolonged social isolation, but recognition of familiar, unrelated individuals was not. If re-establishment of familiarity is not costly or if adults rarely interact with the same individuals in successive years, then selection may not favour retention of individual memories of particular conspecifics over the winter. Even though males rarely encounter kin after dispersal, yearling males did recognize their siblings, suggesting that the relative costs of maintaining kin-recognition abilities year-round may be low. Possible mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of individual and kin recognition are discussed. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Perception of the pollen need by foragers in a honeybee colony

ID BEES APIS-MELLIFERA; PATTERN-FORMATION; BROOD; COMBS
AB Honeybees, Apis mellifera, adjust their pollen foraging activity according to the need for pollen within the colony, determined by the amount of stored pollen and young brood present in the hive. To clarify how pollen foragers detect the supply of pollen, we followed individual honeybees while they were returning with pollen. Pollen foragers deposited their loads on the frame where most of the unsealed brood was, independent of the position of this frame within the hive. They also inspected more cells on that frame and spent most of their time there, indicating that pollen foragers may individually evaluate the pollen requirements of the colony. In 18 normal-sized colonies we also tested whether olfactory cues provided by a frame of hungry young brood or an additional pollen frame covered by cages affect foraging activity. These experiments showed that olfactory stimulation within the colony is insufficient to increase or decrease the foraging effort, but suggest that foragers must have direct contact with the brood and pollen area to regulate their foraging activity according to the conditions in the colony. The different mechanisms by which foragers may gather the information about pollen supply are discussed. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We tested the hypothesis that male southern green stink bugs, Nezara viridula (L.), use substrate-borne songs to locate females. We recorded the responses of bugs on plants to the vibrations caused by a prerecorded female song and by an artificial sound. The female song caused males to walk, to respond with the calling and courtship songs and to approach the source of the song with characteristic search behaviour at junctions between branches on the plants. At a junction, a searching male stopped, stretched his legs and antennae and compared the vibratory signals on the two branches, with different combinations of legs and antennae. The males then left the junction and approached the source of the vibration. Males located the loudspeaker significantly more frequently in the presence than in the absence of vibratory stimuli on cyperus, Cyperus alternifolius L., and beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L. Vibrational directionality was also elicited by artificial pure tones whose spectral and temporal parameters were similar to those of natural female song. Females showed no reaction to vibratory stimulation and no vibrational directionality. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying vibrational directionality in the light of expected signal changes during transmission through plants.

ID SOCIAL INSECTS; GNAMPTOGENYS MENADENSIS; EUSOCIAL HYMENOPTERA; WORKERS;
   QUEEN; NUMBER
AB The majority of colonies of Gnamptogenys menadensis in Sulawesi lack queens and several workers ('gamergates') mate and reproduce instead. Virgin workers lay morphologically specialized trophic eggs which are fed to larvae. Some of these virgins switch to male eggs when gamergates are experimentally removed. Three distinct patterns of oogenesis thus result in: (1) trophic eggs; (2) reproductive eggs (unfertilized) laid by virgin workers; and (3) reproductive eggs laid by gamergates, whose ovarioles are always longer than those of virgin workers. We investigated the behavioural regulation of ovarian activity in virgin workers by temporarily excluding gamergates. In 12 groups of 35-45 virgins, a few workers became dominant and started to lay reproductive eggs. Once gamergates were reintroduced, sterile workers attacked and immobilized workers, with enlarged ovaries (confirmed by dissection of 173 individuals), which often died as a result. Gamergates were never aggressive towards new egg layers. Aggression was not triggered by divergence in colony odours, as it was absent in control experiments in which six colonies were divided in half, with each part containing gamergates, and reunited after 50 days. Our results show that sterile workers discriminate against new egg layers, given. that their ovaries are not as developed as those of gamergates. Olfactory detection of different levels of ovarian activity thus appears possible. Mesh experiments indicated that the putative pheromones are nonvolatile and require physical contact for transmission. Aggressive behaviour directed at reproducing workers can be interpreted as worker policing. In G. menadensis, worker policing results in virgins laying only trophic eggs.

AB Little is known about mate recognition systems among the species-rich cichlid necks of the African Great Lakes. Such knowledge is critical to our understanding of how evolutionary processes have brought about the current diversity. In the present study we focused on three anatomically similar species of rocky shore cichlid fish Pseudotropheus (Maylandia) spp. from Lake Malawi. We scored male responses to heterospecific and conspecific females which were enclosed in separate watertight transparent chambers. Any male behaviour we observed was therefore due to visual cues alone. Although males of some species could clearly identify conspecific females on visual cues alone, others could not. In cases where conspecific and heterospecific females were phenotypically similar,males could not consistently distinguish between them. Further experiments are required, however, to see whether males can recognize these females using alternative means, such as olfactory cues.

AB Postpubertal male common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, engage in little or no sexual behaviour while living with their natal families. The social mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been identified but have been assumed to include reproductive suppression by dominant males and/or avoidance of mating with closely related females. We evaluated these two possible components of male reproductive failure. Seven postpubertal males and their fathers underwent a series of 45-min sex tests, in which the son, the father, or the son and father together were allowed to interact freely with the mother/mate or with an unfamiliar, unrelated adult female. We measured testosterone, luteinizing hormone and cortisol concentrations in blood samples collected from males immediately following each test, and in basal blood samples collected on three different occasions. Sons, but not fathers, engaged in very low rates of sexual behaviour when tested with the mother/mate. When tested with unrelated females, however, sons engaged in significantly more sexual behaviour than they had when tested with their mothers and showed no differences from their fathers. When sons and fathers were tested together, both males performed significantly less sexual behaviour than when tested alone with a female; however, they showed no overt competition for females and engaged in little agonism. Hormone levels did not differ significantly between fathers and sons. These results indicate that avoidance of mating with familiar females and possibly father-son competition, but not specific, rank-related suppression, contribute to reproductive failure among postpubertal male marmosets living with their natal family.

AB Two-day-old chicks, Gallus gallus nomesticus, were faced with a spatial task requiring them to make a detour around a U-shaped barrier in order to join a group of conspecifics placed beyond it. Chicks made one detour trial, and were then retested after delays of 30 min, 3 h and 24 h. When retested, the chicks took significantly less time to make the detour, even at 24 h. Chicks that failed to solve the task on the first trial within the time limit (600 s) took as long as naive chicks, when tested again 24 h later, suggesting that long-term memory for the task requires a form of one-trial learning. Since many chicks chose the same direction of detour on both the first trial and the retest, they may have simply shown a stereotyped preferential response. In a further experiment to test this possibility, we used a more complex version of the apparatus: the direction of detour first chosen by the chick was: always blocked, and a subsequent detour in the opposite direction was required to complete the task. This time, chicks did not choose the same direction on the first test and when tested 24 h later. However, they proved able to remember the correct direction for at least 24 h if they were allowed to learn the correct path in a series of five trials.

AB The study of physiological stress and its context in free-ranging animals provides a means for understanding the challenges found in the natural habitat. Patterns of physiological stress in free-ranging animals have yet to be well characterized. Methodological difficulties in measuring physiological responses in the natural habitat have limited this area of research. In this research, physiological stress in free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs, Lemut catta, was estimated using a steroid-extraction method to measure cortisol levels from female faeces. Ten females were observed across two social groups in southwestern Madagascar during a 5-month period including portions of the annual wet and dry-seasons. I used behavioural measures to estimate predation threat, food accessibility and individual dominance status, to determine whether these variables predict faecal cortisol levels. Faecal cortisol levels were relatively high during two distinct periods: one period coincided with late gestation and the other period corresponded with the end of the dry season, when high-intensity antipredatory behaviour and estimates of feeding effort were elevated. In addition, faecal cortisol measures were significantly correlated with dominance indices: high-index individuals had high cortisol values, and low-index individuals had low cortisol values. These results suggest that faecal cortisol measures can be used to assess seasonal and individual differences in adrenal activity in this lemurid primate, and that this measure could provide a means-for quantifying physiological stress in free-ranging animals.

AB Male wolf spiders within the genus Schizocosa display considerable variation in foreleg ornamentation as well as in courtship communication. Multiple modes of male signalling have evolved in a number of species. Divergence in courtship signals among species within this genus may be directly associated with variation in the sensory sensitivities of conspecific females. We isolated the visual and vibratory courtship cues of four species of Schizocosa and recorded conspecific female receptivity to each isolated cue. We also examined female receptivity to complete multimodal courtship signals. We found that the sensory sensitivities of conspecific females were associated with the predominant modes of male courtship communication. Species in which females use mostly stridulatory cues in assessing conspecific males tended to have stridulation-based male courtship displays (S, duplex and S. uetzi) while the opposite was true for species in which females used more visual cues in male assessment (S. stridulans and S. crassipes). This study suggests coevolution between male signal design and female sensory design. We discuss' possible scenarios that could be driving this coevolution, including hypotheses of sensory bias and environmental constraints. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study Animal Behaviour.

AB During the breeding season, female and male crested auklets, Aethia cristatella (Alcidae), display similar conspicuous crest ornaments composed of elongated forward-curving feathers on their foreheads. Based on quantifications of brief agonistic interactions at a large breeding colony, we found that crest length was strongly correlated with dominance within both sexes. Across the full range of crest length, individuals with longer crests were dominant over shorter-crested individuals in agonistic interactions involving same-sex adults. Within subadults (2-year-olds of unknown sex), there was a similar trend towards longer-crested individuals being dominant. In agonistic interactions involving individuals of different sex and age, adult males were dominant over adult females and adults were dominant over subadults, regardless of crest length. In an experiment in which we manipulated crest length using Life-size realistic models, male auklets that responded were less aggressive to male models with longer crests than to models with normal or shorter crests, confirming that crest length by itself signals dominance status. In a related experiment in which we controlled intrasexual competition, both males and females responded to opposite-sex models with more frequent sexual displays when the models had long crests compared with those having short crests, suggesting that crested auklets also have mating preferences that favour long crest ornaments. Taken together, these results support the idea that the crest ornament is favoured by both intra- and intersexual selection. (C) 1999 The Association far the Study Animal Behaviour.

ID FORAGING BEHAVIOR; PATELLA-VULGATA
AB Helcion pectunculus, a high-shore, crevice-dwelling limpet, is active during nocturnal low tides and during daytime low tides whilst in the shade. We examined whether this activity is controlled by an internal clock or purely by exogenous stimuli, such as light levels and tidal phase. Maximum entropy spectral analysis (MESA) revealed that the limpets possess a free-running endogenous rhythm of locomotor activity with both circadian (period 28.1 h) and circatidal (period 13.8 h) components. We suggest that this rhythm plays a role in allowing individuals to avoid unfavourable environmental conditions. The exogenous entrainment factor of the endogenous circatidal rhythm in H.pectunculus is the time of exposure to air, whilst the zeitgeber for the circadian component is not yet known.

AB In Parastizopus armaticeps (Tenebrionidae), a nocturnal desert beetle, the males excavate breeding burrows and maintain their moisture level while the females provision the larvae with detritus collected on the surface. The beetles court in small groups on the surface at night after rain. Male size distribution in these groups corresponded to that in the population but more large and fewer small females were present than expected and more large beetles of both sexes bred. Offspring number correlated positively with burrow depth and body length for males but not for females. Since large males dig deeper burrows, which results in higher larval survival rate, females should prefer them. In choice experiments, females selected larger males. Behavioural analyses showed that choice was not dependent on differences in male courtship activity or intermale dominance. When the mass of the smaller male was increased experimentally by a dorsally attached weight, the smaller male was preferred, females estimating male size difference by mass. Partner choice is therefore epigamic for a male phenotypic character which correlates with both parenting ability and greater reproductive success for females.

AB Diurnal and nocturnal flight paths of 364 Levant sparrowhawks, Accipiter brevipes, were recorded by radar and used to analyse migratory strategies. Soaring-gliding was the predominant flight strategy during the day when thermals were available. Also during the day, and at night, napping-gliding flight was used: Levant sparrowhawks flew at similar altitudes as other migrating raptors in Israel during the day; however, they showed different diurnal patterns, using napping flight at high altitudes soon after sunrise and late in the afternoon. Migratory directions were strongly concentrated on a south-southwest-north-northeast axis in spring and autumn, whereby birds compensated for lateral drift. Soaring-gliding birds maximized cross-country airspeed according to optimal flight theory and, thus, minimized time needed per distance. In napping-gliding flight, they adjusted their airspeed with respect to the wind to fly at the maximum range speed, suggesting that they minimized energy consumption per distance. Calculations based on aerodynamic flight theory showed that the optimal migratory strategy of a Levant sparrowhawk with respect to time and energy depends on feeding conditions en route: in poor conditions, both time and energy are minimized by a pure soaring-gliding flight strategy. If food is available en route, soaring-gliding flight should be combined with napping flight when no thermals are available, as this will minimize time spent on migration. The evidence for both Strategies is discussed. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I present a 'cumulative assessment model', which describes dyadic antagonistic encounters in which a contestant's decision whether to persist or to flee is based upon a cumulative sum of its adversary's actions. It is particularly relevant to ritualized fights in which only a certain total of direct physical damage can be tolerated, but it can also be applied to displays without physical contact provided they are subject to external time costs (such as from predation risk). The cumulative assessment model provides an alternative to the sequential assessment model or the war of attrition as a description of temporally extended displays. I describe how the three may be distinguishable in real situations by consideration of escalatory properties and of characteristic intrapopulation variation. The model predicts that, under some circumstances, losers may start the encounter at a lower level of intensity but increase that level more rapidly than winners. Such behaviour has been observed in the cyprinodont fish Aphyosemion striatum. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In the ruff, there are two alternative male reproductive strategies. The majority of males of this lekking bird attempt to establish and defend territories on leks, and are referred to as Independents. Other males, referred to as Satellites, forego this behaviour and instead attempt to get access to the territories defended by Independents by acting submissively. The system is thought to be an example of a mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), where the two strategies have equal fitness payoffs and:are maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection. Satellites visited leks at the same time as females, and were associated with territory-holding Independents which were successful in attracting females. This appeared to be an effect both of Satellites following females, and of females being attracted to Independents that dominated submissive Satellites. Males pursuing the two strategies benefited from the presence of each other, at least to some extent. In this study; Satellites got fewer copulations than expected by their proportion in the population. Satellites on leks might have increased longevity or reproductive life span, and gained copulations off leks and while migrating, to compensate for their low observed mating success on leks. The Satellite strategy may be a low-cost, low-benefit strategy, which may have equal average lifetime reproductive success as the territorial strategy.

AB Mammalian monogamy is characterized by pair bonding and a relative absence of sexual dimorphism in body size. Alloparental behaviour is a characteristic of mammalian cooperative breeding systems. Studies of prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, from stock captured in a resource-abundant habitat in Illinois have supported the assumption that this species is a monogamous, cooperative breeder, while other studies of prairie voles from a more arid habitat in Kansas have called this assumption into question. We hypothesized that reported differences between these populations represented true intraspecific variation. Patterns of sexual dimorphism in body size, partner preferences and parental contact behaviour were compared in prairie voles from stocks originating in Illinois or Kansas. Both Illinois and Kansas voles showed a strong preference for a familiar partner, which is suggestive of monogamy. Sexual dimorphism in body size was observed in Kansas, but not Illinois voles. Illinois voles displayed significantly higher levels of parental contact behaviour than did voles from Kansas. When animals from Illinois and Kansas were crossed, the expression of parental contact behaviour of the 'hybrid' offspring followed the pattern seen in the population of origin of the sire. Removal of the sire prior to the birth of the litter increased alloparenting in Kansas voles, but removal of the sire was associated with lower levels of alloparenting in Illinois voles. Thus, some traits associated with the social system may show intraspecific variation and can be influenced by the presence or absence of the sire during rearing.

AB Morphologically specialized soldiers occur in more than 50 aphid species in the families Pemphigidae and Hormaphididae. To study the effectiveness of soldiers of the gall-forming aphid, Pemphigus spyrothecae Pass., in protecting their galls against natural levels of predation, we manipulated the proportions of soldiers and non-soldiers in sets of galls still attached to poplar trees in the held. Galls with 50 soldiers and 50 non-soldiers were approximately 10 times less likely to be attacked by predators than galls that contained 100 non-soldier aphids. There were significantly fewer live aphids, and significantly more dead aphids, in galls without soldiers than in galls protected either by soldiers or by being within a bag. There were no significant differences in the survival of aphids in galls protected by soldiers compared with those protected by bagging. The soldiers did not protect the galls against invasion by the cohabiting aphid Chaitophorus leucomelas Koch. These observations provide the first demonstration that soldiers are effective in defence against natural levels of predation under field conditions.

AB Female colour polymorphism is a perplexing characteristic of many damselfly species. In Ischnura elegans three female phenotypes occur, one of which has the same blue coloration as the male (androchromes) whilst the others are inconspicuous brown gynochromes (infuscans and infuscans-obsoleta morphs). By marking a natural population near Rome, Italy, we found that all female phenotypes have similar survivorship, but they differ in mating frequency. Androchromes represented 55% of females but were involved in 43% of matings, whereas infuscans females represented 27% of females and 40% of matings and the infuscans-obsoleta phenotype 18% of females and 17% of matings. Old androchromes stored significantly less sperm in their spermatheca than old gynochromes, suggesting that they had mated less often. The majority of mature androchromes were observed alone (54%) when the majority of gynochromes (82-84%) were mating. When live tethered conspecifics were presented to males, blue models (male and androchrome female) were less attractive than brown models (gynochrome females). In contrast, all female colour morphs and males were equally (highly) attractive to males when the models were dead. Androchromes were significantly larger than gynochromes. Our results indicate that androchrome females mate less often than gynochromes, which could be a means of avoiding unnecessary and costly matings, but some androchrome females failed to reproduce (mate or oviposit) probably because they were unable to mate at all. The different explanations for the maintenance of this polymorphism in I. elegans are discussed. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural experiments on gregariousness in larval German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.), confirmed that this species deposits an aggregation pheromone by body contact. Choice tests with groups of larvae indicated that they were preferentially attracted to papers conditioned by the odour of their conspecifics, although they were able to aggregate on clean paper in the absence of cockroach odour. Individual larvae were able to recognize the odour of their own population or strain in the absence of conspecifics. The odour was produced and perceived by larvae at all developmental stages. We report, for the first time, experiments comparing the relative attractiveness of odours of strains from different locations: larval cockroaches were able to discriminate and recognize the odour of members of their own strain. Our results showed that different strains have variations of a specific odour. All experimental strains had similar discriminatory capacities and all preferred the odour of their own strain. When larvae were presented with a choice between odours from two unfamiliar strains, they appeared to avoid these odours. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The crustacean Gammarus duebeni exhibits precopula mate guarding and size-assortative pairing, in which larger males tend to pair with larger females. Size-assortative pairing may result from sexual selection or natural selection (mechanical or loading constraints limiting the size of female that can be carried by the male). If loading constraints are important, large females should have lower pairing success than females of intermediate size as they will be less likely to encounter sufficiently large males capable of carrying them in precopula. We tested this hypothesis in a laboratory study. Female pairing success was dependent on size; however, the relationship was curvilinear: pairing success increased with size up to a point, but larger females suffered decreased pairing success. This supports the hypothesis that loading constraints play a part in structuring size-assortative pairing in this species. We found no evidence for size-related female resistance in structuring the pattern of pairing. We considered size-related pairing success with regard to environmental sex determination and parasitic sex-ratio distortion in G. duebeni. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Lapland longspurs, Calcarius lapponicus, are tundra-nesting arctic birds with an extremely short breeding season. Males show a pronounced brief peak of plasma testosterone early in the season. We studied the effect of exogenous testosterone on song and aggression in free-living male Lapland longspurs. We gave high-testosterone implants to 16 birds, low-testosterone implants to seven birds, and empty or no implants to 33 birds. The implants resulted in significantly different plasma testosterone levels during incubation (high-testosterone mean=20.79+/-3.4 ng/ml, low-testosterone mean=2.54 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, control mean=0.53 +/- 0.1 ng/ml). High-testosterone birds had larger cloacal protuberances than controls, but low-testosterone birds did not. We measured aggression and song with simulated territorial intrusions during incubation, a mean of 12.03 +/- 1.45 days after the insertion of implants. High-testosterone birds and low-testosterone birds were no more aggressive than controls. However, high-testosterone birds, but not low-testosterone birds, were significantly more likely than controls to sing. These results suggest that the high, brief testosterone peak of Lapland longspurs may be related more to song than to territorial aggression. Alternatively, both aggression and song may be testosterone-influenced, but aggression may be more readily suppressed during incubation. The hormone-behaviour patterns demonstrated in this study may be adaptations for breeding in the short arctic summer. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB It has been argued that intraspecific mate-choice copying can be adaptive under certain conditions. Dugatkin's (1992, Am. Nat., 139, 1384-1389) work with guppies, Poecilia reticulata, remains the most influential experimental demonstration of this phenomenon. We replicated Dugatkin's work using several choice criteria to ensure that our results were not dependent upon any single method of judging mate choice. We also tested our findings against two null hypotheses of differing stringency. Irrespective of the choice criteria or null hypothesis used, we did not observe any relationship between female mate choice and copying. We conclude that further experimental evidence of female mate-choice copying is required before the existence of this behaviour can be affirmed.

AB Mating behaviour of female cooperatively breeding noisy miners was examined. Dow & Whitmore (1990, Cooperative Breeding in Birds (Ed. by P. B. Stacey & W. D. Koenig), pp. 559-592, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) suggested that female noisy miners mate promiscuously to recruit males as helpers to their nests, and that the benefit of doing so might be (1) increased genetic variability of their broods or (2) increased survival of their offspring as a direct result of multi-male care. Multilocus DNA profiling has since shown that 96.5% of nestlings resulted from monogamous matings and that extra-group and multiple paternity within broods were rare (Poldmaa et al. 1995, Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol., 37, 137-143). In this study, strong behavioural correlates of monogamy were found. A breeding female associated more often with only one male in her social group, and most of the female's sexual behaviours were directed towards this male. Females were observed copulating repeatedly with the same male, but never with more than one male. Home ranges of breeding females rarely overlapped with each other, but home ranges of breeding males overlapped greatly. Furthermore, a greater percentage of a female's home range was shared with that of her genetic mate than with those of other males. Thus, behavioural evidence is consistent with the genetic evidence that noisy miners mate monogamously in some populations. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Cover is a structural feature of the environment that animals can use to conceal themselves from predators or conspecifics or to gain shelter from inclement weather. Cover may also form a physical barrier limiting movement. It was hypothesized that domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, would use visual cover for concealment. Use of cover was examined in two strains of domestic fowl kept indoors in four groups of 110-112 birds each. In each pen, cover was provided by four rigid vertical panels, one in each of four quadrants. Four similar quadrants were without cover. To investigate use of cover for concealment, the four cover structures varied in continuity of visual cover: (1) transparent (0% cover), (2) transparent with four equidistant vertical green stripes (33% cover), (3) transparent with eight such stripes (67% cover) and (4) solid green (100% cover). Scan samples of quadrant use were made weekly when the birds were 24-52 days of age. Both strains of domestic fowl (I) used areas with cover more than areas without cover, (2) showed increased resting and preening behaviour in areas with cover and (3) showed increased use of cover as continuity increased from 0 to 67%. These results could not be explained by thermoregulatory or physical barrier effects of the cover structures. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a preference for concealment motivates the use of visual cover by domestic fowl, and suggest a 'Venetian blind' effect for visually discontinuous security cover.

AB The influence of breeding habitat on the evolution of song structure was examined in four wood warbler species of the sub-family Parulinae. The effects of song degradation on the ability of territorial paruline males to estimate distance by means of acoustic cues was also investigated. Song transmission characteristics of paruline breeding habitats were compared in southeastern Ontario, Canada; songs native to the habitat in which they were broadcast did not degrade less than foreign songs. The response of territorial paruline males to playback of 'near' (undegraded) and 'far' (degraded) conspecific songs broadcast from the same position within the territory at the same amplitude were then compared. Males responded to near songs as they would to a conspecific territorial intruder and with less intensity to far songs, suggesting that males may use cues from song degradation to estimate distance to vocal conspecifics. Our results from transmission and playback experiments are discussed with respect to the ranging hypothesis, which proposes that selection should favour males that structure songs to minimize their degradation, so that songs function to disrupt or intimidate rivals by providing unreliable distance cues.

AB The influence of both social and asocial factors on the stability of a socially learned tradition of food preference was explored in colonies of domesticated Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus. We trained members of 'founding colonies' of rats to avoid eating a distinctively flavoured food and then introduced them into enclosures where they were offered a choice between the food they had learned to avoid and a familiar, safe food. We then monitored the food preferences of these colonies while we gradually replaced founding members with naive subjects. Traditions of food preference were more stable across generations of replacements: (1) in colonies that had food available 2 h/day than in colonies that had food available 24 h/day (experiment 1), (2) when replacement subjects each resided in their respective colonies for 2 days rather than for 4 days before themselves being replaced (experiments 2 and 3) and (3) when founding members of colonies had learned to avoid a relatively palatable diet (experiment 4). The results of the first four experiments were consistent with the view that opportunities to learn asocially to eat a food other than that preferred by one's fellows reduced the stability of a food preference as it was transmitted across generations. We also found that introducing a naive individual into a tradition-bearing colony reduced its rate of acquiring a food preference other than that of the colony it joined (experiment 5). The interactive effects of social and asocial learning on the stability of food preference traditions in Norway rats was discussed. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To determine the factors that cause the development of stereotypic digging, features in the captive environment of young Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus, were varied. It was hypothesized that stereotypic digging develops because stimuli that control digging motivation are lacking. A regulatory model of motivation was used to examine whether digging motivation is decreased by the performance of the motor pattern 'digging' or by the consequences of digging. Young gerbils that could dig in a sand area developed stereotypic digging. In contrast, young gerbils that could not dig in sand but had access to an artifical burrow, which was presumed to be the consequence of digging, showed less non-stereotypic digging than gerbils from the sand treatment and did not develop stereotypic digging. Therefore, the mere perception of the stimulus 'burrow' by a retreating animal decreased digging motivation. The complexity of the artifical burrow was reduced to a few elements to analyse in detail the stimuli that control digging motivation. A dark and narrow chamber at the end of a tube connected to the cage provided the stimuli that elicited retreating and prevented the development of stereotypic digging. The tube was a necessary feature: a chamber alone did not prevent the development of stereotypic digging. Such a stimulus situation seems to match the stimuli of a natural burrow which is built to buffer climatic fluctuations and to provide shelter from predators. The results show that stereotypic digging develops when a young gerbil cannot achieve a stimulus situation that is efficient in decreasing digging motivation.

AB The different versions of the hotspot hypothesis for the evolution of leks variously suggest that leks should form either in areas: (1) where there is a high degree of overlap of female home ranges; (2) where females spend most of their time; (3) where the most females can be encountered; or (4) in areas where there is high female traffic. The notion underlying these predictions, that males adjust their behaviour according to that of females, is basic to how we think about the evolution of mating systems in general. In this study female movements were monitored using radiotelemetry to test the various predictions of the hotspot hypothesis in the lek mating system of the ochre-bellied flycatcher, Mionectes oleagineus (Aves: Tyrannidae). Females used identifiable routes when travelling through their environment. Each route was used by several females. Lek locations were strongly associated with these routes, and tended to be in areas where the most females could be encountered. They were not in areas where females spent the most time. These results support the female traffic version of the hotspot hypothesis for the evolution of leks in this species. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In the northern Gulf of St Lawrence, eastern Canada, the whelk Buccinum undatum occasionally aggregates near the feeding asteroid Leptasterias polaris to obtain food. This is surprising considering that whelks are frequently preyed upon by L. polaris and have developed a violent escape response to this predator. Almost all whelks in aggregations near feeding asteroids are large. This study suggests that small whelks do not approach feeding L. polaris because they are more vulnerable to this predator. Predation experiments demonstrated that the vulnerability of whelks to L. polaris decreases with increasing whelk size. Sampling in the field showed that 97% of whelks measuring more than 5 cm in shell length are found in the sediment zone, where L. polaris extracts large endobenthic bivalves, but whelks less than 5 cm are equally abundant in the rocky (49.5%) and sediment (50.5%) zones. Field experiments showed that whelks within 50 cm of large bivalves being ingested by L. polaris were larger than those within 50 cm of bivalves placed by themselves on the bottom. Finally, laboratory measurements showed that the influence of predator threat on the time whelks spent feeding decreased with whelk size, but the influence of feeding motivation on the time whelks spent feeding increased with whelk size. In the situation where motivation to feed was high and size-related differences in vulnerability were large, the impact of the predator decreased significantly with increasing whelk size. Whelks show threat-sensitive decision making adjusted to potential feeding benefits and vulnerability to predation. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

TI Ectoparasites and sett use in European badgers
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID MELES-MELES SETTS; PARASITES
AB The European badger, Meles meles, constructs burrows ('setts') of various sizes and types, some of which are very large and complex. The hypothesis that large setts allow badgers to move regularly from one nest chamber to another, thereby avoiding accumulation of ectoparasites, was tested. The ectoparasite load of 32 wild badgers was measured and the daytime sleeping locations of 33 radiocollared individuals, 16 of which were treated with anti-parasite spray, recorded. Untreated badgers were infested with fleas, ticks and lice, and they regularly shifted from one sleeping site to another within a sett, rarely spending more than 2 or 3 consecutive clays at the same site. Anti-parasite treatment decreased the frequency with which badgers switched to different nest sites. Badgers did not choose sleeping sites at random when returning to the sett each morning: they tended to return more often than would be expected by chance to a site that they had occupied the previous day, and less often than expected to a site that had been vacated by another member of the group on the preceding night. Badgers may thus remain in the same nest until perceived ectoparasite challenge exceeds a certain threshold and avoid nests recently vacated by a conspecific because the level of infestation of such nests is also likely to exceed the threshold. Use of multiple nests as a defence against ectoparasites may be a common trait in burrowing mammals. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The context-dependent nature of kin discrimination was examined in larvae of the marbled salamander, Ambystoma opacum. In a graphical analysis, relationships between aggression and social and ecological factors were explored. Increasing relatedness between individuals was predicted to reduce aggressive encounters, except when correlates of fitness (e.g. body size) differed between individuals and/or when environmental conditions increased the profitability of aggression. These predictions were tested in a multifactorial experiment in which genetic relatedness, food quantity, relative body size and the potential for physical encounters were manipulated. The effects of each factor and their interactions on larval aggression and correlates of fitness (body size and timing of metamorphosis) were examined. Frequency of aggression depended upon an interaction between kinship, food quantity and relative larval size. Thus, in accordance with our graphical model, kinship-based aggression varied in a context-dependent fashion. Low food level reduced body size and increased the time required to reach metamorphosis. When larvae were not separated by a barrier, growth was inhibited in the smaller, but not the larger, individual of a pair. Moreover, the larval period was significantly shortened in chambers where barriers were absent. Neither kinship nor initial relative size, either alone or in combination with the other factors, significantly affected larval performance. These results show that the frequency of larval aggression in A. opacum depends upon prevailing social and environmental conditions; however, the influence of aggression on larval growth and metamorphosis remains unclear. Previous inferences regarding context-dependent kin discrimination in amphibians have been based on independent, interspecific studies or concurrent, intraspecific comparisons between individuals of alternative morphologies. The present results provide direct evidence that simultaneous variation in multiple socio-ecological factors may alter aggression in a single amphibian species in which kin discrimination is known to occur.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID NEST DEFENSE; ALTRICIAL BIRDS; PREDATION; SPARROWS
AB As in many altricial species, adult moustached warblers alarm call more at the nest as the breeding season progresses. This study used the experimental human approach method as well as two predator types (plastic snake and taxidermic raptor) placed at the nest to test the anti-predator responses of chicks to parental alarm calls. The probability of chicks making anti-predator responses (ducking and jumping) was strongly correlated with the probability of adults giving alarm calls. Furthermore, chicks reacted selectively to different predator types, tending to remain in the nest in response to aerial predators and to jump from the nest in response to ground predators. A conceptual framework is presented identifying the age of chicks when alarm calls are first given for the brood value, vulnerability and chick reaction hypotheses. These were tested by comparing the intercept of the regression line for alarm calls with those predicted by each hypothesis. The results suggest that the anti-predator response of chicks is the proximate cue for adult alarm calls. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB In a study on size and reproductive behaviour in the southern elephant seal, Mirounga leonina, on South Georgia from 1991 to 1993, large size, measured as nose to hind flipper length, was associated with factors that confer an advantage in terms of reproductive success. Some males stayed at the centre of harems, others were on the periphery and others were outside the harem. A male's mating success increased with his length, and for central males, mating success increased with harem size. Central males defeated almost all other males. Central males were also longest and outside males shortest. Furthermore, central males stayed ashore longest. For central males, length was positively correlated with number of days spent in the harem but not with harem size. Central and peripheral males had the highest copulation frequencies (per h and per male). The copulation frequency of central males apparently peaked in harems with a maximum size of 100-150 females, with lower frequencies in larger and smaller harems. However, the mating success of central males over the season increased with harem size. The rate of alert behaviour and time devoted to resting were not correlated with harem size for any of the three male categories, but rate of agonistic behaviour increased with increasing harem size for central males.

   DRIFT; RISK; VULNERABILITY; AVOIDANCE; ECOLOGY
AB The fish avoidance behaviour of nymphs of the grazing mayfly Baetis rhodani (Ephemeroptera) was examined. The nymphs originated from a fishless stream. To study their responses to the addition of predator cues, nymphs were exposed to (1) chemical cues from a caged fish, or (2) a freely moving diurnal fish (European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus). The nymphs immediately increased their refuge use when exposed to a live fish, whereas chemical cues alone did not cause any avoidance responses. In a second experiment, the effects of (I) fish chemicals and (2) a fish model plus fish chemicals on the diel refuge use patterns of Baetis nymphs were examined. In the presence of a fish model, more nymphs were outside the refuges during the first few hours of darkness, when fish predators are not active, than at any other time of day. A similar but non-significant trend was observed when only chemical cues of fish were present, whereas refuge use in the control treatment was aperiodic. Baetis nymphs were thus able to assess the fish predation risk and to respond by quickly adjustable, flexible avoidance behaviour. Spatial and temporal variation in predation risk, and adult dispersal between fishless and fish-inhabited streams, may be the key factors promoting the maintenance of flexible fish avoidance behaviour in stream-dwelling mayfly nymphs.

AB DNA fingerprinting of socially monogamous, colonially breeding lesser kestrels, Falco naumanni, revealed that three of 87 (3.4%) nestlings were illegitimate, and all three came from a single nest of 26 sampled (3.8%). Extra-pair paternity may have arisen through either extra-pair copulation (EPC) dr mate replacement. The maximum level of extra-pair fertilization (EPF) was low (3.4%) compared to that found in other socially monogamous species and was also lower than predicted according to the frequency of EPCs in a previous study (6.7%). Paired females depend strongly on male provisioning throughout the breeding season and may refuse to engage in EPCs to prevent withdrawal of parental investment by their mates. The DNA analysis also indicated that two nestlings in two different nests resulted from intraspecific brood parasitism. The frequency of parasitized broods revealed by DNA fingerprinting (7.4%, N=27) was higher than that inferred from egg-marking during nest inspections (3.8%, N=52). Pair copulation rates are high in the lesser kestrel but occur in a context of low sperm competition (i.e. low frequency of both EPCs and EPFs). Instead of assuring paternity, frequent copulations may function in females to assess their mate's condition. Alternatively, copulations may have a pair-bond function or may reduce the availability of an individual to other potential mates. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Analyses of the relationship between female preference and male behaviour have been complicated by correlated variation in factors such as male size and appearance. This study examined the effects of systematically manipulating male behaviour, while holding male morphology constant. Female green swordtails were shown video-recorded sequences of the same male engaging in an active courtship display, performing similar levels of feeding activity, and remaining inactive. Control sequences of moving food particles and of an empty aquarium were also presented. Female responsiveness was significantly different across time intervals (before, during and after the stimulus) for the three stimuli showing a male, but not for the two controls. Analyses of female behaviour patterns during the stimulus presentations revealed that they preferred sequences of courting males to all other stimuli. Females did not respond differently to the feeding and inactive sequences. These results indicate that female interest depends upon a specific set of motor patterns, and suggest thar male behaviour and morphology may act synergistically to determine female preference. Video stimuli should prove useful in future experiments seeking to identify the role of specific courtship motor patterns in mate choice. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

Scan durations did not vary with flock size. However, arrivals and departures of birds were immediately followed by long scans. The study represents a more powerful test of flock size effects than has previously been presented in correlational studies. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Despite the considerable number of studies of avian mating systems, the reasons for divorce in monogamous birds are still poorly understood. It is now generally believed that divorce is a reproductive strategy by an individual to maximize its own fitness, and that birds are continuously faced with the decision of whether to stay with the old mate or divorce in favour of a different partner. The key to understanding when divorce will occur lies in determining the costs and benefits of both pair fidelity and divorce. These are likely to be species-specific and related to the varying life histories. Individuals are expected to divorce when the benefits outweigh the costs. Although a number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain why and when individuals may divorce, these are scattered throughout the literature and have not been critically compared and contrasted either theoretically or empirically. Confusion still exists as to the underlying assumptions and predictions of the individual models, mainly because a sound theoretical framework is lacking. Empirical studies to date are few and have been mainly post-hoc interpretations. Further advances in the field require sound mathematical modelling of the hypotheses and more experimental studies that rigorously test a priori predictions. These include removal of mates to create vacancies under controlled situations, manipulating sex ratios to increase intra-sexual competition, reducing or enlarging clutch sizes to alter perceived fitness, and manipulating the availability or quality of territories or mates to determine to what extent this affects divorce rates.

AB Based on the differing costs and benefits of early breeding, single-brooded parent birds are expected to be prudent, and base their decision to commence breeding on several reliable cues in addition to their energy balance, in contrast to multi-brooded parents. A comparative study using data from supplemental feeding experiments performed on 16 species of birds from 12 genera supported this prediction. The multi-brooded birds advanced their laying dates to a greater extent following food provisioning than the double- and single-brooded birds. The response to food was not affected by female body mass or length of the pre-feeding period, indicating that the differences between species do not simply reflect different metabolic needs of birds differing in size, and that experimental differences in set-up are unlikely to confound the results. Advancement of laying was significantly related to the length of the egg-laying period, but this was mainly due to the strong responses and long breeding seasons of the multi-brooded birds. The results suggest that different birds have different reproductive windows, and some possible factors that might influence the timing of breeding are discussed.

AB The sexual responsiveness of female canaries, Serinus canaria, to six different types of male song phrases extracted from natural songs was tested. Copulation solicitation displays were used as an index of female sexual response. Playbacks were performed several days before and during egg laying (a period of natural sexual responsiveness of the females to song). Female canaries were especially responsive to particular short phrases whose essential features were abrupt frequency fall and short silences. This differential responsiveness occurred whatever the serial position (beginning, middle or end) of the phrase in the song and its serial relationship to other different conspecific phrases as well as the general song context (conspecific or heterospecific phrases). Influences such as early experience or 'sensory bias' that may lead to a particular sexual sensitivity of female canaries to these types of song phrases are discussed.

AB A new bioassay was developed to enable quantitative and qualitative assessment of subterranean mammals' responses to chemosensory stimuli. Mole rats of the Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies of Israel responded differently to the odours of conspecific and heterospecific urine depending upon whether they had previous experience with touching the urine with their noses. Mole rats were initially indifferent or slightly attracted to the odour of both conspecific and heterospecific same-sex urine although their behaviour indicated that they could smell it. When animals were given the opportunity to touch the stimulus with their noses, they tended to avoid both types of urine. When exposed to the odour alone, in a separate experiment that followed the touch experiment, the avoidance tendency remained. These results suggest that the animal learns about the odour of the urine through nasal contact with it. Mole rats were indifferent to smelling and touching their own urine and urine of a novel non-competitor rodent (guinea pig, Cavia porcellus) and avoided the urine of a potential predator (marbled polecat, Vormela peregusna) without the necessity of touching it.

TI COOPERATION IN MALE LIONS - KINSHIP, RECIPROCITY OR MUTUALISM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PRISONERS-DILEMMA; EVOLUTION; COALITIONS
AB Playback experiments simulating the presence of intruder male lions elicited cooperative behaviour of male coalitions resident with prides of females. Resident males approached the broadcast roars on all occasions when more than one male was present for the experiment, and only failed to approach in three of eight cases when a single male faced the roars of three intruders. Three routes to cooperation were tested: kinship, reciprocity and mutualism. These results suggest that approaching the roars of strange males is a cooperative behaviour, and that this cooperation is not conditional on either the kinship or the behaviour of a male's companions. Cooperation in male lions instead appears to be based on mutualism.

AB Female painted reed frogs were offered a choice between artificial advertisement calls differing in frequency. Repeatability of mate choice was assessed by multiple testing of females. When the difference between the stimuli was 400 Hz, almost all females, regardless of size, consistently chose the low frequency call. When the frequency difference between the calls was smaller (200 Hz), females as a group appeared to choose at random. However, individual females seemed to show repeatability of mate choice. There was also a relationship between female size and the number of times they chose the lower frequency stimuli. This suggests that the manner in which females respond to stimuli that differ in frequency may be size-dependent. Larger females may be more sensitive to variation in call frequency, and therefore more likely to express a mating preference for low frequency calls.

AB Behavioural and endocrine differences between males and females, and during protandrous sex change were characterized in the anemonefish, Amphiprion melanopus. Females are the largest and behaviourally dominant members of social groups, displaying frequent aggression towards their smaller male mates and other smaller non-reproductive individuals. Sex change was stimulated experimentally through female removals in 1989 and 1991. Behavioural samples were taken prior to female removal and from 10 to 45 days after removal in 1989 and 1-20 days after removal in 1991. Sex-changing individuals showed striking increases in aggression within 1 day following female removal. While the frequency of aggressive acts initiated by sex-changing individuals decreased gradually over the 5-, 10- and 20-day samples, it remained significantly elevated over baseline male levels. A decrease in aggression was also observed from 20 to 45 days after female removal in 1989. Presentations of a model intruder to sex-changing individuals at various stages revealed changes to a pattern of territorial defence characteristic of females. Overall aggression increased and the ratio of attacks at the periphery of the territory to those at the centre increased with time after female removal. There was no convincing evidence of a relationship between plasma levels of the five steroids measured and (1) male/female behavioural differences or (2) behavioural changes with sex change.

AB Parental feeding of young is well documented among endothermic vertebrates and social insects but is rare among fish. Bagrus meridionalis parents feed their young in a manner analogous to birds and social insects. Females feed trophic eggs to the young and the male burrows to expose benthic invertebrates for the young to eat. These behaviour patterns and parental defence of the young were directly observed with remote video-cameras. Division of labour between parents exists not only in the feeding of the young but also in their defence. Role differentiation in defence of the young was greatest when the young were subjected to the most attacks from predators. The female attacked and chased potential brood predators at the edge of the school while the male remained with the brood, executing more frontal displays. On the other hand, as the young grew older and predation decreased, both parents engaged in more sex-specific food provisioning behaviour such as egg release by the female and nest burrowing by the male. Parental role differentiation and monogamy in this species might have evolved both to enhance the growth rate of the young and to reduce their susceptibility to predation.

AB The role of long-term memory in nestmate recognition in ants was investigated. Workers of Formica selysi (Formicinae) and Manica rubida (Myrmicinae) were reared in single-species groups or in artificial mixed-species groups, created 5 h after their emergence. In mixed groups, hydrocarbon profiles of both species acquire at least some of the components characteristic of each other. After 3 months, the species reared in mixed groups were separated and each single-species group was divided into two groups for 8, 15, 30, 60 or 90 days, 6 months or 1 year. After the separation period, 'nestmate' recognition was evaluated far individuals of different species previously reared together ('familiar'), and for allospecific individuals from single-species and mixed groups ('unfamiliar'). Even after 1 year of separation, the workers reared in mixed groups recognized familiar allospecific ants, even though their cuticular profiles possessed only trace amounts of allospecific hydrocarbons. Moreover, they were not aggressive towards unfamiliar allospecifics reared in single-species groups. These results suggest that individuals recognized the allospecific cues borne on each individual's body surface, even when they were present in only trace amounts, and/or each individual learned and memorized allospecific recognition cues during its early life. They suggest also that each individual possesses a template encoding the allospecific and the conspecific cues to characterize nestmates.

TI MOTHER INFANT BEHAVIOR OF WILD GREVYS ZEBRA - ADAPTATIONS FOR SURVIVAL
   IN SEMIDESERT EAST-AFRICA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID LACTATION; HORSES; EQUUS
AB Mother-infant interactions and patterns of foal behaviour in the Grevy''s zebra, Equus grevyi, differ from those reported for other equids. Grevy''s zebra foals exhibit longer intervals between suckling bouts, do not drink water until they are 3 months old, and reach independence from the mare sooner than other equids. Furthermore, Grevy''s zebra foals advance their acquisition of adult feeding behaviour. A 6-week-old Grevy''s zebra foal spends as much time feeding as a 5-month-old wild horse foal. From the time their foals are born until the foals reach an age of 3 months, females form small groups (three females and their foals). These groups are never found further than 2.0 km from surface water and are usually associated with a territorial male. Unlike other equids, the foals of which always follow their mares, when female Grevy''s zebra go to drink, they leave their foals in ''kindergartens'', which are guarded by a single adult animal, usually a territorial male. It is proposed that many of these differences in behaviour and rates of juvenile development are the results of adaptation to an arid environment. Water requirements during early lactation appear to influence strongly the social behaviour of the Grevy''s zebra and should also be a strong influence on the mother-infant behaviour of other arid-living ungulates.

AB Changes in the territory size of birds in the course of their nesting cycle were examined, using data from field studies of the swallow, Hirundo rutica, and the yellowhammer, Emberiza citrinella, and from the literature for 37 other species. Swallows and yellowhammers had their largest territories in the fertile period of the female (nest-building and egg-laying periods) during both first and second clutches. Other species also mostly had their largest territories in the fertile period of the female with only a few species having a peak during pair formation or during the nestling period. Territory size peaked in the fertile period of the female irrespective of territory type (nest site, nest site with some food resources, or nest site with all food sources). Seven of these species had their largest territories in the fertile period of both the first and the second clutch. This pattern supports the hypothesis that prevention of extra-pair copulations is a major selective pressure causing males to maximize territory size and hence minimize the risk of intrusions and copulations by other males at the time when their females can be fertilized. Maintenance of a large territory is thus viewed as a mate-guarding behaviour.

TI THE FEEDING-BEHAVIOR OF A SEMI-SESSILE HYDROMEDUSA AND HOW IT IS
   AFFECTED BY THE MODE OF REPRODUCTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The feeding behaviour of the semi-sessile anthomedusa of Eleutheria dichotoma was studied. The medusae remained motionless on the substrate and approaching prey (here, nauplii larvae of the brin shrimp Artemia salina) were detected from distance before they contacted the medusa. Only catching tentacle nearest the prey item was waved in its direction. Catching behaviour is therefore an active process rather than a random contact and evidently requires some kind of sensory recognition. Ingestion of prey item did not inhibit the medusa from catching another one. Sexual medusae caught an ingested prey at significantly lower rates than vegetative ones. During feeding the medusa increased its volume drastically and, depending on the rate of feeding, a variable number of its walking tentacles lost contact with the ground. As a result the risk of the medusa being detached by the water currents increased. This was particularly true for the vegetative medusae, whereas sexual medusae reduced this risk by their much lower feeding rates. Moreover, sexual medusae responded less to glutathione, which elicits feeding behaviour in coelenterates, than did vegetative medusae. It is concluded that the decrease in feeding is an adaptive response of sexually reproducing medusae, to reduce the risk of mechanical damage to the embryos in the brood pouch. The chemorecognition experiments suggest that this might be mediated on a physiological level by a change in sensitivity of the  chemorecognition system involved in feeding.

TI CONCORDANT EVOLUTION OF LOCOMOTOR BEHAVIOR, DISPLAY RATE AND MORPHOLOGY
   IN ANOLIS LIZARDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Morphologically similar species of Anolis lizards use similar microhabitats on islands in the Greater Antilles. The habitat matrix model suggests that particular locomotor behaviours are favoured in different microhabitats, and that species evolve the morphology appropriate for a given locomotor mode. These predictions are confirmed for 13 species of Jamaican and Puerto Rican anoles. Species occupying similar microhabitats group together in a multi-dimensional ''behaviour space''. Phylogenetic  analyses indicate that limb proportions and locomotor patterns (e.g. frequency of running or jumping) have evolved in tandem. Further, the rate of rapid movements (i.e. runs and jumps) and display rate have co-evolved. A suit of relatively extreme morphological and behavioural (both locomotor and social) changes accompanied the evolution of an active foraging model in A. valencienni. Similar, but less extreme, behaviour changes have been associated with morphological evolution among the 12  species that are sit-and-wait foragers. Habitat structure is also important in determining locomotor behaviour, particularly jumping frequency and distance jumped.

TI COURTSHIP AND THE ASSESSMENT OF VIRGINITY BY MALE BOWL AND DOILY SPIDERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Early in cohabitations of pairs of bowl and doily spiders, Frontinella pyramitela (Linyphiidae), males and females court and pseudocopulate with no transfer of sperm, then may proceed to true copulations during which sperm are transferred. A male assesses female virginity during courtship and pseudocopulation. Only if the female is a virgin will he build a sperm web, charge his pedipalps with sperm, and then begin insemination. The data also indicate that (1) the male''s assessment of the female''s virginity depends on a signal (in contrast to a structural change) given by the female, and (2) the female can signal ''virgin'' but not ''non-virgin''. Males that do not assess the females as virgin continue with pseudocopulations for highly variable periods of time (up to 4.5 h) and the decision to cease is apparently governed by a stochastic process, analogous to a random number genrator, in the male. In contrast, the timings of other events (e.g. the virginity signal and the end of  true copulation) during these reproductive behaviours are governed by quite different processes: the data are consistent with a model involving the steady accumulation or dissipation of some substance or drive.

TI HOW ANIMALS MAKE ASSESSMENTS - INFORMATION GATHERING BY THE HERMIT CRAB
   PAGURUS-BERNHARDUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The process by which animals gather the information required to make a decision on whether or not to accept a resource was examined. A motivational model was developed to predict how information changes levels of causal factors and the model was tested by experiments on hermit crabs investigating shells. A prediction of the model is that, when there is a high utility in accepting the resource, each stage of the assessment procedure will be rapid, whereas if the utility is low the assessment  will be prolonged. If the resource is not available for some reason, for example if a shell has the aperture blocked, the animal will persevere for longer if the initial stages of assessment indicated a high-quality resource than if it had indicated a low-quality resource. These and other predictions of the model were upheld in experiments in which the information available to hermit crabs at each stage of assessment was varied.

AB The risk (per caput attack rate) of occupying discrete spatial locations within a school of 25 Atlantic silversides, Menidia menidia, under attack by a black seabass, Centropristis striata, was determined. When available, stragglers were attacked more frequently than the school and suffered a significantly higher risk in comparison to school members. Within the school, central silversides suffered the most attacks and sustained a significantly higher percentage of the risk, as compared to  peripheral silversides. This findings contradicts theoretical models of the relative benefit of occupying a given location within an animal aggregation and seems to be explicable in terms of predator attack modes and school size.

TI CORRELATES OF DOMINANCE IN WINTERING WHITE-THROATED SPARROWS - AGE, SEX
   AND LOCATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Correlates of dominance were investigted in a wintering population of white-throated sparrows, Zonotrichia albicollis, in 3 successive years at four locations along a 400-m hedgerow. Multiple regression analyses were used to detect characteristics correlated with a sparrow''s ability to dominate conspecifics. Age, but not length of time resident in an area, and sex, but not size, both affected dominance. Individuals had higher dominance near the centres of their ranges, and dominance in a  bird''s first winter was related to dominance in later winters. The presence of site-dependent dominance in this species shows that dominance relations observed at any one location resulted from overlapping dominance fields of the individuals occurring there.

TI THE EFFECTS OF BODY SIZE, AGGRESSION AND NUPTIAL COLORATION ON
   COMPETITION FOR TERRITORIES IN MALE THREESPINE STICKLEBACKS,
   GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Reproductive male threespine sticklebacks differing in size were paired against each other in an aquarium large enough to accommodate a single territory. In these contests one male became dominant and nested while its opponent became subordinate and spent most of the time hiding on the bottom or hovering at the water surface. The large male in each contest generally dominated and this tendency increased as size disparity between opponents increased. A weight difference of 15% was sufficient to provide a competitive advanatage to the heavier male. The size distribution of males indicated that such disparity occurs commonly between opponents from this study population in nature. The study failed to confirm the association between nuptial coloration and dominance reported in a recent study of this species, but this is probably attributable to the similarity of coloration among males used in the present study. Opponents differed widely in the number of bites they directed to a live test male placed in their territory. There was no correlation, however, between this measure and the male''s tendency to dominate in a contest.

TI FEMALE MATE CHOICE, MALE-MALE COMPETITION AND PARENTAL CARE IN THE RIVER
   BULLHEAD, COTTUS-GOBIO L (PISCES, COTTIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male body size was tested for its influence on female mate choice, male-male competition and ability to defend broods in the river bullhead, Cottus gobia L., a polygynous fish with paternal care. Females presented with two potential mates of different sizes significantly preferred to spawn with the larger male. Males smaller than, or 1.5 times longer than, the female were rarely selected as mates. Larger males were more successful in defending their brood from conspecifics, which may explain female preference for them. Unmated large males displaced smaller guarding males from their nests and retained the acquired egg masses. Competition between males for nest sites with eggs can be accounted for by the preference of females for males already guarding eggs; by seizing a nest containing egg masses, a male will increase his chance of being chosen.

TI GROUP RELATEDNESS AND KIN DISCRIMINATION IN HONEY BEES APIS-MELLIFERA L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In addressing problems concerning kin discrimination and the evolutionary significance of inclusive fitness in highly eusocial insects, the genetic relatedness between groups, such as individuals belonging to the same patriline within colonies, is of interest. Based on the definitions for individual genetic relationship, several new measurements of group relatedness are derived and their genetical meaning is discussed. In a metabolic bioassay for the documentation of kin discrimination, carbon dioxide production was used to quantify reactions of groups of honey bees to volatile odours of other groups. Worker test groups, which had not experienced their hive environment, were able to discriminate between related and unrelated groups of workers within and between colonies. Test groups responded in a similar way to odours of genotypically mixed groups with related and unrelated workers and to the odours of pure groups of the less related subgroup. Thus, the reaction to group odours that  function as discrimination labels is not a linear response as predicted by an additive gestalt odour model. Since experienced bees collected from the colony could not discriminate between the various patrilines, the observed phenomenon resembles nest mate recognition rather than within-colony kin recognition.

TI KIN RECOGNITION AND MATE CHOICE IN MICE - THE EFFECTS OF KINSHIP,
   FAMILIARITY AND SOCIAL INTERFERENCE ON INTERSEXUAL INTERACTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Cross-fostered laboratory mice, Mus musculus, were tested for their ability to discriminate between individuals of the opposite sex on the basis of kinship. Subjects were presented with three sets of choices between familiar and unfamiliar test animals of five different degrees of relatedness. The three sets involved choices between (1) pots of soiled sawdust provided by text animals, (2) test animals confirmed within cages and (3) test animals in a freely mixing group. Analysis of time spent  with different test animals or their odor cues and behavioral interactions between subject and test individuals showed evidence of kin discrimination by both sexes but discrimination was more pronounced in males and when subject and test animals were familiar. However, there was evidence of discrimination between unfamiliar animals in freely mixing groups. Males showed a preference for females of an intermediate degree of relatedness in terms of time spent and investigatory/contact activities  but the little mounting behavior that occurred appeared to be influenced by female proceptivity with females showing some preference for closely related (full/half-sibling) males. The difference in apparent preference between the sexes was similar to that reported in some other studies. There was no effect of male social dominance ranking per se on discrimination by females.

TI EXPERIMENTAL MATRILINEAL INHERITANCE OF RANK IN FEMALE JAPANESE MACAQUES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In many species of cercopithecines a female inherits her mother''s (or genealogical) rank. Matrilineal rank inheritance may be defined in general terms as the process whereby a female (termed ''dependent'') acquires the rank of an ''ally'' above another female (''target''). An attempt was made to reproduce this process in time-lapse form in a group of 17 Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, comprised of three families with similar age-sex compositions. Experimental female subgroups were formed such  that in each of them a female (dependent) was given more alliance power than a dominant target. The results indicate that in each of the subgroups that was tested the dependent female inherited the rank of her ally (mother or older sister) above same-age or older targets. Four processes of rank inheritance were observed. The fact that females who were given more alliance power did not solicit their ally, or challenge the target females, before they were aided by their ally suggests that  aggressive interventions are the primary mechanism of rank inheritance. The results also account for the reported rarity of aggressive interventions in natural groups and for the observation that orphans may nevertheless inherit the rank of their family. The role and dynamics of the recognition of alliances in the establishment of rank relationships are discussed.

AB The importance of courtship song rhythms in Drosophila to molecular and behavioral genetics led to a attempt to verify them. Two songs considered rhythmic by one of the two workers who first reported this behavior were found to be arrhythmic because the analysis used earlier was inappropriate for identifying song cycles. Using time series analyses by spectral analysis and autocorrelation, no fly showed the sinusoidal pattern in its song claimed by the earlier workers. These findings require recent research concerned with Drosophila song rhythms to be re-evaluated.

TI NEIGHBORS, STRANGERS, AND THE ASYMMETRIC WAR OF ATTRITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The literature showing that territorial residents generally respond more intensely to an intrusion by a stranger than by a known neighbour is reviewed. The functional basis of this discrimination has not been seriously considered in this extensive literature, and it is shown here how the asymmetric war of attrition can explain why neighbours settle with relatively little aggression. In the asymmetric war-of-attrition model the degree of escalation observed in a territorial contest depends on  the familiarity of the contestants with each other. Predictions of this model about neighbour-stranger contests are supported by data in the literature.

TI CHANGES IN THE SHORT-TERM DEFLECTOR LOFT EFFECT ARE LINKED TO THE SUN
   COMPASS OF HOMING PIGEONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite being the most studied of all avian orientation systems, important questions still remain about the sun compass of homing pigeons, Columba livia. While it is well-documented that the sun compass is usually learned by young pigeons during the first 10-12 weeks of life, the mechanism by which it is calibrated to adjust for seasonal changes in the sun''s azimuth is not known with certainty. Previous experiments using short-term deflector loft pigeons indicated that the sun compass may be  calibrated by referencing celestial polarization patterns. The present paper describes important measurable changes in the previously reported orientation behaviour of short-term deflector loft birds, and suggests a correlation between these changes and the presence of a massive upper-atmospheric dust cloud of volcanic origin which significantly altered natural skylight polarization patterns in 1982 and 1983. Moreover, it is shown that when the short-term effect was absent (at times when data  from previous years suggested it should be present), the birds were also not using sun compass orientation, as demonstrated by their failure to show the standard ''clockshift'' response to a 6-h fast shift of their internal clocks. These results support the hypothesis that reflected light cues, rather than odours, are the basis of the deflector loft effect in pigeon homing.

TI SEARCH IMAGES NOT PROVEN - A REAPPRAISAL OF RECENT-EVIDENCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It is commonly agreed that predators hunting for cryptic prey have been demonstrated to adopt search images (involving perceptual specialization) for particular prey types. However, a simple alternative strategy, that of an appropriate reduction in search rate, may in many cases have the same effect as adopting a search image. The search image and search rate hypotheses are examined, and a series of critical predictions are proposed to distinguish them. Briefly, the search rate hypothesis predicts: (1) that adjusting search rate for one cryptic prey type will enhance the ability to detect other equally cryptic types (the search image hypothesis predicts that this will interfere with the ability to detect other equally cryptic types); (2) that adjusting search rate for cryptic prey will be achieved by learning to spend longer looking at each patch of the environment, and that the more cryptic the prey the longer will be the viewing time required to effect accurate detection (the search image hypothesis makes no such predictions). Four recent studies purporting to demonstrate search images are re-examined in the light of these predictions, and it is found that the published data fail to distingiush the two hypotheses. In addition, some evidence that is better explained by the search rate hypothesis is discussed. A brief examination of the ecological consequences of the search rate hypothesis shows that, unlike the search image hypothesis, it does not predict apostatic  selection. It is therefore argued that the distinction between the two mechanisms explaining how predators ''learn to see'' cryptic prey is important, but that the critical tests have not yet been made. the existence of search images remains not proven.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, learn their song from their Bengalese finch, Lonchura striata, foster-father, provided that they could interact more with him than with adult male conspecifics. When, at independence, they were allowed full contact with an adult male zebra finch, while their contact with the foster-species was decreased to allow visual and vocal contact only, the young were as likely to be influenced by the conspecific male as by the foster-father in their choice of  song tutor. Young raised by their own species did not show this change in song tutor selection which suggests that the behaviour of a conspecific tutor is the most suitable stimulus for song learning.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF TIME CONSTRAINTS ON DIET CHOICE OF THE GREAT TIT,
   PARUS-MAJOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Great tits were given 30 or 60s of access to food presented on a moving conveyor belt with interbout intervals of 120 s. Selectivity in a two-prey system (small and large fly pupae) was measured within access periods. The birds rejected a higher proportion of small prey during the longer foraging period, and also rejected fewer small prey with a reduction in time left within the access period (end-of-bout effect). The end-of-bout effect was greater for 30-s bouts. Previous work has shown that animals are less precise in estimating time intervals as interval length increases, and this may account for the differences in the end-of-bout effect between access periods. The birds subdivided each access period into shorter foraging subbouts, and selectivity appeared to decline within these sub-bouts. Individual differences in selectivity between birds correlated with the mean length of the individual foraging sub-bouts. Thus, when analysed over four different time scales (30-s versus 60-s  access periods, time left within the access period, uninterrupted time allocated to the belt and time left within these sub-bouts), selectivity always declined with time left in the bout independently of the time scale over which the behaviour was analysed.

TI INTERGENERATIONAL CONFLICTS IN GULLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Gulls (genus Larus) are known both to adopt and to attack and kill unrelated offspring wandering through their territories. The tendency of adult gulls to accept unrelated offspring appears to counter standard Darwinian natural selection, and has been interpreted as kin selection, altruism, or reproductive error. Another alternative, not generally advanced, is that there is an intergenerational conflict in which gull chicks receiving inadequate parental care seek parental care from unrelated  adults, and the adults try to prevent this from happening. In this study, chicks that abandoned their natal territories were being fed at low rates or were growing slowly compared to siblings, or were the recipients of siblicidal aggression. Of the chicks that abandoned their parents, around 20-30% became successfully adopted and a similar percentage were killed by conspecific adults. Selection should favour the chicks winning the conflicts, since if they are not adopted they will perish,  whereas the cost to an adult that adopts an unrelated chick will be measured in lost time and energy, which may have little or no effect on future reproductive potential. The concept of an intergenerational conflict in which adults care for unrelated offspring may be of general applicability to those species that have precocial offspring.

TI BOLUS RECOVERY BY GRAY JAYS - AN EXPERIMENTAL-ANALYSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis) typically store food boli in various sites on conifers. In a laboratory setting we determined whether gray jays recover stored boli by means of olfaction, trial-and-error search or spatial memory. Using an artificial tree with 52 possible caching sites, caching and/or recovery trials were performed with five captive gray jays for the following experiments: (1) no extra visual cues on tree; (2) extra visual cues (pine foliage) attached to tree; (3) pungent-smelling food hidden by observer; (4) one bird allowed to cache food but caches recovered by a second bird; (5) one bird allowed to observe another bird cache food and later permitted to recover those caches. Results supported the memory hypothesis, but cache site preferences were apparent for individual birds. To control for this, an additional experiment (6), in which cache site access was limited by the investigators, was conducted with two new birds. These results also indicated  that gray jays use spatial memory to recover stored boli.

TI SOCIAL-DOMINANCE IN COMMUNAL MEXICAN JAYS APHELOCOMA-ULTRAMARINA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Social dominance among members of seven social units of communal Mexican jay (Aphelocoma ultramarina) was studied at feeding stations during the non-breeding season. Hierarchies were generally linear. Males were usually dominant to females and there was a tendency for the oldest male in each unit to be the most dominant adult. An unusual pattern of high social status of yearlings was observed. We attribute the high social status of yearlings and adult males to different causes. Adult male  dominance is probably related to competition for breeding opportunities within each social unit. We tentively interpret the dominance of the yearlings in terms of payoff asymmetries and parental facilitation.

TI SYNCHRONY OF ESTRUS AND CONCEPTION IN RED DEER (CERVUS-ELAPHUS L)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Oestrus is synchronized in non-lactating wild red deer females (hinds) that association together during the mating season (rut). Female relatives associate together and this association leads to synchronous oestrus within kin groups which is not due to kinship per se. Estimated conception dates show only slight synchrony between associated hinds, probably due to the failure of some hinds to conceive at the first oestrus. Hinds that were lactating during or immediately prior to the rut show no  tendency to conceive synchronously. Possible advantages of synchronized oestrus and conceptions are discussed.

TI FORAGING-EFFICIENCY PREDATION-RISK TRADE-OFF IN THE GREY SQUIRREL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many animals must ofen respond to environmental patterns that simultaneously influence both foraging efficiency and predation risk. Gray squirrels (S. carolinensis) sometimes immediately consume food items in areas of relatively great exposure to predators, and at other times carry food items to the safety of a tree prior to consumption. It was hypothesized that the squirrels were somehow trading-off energy intake rate against predation risk. A simple model shows that maximal energetic efficiency is associated with immediate consumption, whereas (under the field conditions studied) carrying items to the safety of trees provides for minimal exposure to predation. Analysis of the model predicts that the tendency to carry a food item should decrease with distance of food from cover (travel time) and increase with item size (handling time). To test these predictions, free-roaming grey squirrels were presented with patches containing a fixed number of identical food items. The proportion of items carried to trees was estimated trees before consumption for 12 different combinations of distance to the nearest tree and item size. The results support the hypothesis and indicate that a simple behavioral criterion based solely on foraging rate or time exposed to predators is insufficient to explain the variation in the data.

TI GROUP FORAGING IN WILD BROWN HARES - EFFECTS OF RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION
   AND SOCIAL-STATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Wild brown hares (Lepus europaeus), though normally comparatively solitary, have the capacity to adjust their behavior such that they can benefit when foraging in groups. They are able to allocate more time to feeding and have an increased corporate vigilance as group size increases. However, these benefits are conditional upon the food distribution. When food is spaced, all individuals benefit. When it is clumped into a small defendable patch, dominant hares attempt to monopolize the resource. They can successfully exclude subordinates when group size is small but, as group size increases, they must devote more time to defending the patch. Therefore, dominants spend less time feeding with increasing group size, while subordinates spend more, since they have more opportunity to feed while the dominant hare is off chasing other individuals. As a consequence, when more than 2 hares are present, all individuals do less well when food is clumped than when it is spaced.

TI VOCALIZATIONS OF BELDINGS GROUND-SQUIRRELS (SPERMOPHILUS-BELDINGI)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Vocalizations of Belding''s ground squirrels (S. beldingi) were recorded during the summer of 1982 near Tioga Pass, in the central Sierra Nevada of California [USA]. Sonagrams were made and call parameters were measured. Discriminant function analyses showed that multiple-note calls (trills) differed acoustically depending on whether they occurred in response to a predator, or were given by males following copulations. The post-copulatory trills of males were individually distinctive. Among  anti-predator trills there was no evidence of predator-specificity within the narrow range of predators tested: trills given to 2 spp. of (stuffed) weasels (Mustela), to dogs and to humans were statistically indistinguishable. Sonagrams of trills occurring in agonistic contexts suggest that a 3rd general category of trills may exist, but agonistic trills were more variable than either anti-predator or post-copulatory trills. The ground squirrels also gave single-note calls in the 3 contexts described above, either repetitively (chirps) or singly (whistles). Neither chirps nor whistles encoded any obvious situation-specific information, except that whistles were typically associated with rapidly-moving predators, usually raptors. The post-copulatory chirps of males were individually distinctive. Vocalizations of Belding''s ground squirrels may not vary among contexts as much as do the analogous calls of California ground squirrels (S. beecheyi).

TI ACOUSTIC COURTSHIP SIGNALS IN THE CARIBBEAN FRUIT-FLY,
   ANASTREPHA-SUSPENSA (LOEW)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male Caribbean fruit flies, Anastrepha suspensa produce 2 sounds in sexual contexts, calling songs and precopulatory songs. Calling song occurs during pheromone release from territories within leks and consists of repeated bursts of sound (pulse trains). Virgin female A. suspensa became more active in the presence of recorded calling songs. Activity during the broadcast of a heterospecific song did not differ from movement during periods of silence. A conspecific song typical of smaller  males, i.e., conspicuous for its long periods between pulse trains, also failed to elicit more activity by virgin females than silence. Mated females were most active during silences. Unmated males had no obvious reaction to sound. Calling songs are apparently sexually important communications which females discriminate among and may use as cues for locating and/or choosing between mates. Precopulatory song is produced by mounted males just before and during the early stages of copulation.  Males that did not produce such songs remained coupled for shorter periods, perhaps passing fewer sperm. Wingless (muted) males were more likely to complete aedeagal insertion if a recorded precopulatory song was broadcast. Calling song played at the same level (90 dB) had no significant effect on the acceptance of males, nor did precopulatory song at a lower SPL [sound pressure level] (52 dB). Precopulatory song may be used to display male vigor to choosing females.

   EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The monogamous relationship of the common marmoset C. j. jacchus was studied in 8 breeding pairs. The responses of paired males and females to unfamiliar conspecifics of the opposite sex were 1st recorded in the absence of the mate. Males, but not females, showed sexual soliciting behavior. In the presence of the mate, the paired animals showed strong intra-sexual aggression: males did not solicit unfamiliar females and the previous eagerness of males to mate with and the indifference of females to strangers of the opposite sex were replaced by a tendency to behave aggressively. Contacts between the paired animals also increased and its seems likely that attraction between familiar partners and aggressive behavior directed at strangers are important in maintaining the stability of the pair-bond.

TI ELECTIVE RECRUITMENT BY THE EASTERN TENT CATERPILLAR
   (MALACOSOMA-AMERICANUM)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The eastern tent caterpillar (M. americanum) is the only presocial insect known to utilize chemical recruitment trials. The laboratory studies reported here show that recruitment in this species is elective and contingent upon individual assessment of the quality of feeding sites. In 1 series of 2-choice tests, caterpillars recruited more tentmates to uncrowded than to crowded sites. A separate series of tests showed that caterpillars that fed on either aged leaves of host trees or young leaves of non-host trees recruited significantly less than caterpillars that fed on the young leaves of host trees. Elective recruitment may facilitate the efficient exloitation by colonies of a qualitatively patchy food supply. Comparisons are drawn between the trail systems of caterpillars and ants.

LA English

AB The mate preferences of male Darwin''s finches (Geospiza) were compared in areas of sympatry and allopatry, using female models in choice tests. Males from sympatric populations showed significantly stronger sexual preferences for conspecific females than did allopatric males. At 1 sympatric site (Isla Pinta), enhanced preferences for conspecific females were found, despite the absence of character displacement in cues important for visual recognition. Lack of preferential male courtship is correlated with hybridization with immigrants in 1 allopatric population, Daphne Major G. fortis. Tests at other allopatric sites showed that the ability to distinguish unfamiliar species from conspecifics by visual cues varies among populations and generally is better-developed on islands having more congeners.

TI THE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF POSTCOPULATORY MATE GUARDING IN A
   DRAGONFLY, PACHYDIPLAX-LONGIPENNIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In both high- and low-density populations of P. longipennis, ovipositing females are frequently disturbed by conspecific males. A disturbed female usually leaves the pond or copulates with 1 of the males. In most cases, a male guards his mate while she oviposits in his mating territory. A male that hovers above his mate and repulses intruders can both maintain his territory and decrease the amount of interference to his mate, allowing her to oviposit for an average of 4 times longer than  unguarded females. Because females are scarce and multiple matings are common, non-contact mate guarding appears to be an effective method for territorial males to maximize their reproductive success. Tandem mate guarding is a more effective reproductive behavior in species such as Tramea carolina, where territoral behavior does not occur.

TI WHY DO PIED FLYCATCHER FEMALES MATE WITH ALREADY-MATED MALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The contribution of the pied flycatcher F. hypoleuca male in parental care was studied to examine why some females mate with already-mated males. No difference in feeding rate was found between older and yearling monogamous males, when comparing nests at the same time. Monogamous and primary females were helped significantly more in parental care by the male than were secondary females of polygynous males. Females could only partly compensate for the absence of a male and secondary females and widows raised fewer young than monogamous pairs. Weight and tarsus length of nestlings were reduced in nests with low male assistance. Differences in mate and territory quality were far too slight to make it advantageous for females to choose already-mated instead of mating with monogamous males. Males, by being polyterritorial probably deceive females into accepting polygyny; females can be deceived since they do not have time to find out the marital status of males.

TI RESPONSE OF BROWN-HEADED COWBIRDS TO SIMULATED CONSPECIFIC INTRUDERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The response of brown-headed cowbirds (M. ater) to simulated intruders was examined using playbacks of cowbird vocalizations in conjunction with a model of a male or female cowbird. Females reacted aggressively to female vocalizations but not to male vocalizations. Solitary males approached and often courted the female model but did not approach the male model. Males accompanying females showed little reaction to either model, although some evidence suggests that proximity to the male model may influence their response. These data support the hypothesis that female cowbirds are territorial and that males guard females from the solicitations of other males. The ecological pressures which may have influenced the development of this social system are discussed.

Under these conditions, Charnov''s (1976) marginal value theorem, as adapted for load size in central place foragers by Orians et Pearson (1979), predicts an increase in load size with increased travel time between the foraging site and burrow. This prediction was verified, but the quantitative predictive value of the theory is questioned because it failed to predict accurately either the actual loads or the trend in load size with distance.

TI THE BEHAVIORAL COMPONENTS OF SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE MILKWEED BEETLE
   TETRAOPES-TETRAOPHTHALMUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Body-size-specific variation in male mating success is seen in the milkweed beetle, T. tetraophthalmus. In laboratory studies, no evidence was found for an intersexual component of mate selection; neither female choice nor a variable propensity of males to mate. In both laboratory and field studies, intrasexual selection in the form of male-male fighting played a large role in determining the mating success of individuals. Body-size-related variation in mating success results partly because the larger of 2 interacting males denies the smaller male access to any nearby females.

TI SEX-DIFFERENCES IN MOUSE URINATION PATTERNS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When tested in circular open fields male and female mice (Mus musculus) produced strongly centrifugal urination patterns, which showed a clear edge-dependency in all the field sizes used. Striking sex differences in the pattern of deposition were shown in terms of both the number and distribution of the urine spots. Male mice produce large numbers of spots which are regularly dispersed, while females produce relatively fewer spots with a more clumped distribution. A hitherto unsuspected level of intersexual communication may explain these differences.

TI AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR OVER FOOD AND PERCH SPACE IN MALE QUELEA-QUELEA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A measure commonly used in previous studies of fighting in Q. quelea (the Dominance Index) is unsuitable for the ranking of animals in small groups. To study interactions between pairs of individuals within groups is probably preferable. Rank relationships between individuals were similar in competition over food and perch space in 2 series of observations 8 wk apart. Fights within the groups did not show an overall decrease with time since group formation but were related to flight activity (between perches) and time spent at the food hopper. Success in competition at the food hopper gave priority of access to the food, but success in competition over perching space did not lead to those birds winning more encounters sitting in a central position within the resting groups. Results are discussed in relation to possible advantages to individuals and to the ecology of Quelea.

   ORGANIZATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The reproductive behavior of a population of prolonged-breeding B. woodhousei was studied in central Arizona [USA]. Choruses formed in discrete and consistent areas of ponds, and males actively defended calling sites within these aggregations. Call rate and calling site residency, but not size, were important factors determining the outcome of male-male disputes within choruses. Females visited choruses to select males, and oviposition occurred away from the calling site of selected males. Natural and experimental observations revealed that females prefer males with a high call rate. Preliminary results indicated that large males did not achieve greater reproductive success, nor was there any suggestion of assortative mating in size of mated pairs. B. woodhousei has a lek mating system, possible because of its prolonged breeding period. These results are discussed in relation to other anuran mating systems and sexual selection in general.

TI SEXUAL SELECTION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN MALES OF THE BICOLOR
   DAMSELFISH, EUPOMACENTRUS-PARTITUS (PISCES, POMACENTRIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Relative reproductive success of male bicolor damselfish, E. partitus, was measured as the number of egg batches obtained/wk per male during a 14-mo. field study. Large and consistent differences in spawning success, observed in 7 colonies containing 23 males, demonstrated that mating was non-random. Various physical and behavioral characteristics of males were also monitored. Significant correlations (P < 0.05) were found between reproductive success and 4 variables: frequency of courtship, inter- and intraspecific aggression and total length. The importance of other factors such as size and location of male territories and time allotment to various activities was also considered. The interactions between these variables, as well as preliminary observations of spawning, suggest that intersexual selection, i.e., female choice of mates, is the dominant process in sexual selection in this species.

TI PARENTAL DEFENSE OF OFFSPRING - A MODEL AND AN EXAMPLE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Defense of offspring against predators is an important form of parental investment in many species. A model for the optimal level of parental defense during a predator attack is derived. A higher level of defense increases offspring security, but it also exposes the parent to a higher risk. Other conditions being equal, the model predicts that the optimal level of defense increases with offspring age. This is because the relative difference between parent and offspring in expected future survival decreases with increasing offspring age. Compared with the parent itself, the relative importance of the offspring for parental inclusive fitness increases. The risk that the parent should take in defending offspring increases with its age. The model is applied to fieldfare (Turdus pilaris) nest defense. Parent fieldfares increase their defense throughout the nest period. The model also predicts the observed decrease in parental defense after the hatching and scattering of a precocial brood of young.

TI ACTIVITY RHYTHMS AND POSITION PREFERENCES OF DOMESTIC CHICKS WHICH CAN
   SEE A MOVING OBJECT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The activity levels of isolated domestic chicks in home pens maintained at constant light and temperature were monitored for 4-6 days after hatching. The data were analyzed using correlograms, spectrograms and multiple regression. Most chicks showed 24 h periodicities and also shorter periodicities of 1.5-4 h and about 30 min, but there was considerable individual variation. The importance of short-term rhythms in studies of responsiveness is emphasized. Chicks which could see a small, rotating ball from their home pens were more active than those which could not see a moving object and spent more time near it. The more pronounced 24 h periodicities, shown when a moving object could be seen, were partly due to greater activity, especially that near the object.

TI STIMULUS FEATURES OF CHICKS AND OTHER FACTORS EVOKING PARENTAL
   PROTECTIVE BEHAVIOR IN RING-BILLED GULLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of certain stimuli in parental approach and protection of straying chicks was examined by noting the response of ring-billed gulls, L. delawarensis, to different stimuli placed within their territories. Playback of chick calls and presentation of surgically devocalized chicks each elicited and oriented parental approach and protective behavior, although a combination of the 2 was more effective. Other factors affecting a parent''s reaction included the parent''s reproductive state, whether other offspring were present, the chick''s location and the chick''s size relative to the parent''s own chicks. These response tendencies should increase a gull''s probability of responding selectively toward its own chicks before it can individually recognize them, while rejecting foreign chicks.

TI MALE-BEHAVIOR AND FEMALE CHOICE - MATE SELECTION IN THE WREN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB The European wren is frequently polygynous. Males occupy exclusive territories within which they spend much time displaying and building nests. They lead females to their nests in courtship. Males building the most nests during a season also make the most breeding attempts. Individual females may show a preference for males with the largest number of complete but vacant nests. There was no consistent correlation between male display behavior and female mate choice. Data on breeding success may suggest why polygyny is adaptive for both males and females in this species.

AB Eye shapes may be aversive to the domestic chick but controversy remains over the relative importance of various features of the eyes in causing aversion. The potency of various eye-like shapes in causing avoidance was evaluated. Monochromatic, 2-dimensional eye shapes elicit avoidance and fear in young male domestic chicks, and the eye shapes are not responded to merely as conspicuous objects. Horizontal orientation, pairedness and the presence of both an iris and a pupil are important recognition cues. The shape of the eye-like stimulus may be more important than its size. Circularity of the iris is not an essential feature but further work is necessary before conclusions can be drawn regarding the shape of the pupil.

TI INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION OF CONTACT CALLS BY PYGMY MARMOSETS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Individual recognition by voice was frequently assumed to be an important phenomenon in the social species. There may be distinctive acoustic features in each of 2 contact calls in C. pygmaea, by which individuals could be distinguished from each other. Individual pygmy marmosets responded differently depending on which type of contact call was given, and on the identity of the vocalizing animal. Playbacks of individual calls through hidden speakers produced some evidence for differential individual responses, but only when they originated from familiar locations. Pygmy marmosets probably recognize each other on the basis of their contact calls.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The success of the large-scale raids and emigrations of the army ant N. nigrescens (Cresson) depends upon their ability to orientate by responding to a chemical trail and to tactile stimuli provided by physical objects. Laboratory experiments showed that the workers'' response to tactile stimuli increases in the absence of a chemical trail. Under these conditions, test ants behave much as they do in the field at a raiding front. This may explain why raiding columns are typically established along the base of rocks, fallen tree trunks and other inanimate objects. Other experiments show that tactile stimuli may, in turn, facilitate the ants'' orientation to weak chemical trails.

TI INCUBATION BEHAVIOR IN COMMON TERNS - INFLUENCE OF WIND SPEED AND

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB Wind is an important factor influencing the orientation of incubating birds. This study examined the relationship between wind speed and direction and the orientation of incubating common terns [Laridae]. An index measuring the deviation of bird orientation from wind direction was devised, and this index approached zero (greater uniformity in facing into the wind) as wind speed increased. The relationship was linear over a large range of wind speeds and successfully predicted orientation behavior observed for birds incubating during a wind storm. These findings provide the basis for further examination of factors such as habitat and social interactions likely to be important in influencing incubation behavior under many circumstances, but which may be overridden as wind speed increases.

AB Models of brent geese [Branta bernicla bernicla] in the head up, extreme head up and head down postures were combined in various ratios to form model flocks. These were placed in a field regularly visited by brent, and responses of geese to flocks were recorded. Data agreed with the prediction that extreme head up models would be aversive while head down models would be attractive. Head up models were more aversive than head down models but only when both types were combined in flocks with extreme head up models. Geese appeared to monitor the proportion of extreme head up models in a flock.

TI RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DISTANCE SENSES IN COYOTE PREDATORY BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relative importance of vision, audition and olfaction to hunting coyotes (Canis latrans) was studied. The durations required for 5 coyotes to locate rabbits in an enclosed room were measured. The visual, auditory and olfactory stimuli emitted by the rabbits were eliminated individually, in pairs, and altogether. Visual stimuli were eliminated by removing all visible light from the room. Auditory stimuli were eliminated by killing the rabbits prior to a test. Olfactory stimuli were blocked by a masking odor. The coyotes'' preference for visual or auditory prey stimuli was also tested. The relative importance of these 3 senses in order of decreasing importance was vision, audition and olfaction.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF BEHAVIOR IN ALEVINS OF ATLANTIC SALMON, SALMO-SALAR, AND
   RAINBOW-TROUT SALMO-GAIRDNERI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of behavior in Atlantic salmon (S. salar) and rainbow trout (S. gairdneri) in a gravel-free enviornment was observed from hatching to the age corresponding to 1 wk after emergence at 15.degree. C (40 days). Records included changes in posture and spatial distribution and the development of swimming, surfacing, ingestive and agonistic behavior acts. Young fish of both species with large yolk sacs held a posture and locomoted with their head down, had difficulty in remaining upright, and were essentially photonegative. As the yolk sac was exhausted, the body axis became more horizontal, an upright position was maintained, and photonegativity was reduced. Surfacing behavior occurred just prior to the emergence of conspecifics from gravel. Until the age of emergence, the behavior of the 2 spp. was very similar. Upon emergence, rainbow trout became pelagic and exhibited immediate feeding and extensive agonistic behavior. Atlantic salmon remained on the substrate after emergence, began to feed at the same age as trout but exhibited less agonistic behavior.

TI QUANTITATIVE BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS OF HAPLOCHROMIS-BURTONI UNDER
   SEMI-NATURAL CONDITIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Adult males of the cichlid fish H. burtoni were observed under semi-natural conditions. Nineteen behavior patterns were recorded simultaneously with the coloration of the fish. Territorial males spend about 1% of their time maintaining territories. Their interactions with females follow a fairly regular pattern. The bright body coloration and black head markings are rarely turned off, and then only in specific behavioral situations. There were no differences observed between the males with and the one without the black eye bar, although this has been shown to be a recognized signal in experiments using dummies. Color is closely correlated with the status of the animal and less closely with the immediate behavioral situation.

TI STUDIES OF COPULATORY-BEHAVIOR IN NORTHERN GRASSHOPPER MICE
   (ONYCHOMYS-LEUCOGASTER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB O. leucogaster display a copulatory pattern characterized by locking, no intravaginal thrusting, ejaculation on a single insertion and multiple ejaculations. Pairs of mice (10) received a total of 50 tests with females in hormone-induced [estradiol benzoate, progesterone] estrus. A mean of 3.8 locks with a mean duration of 69.4 s preceded attainment of a satiety criterion. Pregnancies were found in approximately 25% of females tested to sexual satiety in natural estrus, but no female mated for just 1 lock. There was a positive relationship between number of locks and probability of pregnancy. Supplementary observations on attempts to increase pregnancy rates and on effects of mode of estrus induction on copulatory behavior are reported.

TI EXPERIMENTAL BROOD PARASITISM OF MAGPIE (PICA-PICA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Egg and chick features were tested on natural magpie (P. pica) nests. The stimuli best accepted were those of greater size, weight and of a white background and black specks. Stimuli with a shape different from oval and of low weight were the most readily expelled. Relative quantity of eggs in the nests had no strong influence on the expelling response. Chicks of house sparrows, spotless starlings, jackdaws and swallows were readily accepted and reared by the magpies. Among some chicks of other species introduced, a parasitic form of behavior appeared which led them to eliminate competitors in the nests.

TI ROLE OF INTERFLASH INTERVALS IN A FIREFLY COURTSHIP
   (PHOTINUS-MACDERMOTTI)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The flash code of P. macdermotti fireflies was measured over a temperature range of 16-25.degree. C. The code changes in characteristic fashion during different phases of firefly courtship. Males produce rhythmic patrolling flashes while flying, and when answered, shift to courtship flash pairs of significantly shorter interval. Females will answer some consecutive patrolling flashes and normally respond after the 2nd flash of each male courtship pair. A possible behavioral role for the shifting of male patrolling and courtship flash intervals and for the female''s response patterns is proposed.

TI TO BREATHE OR NOT TO BREATHE - NEWTS PROBLEM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In experiments designed to investigate the interaction between sexual behavior and breathing, male newts [Triturus vulgaris] were presented with females whose behavior was controlled by the experimenter. In some experiments the male received sufficient positive feedback from the female to enable him to complete his sexual sequence; in others he did not. The results are interpreted in terms of McFarland''s (1969) hypothesis that the transitions from one activity to another may occur either by competition or by disinhibition. In the absence of sufficient positive stimulation to enable the male to complete his sexual sequence, breathing may occur by competition with sexual behavior. When the male has sufficient stimulation the temporal patterning of his behavior becomes more under his control and breathing occurs by disinhibition.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Laboratory reared 37 day old white leghorn chicks were placed individually in an arena with 1 of a range of 8 three-dimensional stimuli. The chick''s behavior was recorded over a 3 min period. Each bird was exposed to a stimulus which varied in 3 ways, being either circular concentric (eye-like) or rectangular, single or paired and which appeared to either persistently look at (track) or look away from (avoid) the chick. All 3 manipulations produced significant effects on how close the bird approached. The most avoided combination was 2, tracking, eyelike shapes. The results are discussed in the context of the problems involved in isolating the effective components of stares and the head forwards threat posture.

AB A previous study reached certain conclusions regarding the mode of inheritance of elements of the mating pattern in male mice when F1 males were compared to males of the inbred parent strains. The present experiment tested the generality of these conclusions by changing 1 inbred parent strain while retaining the other. This genotypic change resulted in different conclusions regarding mode of inheritance for 10 of 14 measures.

TI EFFECT OF FOREGRAIN ABLATION ON PERFORMANCE OF A CONDITIONED AVOIDANCE
   RESPONSE IN TELEOST FISH TILAPIA H MACROCEPHALA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of the forebrain in learning was studied by comparing the ability of fish to make a conditioned avoidance response before and after forebrain ablation. Subjects were trained to avoid intermittent electric shock by swimming from one compartment of the test tank to another in response to a light signal. When the fish consistently avoided the shock, the forebrain (experimental subjects) or the olfactory bulbs (controls) were ablated and testing was resumed. Ablation of the olfactory bulbs had no effect on performance of the conditioned response. In all subjects, forebrain ablation resulted in an increase in latency and variability of response. The number of avoidance responses decreased while the number of no crossings increased sharply. With continued testing the performance of some forebrain-ablated subjects improved but in no case was the highly consistent pre-operative level attained. When the forebrain was removed prior to training, 2 subjects never learned to avoid. A 3rd subject eventually learned the avoidance response after a long training period, but its performance remained more variable than that of fish trained before forebrain ablation. This study thus provides evidence for the hypothesis that the teleost forebrain is concerned with facilitating the acquisition and performance of conditioned responses by contributing to the general arousal level of the organism.

TI INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR OF MALE RHESUS MONKEYS
   (MACACA MULATTA) UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sexual behavior was studied quantitatively in 8 male and 7 female adult rhesus monkeys, paired in 16 oppositely-sexed combinations, during regular test sessions conducted over a period of 13 months. Results indicated that the overall level of sexual interaction of pairs was determined largely by the male partner. The range of variation between males was large across all the indices of sexual behavior used. Highly significant differences were found in the indices of behavior of different males tested with the same group of females, whereas differences were smaller when different females were tested with a single male, indicating the predominant role of the latter. Paired tests showed that the menstrual cycle of the female did not influence the differences in the behavior of males. Successive ejaculations in a test resulted in a progressive decline in sexual performance and an increase in refractory periods. The relevance of these findings for the design of experiments concerned with the control of mating behavior in the rhesus monkey is discussed.

TI EFFECT OF EXPERIENCE OF SURROUNDINGS ON RESPONSE OF LEBISTES RETICULATUS
   TO A STRANGE OBJECT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The response of L. reticulatus to a strange object was determined as a function of familiarity with the environment and of long- and short-term novelty of the object. Time spent near the object, length of bouts of investigation and latency of approach were measured. Coefficients of Multiple and Partial Correlation were found between each measure of behavior and the variables of experience. Lebistes explores a strange object introduced into its surroundings more when it has had time to become familiar with its surroundings. Short- and long-term waning of avoidance and exploration occur. Changes in perceptual experience, thus related to changes in exploration, are considered in relation to the process of habituation to strange objects.

TI EFFECTS OF PROLACTIN AND TESTOSTERONE ON PARENTAL BEHAVIOUR OF MALE
   STICKLEBACK GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Injections of mammalian prolactin (lactrotrophic hormone LTH) failed to induce fanning behavior or to intensify either displacement fanning or parental fanning of the male threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus. Castration greatly reduced or entirely eliminated fanning behavior in sexually active male sticklebacks. Treatment with methyl testosterone maintained or restored fanning in castrated males. With a series of graded doses of methyl testosterone, the earlier stages of reproductive behavior (sand digging) appeared at the lower dosages while the later elements (fanning) were only evident at full intensity with the higher dosages. All of the evidence indicates that parental fanning is regulated by the hormones of the testes. Prolactin probably exerts its physiological action during the pre- sexual migratory period of the reproductive cycle.

AB Banded individual birds (Gallus gallus) on the 100 acres of the San Diego Zoo, California were studied. The peak of breeding is in April-May with very little breeding in Dec.-Jan. The various flocks of these jungle fowl had extreme locality fixation with small home ranges and territories centering about stable flock roosting sites within ravines. There is a peck order in these unconfined flocks. Dominant cocks associate with one to several hens, while subordinate cocks are often kept away from the hens. Young of the year generally stay at or near the home roost. Some of them move a short distance to peripheral and adjacent roosts and may help form new roosts along with adult males evicted from their home roosts by more dominant cocks. There is a rapid turnover in this apparently protected population, and after 3 years most of the roosting flocks were composed almost entirely of different birds, but there was little or no change in roosting sites.

TI CHARACTERISTICS OF SEX BEHAVIOUR IN MALE RATS FOLLOWING CASTRATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The decline of sex behavior following castration, and the qualitative changes in behavior resulting therefrom, were studied in adult male Long-Evans rats. Percentages of animals showing the ejaculatory pattern decreased rapidly but the rate of decline was quite variable. In 2 different experimental series the percentages of rats showing the complete pattern of mating behavior in the fourth postoperative week were 42 and 8% (n =46 and 63, respectively). Some animals were tested for 5 mo. and in 1 animal an ejaculatory pattern was noted 147 days after castration. Ejaculation latency (period from 1st intromission to ejaculation) and the number of intromissions to ejaculation were both decreased in the first 2 or 3 wk. postoperatively. Ejaculation latency increased thereafter over preoperative levels, but intromission frequency remained below them until the 9th wk. The latency to 1st intromission, the frequency of mounting and the post-ejaculatory refractory period were generally increased on all postoperative tests. It is concluded that male rats may retain all components of sex behavior for relatively long periods after castration although the extent of retention is variable, and in the early postoperative period the ejaculatory mechanism is facilitated, although sexual "arousal" is inhibited.

TI SENSORY MODIFICATIONS OF HEART RATE IN CRAYFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A diminished sensory input from tactile, sound, vibration as well as visual and chemical sources results in a slowing of the crayfish heart. Within a period of 2 hr in such an environment, the heart rate was observed to decrease to nearly 1/2 that of the normal active rate. Illumination of the animals following a diminished sensory input was shown to be accompanied by an acceleration of the heart to the original level, usually within 1/2 hr. The chemoreception of food results in a cardiac arrest which may be sustained for 10-15 sec. During the consumption of food, the swallowing reflex often produced a 2-3 sec heart block. During other phases of food searching or feeding, a marked cardiac acceleration was seen. Locomotion affects the heart of the crayfish by increasing the rate. The tail-flip escape response appears more complex. There is typically an immediate but transient bradycardia followed by an increase in rate to above normal. The normal heart rate in the free unrestrained crayfish may vary from near 60/min to 120/min at 24 [degree]C, depending upon the stimuli received from the internal and external environment. The rate change is often striking. In a single individual, an extremely rapid rate change from 45/min to 96/min was observed in response to tactile stimulation. Cardiac arrest may be equally abrupt. Although heart blocks are more difficult to induce during tachycardia, they occur frequently in response to the strong chemical stimulation accompanying feeding. Visual, chemical or vibrational stimulation resulting from the presence of another individual of the species is apparently not an adequate stimulus to alter heart rate. The presence of another species, or contact between 2 individuals of the same species does alter the heart rate, but the nature of the stimulus is not clear. The neuronal and hormonal mechanisms which may account for the observed variations in heart rate are briefly reviewed.

AB Onset and cessation times were studied via an automatic radio-tracking system. They varied greatly for wild male cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus) studied in Jan., but for females in Feb. they were more consistently correlated with sunrise and sunset. Contradictory conclusions of previous studies may have resulted from pooling of highly variable data. Onset and cessation of activity in a female snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) in late winter and spring closely followed sunrise-sunset times. Cessation of activity may be related to light intensity rather than actual sunrise.

TI HIERARCHY IN ORGANIZATION OF A CAPTIVE BABOON GROUP
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The heirarchical organization of small artificial groups of captive monkeys is the expression of a continuous learning process. Only approach/retreat interactions can be used to determine rank. Interactions of 11 adult and subadult Papio anubis in a breeding group during 300 hr. were analysed, and compared with similar groups of P. hamadryas and Macacca mulatta described by other workers. Behavior of the sexes is quantitatively not qualitatively distinguished outside mating situations; the artificial group structure may give spurious correlations of intersexual behavior with rank. Hierarchy is not rigid and probable method of changing rank can be deduced. Hierarchy appears to be maintained by subordinates'' behavior patterns and by low- rather than high-ranking animals.

TI EFFECT OF SOCIAL CONTEXT ON DOMINANCE CAPACITY OF DOMESTIC HENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An attempt was made to estimate the extent to which factors emerging from flocking may interfere with the dominance capacity of domestic hens.Thirty New Hampshire hens were drawn from laying batteries and randomly allocated to groups of 10. Within each group of 10, peck orders were determined by initial paired encounters (PO1). Ss[subjects] were then returned to laying batteries for 21 days to allow learned dominance relationships to extinquish. At the end of this period, each allocated group of 10 was simultaneously released in a coop, 9 ft. long, 3 ft. wide and 3 ft. high. After 21 days in coops, the social order (SO) was determined by observation of inter-member peck frequencies over 12 consecutive hours. At this stage paired encounters were repeated within each group (PO2). Tau coefficients between PO1 and SO, PO1 and PO2, SO and PO2 were calculated for each of the 3 groups. In that order, the coefficients were: Group 1, (0.03, p>.05) (0.18, p>.05) and (0.87, p<.01); Group 2, (0.76, p<.01) (0.61, p.>.05) and (0.71, p<.01); Group 3, (0.00, p>.05) (0.21, p>.05) and (0.86, p>.01). The discrepant results for Group 2 were attributed to the failure of a stable structure to emerge as reliability coefficients indicated.

AB A photographic technique is described using multiple exposure shutters or, alternatively, cine sequences which, by means of an adaptation of standard navigational methods, can be used to determine the flying speed of insects and birds as well as the speed and direction of the wind which they are experiencing. The method, which has been used for observations on desert locust swarms, can give a detailed wind structure with height enabling a measure of wind turbulence to be obtained over the range of image discrimination. Distinction between flapping and gliding flight is also obtained. In the case of the desert locust, it is known that flapping does not normally occur below about 22[degree]C which gives an indication of the lapse rate.

TI ON BEHAVIOUR + SENSORY PHYSIOLOGY OF SCORPION LEIURUS QUINQUESTRIATUS (
   H + E )
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The response of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus (H. and E.) to different stimuli and its general sensory physiology have been investigated. The species was found to react positively to humidity and negatively to light and temperatures above 39[degree]C. The scorpion can detect the texture of the substratum and usually chooses the finer one. It also shows a negative reaction to the odors of nephthalene, clover oil, and acetic acid. The reaction to these different stimuli is usually orthokinetic. Desiccation and keeping the scorpion in a moist atmosphere for up to 24 hours does not affect the animal''s positive reaction to humidity. The scorpion was also found to be unresponsive to small humidity differences in the drier range. When the effects of the combination of different environmental factors on the behavior of the scorpion were investigated the light factor was shown to dominate others. An attempt to map the various sense organs responsible for these different responses was also made. The hairs or sensillae which cover the body organs are of different types. The humidity-sensitive hairs are found mainly on the distal-tarsal segments of the legs, while the pedipalps, the pectines and the poison bulb appear to carry the hairs sensitive to touch, odor and temperature respectively. The tactile hairs on the pedipalps detect the presence of prey within a certain distance, but the actual attack depends on the eyes.

AB Eleven experimental colonies of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) representing 4 inbred lines were tested to learn whether or not they would remove brood killed by the disease American foulbrood (causative organism: Bacillus larvae White) from the combs of their broodnests. About 5500 cells of diseased and nondiseased brood were involved in experiments. Two of the lines with a history of resistance to American foulbrood removed all but 3 of several hundred larvae which did not survive. The other 2 lines with a history of susceptibility to the disease allowed hundreds of dead individuals to remain in the broodnest. Thus a great difference in behavior of the 2 kinds of lines was demonstrated.

In subsequent standardized tests, the lizards differentiated between unicolored and polycolored insect prey, capturing proportionally more of the former than of the latter. Some of the polycolored prey were apparently not obnoxious and did not resemble obnoxious insects used in the tests.

AB Strong memories interfere with learning new information through proactive interference, potentially contributing to a trade-off between retaining older memories and acquiring newer ones. Due to mixed evidence for such a trade-off, it is unclear to what extent proactive interference may impact fitnessrelated behaviours in wild populations. Here, we explored the effects of proactive interference on memory retention and acquisition in wild mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, by assessing foraging behaviour at feeder arrays after birds had completed a spatial learning and memory task and a subsequent reversal learning task and when all feeders provided food. Overall, post-testing foraging behaviour was consistent with predictions of proactive interference. Chickadees that learned the location of a food reward better in the first spatial learning and memory task later foraged more from the first task's rewarding location and less from the reversal task's rewarding location, compared to birds that performed worse. In contrast, chickadees that learned the new information better in the reversal learning task later foraged more from the reversal task's rewarding location and less from the initial memory task's rewarding location. These results suggest that interference from strong memories had a lasting effect on foraging preferences. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In arthropods, moulting is characterized by immobility and physical vulnerability, making individuals undergoing it sensitive to predation. Here, we examined how gregarious nymphs of desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, avoid predation during moulting, in the Sahara Desert. In the field, premoulting, gregarious, last-instar nymphs stopped marching and remained on a roosting bush. In response to an approaching simulated vertebrate predator, both pre- and postmoulting nymphs quickly dropped into the bush and hid themselves under branches. Although middle-moulting nymphs that were shedding an old exocuticle were immobile for approximately 10 min, once the femurs were out of the old exocuticle, the insects started to exhibit dropping/hiding escape behaviour. Behavioural experiments confirmed that pre-, middle- and postmoulting individuals were able to extend their wings by climbing after dropping. However, if dropped locusts were not allowed to climb and stayed on the ground, they failed to extend their wings. Hence, our results suggest that the integration of a physically protected moulting site choice before entering the moulting state, a dropping/hiding escape behaviour, which does not require dynamic locomotion, and flexible movement during the soft-bodied state could act to reduce moulting-associated predation. This is the first report of active behavioural and physical antipredator strategies in moulting gregarious juvenile arthropods. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Dogs' behavioural synchronization with humans is well established, but few studies have examined its social modulation. We investigated whether the number of human agents modulates interspecific behavioural synchronization. We replicated the protocol of Lamontagne et al. (2023, Animal Cognition, 26, 1021e1034), comparing dogs' locomotor synchronization in two experimental groups, either with their owner alone or with the owner and four other people, during a straight-line walking task and using GPS devices. Our results are consistent with those of the previous study and show no significant difference between the two experimental groups. Specifically, dogs stayed at an average distance of 5 m from their owner, they adjusted their speed to that of the humans' speed and they adapted their speed within about 2 s when the humans changed speed. To further explore the effect of the number of humans on dogs' behavioural alignment, the five-person group separated at the end of the straight-line walk, with the owner going one way and the rest of the group the other. Fifteen of 20 dogs followed the group after the separation and then went to their owner afterwards. We suggest that the number of agents modulated dogs' behavioural synchronization with humans, as dogs followed the group of humans, but this group effect was masked during the straight-line walk by another social modulator, namely the attracting effect of the owner due to the affiliation between the dogs and their owners.

AB The effect(s) of infection on optimal foraging decisions are largely unknown but have important implications for pathogen spread, especially when individuals congregate at or near food resources. House finches, Haeomorhous mexicanus, are ubiquitous group foragers whose visits to bird feeders facilitate the spread of Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can cause severe conjunctivitis, temporary functional blindness and pronounced sickness behaviours. We placed single, wild-caught house finches in novel arenas containing a high-quality food source (sunflower seeds) and either a medium-quality (Roudybush crumble) or low-quality (5% sunflower, 95% rice hulls) food source. At one time point before infection and one time point during infection, we recorded each bird's latency to first visit each food source, number of unique feeding visits to each food source, total time spent feeding at each food source and the amount of each food source eaten. When presented with high- versus medium-quality food sources, healthy finches preferred high-quality food in terms of latency to first visit, time spent at the source and amount eaten. During infection, these preferences were lost or muted in all those metrics. When given a choice between high- and low-quality food sources, healthy birds still preferred the high-quality option, but, unlike with the medium-quality choice, this preference persisted during infection. These results suggest that finches' foraging decisions change based on infection status and available food choices. Such differences could mitigate contact rates and, therefore, pathogen transmission between healthy and sick individuals when food resources cause animal aggregation.

AB Tropical granivorous finches often form large flocks around resources. The composition of these flocks, whether they are random groups of individuals or comprise related birds travelling together, is currently unknown. To bridge this knowledge gap, we combined high-frequency location tracking with comprehensive genetic sequencing to investigate the relationship between pairwise association strength and genetic relatedness in Gouldian finches, Erythrura gouldiae, as they ranged across the landscape. We found that birds captured within close proximity were more genetically similar than birds captured further away and generally moved across the landscape together. These findings show that for the Gouldian finch, within-flock associations are influenced by genetic relatedness, and we argue that forming sibling subgroups may assist young Gouldian finches to optimally locate resources across this harsh landscape. Maintaining stable and consistent flock compositions as they move across the landscape and visit waterholes may have implications for estimating population size for Gouldian finches. This is because it will reduce the likelihood of single bird revisits and double counts within the same sampling window during waterhole surveys. By considering the flock as a distinct unit, reasonably accurate estimates could be made of a local population, and repeated counts on consecutive days could be assumed to provide reliable and replicable abundance estimates.

AB This study analyses behavioural adaptations in a recently discovered European cave fish. Navigation in standardized labyrinth conditions was compared between this cave fish, its epigean ancestor, the European stone loach, Barbatula barbatula, and hybrid specimens. Loach behaviour was tracked and recorded using an infrared camera. In open field tests, in both dark and light conditions, cave loaches showed reduced thigmotaxis compared to the other two groups. Hybrid loaches generally showed strong avoidance of the open field, whereas epigean loaches avoided the open field more in light than in dark conditions. Other tests were performed in darkness only. Cave loaches showed more consistent lateralization in turning behaviour during exploration of the Y-maze than the other two groups, indicating a search strategy optimized for nonvisual navigation. In all groups, complex maze learning was evident in the first half of the 15 trials, with a reduction in latency of departure from the starting chamber, and in both time and track length to reach the food chamber. However, cave loaches were far more successful in finding food than were epigean loaches and hybrid loaches. When the path to the food chamber was altered, epigean loaches generally responded by changing their route, whereas cave loaches tended to continue following a previously learned path and hybrid loaches exhibited intermediate behaviours. In conclusion, the enhanced ability of cave loaches to navigating labyrinths in the dark compared to their epigean ancestor suggests the evolution of behavioural traits that optimize survival in caves.

AB Animals are often assumed to follow a strategy of energy maximization, and therefore should evaluate feeding options based on energy intake rates. However, at the proximal level, a direct estimate of energy intake rates, if that is possible at all, might require postabsorptive senses with relatively longer processing times, whereas an indirect estimate of energy intake through proxies like pre-absorptive senses of different sensory food properties might support rapid foraging decisions. Here, we show that nectar sugar concentration (sweetness) and nectar viscosity (resistance) drive preferences of bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, classical models for economic and foraging decision making. Using a tasteless/ odourless biopolymer (Tylose), we created feeding options that differed in sweetness and resistance, properties that affect energy intake rate and can be immediately sensed. When energy intake rates were similar, bumble bees developed preferences based on sweetness and resistance. When energy intake rates were different, but sweetness and resistance were balanced against each other, bees developed no preferences. Decision dynamics during training indicated that bumble bees simultaneously evaluated sweetness and resistance to make decisions quickly (in seconds). These results suggest that bumble bees' food preferences are jointly affected by the immediate sensation of nectar sweetness and resistance as positively and negatively reinforcing properties, respectively, indicating a pre-absorptive proximate mechanism for rapid energy-sensitive decisions in bumble bees.

AB Collective animal behaviour is a subfield of behavioural ecology, making extensive use of its tools of observation, experimental manipulation and model building. However, a fundamental behavioural ecology approach, the application of optimality theory, has been comparatively neglected in collective animal behaviour. This article seeks to address this imbalance, by outlining an evolutionary theory framework for the discipline. The application of optimality theory to collective animal behaviour requires a number of questions to be addressed. First, what is the correct quantity to optimize? This can be achieved via a combination of considering the organisms' life history, alongside tools such as statistical decision theory and stochastic dynamic programming. Second, what mechanism is appropriate for optimal behaviour? This involves ensuring that models are self-consistent rather than assuming parameter values. Third, at what level of selection does optimization act? Selection acts on the individual except in very particular circumstances, yet collective animal behaviour phenomena are group level, thus introducing a risk of confusing at what level adaptive properties emerge. This article presents examples under each of the three questions, as well as discussing mismatches between theory and observation. In doing so, it is hoped that collective animal behaviour fully inherits the tools and philosophy of its parent discipline of behavioural ecology. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Social support can play a crucial role in enabling individuals to cope better with environmental stressors when accompanied by a social partner, but this effect varies strongly across species and often with partner identity. While generally conspecifics can provide social support most effectively, domesticated species might benefit also from the presence of a human partner; even more than their intensively human-socialized wild relatives. Here we set out to compare stress support provided by conspecific and human partners in equally hand-raised and kept wolf, Canis lupus, and dog, Canis lupus familiaris, puppies. Given their similar developmental trajectories and evolutionary background, we expected a similar supportive role of conspecifics in both species. Moreover, we hypothesized that domestication has prepared dogs to benefit from the presence of a human more than wolves, which, however, may be masked when intensive socialization is provided to both species. Therefore, we expected a similar stress buffering effect of a human partner in both dog and wolf puppies. To test this, we had puppies of both species participate in two neophobia tasks and one isolation-reunion-separation task. Although we found no direct differences between the two species when tested with either a conspecific or a human partner, there were a few behavioural differences between wolf and dog puppies suggesting that dogs rely more on humans than wolves. Our present results provide evidence that stress buffering has not evolved anew during the process of domestication, but also that both socialization and domestication might play a role in shaping the extent to which young dogs and wolves rely on their human partners.

AB Animals rely on both personal and social information when making decisions. To acquire social infor-mation, animals interact with other individuals. However, not all interactions are the same. The type of interaction (e.g. affiliative or agonistic) and the state of the individual one interacts with may impact the information provided. Here we asked whether the decisions of ants to forage are determined by indi-vidual or social information and whether the type of social interaction experienced impacts these de-cisions. We found that foragers of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, relied predominantly on local interactions of particular types when deciding whether or not to continue foraging. Specifically, the time a forager spent in the nest was affected by the proportion of trophallactic interactions it experienced but not by other types of interactions. Furthermore, latency to leave the nest was only affected by the proportion of trophallactic interactions with hungry ants and not by other interactions or by personal information. Finally, global colony hunger level did not affect a forager's decision to continue foraging. Thus, the type of interaction and the state of the individual one interacts with impact decision making. Therefore, when examining the emergence of collective outcomes from local interactions, it is important to consider the nature of these interactions and not only their rate or quantity.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Individuals of the same species often show consistent differences in behaviour, categorized as personalities. For an animal with parental care, reproductive success may be affected by the behaviour of the parent. When reanalysing a previously published field study, I found that nest-guarding male common gobies, Pomatoschistus microps, showed individual differences in behavioural response to disturbance during simulated predation risk. There was also a difference in nesting success with some nests being abandoned prematurely. The males were tested over a nesting cycle with respect to individual behaviour patterns. Two behaviours were quantified, in the presence of a live eelpout, Zoarces viviparus, behind glass: (1) time away from nest after being evicted by the approach of a finger, and (2) the distance between the finger and the nest when the male escaped from the nest. Of 24 males studied, only half remained in their nest for the whole nesting cycle, while the other nests were abandoned earlier, failing in the current reproductive event. No direct effects of behaviour were found in males that abandoned early or remained at the nest for the full nesting cycle. However, larger males stayed away from the nest for longer and more often abandoned their nests prematurely than smaller males. This may be explained by a better competitive ability to renest for a larger male. Behaviour, but not nesting success, was also connected with brood size. Males with smaller broods stayed away from the nest for longer. Nesting success thus seemed to result from a combination of size and male personality.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB To overcome the cost of competition resulting from foraging socially, individuals may balance their use of private (i.e. acquired from personal sampling) and social (i.e. acquired by watching other individuals) information to adjust their foraging strategy accordingly. Reliability of private information about envi-ronmental characteristics, such as the spatial distribution of prey, is thus likely to affect individual movement and social interactions. We aimed to investigate how movement characteristics of foraging individuals changed as they acquired reliable information about the spatial occurrence of prey in a foraging context. We allowed guppies, Poecilia reticulata, to develop the reliability of their private knowledge about prey spatial occurrence by repeatedly testing shoals in a foraging task under three experimental distributions of prey: (1) aggregated prey forming three patches located in fixed locations, (2) scattered distribution of prey with random locations, or (3) no prey (used as a control). Using indi-vidual time series of spatial coordinates, we computed a suite of movement variables reflecting search effort, social proximity and locomotion characteristics during foraging, to examine changes occurring over repeated trials. Over time, individuals foraging on either scattered or aggregated prey travelled greater distances, showed an increasing distance to their closest neighbour and became slightly more stochastic in their acceleration profile, compared to control individuals. We found that behaviour changed as private information increased over time, with a clear behavioural shift and an increase of collective foraging efficiency occurring on the third testing day. Social proximity was the major predictor of foraging success in the absence of prior foraging information, while search effort became the most important predictor of foraging success as information increased. In conclusion, we showed that in-dividuals' movement patterns changed as they acquired private information. Contrary to our predictions, the spatial distribution of prey did not affect any of the movement variables of interest.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB The ability of a single genome to express multiple phenotypes is key to understanding social systems. In social insects, caste and task-specific morphologies are typically determined by the social environment during larval development. Here, we used the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to examine the social regulation of body size and caste by manipulating the identity (queen/worker) and the number of caretakers tending for the brood. Eggs of females and males were kept in cages with (1) a queen, (2) one worker, (3) three workers or (4) 10 workers. We measured larval weight, developmental duration and the resulting caste (in females) throughout the development of >2000 individuals. We found differences in larval mass when reared by varying number of workers, but not when reared by a single worker compared to a queen. Additionally, in contrast with previous findings in Bombus terrestris, none of the female eggs reared by workers developed into queens, indicating the existence of multiple mechanisms for caste determination in bumble bees. Adult males were slightly larger than workers and took longer to develop in the presence of the queen. The hypothesis that the queen's presence manipulates female development and caste was not supported by our data. Overall, we suggest that body size in B. impatiens is determined by the number of caretakers and is likely mediated by the amount of provision.

AB Diel activity of diurnal pollinating insects declines well before the end of day, but a few species, such as bumble bees, can continue foraging in the period before sunset, when light levels decrease. Foraging during this time could be costly for individuals, and key decisions regarding the daily cessation of foraging behaviour have to be made during this period of rapid abiotic change. However, little is known about the behaviour of diurnal bees under these light conditions. We conducted a field experiment in a mixed agricultural landscape to investigate pollen foraging in the hour before sunset in the buff-tailed bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, comparing it to an hour during the afternoon. We monitored activity at the colony entrance and collected pollen sacs from returning foragers. Overall, there were fewer exits and returns in the evening period than in the afternoon period. Evening foragers returned to the colony with partial pollen loads when compared to daytime foragers, and those returning in lower light levels had smaller loads. Additionally, we found that the same flower taxa were being exploited in the evenings as in the daytime. We found no effect of individual size on the likelihood of evening foraging or the size of pollen loads. Our results suggest that B. terrestris are facultative evening foragers that opportunistically exploit profitable flowers they have encountered during the day. Evening foragers decide to return to the colony with partial pollen loads in this period of the foraging day, which results in a largely reduced pollen influx to the colony at the end of the day. Our findings indicate that the gradual decline in light is likely to be an important factor guiding the decisions of bumble bees and other diurnal pollinators of whether to extend or end foraging, and when to return to the colony.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Although the effects of learning on song structure have been extensively studied in songbirds, little attention has been given to the learning of syntax at the level of song sequences. Here we investigate song syntax learning in two cohorts of hand-reared song sparrows, Melospiza melodia: an isolate group, consisting of four males raised with no exposure to external song models, and a trained group, consisting of 17 males exposed to recorded song sequences during the sensitive period for song learning. The isolate males followed three syntactical rules previously described for field-recorded song sparrows: (1) they produced their song type repertoires with eventual variety, repeating a song type multiple times before switching to another; (2) they cycled through their repertoires using close to the minimum number of bouts; and (3) they showed consistent preferences for singing certain of their song types more than others. The trained males were tutored with sequences with exaggerated eventual variety and cycling patterns and no usage preferences, but their syntax was little affected by any of these training features. One syntactical pattern that was affected by external experience was the rule that long bouts of a song type are followed by long recurrence intervals before that type is produced again. Isolate males showed no bout length/recurrence interval correlations while trained males showed reduced correlations relative to field-recorded males, implicating learning in the development of the normal pattern. Other songbird species have been found to preferentially use song type transitions as adults that they were tutored with as juveniles, but the trained song sparrows in this study showed no evidence of such effects.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

When completing seasonal migrations, some migrants switch their activity patterns (e.g. from diurnal to nocturnal in multiple species of migratory birds) to take advantage of better conditions. We tested the temporal niche -switch hypothesis by comparing activity patterns before and during migration for four populations of migratory mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus, in western Wyoming, U.S.A. (2007-2019). We predicted that the physically taxing and risky event of terrestrial migration would prompt shifts in diel activity patterns. In contrast to the niche-switch hypothesis, mule deer did not drastically change their activity patterns during migration. Both before and during migration, mule deer were crepuscular (i.e. most active during twilight hours). When migrating in the spring, however, mule deer tended to concentrate activity near dawn, although they did not concentrate activity near dawn in the autumn, when less snow was present. By moving in the morning during spring migration, mule deer moved when snow was hardest, potentially allowing them to avoid the energetic costs of sinking into deep snow. Mule deer overall maintained a consistent pattern of crepuscular activity, but fine-tuned their activity patterns during migration, which may allow them to better match their behaviours with environ-mental conditions while completing an important life event. Rather than abandoning activity patterns, animals instead may make subtle alterations in their activity patterns to take advantage of present conditions.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB After completing embryonic development, marine turtle hatchlings emerge from their subsurface nest, generally at night, and crawl to the ocean ('sea finding'). That response depends upon the ability of the turtles to discriminate between the brighter seaward versus a dimmer landward horizon, followed by a positive phototaxis. While the crawls of most marine turtle hatchlings are well oriented and straight, those of leatherback hatchlings are sometimes interrupted by bouts of circling. We conducted experiments comparing the orientation and crawling behaviour of leatherbacks to those of loggerhead hatchlings to determine why those differences occur. The two species did not differ in the light spectra attracting the hatchlings, but leatherback thresholds for detection and for intensity discrimination were significantly higher than those of loggerheads. At the nesting beach, loggerheads under full (bright) or new (darker) moon conditions crawled straight to the ocean; circling rarely occurred. Leatherback crawls under a full moon were indistinguishable from those of loggerheads, but during new moon trials, when horizon brightness differences approached leatherback intensity discrimination thresholds, circling increased significantly. We conclude that circling is probably used by leatherbacks to reinforce orientation decisions when horizon cues become more difficult to discern. Circling could be costly as it lengthens the crawl and increases exposure to terrestrial predators. We hypothesize that those costs persist because other visual adaptations affecting sensitivity enhance the ability of leatherbacks to detect prey, mates or favourable habitats in an open ocean environment.

AB Integrating and weighting sensory perception across modalities is crucial to how animals adapt to their environment. Divergence in brain structure is often in sensory processing regions, suggesting that investment reflects ecological needs. Here, we use two parapatric closely related species, Heliconius erato cyrbia and Heliconius himera, to test the hypothesis that divergence in sensory brain regions affects foraging decisions. These butterflies are isolated across an ecological gradient, which is linked to differences in brain morphology, with H. e. cyrbia investing more in visual centres and H. himera investing in olfactory centres. Here, we demonstrate that these two species vary in how they associate visual and olfactory cues with positive food rewards. We found that when individuals were trained on paired olfactory and visual stimuli, then presented with these stimuli in conflict, they showed distinct behavioural responses. Heliconius himera was more likely to favour positive olfactory cues than H. e. cyrbia, which favoured visual cues regardless of the paired stimulus. This suggests that these species have diverged in the emphasis placed on these different sensory domains during foraging, consistent with observed differences in brain morphology. This result strengthens evidence that speciation initiated by local adaptation is partly facilitated by changes in the neural basis of key behavioural functions. ?? 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Multimodal displays are a long-standing fascination of behavioural biologists because many signallers can adjust display architecture or switch signalling modality, often to exploit the advantages or avoid the disadvantages of a particular signalling environment. Yet, how such adaptive flexibility occurs remains poorly understood. Here, we argue that studying the endocrine modulation of multimodal signal pro-duction can close this knowledge gap. We first highlight a concept well known to behavioural endo-crinologists that sex steroid hormones, and in particular androgens, can mediate the integration of multiple signalling traits at the organismal level. We then hypothesize that endocrine responses also play a role in maintaining flexibility in multimodal displays over time and space and may be key in responding quickly to fluctuating environments. To support these ideas, we use as our major example our own work in 'foot-flagging' frogs, Staurois parvus. We provide an overview of prior work on multimodal signalling in this species, as well as initial data from network analyses that point to androgen-mediated adaptive shifts in multimodal display architecture. We conclude by suggesting future work to further elucidate the connections between the signalling environment, androgenic hormones and behavioural flexibility in multimodal communication.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Large groups of animals aggregate around resource hotspots, with group size often influenced by the heterogeneity of the environment. In most cases, the foraging success of individuals within groups is interdependent, scaling either constructively or destructively with group size. Here we used biologging tags, acoustic prey mapping, passive acoustic recording of social cues and remote sensing of surface currents to investigate an alternative scenario in which large, dense aggregations of southeast Atlantic humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, and northeast Pacific blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus, were each associated with ephemeral krill aggregations large enough such that their availability to predators appeared to be influenced more by environmental features than by consumption, implying independence of group size and consumption rates. We found that the temporal scale and spatial extent of oceanographic drivers were consistent with the temporal scale and locations of predator aggregations, and additionally found that groups formed above bathymetric features known to promote zooplankton concentration. Additionally, we found calling behaviour counter-indicative of competition: blue whale foraging calls were anomalously high during observed aggregation time periods, suggesting signalling behaviour that could alert conspecifics to the location of high-quality resources. Modelled results suggest that the use of social information reduces the time required for individuals to discover and exploit high-quality resources, allowing for more efficient foraging without apparent costs to the caller. Thus, rorqual whales foraging in these environments appear to exhibit a social foraging strategy whereby a behaviour with negligible individual costs (signalling) provides information that enhances group foraging efficiency. The population density dependence of this social foraging strategy may help explain why some rorqual species were at first slow to recover from human exploitation, but have since increased more rapidly.

AB Despite the ecological importance of pair bonding, the ontogeny of pair bond formation remains poorly understood. We capitalized on long-term high-resolution tracking of social interactions across replicated colonies of captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, to map the dynamics of social relationships prior to reproduction and to identify the role that relationship quality plays in subsequent reproductive performance. We found that pairs that developed stronger and more stable social relationships outside the breeding season were more likely to breed together and form a pair bond. Moreover, pairs that formed a stable social relationship initiated reproduction faster than those with less stable pair bonds, while the stability and the length of time since establishment of the pair bond both reduced the probability of divorcing. Our results demonstrate an important link between the ontogeny of social relationships and reproductive benefits that may explain the evolution of long-term monogamy. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Food caching is a behaviour used by a variety of birds and mammals and can be an essential strategy for surviving food-scarce periods. Ensuring that cached food remains available for later recovery is critical to the fitness of caching individuals. Cache robbers, conspecific or heterospecific individuals that remove and consume food stored by the original cacher, present a unique threat to food-caching individuals. Accordingly, caching species have evolved a variety of cache protection strategies to limit the potential risk of cache robbery. We assessed these cache protection strategies in Canada jays, year-round residents of Canada and the western United States that rely on cached food to survive food-scarce winters. We evaluated caching behaviour and movement patterns of captive Canada jays in caching contexts that varied in potential risk of cache robbing: presence versus absence of a model cache robber and visual cover from the cache robber. We found that depending on perceived risk, Canada jays flexibly used a variety of nonmutually exclusive cache protection strategies including cache depression, out-of-sight caching and spacing. These cache protection strategies likely reduce the risk of cache robbing and increase the probability of caches remaining available for recovery and consumption.

AB Individuals engaged in cooperative or mutualistic interactions can benefit from adjusting their strategic behaviour according to the bargaining positions of their partners. In interaction networks in which individuals cooperate with a variety of partners, assessing partners' options and expected interaction payoffs might be crucial for such behavioural optimization to occur. However, the cognitive challenges involved in this assessment and the constraints they may pose for strategic behaviour are currently poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether cleaner fish, Labroides dimidiatus, can learn to optimally prioritize partners, when faced with an ecologically relevant challenge that requires them to distinguish between interaction contexts. We expanded on a relatively well-studied problem that cleaners face in nature: choosing between client fish that simultaneously seek service. In such situations, cleaners should give priority to visitor client species as these tend to leave if not serviced immediately, while resident species will readily await inspection. In laboratory 'biological market' experiments simulating this choice using ephemeral and permanent food-offering plates, cleaners could learn to prefer visitors. However, the actual challenge cleaners face is more complex: interactions in the reef form a 'complex market' whereby clients appear in all possible configurations. In homogeneous configurations (visitor-visitor and resident-resident), the payoffs received from tending residents are higher which may slow down or even prevent learning to prioritize visitors. Adjusting the plate paradigm to this more complex scenario, we found that exposure to homogeneous configurations indeed posed a challenge to cleaners' strategic prioritization, diverting their preferences towards residents. Our results also revealed individual differences in performance, as some cleaners still learned to prefer visitors. This suggests that cleaners may not only learn about each client type separately, and that learning about cue configurations, a precursor of learning complex structures, may play a role in shaping their strategic behaviour in cooperative interactions.

AB Cognitive flexibility may be necessary for animals facing changing conditions and has long been tested by the reversal learning paradigm. However, while this paradigm is typically based on training animals to discriminate between a rewarding and nonrewarding stimulus and then reversing their roles, under natural conditions animals usually face more than one set of two stimuli. Here, we addressed these potential intricacies by studying the reversal learning of house sparrows, Passer domesticus, in a two-set task. Sparrows previously trained as either colour or shape specialists exhibited different reversal dynamics: While colour discrimination was acquired faster than shape discrimination, shape specialists, including those reaching perfect preference of the rewarding shape, reversed faster than colour specialists. The reversal success of shape specialists was also less variable than that of colour specialists. Additionally, despite being slower, during the reversal, colour specialists sampled shapes more than shape specialists sampled colours. These results suggest that (1) when comparing different reversal tests, significant differences in reversal behaviour may be explained by the type of learned stimulus (e.g. shape versus colour) rather than by differences in cognitive flexibility and (2) under realistic conditions of multiple foraging options, preferences that are difficult to reverse (and typically viewed as indicating low cognitive flexibility) may nevertheless facilitate an ecologically flexible shift to novel food types. Finally, our results also demonstrate that a two-set (multiple-cue) experimental design may help to tease apart some of the different processes underlying reversal behaviour and cognitive flexibility.

AB Small birds in winter face trade-offs between predation risk and foraging, and alternate life-history strategies may arise from these trade-offs. Animal personality shows similarities with alternative life history strategies, and using a life-history context to understand personality can provide valuable insights. Golden-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia atricapilla, a small migratory bird, have a complex winter social system with high site -fidelity, long-term social associations between individuals and competition mediated by badges of status. We asked whether golden-crowned sparrows show personalities during winter, whether these personalities were consistent over 3 years and whether they correlated with social and morphological traits. We found that golden-crowned sparrows had highly repeatable behaviours, as measured in captive behavioural assessments, constituting personalities consistent within one season and over time for up to 3 years, a time span that covers the average life span of the sparrows. While longterm repeatability was present, it varied considerably among different behaviours and time spans, and length of time between measures did not predict the magnitude of repeatability. Two movement-based aspects of sparrow personality were independent of the traits we measured (dominance, badges of status, size and age). However, nonsong vocalizations (a repeatable aspect of personality) correlated with wing length and gold badge size in some years. Because personality did not strongly link to the social traits we measured, sparrow personality could represent a separate axis of variation that might connect with other winter life-history parameters such as foraging, predation response or survival.

AB Social relationships can be described by a series of components, all having putatively different functional roles in the lives of humans and other social species. For instance, certain relationship characteristics can strongly influence how individuals deal with stress, ultimately influencing their fitness. However, species vary highly in regard to which components of their relationships influence stress buffering and how. Variation in species' social organization could explain such differences. Comparing closely related species subjected to different ecological constraints can be especially informative when investigating this hypothesis. Here, we compared whether relationship quality differently influences how grey wolves, Canis lupus, and domestic dogs, C. l. familiaris, react to a series of stressors. We tested the role of various relationship components (i.e. two affiliation indices and two aspects of dominance rank) in mediating stress reactivity, social support seeking and social referencing in dyads of pack-living animals. To do so, we conducted systematic long-term observations of the social interactions between animals and an experimental test battery exposing animal dyads to a series of stressors (e.g. novel environment exploration, separation from and consequent reunion with the partner, exposure to a novel object and a threatening human). We found that a large rank distance and high affiliation index based on the number of friendly behaviours exchanged during everyday life (but not dominance status or the affiliation index based on the time spent in body contact) were related to a dampened stress response in both species. These results suggest a functional role of these two relationship components in the stress buffering of both dogs and wolves. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB The existence of substantial variation in the accuracy of resemblance of mimics to their models remains a fundamental evolutionary question, and the ability to quantify mimetic accuracy is key to addressing this question. Mimicry researchers have used a wide variety of methods to measure accuracy, which can be broadly grouped into (1) receiver responses, such as predator trials, and (2) trait measurements. While receiver responses are fundamental to mimicry research, logistical and ethical concerns mean that only a minority of studies include tests with relevant predator receivers. Trait measurement methods are therefore vital, both to supplement receiver response methods and as standalone methods for quantifying accuracy. Here, we collect and describe five methods for measuring the accuracy of visual mimicry. Three of the methods quantify the similarity of mimetic phenotypic traits: linear morphometrics, geometric morphometrics and biometric trait table. Two methods measure the responses of proxy receivers: machine learning and human assessment. These methods are applicable to any type of visual mimetic traits. We evaluate and compare the effectiveness and cost of these methods by assessing the accuracy of a variety of visual ant mimics to their ant models. The methods vary in the types and number of traits being measured, whether traits are measured directly (trait measurement methods) or indirectly (receiver responses) and in the effort and skills required for implementation. Despite the methods measuring different visual characteristics, the accuracy scores from all five methods were positively correlated when applied to ant mimics, suggesting some generality in how mimics rank in their accuracy. We provide practical advice on the use of these five methods and provide open-source implementations of the scripts used in our analysis. The scripts may be freely reused or used as the basis for new implementations. Our aim is to aid researchers to select and implement methods that are appropriate and suitable for future mimicry research. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB As the climate warms, endotherms are challenged with maintaining body temperature within a neutral range. Modifying behaviour to mitigate heat loads is a potentially low-cost response to avoid heat stress and may be critical to persistence in a changing environment, especially for large endotherms. We tested the hypothesis that bed sites are a thermal refuge and means of behavioural mitigation of heat loads for a large temperate ungulate especially prone to heat stress, the Shiras moose, Alces alces shirasi. We predicted that if bed sites are a thermal refuge, selection of bed sites should be consistent with sites that reduce heat gain or increase heat loss via convection or conduction. Moose selected cool bed sites with a substrate that was moist, wet or had standing water, and avoided bedding in open or sparse vegetation. On warm days and during the warmest periods of the day, moose increased selection for wet substrate and for bed sites in standing water with sparse vegetation, which they avoided on cool days and during cool periods of the day. Strong and context-dependent selection for bed sites that would reduce heat gain and ameliorate heat load supports the notion that bed sites are a thermal refuge and a way to behaviourally mitigate warming temperatures. Flexibility in habitat selection may be a primary way for large endotherms to combat a warming climate, although doing so is contingent on habitat assemblages that offer thermal refuge to limit heat gain and importantly, facilitate heat loss.

AB Assortative mating depends on species distinctiveness in mating traits and preferences, which can be challenging to maintain when traits and/or preferences are learned. This is because learning may cause individuals to copy heterospecific signals. Juvenile songbirds possess innate sensory biases favouring them to learn and to prefer conspecific songs, but the effectiveness of these biases relies on consistent and sufficient differences between the songs produced by different species. However, mating signals, including learned songs, sometimes converge in sympatry, and the species-specific cues that individuals use to shape their preferences are often unknown. In Ficedula flycatchers, a stereotyped and highly species-specific alarm call is often incorporated as the first syllable of their songs. However, where the two species co-occur, pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, learn to incorporate the introductory calls of the closely related collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, into their songs. In this study, we investigated the role of introductory alarm calls for song discrimination in collared flycatchers, using playback experiments of both manipulated and unmanipulated songs on adults and nestlings within the hybrid zone of Oland, Sweden. We predicted that the introductory alarm call would be sufficient to trigger song responses, such that adults and nestlings would respond similarly to song phrases including the call, whether it is followed by conspecific or heterospecific notes. Our results provide evidence that the introductory alarm call is sufficient to trigger song discrimination in nestlings, but not in adult males, potentially due to their greater experience with songs and, therefore, subtler discrimination. Altogether, this study highlights the often-overlooked importance of calls within or associated with songs. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB Behavioural responses of animals are often placed conceptually along some axis characterized by the extremes, e.g. bold versus shy or timid. Ecological and evolutionary pressures can be associated with increased frequencies of different behavioural patterns that are also subject to intrinsic factors such as differing metabolic requirements or cognitive abilities. We exposed individual wild-caught juvenile bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, to kairomones from predatory northern pike, Esox lucius, or to lake water controls during a Z-maze arena assay commonly used to assess relative levels of boldness and exploratory behaviours. Fish were subsequently lethally sampled for liver and brain mass to obtain estimates of relative body condition (hepato-somatic index, HSI) and cognitive capacity (brain-somatic index, BSI), as well as the state of the gallbladder, to test for relationships between these indices and observed boldness-related behaviours. Using principal components analysis (PCA) we identified a boldness eexploration syndrome in bluegill independent of chemical treatment and body metrics where bolder fish emerged from a start chamber in less time, travelled farther through the maze and crossed more lines than less bold fish. Bluegill exposed to kairomones were bolder on average than their counterparts in the control treatment independent of body metrics, suggesting that elevated risk levels indicated by predator kairomones can elicit behavioural responses consistent with boldness, exploration and risk taking. The role of relative cognitive ability in the expression of boldness and exploration is equivocal and may be resolved through repeated assays on individuals at different risk levels.

AB Neophobia, the fear response of organisms towards novel cues, is a phenotypically plastic trait that manifests among prey that experience uncertain, often high levels of risk. Prey that find themselves in uncertain or highly variable risk environments over ecological and evolutionary time could benefit from reducing the costs associated with 'making a bad decision' when they detect novel or unknown predatory threat. Hence, understanding ecological uncertainty in the context of prey decision making is of key interest. While ecological uncertainty remains a poorly defined concept, the degree of uncertainty experienced by prey, and by extension neophobia, should be influenced by the predictability of risk. Here, we test whether prey exposed to the same overall level of predation risk exhibit stronger neophobic responses towards a standardized novel cue when they experience the risk in an unpredictable versus predicable manner. Northern red-bellied dace, Chrosomus eos, exposed to conspecific alarm cues (risk cue) over a 3-day period exhibited a stronger intensity of neophobia than those exposed to low-level risk. However, if the alarm cues were presented as three exposures ranging in volume, the dace exhibited stronger neophobic responses compared to dace exposed to three equal exposures per day. Similarly, our second experiment showed that dace exposed over 3 days to elevated risk at random versus consistent times each day had stronger neophobic response under the random schedule. Combined, our results demonstrate that the degree of predictability of risk is a critical factor determining uncertainty and neophobia exhibited by prey populations.

AB Using information from multiple predation cues may allow prey to accurately assess predation risk and correlate antipredator responses with the intensity of the threat. We assessed whether combined unimodal cues would enhance antipredator behaviour in captivity by presenting 10 wild-caught ship rats, Rattus rattus, with direct and indirect simulated visual predation cues, either alone or in combination. We measured changes in activity and foraging behaviours to examine how antipredator behaviour differed when rats were exposed to bright light (an indirect visual predation cue), a looming stimulus (a direct visual predation cue that simulates an attacking aerial predator) and bright light combined with the looming stimulus (direct and indirect visual cues combined). In most cases, the combined visual cues significantly enhanced antipredator responses relative to control conditions (i.e. no looming stimulus and low light); rats adopted cautious foraging strategies and exhibited sustained avoidance behaviour. Ship rats appear to amplify their responses to risk when exposed to combined unimodal predation cues; the finding could be exploited to control the activities of rodent pests, but also warns of possible impacts of multiple sensory pollutants.

AB Researchers of different genders and backgrounds contribute greatly to the diversity of questions and approaches in science. Historically birdsong was studied primarily as a male trait. However, as researchers in the field of animal behaviour have become more diverse, women have made substantial contributions to the birdsong literature, including through the study of female birdsong. We investigated the influence of gender on research topic and asked: are research articles on female birdsong disproportionately authored by women? We surveyed published 'female song' papers within the last 20 years, recording counts of author gender and authorship position (first, middle, last). We compared these data to a control group of 'birdsong' papers that were matched by journal and publication date. We found strong associations between research topic and author gender. First authors of female birdsong papers are significantly more likely to be women: women now make up 68% of first authors on female birdsong papers whereas women are only 44% of the first authors on general birdsong papers. Our case study suggests that women are making a greater contribution to the emerging field of female birdsong. This discrepancy demonstrates the importance of diversity in addressing previously understudied areas of science. Increasing diversity in science can lead to new approaches for studying behaviour, ecology and conservation. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many animals rely on the integration of senses to interact with their environment. While most studies on multisensory integration focus on animals that use passive sensing, fewer studies have investigated actively sensing animals, such as animals that use echolocation. Prior work has demonstrated that bats and dolphins have the ability to perceive objects through both echolocation and vision and may integrate information across senses to improve target identification. Less is known, however, about how these animals might modify their active sensing systems when additional sensory input, such as visual cues, is available. In this study, we examine how Brazilian free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis, in the wild use their echolocation calls during night compared to day under two different sensory challenges: ground detection in an open field and roost localization in a complex and cluttered environment at a cave edge. Both location and light condition had a significant effect on call frequency and call duration. Echolocation calls had shorter durations and wider bandwidths during night compared to day, and this effect was more pronounced during roost localization at the complex cave edge. These results suggest that bats may use vision to supplement echolocation, but modifications to their sensing systems may depend on environmental complexity and/or sensorimotor challenges.

AB Males typically court females extensively to convince them to mate. In some species, however, males coerce females to mate. We studied mating behaviour in the spider Thanatus fabricii and focused on behavioural and venomic adaptations. We found that males always bit and bound females before and during mating. The bitten females quickly fell into a state of immobility, during which males copulated with them. The duration of male bites increased with increasing size of the female. In contrast, male bites were shorter if the female was missing legs. Additionally, males with relatively longer legs induced longer states of immobility in females. Binding by silk prolonged the state of immobilization, allowing males to perform more insertions. After copulation, females were less successful in catching their prey (ants), suggesting that this mating strategy negatively affects female fitness. Altogether, this evidence shows that mating in T. fabricii is coercive. Males of T. fabricii had relatively larger venom glands than both conspecific females and males of closely related Philodromus species, which court females. The composition of venom, however, did not differ between the sexes. Male venom glands appear to be adapted to coercive mating rather than to foraging, as they caught fewer prey than closely related species. We suggest that coercive mating in T. fabricii may be enabled by venomic adaptation in the males. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Considerable interindividual variation in behaviour, including learning ability and personality, exists within populations. Recent research has suggested that these two traits might covary; that is, the expression of certain personality traits might be correlated with learning ability. We experimentally tested this hypothesis under controlled laboratory conditions using female Trinidadian guppies. We tested for individual learning performance, measured as time to learn an association between a physical object and the presentation of food, both without (individual learning) and with (social learning) public information from conspecifics. Further, we quantified three ecologically relevant personality traits in individual fish in a fixed sequence: namely, exploration of a novel environment, sociability as the tendency to associate socially with conspecifics and boldness in the face of a simulated threat of predation. Each of these three personality traits was significantly repeatable, but they were not intercorrelated (i.e. did not form a behavioural syndrome). Individuals that needed fewer trials to feed from the objects initially had a higher probability of reaching the learning criterion and needed fewer trials to do so, but this learning performance was not related to repeatable personality traits across individuals. More exploratory individuals tended to learn faster during individual learning. When excluding individuals that had not learned, more social individuals were significantly faster at associative learning during social learning than less social individuals. Overall, we found no compelling evidence for any link between individual personality traits and learning performance, nor between the two modes of learning. Our results therefore suggest that individual personality does not predict learning performance and the observed independence of the two modes of learning tested suggests a lack of a domain-general learning capacity in female Trinidadian guppies, at least under our experimental conditions.

AB When making decisions, individuals can be influenced by both the range of options available to them and intrinsic factors, such as their own body size or condition. The current understanding of the topic comes mostly from studies of foraging behaviour and mate choice, whereas other fitness-related decisions have been the subject of much less attention. Here, we investigated how the number of available options, along with body size and condition, affect the nesting resource choices of male sand gobies, Pomatoschistus minutus. The results show that resource choices were not affected by additional choice options (i.e. binary versus ternary choice situation) or the body condition of the chooser, whereas resource size, resource type (i.e. whether choices were between arched or flat resources) and body size did have an effect. In particular, while larger nesting resources were chosen more often in most situations, this pattern was stronger among larger males and when the resources had a flat, rather than arched, shape. Indeed, in the case of arched resources, the medium size category was more popular than the smaller and larger ones. Together, the results show that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors can influence important behavioural decisions over resource choice. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Female mate choice is a widespread and well-recognized phenomenon. Nevertheless, individual variation in female preference has not yet received the same attention, although such preferences can have important effects on evolutionary dynamics. Here we assess and compare population- and individual-level female preferences for male ornaments and size in the tropical jumping spider Hasarius adansoni in two sets of laboratory experiments. First, we paired females with a single male and quantified receptive behaviours (e.g. receptive posture, number of copulations) and unreceptive behaviours (e.g. attacking the male, running away from a male). We assessed whether these male traits were related to offspring quality and quantity to determine whether there was selection on female preferences. Then, we paired different females with three different-sized males, one per day, and scored similar behaviours to measure preference functions (relationship between male traits and female receptivity). Generally, the population of females did not show a consistent average preference for male traits, despite our finding that females mated to larger males produced more offspring. However, at the individual level, females showed different preference functions for male size, such that some females preferred larger males, while others preferred smaller males. We discuss these data in terms of the causes and consequences of individual preference functions, highlighting the importance of including individual preference functions in future studies that focus on sexual selection and how individual preference can maintain phenotypic variation in wild populations.

AB In monogamous mating systems, pair mates frequently share similar characteristics, such as size or ornamentation, a pattern suggesting mutual mate choice. When pairs persist across multiple seasons, preferences for familiar pair mates can either reinforce or disrupt patterns of assortative pairing. Snapping shrimp (Alpheus angulosus) are socially monogamous shrimp that can be found in size-assortative pairs year-round; both sexes could benefit from pairing with larger individuals. To determine the role of pair mate preferences for either size or established pair mates in size-assortative pairing, we performed simultaneous choice trials to test whether (1) either or both sexes prefer larger pair mates, (2) females prefer males with larger claws, or (3) either or both sexes prefer current pair mates over size-matched unfamiliar potential mates. Males, but not females, preferred larger potential pair mates in both the reproductive and nonreproductive seasons; males also showed more mate-searching behaviour, switching more frequently between choice options than females. Females, but not males, preferred their current pair mate over a novel potential pair mate; females also engaged in more frequent switching between pair mates and novel males, but only during the nonreproductive season. Thus, while both males and females exhibit preferences in pairing, size-assortative pairing in snapping shrimp does not result from mutual mate choice for size, but rather preferences for size in one sex, with size-assortative pairing reinforced by preferences for established pair mates in the other. Furthermore, pairing behaviour may be dynamic, shifting across seasons even in a year-round socially monogamous species. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In cooperatively breeding societies dominant breeders are assisted by other individuals in raising their young. In many of these species helping behaviours and their benefits for breeders have been studied by investigating the helpers' contribution to direct offspring care, even though a significant proportion of help is not targeted specifically to offspring. Here, we investigated how breeders and helpers share the effort in shelter maintenance and how their investment is influenced by the presence of dependent young in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus savoryi. Shelters provide essential protection from predators, independently of a group's breeding status. Shelter maintenance is costly in terms of time investment and energy expenditure. In the field we manipulated the workload of groups that differed in the presence and number of helpers and the reproductive state of breeders by increasing the need for digging out the breeding shelter. Helper presence correlated with workload reduction of dominant females, even in the absence of dependent young. This emphasizes the importance of shelters for the whole group, independently of the current reproductive status of the breeding pair. The described benefits increased with the number and body size of the helpers. Additionally, breeding females and helpers visited the breeding chamber more often if young were present, and helper presence enhanced the reproductive success of breeders. These findings highlight the importance of studying the role of helpers and their benefits to breeders not only in the context of direct brood care, but also for other cooperative tasks, in order to understand the evolution of complex animal societies.

   AUTOTOMY; CONFLICT
AB Monogynous male mating strategies have repeatedly evolved in spiders along with female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) and extreme male mating investment. As a manifestation of sexual conflict, male African golden-silk spiders, Trichonephila fenestrata, are regularly attacked by females during copulation, and sexual cannibalism is common. Curiously, attacked males actively cast off (autotomize) their front legs and copulation continues while the female is feeding on these legs. Since the loss of legs is costly in reducing males' ability to mate guard, it should yield significant benefits. In a series of experiments, we investigated the behavioural mechanism of male leg ejection and tested three hypotheses. First, we performed feeding experiments to test whether conspecific male legs are particularly attractive for females and act as a sensory trap. Second, we conducted mating experiments with sibling and nonsibling pairings to test whether males preferentially invest in high-quality mates. Third, by offering male legs during copulations, we tested whether male leg ejection serves to distract and pacify females. In support of the female pacifier hypothesis, our results confirm a significantly reduced probability of attacks in females that had been offered a male leg, but we found no relationship between simulated leg ejection and male survival. While there was no evidence for special properties of male legs, females accepted male legs significantly more often than insect food. The degree of male leg sacrifice did not depend on male-female relatedness, but large males lost more legs than small males, and small males achieved more copulations. However, total copulation duration was unrelated to male size. Male leg sacrifice in T. fenestrata may represent a rare example of an evolutionary transition in which the antipredation behaviour of autotomizing body parts has changed its function into a sexual context, here to pacify females and to facilitate undisturbed copulations.

AB Social learning can be a shortcut for acquiring locally adaptive information. Animals that live in social groups have better access to social information, but gregarious and nonsocial species are also frequently exposed to social cues. Thus, social learning might simply reflect an animal's general ability to learn rather than an adaptation to social living. Here, we investigated social learning and the effect of frequency of social exposure in nonsocial, juvenile Port Jackson sharks, Heterodontus portusjacksoni. We compared (1) Individual Learners, (2) Sham-Observers, paired with a naive shark, and (3) Observers, paired with a trained demonstrator, in a novel foraging task. We found that more Observers learnt the foraging route compared to Individual Learners or Sham-Observers, and that Individual Learners took more days to learn. Training frequency did not affect learning rate, suggesting acquisition occurred mostly between training bouts. When demonstrators were absent, 30% of observers maintained their performance above the learning criterion, indicating they retained the acquired information. These results indicate that social living is not a prerequisite for social learning in elasmobranchs and suggest social learning is ubiquitous in vertebrates.

AB Affiliative interspecies interactions are important to community structure within an ecosystem yet understudied relative to antagonistic relationships. Mixed-species associations provide important benefits via foraging, predator avoidance and social interactions. Tactile behaviours help with social bond formation and group establishment among conspecifics during social interactions, but little is known about the role of contact between heterospecific animals in mixed-species groups. Our objective was to quantify characteristics of pectoral fin contact between individuals of two sympatric species of wild dolphins, spotted dolphins, Stenella frontalis, and bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, off Bimini, The Bahamas, in order to assess possible benefits of heterospecific interactions. Using underwater video recordings from mixed-species dolphin encounters from 2011 to 2017, we observed 74 pectoral fin contacts, of which 27 were between heterospecific animals. Encounters were either affiliative (61.5%) or sociosexual (38.5%). Conspeciflc and heterospecific dolphins had similar rates of initiating and receiving contacts. This suggests that during mixed-species groups, the cost-benefit trade-off in choosing a social partner is similar for conspecific and heterospecific individuals. Heterospecific contacts initiated by S. frontalis were primarily affiliative whereas heterospecific contacts initiated by T. truncatus were sociosexual. Both sociosexual behaviour and pectoral fin contact in dolphins have been suggested as mechanisms of bond formation. We conclude that mixed-species interactions with pectoral fin contact may be a mechanism for social bond formation between heterospecifics and that these bonds may help to re-establish groups, as needed, for predator avoidance.

AB The stability of social relationships is important to animals living in groups, and social network analysis provides a powerful tool to help characterize and understand their (in)stability and the consequences at the group level. However, the use of dynamic social networks is still limited in this context because it requires long-term social data and new analytical tools. Here, we studied the dynamic evolution of a group of 29 Guinea baboons, Papio papio, using a data set of automatically collected cognitive tests comprising more than 16 million records collected over 3 years. We first built a monthly aggregated temporal network describing the baboon's co-presence in the cognitive testing booths. We then used a null model, considering the heterogeneity in the baboons' activity, to define both positive (association) and negative (avoidance) monthly networks. We tested social balance theory by combining these positive and negative social networks. The results showed that the networks were structurally balanced and that newly created edges also tended to preserve social balance. We then investigated several network metrics to gain insights into the individual level and group level social networks' long-term temporal evolution. Interestingly, a measure of similarity between successive monthly networks was able to pinpoint periods of stability and instability and to show how some baboons' ego-networks remained stable while others changed radically. Our study confirms the prediction of social balance theory but also shows that large fluctuations in the numbers of triads may limit its applicability to study the dynamic evolution of animal social networks. In contrast, the use of the similarity measure proved to be very versatile and sensitive in detecting relationships' (in)stabilities at different levels. The changes we identified can be linked, at least in some cases, to females changing primary male, as observed in the wild. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   MATING SYSTEM; MATE CHOICE; SELECTION
AB Within Syngnathidae (pipefish, seadragons and seahorses), male pregnancy often results in choosy males and competitive females. Females in these species often evolve secondary sexual traits and engage in courtship displays that make their ornaments more noticeable to males. Most syngnathids probably continue to grow larger throughout their lives, but we know little about the relationship between age and mating competition in these taxa. Here, we use the Gulf pipefish, Syngnathus scovelli, to investigate the roles of ornament size, courtship activity level, age and fecundity in female mating competition. We conducted male choice trials that allowed males to choose between similarly sized females of different ages. We also measured age and size at maturity. We found that females with larger ornaments were deeper bodied and engaged in longer courtship displays, yet males chose females based on body depth and display rather than ornamentation. This result suggests that ornamentation serves to help males assess female quality. Female age plays no role in male choice or in female ornamentation. Our finding that males care more about female phenotype than female age considerably simplifies the interpretation of mating patterns in natural populations of Gulf pipefish, which are characterized by considerable age structure.

AB The past 20 years have seen a surge of interest in how animals perceive colour, setting the stage for a much more detailed examination of how colour perception differs among species, how a species' colour perception relates to its environment and how it all fits into the framework of animal communication. We need to address two major questions: first, how do general mechanisms of signal processing work within whole clades of animals, and second, how do these mechanisms modulate differences among related species within clades? The receptor noise-limited (RNL) model (Vorobyev & Osorio, 1998) has made a critical advance in the field. Relevant parameters of the model, including screening pigments in the eye, visual pigments and relative numbers of the different receptor cells, can be measured to predict how species detect objects in their environment, based on wavelength. Details of the opponent channels, however, which compare the outputs of the retinal receptors and can determine the signals sent to the brain, are unknown for most species and are not required by the model. Here, we unpack the RNL model, focusing on experiments in humans and birds, and explore the impact of including specific opponent channels in the model. Incorporating opponent channels into the RNL model could help us better understand the selective forces and coevolutionary processes that shape the visual system and determine visual adaptations. Present evidence shows that the RNL model works as a good first approximation and points to critical parameters we need to measure, such as noise in receptor cells.

AB In social species, individuals can use a variety of cues to inform their association patterns. For example, individuals might use information about the rank, recent diet and disease state of potential partners to make association decisions. However, whether individuals use the past experiences of others with predation risk to inform their association decisions remains unknown. Associating with experienced individuals might enable social transmission of predator information and prepare individuals for dangers they have not yet encountered personally. Alternatively, individuals might avoid such predator-experienced individuals and the potential high predation risk nearby. Here, I manipulated the exposure to predation risk of laboratory-born mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, creating high-risk individuals (exposed to alarm cues 9 x over 18 days) and low-risk individuals (exposed to water only). I tested preference of naive laboratory-born focal fish to associate with these high-risk and low-risk individuals, allowing both visual and chemical cues, in a choice test. Under safe conditions, focal fish associated equally with the high-risk and low-risk individuals. I then added alarm cue to the testing tank and again measured association preferences. Under these risky conditions, the focal fish increased their time spent associating with the low-risk partner. Importantly, high-risk and low-risk partners did not differ in swimming activity. These results suggest that during interactions, individuals can not only detect the past experiences of others with predation risk, but that they use this information to alter their shoaling decisions under certain conditions, specifically when they themselves encounter cues of predation risk.

AB Food caching is common in many animal species and is thought to have evolved largely by natural selection. We propose that sexual selection also plays an important role in the evolution of food caching. The sexual trait promotion (STP) hypothesis predicts that if male food caches provide supplemental nutrition allowing males to improve their sexual traits (e.g. song) serving a role in female choice, then sexual selection would act on male food caching. To test this idea, we investigated correlations between the number of caches that males retrieved, male song and pairing success, in the bull-headed shrike, Lanius bucephalus. Our field observations showed that the number of food caches males retrieved was positively correlated with male singing tempo (i.e. the number of notes uttered per second), not with other song characteristics (e.g. repertoire size). The bull-headed shrike's singing tempo has been found to reflect the nutritional condition of the singer and females choose their mates based on the tempo. Food supplementation experiments showed that males with artificially augmented food caches sang at higher speeds and mated with females earlier than controls; conversely, cache removal experiments showed that males with depleted food caches sang at lower speeds and were more likely to fail to mate than controls. Our results suggest that the food caches of male bull-headed shrikes provide them with supplementary nutrition allowing them to improve a condition-dependent song characteristic, which in turn serves the function of female attraction. We therefore conclude that sexual selection is an important evolutionary force acting on male food caching.

AB Pair bonding (i.e. individuals showing a preference for a specific opposite-sex individual) has been demonstrated in several socially monogamous species. However, social bonds also occur in nonmonogamous species, but have received less attention. Currently, we do not know whether social bonds in monogamous pairs differ from social bonds in polygynous groups. We studied the socially flexible African striped mouse in the laboratory, conducting 3 h partner preference tests typically used to measure pair bonds in socially monogamous prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster. In the field, striped mice typically live in polygynous groups, but socially monogamous pairs have also been observed. We compared social bonds between 12 monogamous pairs and 12 polygynous groups (1 male and 2 females). The social situation (monogamous versus polygynous) did not influence social bonds. Female striped mice showed a preference for their partner. While males spent more time in body contact with their partner, they showed a sexual preference for strange females. Polygynous males did not show a preference for one of their two females. While significant preferences for partners were found in striped mice, social preference was less strong than that reported for socially monogamous prairie voles. In summary, our results suggest that opposite-sex social bonds not only occur in monogamous species but also in species that live in polygynous groups, but that these bonds might be weaker in polygynous species.

AB Dispersal is a key process in ecology and evolution. Both theoretical and empirical evidence in actively dispersing organisms support the general notion that the use of nearly straight dispersal paths is a highly efficient way to maximize dispersal success in heterogenous landscapes. In homogeneous landscapes, in contrast, the benefits of a straighter dispersal path could be outweighed by an increase in risk costs, favouring the evolution of tortuous dispersal paths resulting in a relatively slow dispersal. Empirical support for this theoretical prediction, however, has remained elusive. To explore this theoretical prediction, we studied the movement behaviour of the southern Darwin's frog, Rhinoderma darwinii, a fully terrestrial amphibian inhabiting a highly homogeneous environment (i.e. South American temperate forest). Using spatial capture-recapture data collected over a 4-year period in wild populations, in combination with statistical and simulation modelling, we found evidence of a slow natal dispersal lasting one year or more. In contrast, adults exhibited high site fidelity, having a median annual displacement of 3.64 m. A correlated random walk model produced synthetic distributions of juvenile annual displacement that were nearly identical to the empirical data, suggesting that a plausible explanation of juvenile dispersal is the use of routine movements (with high path tortuosity) over short temporal scales (<3 months) integrated over the year along a relatively straight dispersal path. We predict that for species living in homogenous landscapes, this behaviour likely reduces many of the costs associated with the transient stage of dispersal. Specifically, periods of routine movements might reduce risk costs (e.g. dying due to starvation or predation), while the integration of these periods along a straight line maximizes dispersal distance while minimizing energetic costs.

AB Many species of animal use social information, and in a variety of different contexts, but it is not clear to what degree their ability to do this depends upon their prior experience of the association between the behaviour of others and reward. We addressed this question in an experiment in which two stickleback species (Gasterosteus aculeatus and Punginus punginus) were exposed to a novel feeding task and then tested under a range of conditions. Using a fully factorial training design, fish were fed from either the surface or the bottom of their tank, and at the same time were exposed to conspecifics feeding from the surface or bottom. At test, we showed that in order to be able to use demonstrator behaviour to anticipate the presence of food at the surface, test subjects needed first to have prior experience of both: sticklebacks responded to the behaviour of conspecifics that were feeding at the surface by rising higher in the water column themselves, but, crucially, they only did this if they had prior experience both of finding food at the water surface and of seeing others feed there. Moreover, they only displayed this response in the presence of feeding conspecifics, but not when the demonstrators were not feeding or were absent. The role of prior experience and learning in social information use is surprisingly understudied. We suggest that such work is vital if we are to understand the level at which natural selection operates in shaping social information use and social learning.

AB Understanding complex natural systems requires approaches with minimal statistical limitations and biases. Previously, however, the fields of behaviour, ecology and evolution generally have been restricted to evaluating differences between statistical distributions. This framework can be very powerful. Unfortunately, it has also created a bias in these, and many other, fields towards publications focusing only on phenomena for which there are statistically significant differences. However, there is a wide range of questions that would benefit from reversing the existing paradigm and testing, instead, for equivalence. We have adapted the two one-sided test (TOST), also known as equivalence testing, from pharmaceutical science to be applicable to behavioural and ecological studies. We created a repeated measures analysis that allows researchers to statistically examine similarities between distributions. We compared song structure in male and female eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, as a case study for this method. We failed to find significant differences between male and female songs via a more traditional test, repeated measures ANOVA. Therefore, no definitive conclusion could be drawn about the similarities or differences in song structure. However, our repeated measures equivalence test showed that, based on five standard measures of song variation, male and female eastern bluebirds sing statistically equivalent songs. Our study highlights the presence of complex female song in a temperate songbird species. Additionally, we provide a new statistical test useful for expanding the statistical toolbox to assess new behavioural and ecological questions, and to help counteract publication bias in our fields.

AB Lateralization refers to the preferential use of one side of the body to perform certain tasks, often as a consequence of the specialization of cerebral hemispheres. Individuals may benefit from lateralization if it allows them to perform complex tasks simultaneously. Studies on laterality further suggest that sex and age can influence the extent of lateralization. However, most studies on lateralization have been performed on captive individuals, exposed to simplified environments and expressing limited behavioural repertoire. Here, we evaluated behavioural lateralization in the greater flamingo, Phoenicopterus roseus, through observations of wild individuals 5-37 years old. We examined the lateralization of simple behaviours (resting postures) and of several demanding behaviours requiring enhanced motor control and coordination (stamping for food and five courtship postures). Resting postures were not lateralized. In contrast, nearly all flamingos were completely lateralized for stamping, with a significant predominance of right-footed individuals. During courtship displays, twist-preens were significantly lateralized, yet with no dominant laterality at the population level. Finally, we detected a slight positive effect of age on the intensity of twist-preen lateralization, which may be related to the increased complexity of courtship displays with age in this species. Our results support the hypothesis that lateralization manifests in complex behaviours, even in wild animals. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Material and/or genetic benefits are hypothesized to be the main drivers of female mate choice. Research on female mate choice has mainly focused on polyandrous species and has seldom considered monandrous species. Given the absence of postcopulatory mate choice in monandrous females, we predicted that precopulatory mate choice is important for monandrous species. Using the wolf spider Pardosa astrigera as a model monandrous species, we compared mating, reproductive output and offspring fitness between females with preferred mates (mates that were accepted on the first exposure) and females with nonpreferred mates (mates that were rejected on the first exposure but were induced to mate on the second exposure). Our results showed that the mating duration, latency to egg laying and to egg hatching, fecundity and egg hatching rate did not differ significantly between females with preferred versus nonpreferred mates. In contrast, female and male development time was significantly shorter and female carapace width was significantly greater for offspring of females with preferred versus nonpreferred mates. In addition, survival from egg hatching to maturity was twice as high for offspring of females with preferred mates. These results indicate that female mate choice by the monandrous P. astrigera provides genetic rather than material benefits. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals in social aggregations use signals of quality or motivation to attract mates and intimidate rivals. Theory indicates that honesty can be maintained in these signals if the costs of signalling affect low-quality individuals more than they affect high-quality individuals. Considerable research has focused on identifying the nature of those costs and their ability to maintain honest signals. Much of this research, particularly in recent years, has focused on receiver-independent physiological costs of signal production. Less research attention has been paid to receiver-dependent costs that might arise from conspecific responses to signals. Here we survey the literature on these different types of costs, focusing in particular on case studies from a diversity of taxa. We find that signals often do carry significant physiological production costs, but this is not universal, as many signals appear to be physiologically inexpensive to produce. More importantly, very few studies have tested the key prediction that physiological production costs differentially affect low-quality individuals over high-quality individuals. In contrast, research from a diversity of taxa indicates that signals such as coloration and vocalizations often affect agonistic interactions, which in turn affect the production of signals, and that deceptive signallers receive more aggression than do honest signallers in at least some systems. Social costs are a plausible but understudied mechanism for maintaining honest signalling. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social network analysis is quickly becoming an established framework to study the structure of animal social systems. To explore the social network of a population, observers must capture data on the interactions or associations between individuals. Sampling decisions significantly impact the outcome of data collection, notably the amount of data available from which to construct social networks. However, little is known about how different sampling methods, and more generally the extent of sampling effort, impact the robustness of social network analyses. Here, we generate proximity networks from data obtained via nearly continuous GPS tracking of members of a wild baboon troop (Papio anubis). These data allow us to produce networks based on complete observations of interindividual distances between group members. We then mimic several widely used focal animal sampling and group scanning methods by subsampling the complete data set to simulate observational data comparable to that produced by human observers. We explore how sampling effort, sampling methods, network definitions and levels and types of sampling error affect the correlation between the estimated and complete networks. Our results suggest that for some scenarios, even low levels of sampling effort (5-10 samples/individual) can provide the same information as high sampling effort (>64 samples/individual). However, we find that insufficient data collected across all potentially interacting individuals, certain network definitions (how edge weights and distance thresholds are calculated) and misidentifications of individuals in the network can generate spurious network structure with little or no correlation to the underlying or 'real' social structure. Our results suggest that data collection methods should be designed to maximize the number of potential interactions (edges) recorded for each observation. We discuss the relative trade-offs between maximizing the amount of data collected across as many individuals as possible and the potential for erroneous observations.

AB Stereotypic behaviours (SBs) are common in confined animals including captive Carnivora, which display diverse forms of SB: often whole-body movements (e.g. pacing), but also head-only movements (e.g. head twirling) and 'scrabbling' (scratching at enclosure boundaries). Although often pooled together, emerging evidence indicates that SBs are heterogeneous, suggesting that subtypes differ in their causes, triggers, and consequently treatments. In mink, a model carnivore, scrabbling seems to be elicited by neighbouring conspecifics. We tested this hypothesis via three studies of 32 males (individually caged in rows and separated by solid partitions). Study 1 investigated whether neighbour proximity affects the location of any SBs, and Study 2, whether removing neighbours reduces any SBs. Results revealed that although mink typically avoided proximity to their neighbours, scrabbling was uniquely directed towards neighbours who were close to the shared cage partition. It was also the only SB significantly elevated by having all-male neighbours, and reduced by removing neighbours. Study 3 then investigated whether environmental enrichment, a standard SB treatment, would reduce or abolish different SBs equally, to assess whether scrabbling is simply easier to alleviate than other SBs. Enrichment reduced all SB subtypes, but logistic regressions revealed that the odds of complete abolition were higher for whole-body and head-only SBs than for scrabbling. Overall, these naturally solitary carnivores thus seem to avoid conspecific proximity, but they specifically direct their stereotypic scrabbling at neighbours; and their scrabbling is reduced by neighbour removal, while their whole-body and head-only SBs are instead better alleviated with enrichment. Understanding that carnivore SBs are heterogeneous in their triggers and most effective treatments may help zoos, breeding centres and mink farms improve the design of their enclosures and the efficacy of their enrichments.

AB Play fighting in juvenile rats is associated with a high occurrence of 50 kHz vocalizations. These calls are varied in form, ranging from long, flat calls to short, frequency-modulated ones. We hypothesize that at least some types of calls serve as play signals to facilitate play. In the present study, pairs of juvenile male rats that were unfamiliar with one another were paired in a neutral test enclosure to which they had been habituated. Video and audio records were made of the encounters. Pairs were of two types: both pairs could vocalize or only one partner could do so. There were some differences between the play of pairs containing a devocalized partner, but overall, the pattern of play, the frequency and types of calls were similar between the two types of pairs. We used a Monte Carlo shuffling technique to analyse the correlations between the playful actions performed and the types and frequencies of various 50 kHz calls that were produced. The analyses revealed that there were strong associations between types of calls and types of social contact: an approach followed by playful nape contact was associated with calls, but an approach followed by nonplayful contact (e.g. anogenital sniffing) was not. Similarly, different calls were associated with different actions, such as nape contact, evade and wrestling, with most of these calls being uttered by the initiator of the action, not the recipient. However, coordinating calls reciprocally with complementary calls uttered by participants as they engaged in complementary actions (e.g. attacking, being attacked) appeared to be a way in which calls could potentially be used as play signals to influence the ongoing cooperation needed to sustain play fights.

AB Researchers examining how nutrition impacts fitness traits usually examine one nutrient at a time, ignoring potential interactions. When researchers simultaneously examine multiple nutrients, their studies often focus on adults, ignoring potential changes in nutritional needs that occur during the transition between juvenile and adult stages. To address these issues, we quantified how dietary nutrient balance (relative amounts of protein and carbohydrate) during development and into adulthood influenced life history and sexually selected traits using male Jamaican field crickets, Gryllus assimilis. Our findings revealed that male crickets developed significantly faster and grew larger when they were reared on a protein-rich diet, but their average daily time spent signalling for mates was significantly higher when they were reared on a carbohydrate-rich diet. Furthermore, while the probability of signalling and daily time spent signalling increased with age, time spent signalling for mates tended to increase at a higher rate with age when males consumed a carbohydrate-rich diet in adulthood. Together our findings suggest that traits may differ in their nutrient requirements, resulting in diet influencing a possible trade-off between traits across different life stages. The ability to locate and consume foods rich in protein during development should impact adult male fitness, as protein availability results in larger males, and larger males typically produce more attractive signals and are preferred by females. Conversely, the ability to locate and consume foods rich in carbohydrate should also impact a male's fitness, as males signal with higher effort when fed carbohydrate-rich diets, and higher signalling effort can directly impact a male's ability to attract a female.

AB Animals have been specialized by natural selection to perceive features of their environment that strongly impact their reproductive success. For many social animals, the social world of conspecifics provides the most pertinent information, ultimately enabling individuals to adaptively anticipate future events, like time-sensitive opportunities to acquire rare resources. Here we investigated whether 'social timing'-joining others at the right time for resource acquisition-ultimately drives the perception of different social structures among highly social terrestrial hermit crabs, Coenobita compressus. These crabs are specialized to live in architecturally remodelled homes, which can only be acquired through coordinated social interactions among conspecifics. We experimentally simulated these social interactions using static arrays of shells that mimicked the temporary social structures formed at each stage in the social shell-acquisition process. Free-wandering crabs in the wild were then allowed to choose among these different social structures. We found that crabs were most attracted to social structures representing early stages of the social shell-acquisition process, which predict forthcoming opportunities and hence allow individuals to join in time to take priority spots in ensuing social formations. In contrast, social structures representing late stages of the social shell-acquisition process were less attractive. When crabs joined such late-stage social structures they did not stay long, assessing they had arrived too late to insert themselves into the existing social arrangement. Broadly, these results suggest that strong selective pressures exist for sensory specializations that are in tune with the temporal and spatial patterning of opportunities in the social world.

AB The acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that animals should adaptively respond to the transmission properties of the habitat in which they communicate. Although there have been many tests of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis with birdsong, there have been very few tests with different types of bird vocalizations. Here I tested the predictions of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis with avian mobbing calls produced in closed, open and urban habitats in three families of passerine birds. I also controlled for body size and phylogeny since these are known to influence acoustic characteristics of vocalizations. I found that body size was important in duration and frequency measurements of mobbing call acoustic structure. Phylogeny explained acoustic variation in only some acoustic variables measured. I also found only the two low-frequency measurements to differ across habitats. First, 5% frequency (a measurement of low-frequency energy distribution) differed between species classified as occurring in predominately open or closed habitats, with species classified as closed having lower 5% frequency than species classified as open. This finding supports the prediction that species in closed habitats will have lower low frequencies than species in open habitats. Additionally, I found that species classified as urban had a lower minimum frequency. This is in direct opposition to the prediction of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis and previous findings for birdsong, where species appear to shift lower minimum frequencies upward, likely to avoid masking by anthropogenic noise. To confirm this finding, I also measured low frequency using power spectra with an amplitude threshold (i.e. threshold method) and confirmed the same result: species classified as urban had lower minimum frequencies than species classified as open or closed.

AB The effects of parasites on the reproduction of their hosts are widespread, but studies investigating the effect of female parasitic status on sperm allocation in males, a form of postcopulatory mate choice, remain scarce. Because males are often sperm limited, strategic sperm investment, in which females of low reproductive value receive fewer sperm, is predicted to occur to maximize long-term male reproductive success. In this study based on pairs collected in natura, we investigated how Gammarus roeseli (Crustacea: Amphipoda) males allocated sperm when paired with females infected with the vertically transmitted, sex ratio-distorting, microsporidian parasites, Nosema granulosis or Dictyocoela sp. Since infected females had similar fecundity to uninfected ones, and offspring of females infected with N. granulosis showed a higher survival rate, we predicted equivalent or even larger sperm investment from males paired with infected females. Contrary to our predictions, males paired with infected females had a lower sperm count before insemination and provided smaller ejaculates than those paired with uninfected females. This pattern suggests either a strategic sperm investment as a function of the female's parasitic status, or that males in good condition had a higher probability of pairing with uninfected females than those in poor condition.

AB Understanding the emergence and persistence of convergent phenotypes is the subject of considerable debate. Species may converge on nearly identical phenotypes for a variety of reasons, including occupying similar environments, exhibiting similar foraging ecologies, and for signalling reasons such as mimicry. Interspecific social dominance mimicry (ISDM) is a hypothesis that states that socially subordinate species evolve a phenotype mimicking a dominant species so as to accrue resources and avoid aggression. A recently proposed test case for this phenomenon asserts that downy woodpeckers, Picoides pubescens, evolved mimetic plumage to avoid attacks from hairy woodpeckers, Picoides villosus. We examined this claim with a large behavioural data set collected by citizen scientists. We employed phylogenetic methods and simulations to test whether downy woodpeckers avoid aggression, and whether downy woodpeckers are more dominant than expected based on body mass. Contrary to the expectations of ISDM, we found that downy woodpeckers were markedly more often the target of hairy woodpecker attacks than expected based on their relative abundances. Our empirical data thus offers no support for the strict ISDM hypothesis as an explanation for downy-hairy woodpecker plumage convergence. However, downy woodpeckers are slightly more dominant than expected based on their body mass, albeit not significantly so. Our data therefore lend weight to previous suggestions that the benefits of mimicry potentially accrue from third-party species mistaking the mimic for the model, rather than the model mistaking the mimic for another model.

AB Bird vocalizations consist of songs and calls. The calls tend either to be given singly or to consist of multiple elements given in a rapid string. The multi-element bird calls of some nonpasserines resemble passerine song and can contain many diverse elements. Multi-element vocalizations can change the signal message by varying the number of elements and/or the diversity and selection of element types. The use of multi-element variation has been extensively studied in passerine songs, but only rarely in nonpasserines. Here we examined two multi-element vocalization types in a wild parrot, the orangefronted conure, Eupsittula canicularis: ` warbles' consist of diverse elements (heterotypic) whereas ` peaches' consist of repetitions of the same element (homotypic). Both call types are used in aggressive interactions between pairs or flocks. We used playbacks to wild conure flocks in Costa Rica to determine whether the number of elements (both types) and/or the diversity of elements (warble repertoire size) produced differentiable responses. Both short and long peach call series usually elicited retreat, but longer series led to reduced warbling and increased soft contact calls (zip calls) when responses were compared with those of short series. The warble stimuli mainly affected the approach behaviour leaving most call rates unaffected: more flocks left the area in response to long warbles with large repertoires, whereas short, small repertoire stimuli resulted in a closer approach. Both experiments showed that the length of both types of multi-element call and element diversity in warbles are salient to the wild conures. The results suggest that longer series of both call types and higher diversity warbles may be perceived by the birds as more aggressive, leading to the observed patterns of approach, retreat and interaction. The results suggest that vocal complexity in parrots has a signal value similar to that found in passerines.

AB Parasite dispersal theory draws heavily upon epidemiological SIR models in which host status (susceptible (S), infected (I), or recovered (R)) is used to study parasite dispersal evolution. In contrast to these extrinsically host-centric drivers, in this study we focus on an intrinsic driver, the parasite's reproductive value (predicted future offspring) as a regulator of the extent to which the individual will engage in risky dispersal behaviour. As a model system we use the honeybee Apis mellifera and its ectoparasite, the mite Varroa destructor. Mite reproduction happens exclusively inside cells of bee brood, and newly emerged fecund mites may parasitize either a homocolonial brood cell (low risk dispersal) or emigrate to a new bee colony via phoretic attachment to mature forager bees (high risk dispersal). In an empirical bioassay, prepartum mites (high reproductive value) and postpartum mites (low reproductive value) were offered a choice of newly emerged homocolonial worker bees (low risk), homocolonial pollen forager bees (high risk), or heterocolonial pollen foragers (high risk). A preference for newly emerged bees was earlier and more strongly sustained among prepartum mites. This suggests comparatively greater dispersal risk tolerance among postpartum mites with lower reproductive value. A dangerous bid for dispersal may be adaptive if the individual has already successfully reproduced and the rewards for successful dispersal are sufficiently large. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Theoretical models suggest that adult sex ratio (ASR) and population density are expected to influence parental roles by reducing the mating opportunities of the commoner sex and by changing the intensity of sperm competition, although experimental evidence for these predictions is sparse. In biparental species with a high risk of extrapair paternity and consecutive egg laying over the breeding period, males are expected to reduce their parental investment and to spend more time on mate guarding if male density is high, to maximize their fitness. We conducted a field experiment to test this hypothesis in Lethrus apterus, a flightless biparental beetle species from the Geotrupidae family. Using seminatural enclosures, we assigned individuals to nine treatment groups differing in adult sex ratio (three levels) and individual density (three levels) using a full factorial experimental design. Nest attendance and parental provisioning (i.e. collecting and transporting leaves to the nest) were recorded as well as the number, size and sex ratio of the offspring. We found that as the level of maleemale competition increased, generated either by the increased density of individuals or by the male-biased sex ratio, pairs showed higher nest attendance and collected fewer leaves. Male-biased groups also produced fewer offspring under high and low densities indicating a possible conflict of interest between the sexes over paternity and brood size. These results support the increased paternity assurance hypothesis under a high level of intrasexual competition. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID BIRD SONG; PERFORMANCE; FEMALE; SIGNAL; MODEL
AB Identifying the signalling strategies employed by animals during vocal interactions is a challenge, especially for species with large vocal repertoires. We propose that efforts to study such vocal dynamics can benefit by integrating models of syntax into their analyses. In this study, we conducted playback experiments on Cassin's vireo, Vireo cassinii, to examine the role of syntax, and more specifically, shared syntactic patterns, in countersinging. We presented 11 males with song sequences ordered according to population norms, and with sequences whose order deviated from population norms. We did not find evidence that individuals markedly altered their responses based on the syntax of the playback, either in their physical approach to the speaker or in the quantity of song they delivered in response. We did, however, find evidence that syntax was important in governing their choice of phrase types in response to the playbacks. Subjects did not match the playback phrase types. Instead, they engaged in a vocal behaviour referred to as song advancing, where they responded to a stimulus phrase type by singing the phrase type that most often followed the stimulus in their own normal song sequences. When playback sequences were ordered according to population norms, song advancing resulted in birds pre-empting the upcoming playback phrase type or delivering another of the prior playback phrase types (i.e. delayed matching) at higher rates than when playback sequences deviated from population norms. The detection of song advancing was only possible with the explicit inclusion of syntax in our analysis, suggesting that studies of the vocal interactions of species with repertoires of multiple vocalizations can benefit from consideration not only of a subject's repertoire, but also their syntax.

AB Many animals respond differentially to stimuli on one side of their body compared to the other. This is a reflection of being lateralized, and is a feature common in vertebrates. Given that any particular stimulus that an animal encounters, be it food, a predator or a competitor, has an equal probability of coming from either side of the body, there may be negative selection for lateralization. However, the costs of lateralization may be offset if being lateralized confers a considerable advantage in other contexts, including cognition. Here, we showed that learned responses of juvenile ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, to a novel predator was strongly influenced by the degree of lateralization. While both lateralized and nonlateralized fish were able to learn the predator, lateralized fish showed much stronger responses to the learned predator than nonlateralized fish. When we paired lateralized and nonlateralized fish and allowed them to interact over a shelter resource, we observed that lateralized fish were poorer competitors. They attacked less often, showed fewer displays and exhibited greater avoidance of their competitor. For many gregarious species, the expression of lateralization likely reflects a fine balance of competing selection pressures. Our work highlights the need for integrative studies.

AB There is an ongoing debate on how personality types are maintained within populations. We tested, for the first time, the potential of trait multidimensionality and trait compensation, where prey compensate for the costs of one trait by relying more on another one, in maintaining variation in boldness within a population. We studied how four boldness-related traits and swimming escape performance covary and shape the probability of survival and autotomy of Ischnura pumilio damselfly larvae in an experiment with predatory dragonfly larvae. Our results did not support the common belief that bold individuals are selected against in terms of survival selection by predation. Instead, we found survival selection favouring individuals combining being bold for two boldness-related traits. The four boldness-related traits did not covary frequently, supporting the multidimensionality of boldness. Moreover, animals bolder for one trait (activity in the presence of predator cues) were shyer for another trait (response to predator cues), which indicated trait compensation. However, the support for trait compensation was limited. The only other case of trait compensation was that bold larvae compensated for their increased risk-taking behaviour in the presence of a predator with a higher probability of autotomy. These patterns may contribute to maintaining variation in boldness in damselfly populations. Just as boldness-related traits are multidimensional, the mechanisms underlying their persistence in natural populations are also likely to be multifaceted.

AB The predatory greenhead ant, Rhytidoponera metallica, readily attacks some insects but not the processionary caterpillar, Ochrogaster lunifer. This urticarial lepidopteran larva is covered in long hairs and has numerous smaller, detachable barbed setae present on the third instar and older larvae. These setae are a health risk to humans and other mammals. In this study, we tested whether O. lunifer larvae are defended against invertebrate predators, using R. metallica as an example. Field experiments at R. metallica nests and laboratory olfactometer experiments were used to assess possible behavioural, morphological and chemical defence mechanisms. We found that a volatile chemical component from O. lunifer larvae inhibited attack/approach by R. metallica. This odour was associated with O. lunifer cuticular components: larval hairs, setae and exoskeleton. Behavioural defence was not found to inhibit R. metallica attack. Furthermore, despite the dense hairs and setae covering O. lunifer larvae, these did not act as a physical barrier to ant attack. Our study demonstrates the key role of chemical ecology in invertebrate interactions involving such hairy caterpillars. Future isolation of the deterrent chemical(s) produced by O. lunifer larvae may offer novel possibilities for managing ant behaviour. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Coevolutionary theory predicts that parasitism selects for defensive traits in the hosts that counteract the negative effects of parasites. Such antagonistic interactions may continuously coevolve within cycles without end, or result in host specialization and speciation of parasites. Here, we argue that particularities of brood parasiteehost systems explain whether the coevolutionary relationships result in parasite specialization and speciation. Highlighted particularities of the system are (1) virulence of the parasites, (2) the ability of parasites to alter host behaviour, (3) the relative importance of defensive tolerance and defensive resistance of hosts, and (4) phenotypic plasticity of parasite virulence and host resistance. Fixed virulence of parasites selects for fixed resistance of hosts and both enhance the process of specialization and speciation of parasites. In contrast, phenotypic plasticity in virulence of the parasites would select for tolerance and facultative resistance in their hosts. These host characteristics imply limited escalation in resistance defences and therefore would facilitate continuous coevolutionary cycles preventing parasite specialization. Thus, when studying the diversification of brood parasites within the avian phylogeny, considering these three factors would help us understand what drives their evolution. To illustrate the importance of virulence, phenotypic plasticity and defensive tolerance for the evolution of parasites, we compare evolutionary radiation experienced by the genus Clamator and the Tribe Cuculinii, which includes the genus Cuculus, and speculate whether particularities of brood parasitism by the great spotted cuckoo, Clamator glandarius, and the common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, explain differences in evolutionary radiation experienced by these two groups of brood parasites.

AB Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are a major driver of social evolution, but much of the experimental work pertaining to IGEs on social behaviour has focused on the effect of stimulus individuals on single focal individuals. We extended IGE research to examine how stimulus individuals influence social interactions among several focal individuals. Specifically, we relied on recent work on social behaviour in fruit flies to examine whether IGEs cause 12 stimulus flies of distinct genotypes to alter social interactions within groups of six focal flies. The social behaviour of focals was significantly affected by the genotype of the stimulus flies. Focals were closer together when grouped with stimulus flies from genotypes that were close together than when grouped with stimulus flies from genotypes that were farther apart. A mechanism mediating this effect was the encounter rate between focal flies, which was lowest when the focal flies were grouped with stimulus flies of the more cohesive genotypes.

AB Animals communicate using a vast array of different signals in different modalities. For chimpanzees, vocalizations, gestures and facial expressions are all important forms of communication, yet these signals have rarely been studied together holistically. The current study aimed to provide the first comprehensive repertoire of flexibly combined ('free') multimodal (MM) signals, and assess individual and contextual factors influencing production of, and responses to, unimodal (UM) and MM signals in wild chimpanzees. In total, 48 different free MM signals were produced. MM signals were produced at a significantly lower rate than UM signals, but 22 of 26 focal animals were observed to produce free MM signals. The relative production rates of different types of UM and MM signals differed significantly between the behavioural contexts investigated, showing flexible use of signals across contexts. In contrast, individual factors such as age, sex or rank of signaller did not appear to influence the type of signal produced or the likelihood of eliciting a response. Finally, we compared recipient responses to free MM grunt-gesture signals and matched UM component signals and found that these MM signals were more likely to elicit a response than a grunt alone, but were as likely to elicit a response as the gesture alone. The overall findings point to a widespread capacity for wild chimpanzees to flexibly combine signals from different modalities and highlight the importance of adopting a multimodal approach to studying communication.

AB Animal contests vary greatly in behavioural tactics used and intensity reached, with some encounters resolved without physical contact while others escalate to damaging fighting. However, the reasons for such variation remains to be fully explained. Aggressiveness, in terms of a personality trait, offers a potentially important source of variation that has typically been overlooked. Therefore, we studied how aggressiveness as a personality trait influenced escalation between contestants matched for resource-holding potential (RHP), using detailed observations of the contest behaviour, contest dynamics and escalation levels. We predicted that winner and loser behaviour would differ depending on personality. This was tested by examining 52 dyadic contests between pigs, Sus scrofa. Aggressiveness was assayed in resident-intruder tests prior to the contest. Contests were then staged between pigs matched for RHP in terms of body weight but differing in their aggressiveness. In 27% of the contests a winner emerged without escalated physical fighting, demonstrating that a fight is not a prerequisite between RHP-matched contestants. However, the duration of contests with or without fighting was the same. In contests without a fight, opponents spent more time on mutual investigation and noncontact displays such as parallel walking, which suggests that ritualized display may facilitate assessment and decision making. Winners low in aggressiveness invested more time in opponent investigation and display and showed substantially less aggression towards the loser after its retreat compared to aggressive winners. Aggressiveness influenced contest dynamics but did not predict the level of escalation. Prominent behavioural differences were found for the interaction between personality and outcome and we therefore recommend including this interaction in models where personality is considered. Analyses based on contest duration only would miss many of the subtleties shown here and we therefore encourage more detailed analyses of animal contests, irrespective of the level of contest escalation.

AB Animal behaviour is influenced by many environmental factors, including temperature and predation risk. Although many species utilize shelters to buffer ambient temperature and avoid predators, a trade-off can exist between thermoregulation and predator avoidance (e.g. an animal avoids a shelter that is too hot or cold at the expense of increased vulnerability to predators). Immune activation influences both thermoregulation and shelter use, yet its role in mediating a trade-off between these two important processes is unclear. Thus, we examined the dynamics of this thermoregulation-shelter use trade-off using the cornsnake, Pantherophis guttatus, and a repeated measures 2 x 2 factorial design in a thermal gradient where shelter availability and immune activation status were manipulated. Immune activation (injection of lipopolysaccharide, LPS, an endotoxin found in the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria) did not elicit behavioural fever or change shelter use when shelter was available across the entire thermal gradient. Although snakes strongly prioritized shelter use (e.g. snakes injected with saline were observed under shelter 98% of the time), their prioritization shifted during immune challenge. Snakes injected with LPS that were forced to choose between preferred temperature and shelter use maintained thermoregulation, but they spent up to nine-fold more time exposed relative to when they were injected with saline. These results demonstrate the plasticity of the widespread trade-off between thermoregulation and shelter use. Our results also indicate that immune-challenged animals not exhibiting fever may still exhibit important shifts in the prioritization of thermoregulation; thus, we recommend a more nuanced assessment of the effects of immune activation on thermoregulatory behaviour.

AB Animal personality has been linked to individual fitness across many taxa. However, the exact path by which personality translates into fitness is rarely identified. We tested whether nest site choice may serve as a potential pathway linking personality and reproductive success in a natural population of chestnut thrush, Turdus rubrocanus. Using path analysis, we found that human disturbance and choice of nest site with respect to nest density may both mediate the link between personality and reproductive success. Bolder females may choose nest sites with lower nest density, and the low nest density in turn may be responsible for a positive effect on nestling number, and have a negative effect on nestling mass. Bolder females may also prefer nest sites further from human settlements, resulting in a negative effect on nestling mass. Our findings provide rare exact mechanistic pathways by which boldness might be translated into reproductive success. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While most current predictive models agree that the climate is changing, it is not yet clear what impact these changes will have on animal populations. It is vital to determine the potential consequences in order to develop future management and conservation strategies. Climate change may impact population stability by prompting changes in breeding behaviour. For example, if above-average temperatures negatively affect adult body condition, this will increase the cost of parental care. Theory suggests that under this scenario, individuals may trade off their own body condition and survival against that of their young. Despite convincing evidence that this parental care trade-off exists in nature, the potential impact of climate change on parental investment strategies has rarely been investigated. In cooperatively breeding species, group-living adults can gain group size benefits, such as assistance with raising young. These benefits may mediate the effects of climate change on adult condition and subsequent investment in young. Here, we investigated the extent to which high temperatures and rainfall variation affect (1) adult provisioning rates to dependent nestlings, (2) offspring development and (3) the cost of offspring care in the cooperatively breeding pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor. We found that overall, adults provisioned young significantly less on hot days. However, this pattern was affected by rank: dominant individuals provisioned significantly less while subordinates did not. Offspring development was negatively affected by heatwave events, suggesting that young suffer from reduced investment on hot days. However, there was no evidence that the cost of provisioning young increased during heatwave periods, perhaps owing to the reduction in investment by adults. This study provides some of the first evidence that higher temperatures affect investment decisions in cooperative breeders and that dominant and subordinate individuals respond differently to this stressor.

AB The social intelligence hypothesis proposes that social complexity selects for cognitive complexity. However, the role of social complexity in the evolution of nonsocial cognition remains unresolved, resulting in disparate hypotheses. The domain-specific hypothesis posits that sociality only bolsters cognition associated with social challenges and contends that ecological complexity drives the evolution of nonsocial cognition. Alternatively, the domain-general hypothesis argues that the unmatched selective pressures of sociality favour greater cognitive flexibility and ultimately superior general cognition. We tested these hypotheses through experimental comparisons of nonsocial cognition in social and asocial carnivores: lions, Panthera leo, spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, leopards, Panthera pardus, and tigers, Panthera tigris. We tested subjects using a technical task, a puzzle-box, designed to test innovation. Social species were more successful innovators than asocial species. We also observed a positive association between sociality, persistence and innovation; social species spent significantly more time engaged in the task, and persistent individuals were more successful in solving the task. Thus, our findings support the domain-general hypothesis; social carnivores outperformed asocial carnivores on an innovative problem. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many animals, the nontrivial cost of ejaculate production has led males to evolve prudent reproductive strategies in the form of precopulatory mating bias and/or cryptic ejaculate allocation. Behaviours determining male reproductive success, such as courtship and aggression, also impose substantial costs potentially selecting for plasticity in these traits. Here, using laboratory-adapted populations of Drosophila melanogaster, we investigated whether males show plasticity in these behaviours in response to the changes in their perception of future risk of competition (generated by varying the number of rivals). We show that males exhibited nonlinear plasticity in their aggressive behaviour. Males subjected to intermediate risk were found to show the maximum level of aggression compared to those subjected to low and high risk. Such plasticity in aggression did not lead to any variation in mating success but significantly increased the cost of reproduction. We also found a similar trend in courtship behaviour. While our results on copulation duration confirmed the previously reported plasticity, we did not find any effect of the treatment on mating latency. To the best of our knowledge this is the first empirical evidence showing plasticity in aggression in response to perceived risk of future competition and its relation to the cost of reproduction.

AB Direct benefits provided by males have large effects on the fitness of females and their offspring in many species. Here, we examined whether mating or feeding experience of male Carolina sphinx moths, Manduca sexta (Sphingidae), affects the quality of direct benefits that males provide to their mates. We mated virgin females with fed and unfed, virgin and previously mated males. Feeding experience affected male mating success, spermatophore size and flight muscle size. In addition, females mated to fed males laid more eggs than females mated to unfed males, and females mated to virgin males laid more eggs than females mated to previously mated males. Using C-13-enriched glucose in the nectar of the fed males, we found that the second and third spermatophores of males were strongly labelled, but this labelled glucose was not present either in the female's fat body or in her eggs. Therefore, although fed males provided females direct benefits from the sugar in the nectar, the sugar was not used as a nutrient by females. We suggest that in short-lived species, where females mate singly and males mate multiply, and where nectar availability is highly variable, males may be selected to conserve their resources to maintain flight capability and to invest in sperm performance and, thus, provide only limited (non-nutritive) direct fitness benefits to their mates.

AB The existence of discrete social clusters, or 'communities', is a common feature of social networks in human and nonhuman animals. The level of such community structure in networks is typically measured using an index of modularity, Q. While modularity quantifies the degree to which individuals associate within versus between social communities and provides a useful measure of structure in the social network, it assumes that the network has been well sampled. However, animal social network data is typically subject to sampling errors. In particular, the associations among individuals are often not sampled equally, and animal social network studies are often based on a relatively small set of observations. Here, we extend an existing framework for bootstrapping network metrics to provide a method for assessing the robustness of community assignment in social networks using a metric we call community assortativity (r(com)). We use simulations to demonstrate that modularity can reliably detect the transition from random to structured associations in networks that differ in size and number of communities, while community assortativity accurately measures the level of confidence based on the detectability of associations. We then demonstrate the use of these metrics using three publicly available data sets of avian social networks. We suggest that by explicitly addressing the known limitations in sampling animal social network, this approach will facilitate more rigorous analyses of population-level structural patterns across social systems.

AB Nutritional conditions experienced by an individual are known to affect phenotype and performance. In particular, dietary carotenoids influence vertebrate immune function, vision and coloration and have recently been suggested to enhance exercise performance. Despite growing interest in investigating the effect of dietary carotenoids on exercise performance, studies to date have been limited to short-term supplementation during a single life stage. The present study elucidates, for the first time, the effect of long-term carotenoid supplementation during both developmental and adult life stages on the aquatic and terrestrial escape performance of adult southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, testing the predictions of the 'environmental matching' and the 'silver spoon' hypotheses. Individuals (N = 24 per treatment) were exposed to one of four dietary treatments: (1) both developmental and adult life stages were fed a carotenoid-supplemented diet (C-C); (2) developmental life stage, but not adult life stage, was fed a carotenoid-supplemented diet (C-U); (3) adult life stage, but not developmental life stage, was fed a carotenoid-supplemented diet (U-C); (4) both developmental and adult life stages were fed an unsupplemented diet (U-U). There was no effect of dietary carotenoids on swimming speed, hopping speed or righting ability. However, our results do indicate an effect of carotenoid supplementation on both swimming distance and hopping distance. Frogs receiving a carotenoid-supplemented diet during both developmental and adult life stages consistently outperformed other dietary treatments in the distance travelled during aquatic and terrestrial escape trials. Our results do not show support for either the silver spoon or the environmental matching hypothesis, but indicate an overall benefit of exposure to a carotenoid-rich environment across both life stages.

AB The learning capacities of males and females may differ with sex-specific behavioural requirements. Bumblebees provide a useful model system to explore how different lifestyles are reflected in learning abilities, because their (female but sterile) workers and males engage in fundamentally different behaviour routines. Bumblebee males, like workers, embark on active flower foraging but in contrast to workers they have to trade off their feeding with mate search, potentially affecting their abilities to learn and utilize floral cues efficiently during foraging. We used a serial colour-learning task with freely flying males and workers to compare their ability to flexibly learn visual floral cues with reward in a foraging scenario that changed over time. Male bumblebees did not differ from workers in both their learning speed and their ability to overcome previously acquired associations, when these ceased to predict reward. In all foraging tasks we found a significant improvement in choice accuracy in both sexes over the course of the training. In both sexes, the characteristics of the foraging performance depended largely on the colour difference of the two presented feeder types. Large colour distances entailed fast and reliable learning of the rewarding feeders whereas choice accuracy on highly similar colours improved significantly more slowly. Conversely, switching from a learned feeder type to a novel one was fastest for similar feeder colours and slow for highly different ones. Overall, we show that behavioural sex dimorphism in bumblebees did not affect their learning abilities beyond the mating context. We discuss the possible drivers and limitations shaping the foraging abilities of males and workers and implications for pollination ecology. We also suggest stingless male bumblebees as an advantageous alternative model system for the study of pollinator cognition. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Discrete colour polymorphisms are often genetically correlated with other traits under natural and sexual selection, such as behaviour, life history and physiology. Elucidating such correlations is essential to understand the adoption of alternative strategies between morphs and the role they play in the maintenance of colour polymorphisms within a population. Using field experiments, we tested the hypothesis that four visually discrete morphs (orange, yellow, yellow with a central orange patch (orange- yellow) and grey) of the tawny dragon lizard, Ctenophorus decresii, display alternative behavioural strategies. Specifically, we compared the response of colour morphs to simulated conspecific territorial intruders and predators in the wild. Although the orange-yellow morph can be objectively classified, it may behaviourally resemble the orange or yellow morph; therefore we compared statistical models in which the orange-yellow morph was considered a separate morph (four-morph model) or grouped with either pure orange or pure yellow individuals (three-morph models). For aggression, a three-morph model with orange-yellow individuals grouped as yellow morphs best fitted the data. The orange morph showed consistently high aggression to all morphs, while the grey morph showed consistently low aggression. Aggression of the yellow morph was conditional on the morph of the intruder. In addition to being the least aggressive, the grey morph was the least bold. Although the orange morph was the most aggressive, it was only the boldest under a three-morph model, which was equally likely compared to a four-morph model. Overall our results support the view that tawny dragon lizard morphs adopt different behavioural strategies, the orange and grey morphs exhibiting more aggressive and cautious strategies, respectively, and the yellow morph changing its aggression depending on its competitor's colour.

AB As a textbook example of a sexually selected trait, song in male birds has been extensively examined in the context of female mate choice and male-male competition for access to mates. Female song is also phylogenetically widespread, and probably ancestral. However, we know relatively little about when and why females sing. Female song may be important for female-male communication, e.g. fertility advertisement, mate attraction or coordinating the care of young. Alternatively, female song may function in the context of female-female competition for reproductive resources, e.g. nest sites, year-round territories or parental assistance. We quantified spontaneous song, and song in response to playback of an unfamiliar female song, in female and male superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus, across breeding stages. We found that females and males sang with roughly equal frequency spontaneously; however, females sang much more frequently than males in response to playback of unfamiliar female song. We found no difference in song rates across breeding stage, and no effect of age or the presence of subordinates. In both sexes, song rates increased slightly across the breeding season. Female song rates were also repeatable across the season. Overall, the results suggest that although female song is likely to be a multipurpose trait, as in males, the primary function in superb fairy-wrens appears to be female-female competition.

AB When animals defend resources using territorial signals, they must distinguish between competitors and noncompetitors. Conspecific animals routinely compete for resources and regularly engage in aggressive signalling exchanges. Heterospecific animals may also compete for resources, and therefore animals may direct their aggression towards heterospecific as well as conspecific rivals. In both cases, animals should benefit by discriminating between nonthreatening individuals versus threatening conspecific and heterospecific competitors. Experience may play an important role in competitor discrimination; animals living in sympatry with heterospecific competitors may gain experience with heterospecific rivals, but animals living in allopatry will not. We investigated whether experience influences species discrimination between two congeneric Neotropical wrens (rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, and banded wrens, Thryophilus pleurostictus) that live in sympatry in some parts of their range and in allopatry in other parts of their range. We simulated the presence of male conspecific, congeneric and control intruders in the territories of rufous-and-white wrens at sites where they are sympatric or allopatric with banded wrens. If species discrimination is influenced by experience, we predicted that wrens would always respond strongly to conspecific songs, but that in sympatry, they would respond more strongly to the congeneric competitor than to the control songs. Conversely, we predicted that, in allopatry, wrens would show similarly low responses to congener and control songs. In contrast to our predictions, we found that rufous-and-white wrens discriminated between conspecific and heterospecific animals, but that this response did not differ in sympatry or allopatry, suggesting that experience with heterospecific competitors does not influence interspecific discrimination in this species. By contrasting the responses of sympatric and allopatric populations, we can better understand the effect of experience on interspecific discrimination and gain insight into the evolution of species discrimination signals.

AB Petrels are highly philopatric and return from migratory journeys of thousands of kilometres to breed in the same burrow year after year. During the breeding season, some burrowing petrel species rely on their sense of smell to locate their nest at night, but the mechanisms involved in the homing behaviour after several months at sea are virtually unknown. To understand whether the sense of smell is involved in nest finding at the return from migration and to study the interplay with other positional cues, we explored the homing behaviour and nest choice by Mediterranean storm petrels, Hydrobates pelagicus melitensis. During two consecutive winters, we conducted our research in a colony with well-used artificial nestboxes that has been studied for the past two decades. We experimentally displaced previously occupied nestboxes in late winter and then checked for nest choice and occupancy by breeding individuals in the following breeding season. This experimental design allowed the manipulation of the location of the burrow, and the olfactory information contained within, without manipulating other positional cues. We observed that almost all individuals nested in the nestbox located at the same position as the year before, regardless of whether the nestbox was the one they had previously occupied or another one. During the breeding period, we also tested in a Y-maze the olfactory preference for the occupied nestbox with respect to another random one. Again, storm petrels did not show any olfactory preference for their nest. Our study implies that storm petrels breeding in a cave rely on other positional cues than olfactory ones to home and suggests a mechanism combining tactile and proprioceptive cues to find the nest in the dark.

AB Testosterone's (T) influence on male aggression has been well established in many vertebrate species, but the impact of T on female aggressive behaviour is poorly understood. Among birds, a link between T and female aggression is plausible, as females of many species exhibit a seasonal peak in T concentrations at the onset of breeding when social instability is greatest and they may have circulating T through much of the breeding season. However, investigations examining the relationship between T and female aggression are few and have yielded conflicting results, with experimentally or endogenously elevated T supporting aggressive behaviour in females of some species but not others, and T elevating with aggression at some points of the reproductive cycle but not others. We examined the relationship between endogenous levels of T and female aggression in the northern cardinal, Cardinalis cardinalis, a resident temperate species in which pairs exhibit prolonged territoriality and females have measurable levels of T year-round, including all stages of reproduction (incubation, nestling feeding, etc.). Using simulated nest intrusions, we assessed aggressive responses of incubating females to intrasexual 'intruders' at the nest and quantified T levels after each aggressive encounter. Displays of aggression towards 'intruders' varied among females; yet, individuals showing greater levels of aggression did not demonstrate higher levels of T. These results imply that T might not support maternal aggression in this species. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is well established that living in a social group provides animals with considerable antipredator benefits, including the ability to socially learn the identity of unknown predators by observing the actions of others. There has been considerable interest in understanding optimal group size, but surprisingly, little work has focused on understanding how different group composition (i.e. group size and tutor-to-observer ratio) influences the acquisition of information about predators. Here, we manipulated the composition of woodfrog, Lythobates sylvaticus, tadpole groups and found that the ratio of tutors to observers, but not group size, influenced the intensity of learned predator recognition. This finding is in line with theoretical models of the spread of information in social groups but contrasts with some empirical work on information transfer in fish shoals. We suggest that such a discrepancy could arise from the degree to which different animals rely on coordinated group evasion behaviour to avoid capture.

AB Kin discrimination mechanisms are expected to evolve when they provide fitness benefits. To date, evidence for kin discrimination is mixed across taxa and mating systems even when it would apparently be beneficial. In animals with promiscuous mating systems, males were long believed to abstain from parenting behaviours partly because the costs of offspring misidentification outweighed the benefits of dual parenting. Conversely, males in monogamous systems could parent because of high paternity certainty. However, recent work has shown that in some species males parent despite high false paternity rates, and males in some promiscuous systems discriminate between their own and other males' offspring. Here we evaluate the impact of male dominance rank, paternity and age on male-immature relationships in wild mountain gorillas. Mountain gorillas provide an interesting context for assessing paternal kin discrimination because (1) male-immature relationships are strong, and (2) while their morphological characteristics suggest an evolutionary history of single-male groups, a substantial fraction contain multiple adult males. In our sample of 21 males and 49 genotyped immatures living in multimale groups monitored by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research Center, we found that male rank was the primary predictor of male-immature relationship strength. There was little evidence that paternity or age were related to relationship patterns. Male-immature dyads were closer social partners in 2011-12 when groups were smaller and reproductive skew lower, than comparable dyads in 2003-04 when groups were larger and skew higher. Gorillas' lack of paternal kin discrimination provides further behavioural evidence that the species' multimale social structure is evolutionarily novel. However, patterning of male-immature relationships and genetic paternity suggest a persistent minority of two-male groups throughout G. beringei's evolutionary history. This may help explain their ability to live in multimale, multifemale social units despite possessing morphological characteristics typical of harem systems.

AB In natural populations, genetic variation in seasonal male sexual behaviour could affect behavioural ecology and evolution. In a wild-source population of white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, from Virginia, U.S.A., males experiencing short photoperiod show high levels of genetic variation in reproductive organ mass and neuroendocrine traits related to fertility. We tested whether males from two divergent selection lines, one that strongly suppresses fertility under short photoperiod (responder) and one that weakly suppresses fertility under short photoperiod (nonresponder), also differ in photoperiod-dependent sexual behaviour and responses to female olfactory cues. Under short, but not long, photoperiod, there were significant differences between responder and nonresponder males in sexual behaviour and likelihood of inseminating a female. Males that were severely oligospermic or azoospermic under short photoperiod failed to display sexual behaviour in response to an ovariectomized and hormonally primed receptive female. However, on the day following testing, females were positive for spermatozoa only when paired with a male having a sperm count in the normal range for males under long photoperiod. Males from the nonresponder line showed accelerated reproductive development under short photoperiod in response to urine-soiled bedding from females, but males from the responder line did not. The results indicate genetic variation in sexual behaviour that is expressed under short, but not long, photoperiod, and indicate a potential link between heritable neuroendocrine variation and male sexual behaviour. In winter in a natural population, this heritable behavioural variation could affect fitness, seasonal life history trade-offs and population growth.

AB Human adults and children respond negatively to inequity, even sacrificing personal gain to avoid both disadvantageous (more for you, less for me) and advantageous (more for me, less for you) resource allocations. Recent work has argued that some nonhuman animals share this response, but findings for inequity aversion outside of humans are controversial. Unfortunately, animals' negative responses to inequity are difficult to interpret because animal inequity aversion tasks differ in critical ways from the tasks used to test human inequity aversion. Here we present evidence from a novel task testing disadvantageous and advantageous inequity aversion in capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella. Our task was designed to closely mirror inequity aversion studies of human adults and children. We found no evidence for either disadvantageous or advantageous inequity aversion. Instead, capuchins' decisions were guided solely by the food resource that they were offered. Moreover, subjects' decisions and reaction times did not vary across social and nonsocial conditions. Our findings suggest that capuchin monkeys do not exhibit a human-like response to inequity on tasks in which even young children are known to demonstrate inequity aversion. We discuss these results in the context of existing theories for the evolution of fairness. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An ethological approach to attention predicts that organisms orient preferentially to valuable sources of information in the environment. For many gregarious species, orienting to other individuals provides valuable social information but competes with food acquisition, water consumption and predator avoidance. Individual variation in vigilance behaviour in humans spans a continuum from inattentive to pathological levels of interest in others. To assess the comparative biology of this behavioural variation, we probed vigilance rates in free-ranging macaques during water drinking, a behaviour incompatible with the gaze and postural demands of vigilance. Males were significantly more vigilant than females. Moreover, vigilance showed a clear genetic component, with an estimated heritability of 12%. Monkeys carrying a relatively infrequent 'long' allele of TPH2, a regulatory gene that influences serotonin production in the brain, were significantly less vigilant compared to monkeys that did not carry the allele. These findings resonate with the hypothesis that the serotonin pathway regulates vigilance in primates and by extension provoke the idea that individual variation in vigilance and its underlying biology may be adaptive rather than pathological.

AB In many animal taxa, coloration is a visual signal used for communication among conspecifics, for example between age classes. Juvenile coloration has been hypothesized to reduce aggression from adults in some species, in what is called the aggression avoidance hypothesis. Spiny-footed lizards are good subjects for testing this hypothesis, as juveniles develop conspicuous red coloration on their hind limbs and tails that fades in adulthood. To test the influence of juvenile coloration on adult aggressiveness, we conducted videotaped encounters in captivity between adults of both sexes and juveniles with their natural red coloration, or experimentally painted either red or white on their natural red parts. Then we recorded the number of times juveniles were bitten and attacked. In unpainted juveniles, no significant relationship was found between juvenile coloration (brightness, red chroma or hue) and adult aggressiveness. However, juveniles painted red were bitten less than those painted white when number of times bitten was controlled for number of times attacked. This result supports the aggression avoidance hypothesis, as an escalation from low-intensity (attacking) to high-intensity aggression (biting) was less probable towards red juveniles. The presence of red coloration in juveniles caused the reduction in adult aggression, while small natural variations in this red colour did not seem to have any further effect. Juvenile red coloration in this species might indicate age or sexual immaturity to adults. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Body coloration has been known to play an important role in animal visual communication. Attraction of prey by visual signals, such as bright body coloration, has been mainly observed in diurnal predators. For nocturnal cursorial predators, however, this foraging tactic has been largely ignored, because one would not expect it to occur under low ambient illumination at night and because of the technical constraints of conducting research in dim light conditions. Metabolic constraints prevent most cursorial spiders moving continuously for a long time to improve prey encounter rate. Any adaptation that induces prey to orient towards these cursorial predators would greatly enhance their foraging success. Bright body coloration of certain nocturnal invertebrates may play such a role. In this study, we investigated colour-mediated prey attraction in a nocturnal cursorial predator, the brown huntsman spider, Heteropoda venatoria, which has a conspicuous moustache-like white stripe on the forehead. We conducted field experiments using dummy and real spiders and monitored with infrared video cameras the responses of nocturnal prey to treatment groups with the white stripe intact or removed. The results showed that in both dummy and real spiders the presence of the white stripe can significantly increase prey attraction rate. Nocturnal flying insects such as moths comprised the majority of attracted prey. We conclude that cursorial invertebrate predators can visually lure prey, especially flying insects such as moths, by their conspicuous body coloration at night.

Theoretical models predict that territoriality will be selected when resources of intermediate abundance are distributed variably and predictably in time and space, but can be selected against if the resource-holding potential of individuals is low or the risk of predation is high. Here we used a model averaging approach in a mixed modelling framework to analyse 5 years of observational and experimental data collected on group responses to actual and perceived intruders in the cooperatively breeding chestnut-crowned babbler, Pomatostomus ruficeps, in order to provide a rare test of the relative importance of resource value, resource-holding potential and predation risk in territorial behaviour. We found that babblers were highly plastic in their responses to actual and simulated intruders: on average, approaches occurred on 55% of occasions, and aggression ensued in 55% of approaches (observational and experimental results combined). Whether or not babbler groups approached, and if so were aggressive towards, actual or simulated intrusions was explained by time of day, location, group sizes, predator encounter rate and habitat characteristics, but not by reproductive status. Consideration of each of these effects regarding the three hypotheses above suggested comparable roles of group competitive advantage and predation risk on approach probability, whereas ensuing aggression was mostly explained by correlates of resource value. Our study provides compelling evidence to suggest that the risk of predation can affect the incidence of territorial and agonistic behaviour between social groups of animals by moderating the effects of resource value and group competitiveness, and might partly explain the high plasticity in group responses to intrusions.

AB The drivers of social affiliation may vary over time as individuals change their goals with respect to changing environments or physical condition. Studies of companion preference rarely consider shifts in motivational state, despite the potential importance of such shifts in structuring association and population processes. Ignoring state dependence in social behaviour may weaken the ability to recognize social properties and identify their underlying drivers. Modifying established approaches, we apply a state-specific analysis to investigate social properties in male African elephants, which are thought to be weakly social. Specifically, we delineate associations during distinct sexually active and inactive periods and quantify common social metrics (network size, density, betweenness and the number and age of preferred companions) to examine how sexual states may relate to male elephant social relationships. We found that state-dependent association index values were higher and quantitative definitions of preferred companions were more conservative than those derived when sexual state was not taken into account. Preferred companions tended to be closer in age among sexually inactive dyads relative to sexually active dyads, indicating that bulls seek out age-mates when sexually inactive. Networks were larger and denser when sexually inactive. By accounting for dynamic behaviour in social systems, this study demonstrates that male African elephants show more social preference than had been previously thought.

AB The honeybees' (genus Apis) waggle dance is the only known example of a symbolic language in a nonprimate species. Through a complex series of stereotyped movements, a bee returning from a foraging trip can indicate to her nestmates the direction, distance and quality of a nectar, pollen or nest resource she has located. The 'waggle' component of the dance (indicating directional information) contains an inherent error and this error becomes smaller the further the site danced for. The imprecision in the dance effectively spreads dance followers over a patch that remains relatively constant with increasing distance to a resource. This error has been proposed to be a colony-level adaptation and to confer an advantage in the context of foraging. An alternative explanation for the error in the bees' dance is that the bees simply cannot be more precise due to constraints inherent to the dance. Here we analyse all studies to date that have investigated the bees' dance error. We conclude that the error in the honeybee waggle dance is nonadaptive and that the bees dance as best they can.

AB Wormlion larvae (Diptera: Vermileonidae) construct conical pits in fine loose soils and ambush arthropod prey. Their hunting strategy resembles that of pit-building antlions (Neuroptera: Myrme-leontidae), offering a classical example of convergent evolution, as they belong to different orders of insects. However, compared with other trap-building predators, spiders and antlions, the foraging behaviour of wormlions is almost unknown. In this study we used a combination of field observations and laboratory experiments to close this gap and investigate how hunger and ecological factors such as density and spatial pattern affect pit size, that is, how they shape investment in foraging and indicate competition between neighbouring larvae. We found slight, mainly decreasing, changes in pit size with hunger, with no change in response to prey. Surprisingly, body mass and length were not tightly correlated with pit size, unlike in antlions and spiders. Other factors, in addition to body mass and size, affect pit size, as the correlation between pits constructed in the field and in the laboratory was strong. The evidence for competition was mixed. On the one hand, we detected, in the laboratory, a change towards a regular spatial pattern with increasing pit densities, as expected, suggesting interference competition. On the other hand, we detected, in the field, a positive correlation between the sizes of neighbouring pits, and a negative correlation in the laboratory between pit size and distance to the nearest neighbour, both indicating clustering in favourable microhabitats, and not supporting strong competition. We discuss our findings in comparison with other trap-building predators and locate them within the general framework of foraging theory. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Consistent interindividual differences in behaviour, or animal personality, are emerging as an important determinant of a wide range of life history traits and fitness. Individual behaviour, however, may be constrained by between-individual variability in energy metabolism and may become unstable owing to intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. Here we tested the relationship between personality and physiology using wild-caught bank voles, Myodes glareolus, that varied according to mtDNA type (original or introgressed from Myodes rutilus). Personality traits and their within-individual consistency were assessed using an open field test and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was measured in an open-flow respirometer. A significant relationship was found between individuals' consistent (repeatable) personality trait (principal component analysis score reflecting individual differences in proactivity) and their consistent (repeatable) residual BMR (body mass corrected); however, this association depended on mtDNA type and sex. Particularly, the males with original mtDNA showed a positive relationship between proactive behaviour and BMR, which supports the increased-intake model, stating that BMR is positively related to the capacity to engage in costly behaviours. However, this relationship was disrupted in introgressed males, and showed a negative trend in females, suggesting the alternative compensation model. According to our findings, it is likely that consistent differences in behavioural patterns and mtDNA types promote variation between individuals in energy metabolism.

AB Group living involves major health risks, since it facilitates the spread of pathogens and parasites among members. To counteract this negative effect, social insects, such as ants, adopt several social defensive strategies, one of the most widespread being the collective disposal of corpses often outside the nest, which represent potential sources of infection. Corpses might even be used during interspecific conflicts to inhibit the activity of the attacked nest or they could be consumed as food. As intra- and interspecific relationships are manifold and often vary in terms of fitness consequences for the interacting species, it can be hypothesized that responses to corpses of different origin can vary. Scattered or piled up corpses of different ant species could act as cues for foragers, signalling the presence of other species, and triggering appropriate responses: alarm, retreat or foraging. We examined the reactions of the ant Formica cinerea under natural conditions to corpses of co-occurring Formica species. Formica cinerea responded differentially to corpses of different origin. Those of the territorial Formica polyctena and the slave-maker Formica sanguinea elicited more aggression and their corpses were removed sooner than other dead bodies. The majority of corpses were carried inside the nest, with the exception of Formica fusca corpses, which may signify the lack of specific interest in this species. The removal of nestmate and foreign conspecific corpses could be explained through social prophylaxis, and that of superior competitors additionally by conflict avoidance and/or by food supplementation. Based on our results, for ants corpses are not meaningless objects scattered around ant nests, but cues that carry information that trigger different behavioural reactions.

AB The theory of prudent sperm allocation predicts that males should reduce their investment in sperm transfer when their mate's propensity to produce offspring is low. Furthermore, if mating is costly for females, they would benefit from signalling this propensity to males to keep them from attempting to mate. Here we document a remarkable flexibility in insect mating tactic during the period of parental care. Extensive video observations in the biparental burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides revealed that pairs mate frequently before and during oviposition, temporarily discontinue their sexual activity while young larvae are present, and resume mating when males are close to leaving the brood. An experiment, in which we switched males at different time intervals and determined their P-2 value (i.e. the proportion of progeny sired by the second male), confirmed the lack of mating activity during the first few days of larval care and its resumption later in parental care. Females cease laying eggs when caring for larvae, but females will resume egg laying if none of the larvae from their first clutch reach the carcass. We manipulated females into producing such replacement clutches by withholding their larvae, and we found that in this situation males did not cease to mate, but continued to engage in frequent copulations. Hence, males have the ability to assess a female's propensity for oviposition during the period of parental care. Further experiments demonstrated that males do not use the presence or absence of larvae as a cue to adjust copulation rate, but instead use female-produced cues of reproductive state. Therefore, our study reveals that female beetles express cues that display their reproductive condition and males have evolved the ability to detect these cues and respond with prudent sperm allocation. Our findings further contribute to the developing picture of the sophisticated mating tactics that insects employ. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although reptiles have traditionally been viewed as asocial, the recent discovery of complex social systems in lizards suggests that an animal's social behaviour may be shaped by its interactions with conspecifics early in life, as occurs in endothermic vertebrates. We reared hatchling veiled chameleons, Chamaeleo calyptratus, either in isolation or in groups of four, using a split-clutch design. Social interactions during the first 2 months of life substantially affected a chameleon's subsequent responses to newly encountered conspecifics in standardized trials: animals reared in isolation were more submissive, and adopted darker and duller colours. Isolation-reared lizards also performed less well in a foraging task. Thus, social isolation early in life can impair the development of squamate reptiles, as it does in mammals and birds.

AB Nestmate discrimination plays an important role in preserving the integrity of social insect colonies. It is known to occur in the primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata in which non-nestmate conspecifics are not allowed to come near a nest. However, newly eclosed females are accepted in foreign colonies, suggesting that such individuals may not express the cues that permit differentiation between nestmates and non-nestmates. As cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) have been implicated as chemosensory cues used in nestmate recognition in other species, we investigated, using bioassays and chemical analyses, whether CHCs can play a role in nestmate recognition in R. marginata. We found that individuals can be differentiated according to colony membership using their CHC profiles, suggesting a role of CHCs in nestmate discrimination. Non-nestmate CHCs of adult females received more aggression than nestmate CHCs, thereby showing that CHCs are used as cues for nestmate recognition. Contrarily, and as expected, CHCs of newly eclosed females were not discriminated against when presented to a foreign colony. Behavioural sequence analysis revealed the behavioural mechanism involved in sensing nestmate recognition cues. We also found that newly eclosed females had a different CHC profile from that of adult females, thereby providing an explanation for why young females are accepted in foreign colonies.

ID GREEN TREEFROG; CHOICE; RECOGNITION
AB Females commonly exhibit mating preferences when they are allowed to choose between two alternative courtship signals. However, they also commonly approach any courtship signal when presented on its own (no-choice experiments). This could have consequences for male and female fitness. Males with nonpreferred stimuli may successfully attract females if they are, fortuitously, far enough away from competing males to prevent direct comparison. In the banana fiddler crab, Uca mjoebergi, we show, using a combination of no-choice and two-choice experiments, that there was interplay between detectability and preference. We found that preferred stimuli were not more detectable at a distance. Females were more likely to exhibit a preference when they could directly compare two stimuli that were close together and viewed in the same field of vision. Once the decision to approach one male over another had been made, it was not changed, even when more information became available. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Collective animal movements produce spectacular natural phenomena that arise from simple local interactions among group members. Flocks of homing pigeons, Columba livia, provide a useful model for the study of collective motion and decision making. During homing flights, flock members are forced to resolve potentially divergent navigational preferences in order to stay together and benefit from flying in a group. Recent work has demonstrated that some individuals consistently contribute more to the movement decisions of the flock than others do, thereby generating stable hierarchical leader-follower networks. Yet, what attributes of a flying pigeon reliably predict leadership remains an open question. We examined the flexibility of an individual's hierarchical leadership rank (i.e. its ordinal position when flock members are ranked according to the average time differences with which they lead or follow others) as a function of changes in its navigational knowledge. We manipulated already established hierarchical networks in three different flocks, by providing certain individuals with additional homing experience. We found that such training did not consistenly lead to an increase in birds' leadership ranks, and that, in general, the nature of leader-follower interactions between trained and untrained birds remained unaffected. Thus, leadership hierarchies in pigeon flocks appear resistant to changes in the navigational knowledge of a subset of their members, at least when these changes are relatively small. We discuss the implications of our results in light of the potential benefits of structural stability in decision-making networks. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social groups balance flexibility and robustness in their collective response to environmental changes using feedback between behavioural processes that operate at different timescales. Here we examine how behavioural processes operating at two timescales regulate the foraging activity of colonies of the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, allowing them to balance their response to food availability and predation. Previous work showed that the rate at which foragers return to the nest with food influences the rate at which foragers leave the nest. To investigate how interactions inside the nest link the rates of returning and outgoing foragers, we observed outgoing foragers inside the nest in field colonies using a novel observation method. We found that the interaction rate experienced by outgoing foragers inside the nest corresponded to forager return rate, and that the interactions of outgoing foragers were spatially clustered. Activation of a forager occurred on the timescale of seconds: a forager left the nest 3-8 s after a substantial increase in interactions with returning foragers. The availability of outgoing foragers to become activated was adjusted on the timescale of minutes: when forager return was interrupted for more than 4-5 min, available foragers waiting near the nest entrance went deeper into the nest. Thus, forager activation and forager availability both increased with the rate at which foragers returned to the nest. This process was checked by negative feedback between forager activation and forager availability. Regulation of foraging activation on the timescale of seconds provides flexibility in response to fluctuations in food abundance, whereas regulation of forager availability on the timescale of minutes provides robustness in response to sustained disturbance such as predation.

AB Courtship interactions often take place within the setting of a communication network, with signals sent from senders to target receivers also being detectable to third-party eavesdroppers. Potentially, eavesdropping males may be able to use signals produced by courting males to locate females indirectly. Furthermore, where male courtship vigour varies according to the quality of females (e. g. fecundity, receptivity or number), eavesdroppers observing multiple courting males may be able to use differences in courtship vigour to gauge indirectly the relative quality of the females. We tested these predictions in an experiment in which observer male guppies were presented with a binary choice between two demonstrator males courting differently sized groups of females, which were hidden from the observer. We found that the demonstrator males courted larger groups of females at a higher rate, and that observer males tested in the presence of the demonstrators spent more time and performed more courtship displays in the location of the demonstrator courting the larger group of females. Observers tested after the demonstrator males had been removed, however, showed no preference for either of the demonstrated locations and for the most part performed no courtship displays at all. Our results provide evidence for male-male local enhancement, but not delayed local enhancement, via demonstrator male courtship behaviour. Such behaviour may be adaptive, allowing eavesdropping observer males to locate females indirectly. We discuss how this system could be employed to explore social transmission of information further.

AB Reuse of open cup nests is rare among passerine birds despite possible savings of time and/or energy that might yield reproductive advantages. Anecdotal observations of the open-cup-nesting eastern kingbird, Tyrannus tyrannus, at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (MNWR), OR, U.S.A., showed that 10% of females reuse old nests of mainly American robins, Turdus migratorius. We therefore deployed artificial nests in 2010 and 2011 at MNWR to provide female kingbirds with the opportunity to reuse nests to test predictions of the time/energy saving hypothesis. We also used a flood that submerged nest sites in 2011 as a natural experiment to test the nest site shortage hypothesis' prediction that nest reuse by kingbirds should increase when the availability of nest sites is reduced. Female kingbirds used artificial nests heavily in both years, and, contrary to the time/energy saving hypothesis, they did so more in the year of earlier breeding. We also rejected three other predictions of the time/energy saving hypothesis, namely that, within seasons, females nesting in artificial nests (1) breed earlier, (2) produce larger clutches and eggs and (3) fledge more young. The only prediction of the time/energy saving hypothesis that we failed to reject was that time to lay replacement clutches following nest failure tended to be earlier in females that used artificial nests. Nest reuse was significantly more frequent in the flood year. Given this result, and our rejection of most predictions of the time/energy saving hypothesis, we conclude that frequent nest reuse by kingbirds at MNWR is likely the result of a shortage of quality nest sites.

AB Socially foraging animals can search for resources themselves (produce) or exploit the discoveries made by others (scrounge). The extensive literature on producer-scrounger dynamics has mainly focused on scramble competition over readily accessible resources, thereby largely neglecting the variety of scrounging techniques individuals may use as well as the role of investment in food handling. Furthermore, although individual differences in boldness and social factors such as dominance have been described to influence foraging tactics, their potential interplay and effect in foraging contexts beyond the conventional producer-scrounger game remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between social-foraging tactic use and dominance, pair bonds and boldness in a foraging experiment focused on food handling and alternative scrounging tactics. We conducted a producer-scrounger experiment in a captive group of rooks in which individuals could produce by pulling up baited strings, or scrounge by retrieving fallen food items or joining a producer. There were three key findings: (1) dominant rooks adopted the producer tactic more often and more successfully than subordinates; (2) producing and scrounging by tolerance led to mixed benefits to paired birds; (3) bold birds scrounged by retrieving more often than shy birds. Importantly, individuals were highly consistent in their tactic use across conditions differing in food availability. Our study highlights the importance of taking both social factors and boldness (heterogeneity) into account when studying social-foraging dynamics and offers empirical data on food handling and alternative scrounging tactics that can be used to extend current models and experiments on social foraging.

AB The males of many Bactrocera species (Diptera: Tephritidae) respond strongly and positively to a small number of plant-derived chemicals (= male lures). Males that have imbibed the lures commonly have a mating advantage over unfed males, but no female benefits have been demonstrated for females mating with lure-fed males. It has been hypothesized that the strong lure response is a case of runaway selection, where males receive direct benefits and females receive indirect benefits via 'sexy sons', or a case of sensory bias where females have a lower threshold response to lures. To test these hypotheses we studied the effects of lure feeding on male mating, remating and longevity; while for females that had mated with lure-fed males we recorded mating refractoriness, fecundity, egg viability and longevity. We used Bactrocera tryoni as our test animal and as lures the naturally occurring zingerone and chemically related, but synthetic chemical cuelure. Feeding on lures provided direct male benefits in greater mating success and increased multiple mating. For the first time, we recorded direct female effects: increased fecundity and reduced remating receptivity. Egg viability did not differ in females mated with lure-fed or unfed males. The life span of males and females exposed to lures was reduced. These results reveal direct, current-generation fitness benefits for both males and females, although the male benefits appear greater. We discuss that while lure response is indeed likely to be a sexual selection trait, there is no need to invoke runaway selection to explain its evolution.

AB Polygyny typically has negative fitness consequences for secondary females, but may equally impose costs on primary females or even on polygynous males. We investigated how polygynous and monogamous great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, males assist their mates with aggressive nest defence against the common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, and whether the females adjust their nest defence intensity according to male investment in aggression. Additionally, we investigated whether host social mating status affects host vulnerability to parasitism. We presented taxidermic cuckoo mounts at nests of primary, secondary and monogamous females, and recorded aggressive responses of nest owners. We found that monogamous males defended their nests most aggressively while polygynous males allocated their nest protection effort unevenly between their two mates, responding more vigorously on the primary than secondary nests. In contrast, nest defence intensity of females did not differ with respect to their social status, indicating that females of polygynous males did not compensate for low levels of male aggression. Similarly, we found no differences in natural cuckoo parasitism rates between monogamous, primary and secondary nests. Our results thus suggest that while monogamous females receive more assistance with nest defence than females of polygynous males, this has no effect on the probability of parasitism.

AB We summarize 18 common misgivings that animal behaviourists raise about becoming involved in conservation. We argue that many of the supposed institutional and interdisciplinary differences break down under scrutiny; that the supposed basic-applied dichotomy is often imaginary or insufficient to prevent interchange of ideas between behaviour and conservation; and that arguments about professional lifestyle, scientific inflexibility and despair are not adequate justifications for remaining on the sidelines. We suggest that many studies of animal behaviour are relevant to solving conservation problems, and we therefore encourage behaviourists to contribute more strongly to finding practical solutions to the contemporary conservation crisis.

AB The nature of individual social interactions can have a profound influence on group structure and function. Here, we use social network analysis to examine patterns of dominance interactions and spatial associations in 14 captive social groups of the cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. In this cichlid, social groups are composed of a dominant breeding pair and 1-20 nonbreeding subordinate helpers that form size-based queues for breeding positions. In the current study, we performed the first quantitative analysis of N. pulcher dominance hierarchies. We found that dominance hierarchies of N. pulcher were highly linear and that interactions within dyads were directionally consistent. We also found that dominance interactions were not equally distributed across the network, but instead occurred most frequently at the top of the social hierarchy. Contrary to our predictions, neither body size asymmetry nor sex predicted the observed dominance interactions and patterns of associations. However, breeders were more connected than helpers within the networks, perhaps due to their policing role. This study is one of a small handful to conduct network analysis on replicate social groups, and thus is one of few studies able to make general conclusions on the social structure of its focal species. The patterns uncovered suggest that conflict over breeding position inheritance has a strong impact on relationships among group members in N. pulcher.

AB Specificity in biological signalling systems is often important to keep information private. Foragers of several species of stingless bees deposit chemical marking signals to guide nestmates to food sources. The markings show species-and colony-specific compositions and primarily attract a bee's nestmates. An interesting question is whether the bees innately recognize specific trail markings or learn their particular composition from nestmates. To investigate this question, we tested whether Scaptotrigona pectoralis and Scaptotrigona subobscuripennis workers taken from their mother colonies and workers that emerged from combs transferred to foster colonies of the congeneric species are attracted to the marking compounds of workers from their natal colony or from the foster colony. A significant majority of workers were attracted to extracts prepared from foragers of the nest they inhabited, regardless of whether this was the original mother or the congeneric foster colony. Thus, the preference of stingless bee workers for specific food-marking scent mixtures is not innate, but is influenced by the odour they experience within their colony. Despite marked differences in the chemical composition of the scent marks in labial gland secretions of the two investigated species they also shared some main components. We hypothesize that recruitment trail information in stingless bees is composed of one or a few key pheromone compounds acting in conjunction with an additional signature mixture that is species and colony specific and must be learnt by recruited workers.

AB In mutual intraguild predation (IGP), the role of individual guild members is strongly context dependent and, during ontogeny, can shift from an intraguild (IG) prey to a food competitor or to an IG predator. Consequently, recognition of an offspring's predator is more complex for IG than classic prey females. Thus, IG prey females should be able to modulate their oviposition decisions by integrating multiple IG predator cues and by experience. Using a guild of plant-inhabiting predatory mites sharing the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as prey and passing through ontogenetic role shifts in mutual IGP, we assessed the effects of single and combined direct cues of the IG predator Amblyseius andersoni (eggs and traces left by a female on the substrate) on prey patch selection and oviposition behaviour of naive and IG predator-experienced IG prey females of Phytoseiulus persimilis. The IG prey females preferentially resided in patches without predator cues when the alternative patch contained traces of predator females or the cue combination. Preferential egg placement in patches without predator cues was only apparent in the choice situation with the cue combination. Experience increased the responsiveness of females exposed to the IG predator cue combination, indicated by immediate selection of the prey patch without predator cues and almost perfect oviposition avoidance in patches with the cue combination. We argue that the evolution of the ability of IG prey females to evaluate offspring's IGP risk accurately is driven by the irreversibility of oviposition and the functionally complex relationships between predator guild members.

AB All organisms must contend with the risk of injury or death; many animals reduce this danger by assessing environmental cues to avoid areas of elevated risk. However, little is known about how organisms respond to one of the most salient visual cues of risk: a dead conspecific. Here we show that the sight of a dead conspecific is sufficient to induce alarm calling and subsequent risk-reducing behavioural modification in western scrub-jays, Aphelocoma californica, and is similar to the response to a predator (a great horned owl, Bubo virginianus, model). Discovery of a dead conspecific elicits vocalizations that are effective at attracting conspecifics, which then also vocalize, thereby resulting in a cacophonous aggregation. Presentations of prostrate dead conspecifics and predator mounts elicited aggregations and hundreds of long-range communication vocalizations, while novel objects did not. In contrast to presentations of prostrate dead conspecifics, presentations of a jay skin mounted in an upright, life-like pose elicited aggressive responses, suggesting the mounted scrub-jay was perceived to be alive and the prostrate jay was not. There was a decrease of foraging in the area during presentations of prostrate dead conspecifics and predator mounts, which was still detectable 24 h later. Foraging returned to baseline levels 48 h after presentations. Novel objects and mounted jays did not affect foraging. Our results show that without witnessing the struggle and manner of death, the sight of a dead conspecific is used as public information and that this information is actively shared with conspecifics and used to reduce exposure to risk.

AB Many aposematic species combine their bright colours with a black pattern that produces internal contrasts. Studies have shown that birds often pay attention to some parts of a signalling pattern and disregard others, which could be of importance in Batesian mimicry, where a palatable species copies the visual appearance of a distasteful model in order to deceive predators. We used domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, and artificial prey signals to investigate whether predators use different warning colour components for discrimination depending on the degree of information about prey quality they convey. This study supports earlier findings of the importance of colour for discrimination among prey but also provides evidence that other less associable signal properties such as internal patterning, when holding valuable discriminatory information, can be used to assess prey quality in a hierarchical manner. The results also suggest that, in certain circumstances, the presence of a palatable mimic can have positive effects on learning, resulting in 'super-Mullerian' effects. We propose that the degree of selection for perfect mimicry may be dependent on the proportion of well-educated predators in the population.

AB Locusts exhibit a behavioural syndrome known as 'behavioural phase polyphenism', in which a number of behavioural traits change markedly in response to local population density. 'Solitarious' phase individuals, which are typical of low-density populations, change within hours from being relatively sedentary and repelled by other locusts to congregating actively with conspecifics and becoming more active (the 'gregarious' phase). In wild populations, this behavioural plasticity can lead to the emergence of mass marching bands of nymphs and winged adult swarms. Much of our understanding of behavioural phase transition comes from laboratory experiments, which routinely employ an arena-based assay to measure a suite of behavioural variables encompassing aspects of activity, movement pattern and responses towards a stimulus group of other locusts. Individuals are then quantitatively phenotyped along a linear scale from solitarious to gregarious, by entering their returned measurements for several behavioural characters into a logistic regression model. Recently, automated video tracking has enabled multiple experimenters to use a single behavioural model, rather than each having to construct their own. Here, we have taken advantage of another powerful feature of automated tracking systems: the opportunity to use stored data to conduct a rigorous optimization process, which both ensures that the derived statistical model encapsulates the multidimensional nature of locust behavioural phase to best effect, and also provides a new understanding of the relationship between different behaviours.

AB In communally breeding animal societies, theory predicts that a male's investment in parental care should be correlated with his share of paternity in the mixed brood. Here I test this hypothesis in the greater ani, Crotophaga major, a Neotropical cuckoo that nests in groups composed of two to three unrelated, behaviourally monogamous pairs. Each group constructs a single nest in which all of the females lay eggs, and all group members participate in rearing the joint clutch. Previous work has shown that parental investment among males is unequal: just one male in the group performs all nocturnal incubation, and the same male also plays a greater role in diurnal incubation and nest defence. I used parentage and sibling analysis of 357 greater ani nestlings in 53 clutches to investigate genetic mating patterns and the distribution of reproduction within communal groups. Contrary to predictions, male reproductive skew was negligible and nocturnally incubating males did not sire significantly more nestlings than did non-nocturnal incubators. Approximately 75-80% of nestlings were produced by socially monogamous pairs, 12-18% by extrapair fertilizations within the same breeding group, and 3-5% by extrapair fertilizations outside the breeding group. There was no difference in the frequency of extrapair paternity between nocturnally incubating and non-nocturnally incubating males. Compared to other cooperative avian societies, the division of reproduction in greater ani breeding groups is unusually egalitarian, despite marked inequalities in male parental care.

AB The degree of resemblance between mimics and models provides valuable insight into the evolutionary dynamics of mimicry signalling systems, but for many systems mimetic resemblance has not been quantified. Superb lyrebirds have a reputation for accurately imitating an astonishing variety of sounds that they incorporate into their sexual displays. We assessed the accuracy with which males imitate the complex song of the grey shrike-thrush, Colluricincla harmonica. We measured vocal accuracy by (1) using playback experiments as a bioassay, to determine whether and how shrike-thrushes distinguish between their own song and imitations of shrike-thrush songs by lyrebirds and (2) comparing acoustic properties of mimicked and model songs. Shrike-thrushes reacted just as strongly towards mimetic song as to their own when songs were presented alone. When mimetic song was accompanied by lyrebird song sequences (emulating the lyrebird's natural singing style), shrike-thrushes still usually approached the speaker but less often than when mimetic song was presented alone or when model songs were broadcast. Acoustic analyses showed that imitations were remarkably similar to model songs. However, while lyrebirds maintained the structure and complexity of model songs, they sang fewer repetitions of individual element types. This 'abridging' of model songs is consistent with a trade-off between demonstrating both mimetic accuracy and versatility. Overall, these results indicate strong selection on male lyrebirds to imitate accurately the complex vocalizations of other species, and show that species can integrate contextual information with the signal structure to distinguish between their own signals and imitations.

AB Age-related phenotypic changes (maturation-senescence) commonly occur during an organism's lifetime. While maturation is usually considered as a measure of individual quality, senescence is associated with loss of function and physiological deterioration. To date, little is known about age-dependent expression of acoustic sexually selected traits over a lifetime. Using a free-living population of great tits, Parus major, we recorded the song of individually marked males in a standardized way during a 4-year period, in a longitudinal design. The study focused on two previously identified, acoustic, sexually selected signals: song consistency and repertoire size. Young (1-2 years old) and old (5-6 years old) individuals expressed lower song consistency than individuals at intermediate age (3-4 years old), suggesting song tuning during the first 3 years of life, and deterioration after the peak is reached. Repertoire size, in contrast, did not vary with age. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate song changes at advanced age and to report senescence effects on song expression in free-living songbirds. Our results suggest that, similarly to speech in humans, different aspects of birdsong are differentially affected by age: while motor performance traits (song consistency) deteriorate with age, language skills (repertoire size) may not be affected during the life span.

AB Mate relatedness can have an impact on fitness and inbreeding avoidance is a potential factor shaping mating behaviour. When females are unable to avoid mating with kin, they may exploit postcopulatory mechanisms as an alternative means to avoid inbreeding. If females increase their remating propensity after incestuous matings, they could reduce the likelihood of kin siring their offspring. We investigated the effects of male relatedness on the probabilities of female first mating and remating in the adzuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis. Females showed no precopulatory discrimination against brothers at their first or second mating. In contrast, females mated first with brothers were more willing to remate than females mated first with unrelated males. We found no evidence that males transfer fewer sperm when mating with sisters. This study suggests that C. chinensis does not avoid inbreeding before and during copulation. Instead, females that mated with related males adapted their subsequent mating behaviour to avoid the potential costs of inbreeding. Polyandry in this species may be the result of females attempting to prevent genetic incompatibility by remating after having mated to a relative.

AB Despite the spread of human-impacted wildlife habitats, few studies have examined how animals adapt their socioecology in agriculturaleforest ecotones. Anthropogenic processes such as agricultural development directly affect the ecological challenges that species face. In agriculturaleforest ecotones cultivated foods that are palatable, energy-rich, easily digestible, and that often occur as large, clumped and spatially abundant orchards or fields may offer foraging advantages over natural foods. However, crop raiding can be risky: harassment, injury or even death may arise from confrontations with people. The factors that affect grouping decisions and activity budgets within anthropogenic environments are unknown. Twelve months of focal data were collected from direct observations of one chimpanzee community inhabiting a forestefarm mosaic at Bossou, Guinea. Wild fruit abundance did not directly influence daily party size. Instead, cultivated resource consumption, in combination with other social factors, provided chimpanzees with an alternative to fissioning. Chimpanzee party size did not differ between crop raids and wild feeds, but party cohesiveness did increase during raids. Furthermore, males and females adapted their activity budgets in different ways to integrate cultivated resources into their broader ecological strategy. As species are increasingly forced into anthropogenically impacted habitats, models of fissionefusion dynamics and other socioecological adaptations need to take into account exploitation of cultivated, energy-rich crops.

AB Group size is a fundamental aspect of the adaptation of a social animal to its environment. There have thus been numerous attempts to infer optimal group sizes based on both empirical studies of specific taxa and theoretical models that aim to establish generalities. One such generality is that larger groups experience greater within-group foraging competition because of either direct interference by other group members or the rapid exploitation of resources. The ecological constraints hypothesis proposes that increases in group size will increase intragroup feeding competition, thus forcing individuals to visit more patches and to cover greater areas than they would in smaller groups. This paper provides a simple formal model of this constraint, suggesting that two types of constraint limit group sizes in this scenario. First, a constraint on time available to reach an energetic threshold may limit groups to sizes that allow each individual forager to attain that threshold. Second, the balance of foraging costs to benefits may curtail group size even in the absence of a temporal constraint. Both these constraints can be obviated by the adoption of fissionefusion social systems in which a group divides into subgroups during foraging. This latter finding is discussed in relation to primate social systems with an emphasis on time budget approaches. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Both personality and plasticity can influence fitness, but few studies have investigated these two sources of individual variation simultaneously for the same behaviour. The individual quality hypothesis proposes that individuals with high personality scores will also be better able to respond to the changes in the environment (i.e. have a high degree of plasticity). Alternatively, the 'compensatory' hypothesis proposes that personality and plasticity are negatively correlated, because only individuals with low personality scores need to be able to rapidly adjust to environmental conditions. To examine these two hypotheses, we investigated the overall level of aggressiveness (personality) in nest defence, the ability of individuals to adjust this behaviour to respond to changes in temperature (plasticity), and their consequences for reproductive success in male and female tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor. Using linear mixed effect models with individual as a random effect, we found that consistent differences between individuals explained approximately 55% of variation in aggressiveness and that more aggressive individuals were better able to adjust to variation in temperature, providing support for the individual quality hypothesis. However, although more aggressive males tended to fledge a higher number of young, the degree of plasticity only conferred a reproductive advantage for nonaggressive males, providing support for the compensatory hypothesis. For females, neither personality, nor plasticity was a good predictor of reproductive success. Our results suggest that personality and plasticity in aggressiveness are important components of individual variation but that the fitness advantages of each are context dependent.

AB In this study we explored relationships between the aggressiveness of male sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, and their position in a social network. We attached activity loggers to 60 neighbouring lizards during the activity season (September-December) in 2009 at a study site in the mid-north of South Australia. The loggers continuously recorded the activity and location of lizards, allowing us to infer direct social associations. We calculated pairwise associations and integrated these into a social network and calculated node-based measures that quantified male-male and male-female interactions. Aggressiveness of males was quantified in two ways; by involvement in a fight, as indicated by the presence of fresh scale damage, and by aggression assays that scored the response of lizards to conspecific and predator cues. More aggressive lizards in these assays were more likely to be found with fresh scale damage in field surveys. Less aggressive males were more strongly connected to females in the network, and were more commonly in contact with their monogamous female partner, than more aggressive males. Our results suggest a behavioural syndrome among male lizards connecting level of aggression and association with females, with a divergence in behaviour; lovers that are strongly paired and nonaggressive, and fighters that are weakly associated with females and more aggressive.

AB Efficient foragers avoid returning to food sources that they had previously depleted. Bombus terrestris bumblebees use a counting-like strategy to leave Alcea setosa flowers just after visiting all of their five nectaries. We tested whether a similar strategy is employed by solitary Eucera sp. bees that also forage on A. setosa. Analyses of 261 videorecorded flower visits showed that the bees probed five nectaries in 26% of visits, which was the most common case. However, this proportion did not differ significantly from that of six-nectary visits. Probe durations that preceded flower departures were generally shorter than those followed by an additional nectary visit in the same flower. Assuming that probe durations correlate with nectar volumes, this suggests that flower departure frequencies increased after probing of low-rewarding nectaries. The flowers' spatial attributes were not used as departure cues, but the bees may have left flowers in response to scent marks on previously visited nectaries in a small fraction (<14%) of visits. These findings suggest that a combination of a reward-based patch-leaving rule and scent marking contribute to Eucera's efficient foraging. While a counting-like strategy cannot be completely ruled out for Eucera, it seems less exact than in Bombus, and may be mediated by different cognitive processes. Thus, Eucera resemble bumblebees in avoiding most revisits to already visited nectaries, but probably use different foraging strategies to do so. This difference may reflect lower learning capabilities of solitary bee species compared to social ones. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Acquiring information via observation of others can be an efficient way to respond to changing situations or to learn skills, particularly for inexperienced individuals. Many bat species are gregarious, yet few studies have investigated their capacity for learning from conspecifics. We tested whether big brown bats can learn a novel foraging task by interacting with knowledgeable conspecifics. In experimental trials, 11 naive bats (7 juveniles, 4 adults) interacted freely with trained bats that were capturing tethered mealworms. In control trials, 11 naive bats (7 juveniles, 4 adults) flew with untrained bats. Naive bats were then assessed for their ability to capture tethered mealworms. While no bat in the control group learned the task, a significant number of experimental bats, including juveniles with little or no experience foraging, showed evidence of learning. Eighty-two per cent of experimental bats and 27% of control bats directed feeding buzzes (echolocation calls associated with prey capture) at the mealworm. Furthermore, seven experimental bats (64%) showed evidence of learning by attacking and/or capturing the mealworm, while no bat in the control group attacked or captured the prey. Analyses of high-speed stereo video recordings revealed increased interaction with demonstrators among bats attacking or capturing the mealworm. At the time they displayed evidence of learning, bats flew closer together during feeding buzzes than during other portions of trials. Our results demonstrate that social interaction with experienced bats, and listening to feeding buzzes in particular, may play an integral role in development of foraging skills in bats.

AB Recent studies of birds have found that the antiparasite behaviour of host species is modified by social learning. We tested whether individual or social learning modifies the nest defence of yellow warblers, Setophaga petechia, against the parasitic brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater. Using field experiments, we exposed warblers to simulated events of nest parasitism and predation, or allowed them to observe conspecifics mobbing a cowbird. Intensity of nest defence by yellow warblers was greater after simulated threats at their nest than after they had observed mobbing of cowbirds by conspecifics. Warblers defended their nests more aggressively when they perceived a cowbird as an egg predator rather than as a parasite. Higher predation than parasitism frequencies probably explain the more prompt change in defence when cowbirds were encountered as egg predators. Annual fluctuations in frequencies of both parasitism and predation suggest that defence acquired via observing conspecifics may contain outdated information and probably explains the warblers' reliance on individually learned over socially learned defence.

AB Risk-sensitive foraging theory is central to behavioural ecology. It relates individual fitness to variance in foraging success (risk) and predicts which foraging strategy maximizes fitness under applicable constraints. Fitness usually comprises survival and reproduction. Yet, most models of risk-sensitive foraging have focused on only one of these two factors. Consequently, such models cannot account for the interaction between resource availability and population size, i.e. density dependence.
   Here, we incorporate both mortality and reproduction as functions of an individual's risk-sensitive foraging strategy. In our model the individual strategy thus determines the mean availability of resources per capita and consequently the equilibrium population size. From a continuum of possible strategies we are able to pinpoint the exact risk-sensitive strategies that are favoured by natural selection in saturated habitats and demonstrate that, in addition to risk proneness and risk aversion, a number of optimal intermediate variances can be selected for.
   In contrast to predictions based on models that ignore the interaction between behaviour, population density and resource availability, our results show that high baseline mortality (e.g. predation risk) does not necessarily lead to risk proneness. In addition to this novel finding, our model confirms the crucial importance of resource-independent (baseline) mortality for optimal risk-sensitive behaviour.

AB There is increasing evidence to support hypotheses that suggest that mammalian females may have some influence over which sex of offspring they conceive. In the search for a mechanism by which this might occur, female testosterone has become a focus of interest. We investigated the relation between level of faecal testosterone in female Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, measured prior to conception, and the subsequent sex of the offspring. We found that macaques bearing male offspring had higher mean preconception testosterone levels than those bearing female offspring. High testosterone levels were also associated with high maternal dominance. Consistent with theories of sex allocation, testosterone has been shown to underpin dominance behaviour and is also likely to be related to good condition. In addition, female testosterone, unlike male testosterone, rises in response to chronic stress, thus providing a pathway whereby environmental stressors might influence sex allocation.

AB The act of mating may render individuals vulnerable by inhibiting mobility and defence. While the consequences of this vulnerability for predation risk are well known, the implications for male-male contests over mating have been largely ignored. We examined the influence of vulnerability during mating by assessing the effectiveness of asymmetries in resource-holding potential (RHP) and subjective resource value (female mating status) in determining access to females in a resident-intruder scenario. In the earwig Euborellia brunneri, mating males are vulnerable to attack because they cannot use their armaments, and may risk breakage of their extremely elongated intromittent organs. We expected agonistic outcomes and 'ownership' of females to be decided entirely according to imposed asymmetries, since defeat normally induces a strong loser effect and flight responses in losers. Using behavioural assays of dyads of males contesting one female we show that, although small differences in RHP strongly affected agonistic outcomes, dominant males could not monopolize females. Through recurrent harassment, subordinate males exploited the vulnerability of mating opponents to break up copulations and generate mating opportunities. Dominant males also employed this tactic and were more effective at it. While female mating status affected resident mating duration and investment in conflict, only asymmetry in RHP affected fighting and mating outcomes. Resource owners in E. brunneri hence experience a positional disadvantage specific to a mating context. This previously unrecognized phenomenon may provide a proximate explanation for the taxonomically widespread occurrence of attacks during copulation and the avoidance thereof.

AB Helpers in cooperatively breeding acorn woodpeckers, Melanerpes formicivorus, gain indirect fitness benefits by provisioning related offspring, but may also gain direct fitness benefits by any of several mechanisms. We tested the 'skills' hypothesis, which proposes that provisioning behaviour provides helpers with experience that allows them to be more successful when they breed later in life, and the 'pay-to-stay' hypothesis, which proposes that provisioning behaviour by helpers is rewarded by dominant breeders, allowing helpers to remain in their natal group longer, thus reaping nepotistic benefits. We found that young helpers provisioned at relatively low rates, which in most cases increased with age, a necessary requirement of the skills hypothesis. Analyses of birds with known feeding histories, however, revealed that helper males that fed young at higher rates had no greater reproductive success later in life than less helpful helper males, contrary to the skills hypothesis. In accord with pay-to-stay, males that fed more as second-year helpers remained in their natal group as helpers significantly longer and were more likely to inherit than were male broodmates that fed less. An analysis controlling for the time that birds remained in their natal groups, however, failed to indicate that prior feeding history played a significant role in these differences, which are more likely to be a consequence of differences in dispersal behaviour. In acorn woodpeckers, as in other species of cooperative breeders in which helpers are close relatives, the primary benefits of provisioning behaviour are indirect via kin selection rather than direct via either the acquisition of skills or payment of rent.

AB Human voice pitch is sexually dimorphic and therefore conveys important information about its owner's sex. Since people often associate voice pitch with age, body size, attractiveness and, in the case of men, level of dominance, it is assumed that voice pitch signals biological condition. We tested (1) how female voice pitch is related to perceptions of dominance and (2) whether female voice pitch correlates linearly with its attractiveness assessment. We recorded five vowels {A [a], E [epsilon], I [i], O [(sic)], U [u]} and measured the voice fundamental frequency (F0) of 58 young women. The following voices of four women were selected: low (184.6 Hz), medium (223.7 Hz), high (261.9 Hz) and very high (310.3 Hz). Each of these voices was lowered and raised by 20 Hz. The modified voices and the original voices were rated for attractiveness by men, and were rated for dominance by both men and women. We found that women with lower voices were perceived as more dominant and that this relationship was linear. An interaction between the sexes in the dominance assessment indicates that women are more sensitive than men to the dominance cues present in female voices. We also found that, contrary to other studies, the relationship between female voice pitch and its attractiveness is not linear. Higher pitched voices were assessed as more attractive up to an optimal pitch; female voices above ca. 280 Hz were rated as less attractive. We suggest that female voices that have too high a pitch sound babyish and are associated with sexual immaturity. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Theories of language evolution often draw heavily on comparative evidence of the communicative abilities of extant nonhuman primates (primates). Many theories have argued exclusively for a unimodal origin of language, usually gestural or vocal. Theories are often strengthened by research on primates that indicates the absence of certain linguistic precursors in the opposing communicative modality. However, a systematic review of the primate communication literature reveals that vocal, gestural and facial signals have attracted differing theoretical and methodological approaches, rendering cross-modal comparisons problematic. The validity of the theories based on such comparisons can therefore be questioned. We propose that these a priori biases, inherent in unimodal research, highlight the need for integrated multimodal research. By examining communicative signals in concert we can both avoid methodological discontinuities as well as better understand the phylogenetic precursors to human language as part of a multimodal system.

AB Although some group-living animals dynamically modify sexual signals in response to changes in social or reproductive status, this ability is often limited by constraints inherent in the mechanism of signal production. In birds, for example, inflexible moult schedules may restrict the ability to rapidly modify plumage-based signals. In such cases, more flexible secondary signals such as skin, eye, or bill coloration (e.g. soft parts) could potentially be used to achieve dynamic signalling. We addressed the degree to which free-living red-backed fairy-wrens, Malurus melanocephalus, can dynamically update both plumage and soft part signals when status suddenly changes, and how this may be achieved. In this cooperatively breeding passerine, dominant breeding males are distinguished from socially subordinate nonbreeding auxiliary males by the presence of nuptial plumage, dark bills and large sperm storage organs. Following an experimentally induced shift in status from auxiliary to breeder, males showed rapid increases in excreted androgen metabolites. Although they showed no overall change in nuptial plumage colour, several experimental males developed red nuptial feathers on the back following feather plucking, indicating that they had the capacity to develop bright nuptial plumage but were constrained from doing so by the moult schedule. In contrast, experimental males showed a rapid darkening of their bills, reflecting their newly acquired breeding status. These findings (1) provide experimental evidence that status affects physiologically controlled visual signals in free-living birds, (2) suggest that this linkage is mediated by testosterone and (3) illustrate how secondary ornaments may be used in dynamic signalling when the primary signalling modality is constrained.

AB Aerobic organisms naturally create reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products of energy production. These substances can damage DNA and tissue, and probably are major causes of mutation, ageing and a host of diseases. Oxidative stress occurs when an organism produces an overabundance of ROS relative to ROS-neutralizing antioxidants. In this study, we examined the hypotheses that individual differences in oxidative stress are associated with fluctuating asymmetry and with perceived mate quality. We measured urinary biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondialdehyde (MDA)) in a sample of healthy, young men and tested their association with fluctuating asymmetry and physical attractiveness. A composite measure of oxidative stress correlated positively with FA and negatively with physical attractiveness (with exposure to toxins, smoking, and their interaction statistically controlled for). Follow-up analyses yielded associations of oxidative stress with both healthy and masculine appearance. No association was mediated by cortisol or testosterone. These findings may yield insights into previously unidentified factors that affect the development of phenotypic features under sexual selection and contribute to the shape of human life histories, and have potential implications for other species as well.

AB Animal contests often involve the production of repeated signals, which are assumed to be energetically demanding to perform and advertise the performer's fighting ability through a demonstration of stamina. Although the costs of repeated signals have been investigated by the postfight analysis of metabolites, single physiological measures may not adequately reflect an individual's overall stamina. An alternative approach is to investigate whole-organism performance capacities. We examined the relationship between locomotor capacities and the vigour of repeated bouts of shell-rapping signals during fights over gastropod shells in the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. In these fights only attacking crabs perform shell rapping while defenders withdraw into their shell. Successful attackers and defenders had higher mean and maximum walking speeds than losers. Furthermore, maximum speed was a better correlate of fighting ability in defenders, whereas mean speed was better in attackers. This study demonstrates that whole-organism performance capacities correlate with success in agonistic encounters, and that different aspects of performance capacity appear to be important depending on the behaviours performed by different roles. Thus, this study supports the assumptions of theoretical models such as the cumulative assessment model and the energetic war of attrition, which predict that repeated signals advertise stamina and fighting ability, by demonstrating that mean rates of performance, a key component of stamina, are related to success in hermit crab shell fights.

AB Animals often use acoustic signals to assess the physical characteristics of conspecifics in reproductive contexts. Here, we manipulated two components of male giant panda bleats, the formant frequencies ( an acoustic cue to size) and the fundamental frequency, to examine male and female responses to bleats characterized by different combinations of these acoustic components. Our results revealed that male giant pandas had greater looking responses and tended to respond faster to bleats with higher formants simulating small adult males. In contrast, females had greater looking responses to bleats with lower formants simulating large adult males. In addition, there was no interaction between the value of the fundamental frequency and the observed response of male and female giant pandas to formant frequency variation in male bleats. Taken together these findings indicate that formants are functionally relevant to male and female giant pandas, and suggest that the level of the fundamental frequency in male bleats does not significantly affect how receivers perceive formant frequency variation. Furthermore, the sex differences in response direction are consistent with the notion that giant pandas could be using formants as cues to the caller's sex, through the correlation with body size, during the breeding season.

AB Conspecific brood parasitism (CBP) brings the obvious fitness advantage of decreased breeding costs. However, the successful development of parasitic eggs depends on appropriate timing in relation to the host's own eggs. A detailed documentation of CBP requires full knowledge of parentage. We achieved this in a captive population of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, breeding in aviaries. The overall frequency of CBP was relatively high (21% of all host clutches, 5.4% of all eggs in host clutches) and comparable to what has been found in the wild in this species. A large proportion of paired females adopted a mixed strategy, laying one or two additional eggs in other nests before initiating their own clutches. Females showed a high individual consistency in whether they adopted a pure nonparasitic strategy or a mixed strategy, which is indicative of individual specialization. About 38% of all eggs laid outside a pair's own nest were incubated by host pairs and can thus be considered successfully parasitic. No paired females were purely parasitic but unpaired females used CBP as a best of a bad job strategy. Hosts were targeted during the early phase of clutch initiation with the majority of parasitic eggs laid 0-5 days before the onset of incubation and usually before the host commenced egg laying. We did not find evidence that particular types of host females were targeted. The within-female repeatability of being a host was estimated to be negative. Overall, the systematic temporal patterns indicate targeted CBP behaviour in zebra finches. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social relationships are important in social species. These relationships, based on repeated interactions, define each partner's expectations during the following encounters. The creation of a relationship implies high social cognitive abilities which require that each partner is able to associate the positive or negative content of an interaction with a specific partner and to recall this association. In this study, we tested the effects of repeated interactions on the memory kept by 23 young horses about humans, after 6 and 8 months of separation. The association of a reward with a learning task in an interactional context induced positive reactions towards humans during training. It also increased contact and interest, not only just after training, but also several months later, despite no further interaction with humans. In addition, this 'positive memory' of humans extended to novel persons. Overall, positive reinforcement enhanced learning and memorization of the task itself. These findings suggest remarkable social cognitive abilities that can be transposed from intraspecific to interspecific social contexts. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many species, males use auditory signals to attract females and females select males based on their dominance status. Here we show that information on dominance status in male black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, a small, temperate, North American songbird, can be extracted from individual songs. We found that the relative amplitude of the two notes in the 'fee bee' song of this species was more consistent in dominant males. Furthermore, females responded differently to presentations of single song exemplars from males of different dominance status, with females vocalizing more and performing more motor behaviours during the presentation of dominant songs. Our study suggests that non-pitch-based cues within single vocalizations can both reliably indicate relative rank and be discriminated by females.

AB Wild chimpanzees can be dangerously violent against individuals that do not belong to their community, indicating a strong selection pressure on decision-making abilities in this context. The presence of a neighbouring male indicates a serious threat, although encountering an unfamiliar male is potentially even more dangerous because it indicates the arrival of a new group with whom the subjects have no previous history of interaction. We conducted playback experiments with members of three chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, communities in the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, in which we simulated the unexpected presence of another chimpanzee. We tested subjects' responses to pant hoots of familiar group members, neighbouring individuals and unfamiliar strangers. We found that neighbours and strangers elicited a wider range of gestural signals than familiar group members. Vocal responses were common in all conditions. Familiar group members mainly triggered pant hoot replies, whereas neighbour and stranger trials caused screams. Across conditions, males responded more strongly than females. Male party size had an effect on subjects' vocal responses to strangers but not to neighbours, although neighbours were approached more closely. Our results show that chimpanzees are able to identify different classes of individuals by their pant hoot vocalizations, as judged by their differential responses to the calls of familiar group members, neighbours or strangers. The overall response patterns suggest that chimpanzees are aware of the different social consequences associated with encountering a neighbouring group or a group of strangers.

AB Most advances in our understanding of predation risk involve foraging animals, yet animals also trade off predation risk with other essential activities. Drinking under the risk of predation may elicit similar prey behaviours to those in foraging animals, but has been little studied. Agile wallabies, Macropus agilis, manipulate their environment by excavating drinking holes just out of reach of predatory saltwater crocodiles. Paradoxically, however, some wallabies drink from the river's edge despite the immediate availability of the lower-risk drinking holes. We studied the behaviour of wallabies with multiple drinking options to test a series of predictions for animals drinking under the risk of predation. More wallabies drank during the day than at night, regardless of drinking site. However, night-drinking wallabies were much more likely to use the excavated holes than the 'riskier' river. This spatiotemporal dichotomy in perceived predation risk may reflect a mismatch in nocturnal sensory capabilities between predator and prey, and would provide sufficient motivation for wallabies to create low-risk drinking holes. Drinking duration, our surrogate for harvest, was not influenced by drinking site type ( hole versus river), drinking time or social context (solitary versus group), suggesting that some animals may not forego drinking during high-risk periods, as predicted and observed for some foraging animals. Compared to wallabies in groups, solitary wallabies were less likely to drink from the river, especially at night, and were more vigilant. Although evidence is limited, our research suggests that vigilance may be ineffective for nocturnally drinking wallabies in the face of this concealed, ambush predator.

AB Parents may vary their parental behaviour and investment in reproduction in response to parasiteinduced changes in the fitness prospects of their offspring. Thus, parents may use the physical condition of their offspring, or any other trait related to parasite load, to adjust parental effort. The immaculate eggs of the spotless starling, Sturnus unicolor, often become densely spotted owing to the activity of the ectoparasite carnid fly Carnus hemapterus. Spot density anticipates the intensity of fly infestation suffered by nestlings and, therefore, may serve as a cue for parents to adjust reproductive investment. By cleaning spots produced by C. hemapterus on eggs of spotless starlings, we manipulated the parasite's traces revealing its presence in broods of starlings, without modifying the level of infestation, to test whether parents use these signals to adjust reproductive effort. We found support for the hypothetical negative effect of Carnus flies since nestlings raised in nests with a higher fly load had lower body mass. The experimental egg cleaning during incubation did not change the intensity of carnid fly infestation during nestling development. However, it had a significant positive influence on paternal but not maternal effort. Our experimental results support the idea that spotless starling males adjust their effort in response to their perception of the fitness prospects of their nestlings as indirectly estimated by traces of parasites on the eggshells. As far as we know, this is the first evidence of the use of parasite traces to infer risk of parasitic infestation by animal hosts. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The honesty of communication in competitive situations has long been debated. We investigated the coexistence of a diverse set of strategies in a simple model of aggressive communication by means of individual-based computer simulations. The game is an extended Hawk-Dove game in which there are two types of individual, weak and strong, and in which individual can communicate by means of cost-free signals before deciding whether to attack. The available strategies can be classified into three categories: honest, cheaters and those that ignore the signalling system. We found a diverse set of equilibria, most of them consisting of a mixture of honest and cheating individuals. We found that when starting populations consist of all strategies (1) the honest equilibrium can evolve, (2) communication is almost always present when signals are informative, and (3) strategies that ignore signalling are generally rare. Honest individuals need not be the majority in these populations yet communication will be present and stable in the long run. In contrast, the pure honest equilibrium is unlikely to evolve when the starting populations consist of strategies that ignore signals. Strategies that ignore signals are more frequent in these types of run however, signalling strategies are still present in the most frequently evolved equilibria. Even in this simple system two different kinds of use of signals can evolve: the first when signals refer to resource-holding potential and a second where signals are used to create a payoff-irrelevant asymmetry. In general, regardless of the starting conditions, a low resource value favours weak individuals, both honest and cheaters, and cowards, medium values favour strong individuals that use and listen to signals, and a high resource value favours strong individuals that ignore the signalling system and attack under all conditions. Although it is possible to find parameter combinations with a negative value of information, the value of information is positive in the overwhelming majority of equilibria. Thus one can conclude that for the majority of parameter combinations an equilibrium evolved that might not be honest, not even on average, but communication is present and signals are worth listening to.

AB In their natural habitat, ducklings are members of a brood. In imprinting experiments, ducklings are usually tested individually. However, testing ducklings individually does not allow researchers to test for the potential role of social dynamics in the formation of attachments. We describe a procedure for testing ducklings as a brood and report four experiments in which we tested this method. In the first experiment, we exposed experimental broods consisting of 10 mallard ducklings to a stimulus brood of three ducklings or three empty quadrants. The experimental broods preferred the stimulus brood more than the empty quadrants. In the second experiment, we exposed experimental broods to stimulus broods of three and nine ducklings and two empty quadrants. The stimulus brood of nine was preferred more than the other quadrants. The third and fourth experiments examined preferences for even larger stimulus broods and the effect of using a larger testing platform on the preferences shown. These experiments suggest an effective method for testing the preferences and developmental dynamics of broods of ducklings. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Spectacular and abundant light displays consisting of highly complex and repeated vertical trains of secreted bioluminescent pulses are ejected into the water column above shallow grass beds in the western Caribbean about an hour after the sun sets if there is no moon present. These are male courtship displays produced by upwardly swimming male Photeros (formerly Vargula) annecohenae, small (<2 mm) myodocopid ostracod crustaceans, attempting to attract females, which approach males while remaining photically quiescent. Observations in both the laboratory and the field revealed different behaviours by males during the courtship period. Using infrared videography in the laboratory to track individuals, we observed distinct male mating behaviours from multiple males in a single tank. Each participating male is capable of ( 1) 'initiating' a luminescent display train (wleaders), ( 2) 'entraining' on another displaying male in loose luminescent synchrony (wfollowers), and ( 3) 'sneaking' silently on a luminescing male. Males can switch among these three tactics even during a single, 10-19 pulse display train (ca. 12 s). The alternative mating tactic chosen by a male is highly predicted by the orientation and distance of the responding male to the initial courtship display at the start of that tactic. Thus, the complex interplay of these different tactics among a group of males even during a single display train is highly choreographed in both time and space. The mating tactics of P. annecohenae are an extreme example of plastic, neuronally controlled courtship behaviour and provide rich new avenues for investigations into understanding communal sexual displays and sexual selection.

AB How individuals balance time spent satisfying nutritional needs and time spent being vigilant to protect against potential predation has received abundant attention from researchers. Evidence indicates that both social conditions and predator risk affect how individuals perceive environmental threat, however, the relative influence of each type of risk remains unclear. The risk allocation hypothesis considers how individuals respond to predation risk over time by adapting their investment in high-quality or low-quality vigilance. Here we use the risk allocation hypothesis as a guide to examine how different risk factors influence vigilance quantity and quality in Cape ground squirrels, Xerus inauris. We tested how the social conditions of age, sex, distance to a safe refuge, distance from a nearest neighbour and predator risk affect the amount of time ( quantity) individuals spend vigilant. Individuals were more vigilant in areas with more potential predators and when they were further from a safe refuge or nearest neighbour. We then tested whether these risk factors that affected vigilance quantity also affected vigilance quality by measuring exclusive vigilance (high-cost, high-quality) and shared-foraging-vigilance (low-cost, low-quality). Individuals in high-predation risk areas invested more time in high-cost vigilance behaviour than in low-cost vigilance/foraging behaviour compared with individuals in low-predation risk areas. Since squirrels invested in high-cost vigilance significantly more than in low-cost vigilance regardless of distance to a refuge or other squirrels, we suggest that combined foraging with vigilance compromises vigilance to lower its quality.

AB Variation among species in the onset of incubation has been attributed to differences in life history traits, and variation within species has been related to individual and environmental factors. We quantified within- and among-species variation in the onset of incubation in five cavity-nesting passerines, using a continuous record of diurnal and nocturnal incubation from clutch initiation through completion. We documented 11 potential patterns for the onset of incubation and showed that onset patterns were significantly related to hatching success. The onset of diurnal partial incubation and nocturnal full incubation generally occurred before diurnal full incubation, which started around clutch completion. Increases in precipitation or wind speed significantly delayed most types of incubation onset, supporting predictions of the energy constraints hypothesis. Ancillary predictions of rain and wind disproportionately delaying incubation for aerial foragers, and for species with male feeding during incubation, were not upheld. Larger clutch size accelerated the timing of full incubation onset in diurnal and nocturnal full incubation, supporting predictions of the egg viability hypothesis. Predictions of both hypotheses for the effects of minimum temperature, proportion of time above 24 degrees C, and seasonality on incubation onset were not supported. We observed egg neglect for up to 4 days or nights; neglect was more common at night, and consecutive nights of neglect occurred during nocturnal full incubation. Egg neglect did not significantly affect hatching success or incubation period. In conclusion, the timing of incubation onset was strongly affected by environmental and individual factors, and patterns of incubation onset affected hatching success.

AB Mixed-species flocks of foraging birds have been documented from terrestrial habitats all over the world and are thought to form for either improved feeding efficiency or better protection from predators. Two kinds of flock participants are recognized: those that join other species ('followers') and are therefore likely to be the recipients of the benefits of flock participation and those that are joined ('leaders'). Through comparative analyses, using a large sample of flocks from around the world, we show that (1) 'followers' tend to be smaller, more insectivorous, and feed in higher strata than matched species that participate in flocks to a lesser extent and (2) 'leaders' tend to be cooperative breeders more often than matched species that are not known to lead flocks. Furthermore, meta-analyses of published results from across the world showed that bird species in terrestrial mixed-species flocks increase foraging rates and reduce vigilance compared to when they are solitary or in conspecific groups. Moreover, the increase in foraging rates is seen only with flock followers and not flock leaders. These findings suggest a role for predation in the evolution of mixed-species flocking. Species that are vulnerable to predation follow species whose vigilance they can exploit. By doing so, they are able to reduce their own vigilance and forage at higher rates.

AB Behavioural biology is a major discipline within biology, centred on the key concept of 'behaviour'. But how is 'behaviour' defined, and how should it be defined? We outline what characteristics we believe a scientific definition should have, and why we think it is important that a definition have these traits. We then examine the range of available published definitions for behaviour. Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves, each other and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of 'behaviour'. We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes. Finally, we discuss the usage, meanings and limitations of this definition. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Androgens regulate male reproductive behaviour and may be a mechanistic link between sexual signals and physiological condition. However, the role of these hormones in regulating prenuptial moult and male plumage signals of passerine birds is unclear. In the red-backed fairy-wren, Malurus melanocephalus, plumage colour is a sexually selected trait and males express three reproductive phenotypes: males can breed in bright red and black plumage or in dull brown plumage, or assume dull plumage and act as nonbreeding auxiliaries; each phenotype differs in parental and reproductive behaviour. We found that plasma androgen concentrations differed significantly between male phenotypes, with red/black breeding males having the highest levels and auxiliaries having the lowest levels across all nesting stages. These hormonal differences were also present during the prebreeding moult when nuptial plumage is acquired. Males also differed significantly in body condition during moult based on the phenotype acquired in the subsequent breeding season, with red/black breeding males being in the best condition and auxiliaries being in the poorest condition. Moreover, androgen concentrations were positively correlated with body condition during prenuptial moult. Thus, in this species, androgens may determine plumage coloration and provide a link between the expression of sexual signals and body condition. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Predator detection and subsequent antipredator response behaviours have been documented in many vertebrate and invertebrate animals, although the degree of specificity in predator recognition and response varies. We examined responses of actively courting adult male Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz) wolf spiders to cues indicating the presence of an avian predator, including visual, seismic (substrate vibration) and acoustic (airborne) stimuli. Spiders responded to acoustic (bird call) and seismic (simulated beak tap) stimuli with cessation of courtship and movement, but increased locomotion when presented with a visual stimulus (bird shadow). Spiders responded to experimental playback of avian acoustic stimuli with antipredator behaviour significantly more often and took longer to return to courtship than when exposed to nonthreatening stimuli. Tests of responses on different substrata to isolate sensory modes revealed that spiders perceive airborne sound from bird calls as substratum-conducted vibration. Results indicate that S. ocreata are capable of recognizing sensory cues associated with avian predators and distinguishing them from nonthreatening stimuli, suggesting that bird predation has been a selection factor in shaping behaviour of this wolf spider species.

AB Courting males often use multiple signals to advertise their quality to females. Assuming that courtship traits are energetically costly, one would expect a limit to the overall courtship effort of an individual and that a high courtship effort takes its toll on individual condition. We tested this experimentally using a small marine fish, the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, whose males attract females through courtship displays and well-built nests (mussel shells covered with sand). At the end of a 5-day period of supplemental food, or repeatedly induced courtship or construction of nests (or none of these, as a control), we tested whether male display intensity, nest quality (nest cover and nest opening size) and body condition were affected. Males provided with food in excess were in significantly better condition and had significantly higher nest quality than control males. Display rate, however, was not significantly affected by feeding regime. Fish that had been manipulated to perform increased courtship or nest building did not suffer in terms of reduced condition, display rate or nest quality. However, individual fish that displayed intensely after treatment also built better-covered nests. Both of these traits are important in female choice. Moreover, fish that displayed intensely before the treatment continued to do so after treatment, a result that is compatible with signalling of genetic or phenotypic quality. Our results suggest that (1) nest cover is an honest signal of male condition, although we found no cost of nest building per se and (2) courtship display does not signal male condition.

AB Kin selection is often important in the evolution of reproductive behaviour, but we know much less about its significance for nonreproductive social groups. We investigated whether relatedness affects social-foraging behaviour in captive house sparrow, Passer domesticus,flocks, where birds may either search for food or exploit flockmates' food findings by scrounging. In such systems, both increased and decreased frequency of scrounging from relatives can be predicted by kin selection theory, depending on the relative costs and benefits of exploiting close kin. We found that birds used aggressive joining less often and obtained less food by that tactic from their close kin than from unrelated flockmates. In nonaggressive joinings, males also tended to join less often and obtained less food from close kin flockmates than from unrelated birds, whereas an opposite trend was found in females. Close kin males also spent less time feeding together from the same food patch than unrelated males, further suggesting reduced exploitation by male kin. These results suggest that house sparrows are able to recognize their close kin flockmates and reduce aggressive scrounging towards them, and that the sexes may differ in some forms of kin exploitation.

AB In many bird species, song repertoire characteristics play an important role in intersexual competition and intrasexual attraction. Studies on the importance of having a large repertoire typically assume the available song types as a fixed trait. However, repertoire composition may be flexible. We explored the effects of playbacks on the composition and use of the song type repertoire in great tits, Parus major. Playbacks simulate a nearby competitor male, vocally advertising territoriality. We compared the effects of novel song types with two control groups, one in which we played back one of the song types from the repertoire of the focal individual, and one without playback. The repertoire size for individual great tits of actively used song types remained more or less constant, but playbacks led to a significant turnover in repertoire composition over a relatively short period (about a week). The repertoire assessment across three experimental phases led to significantly larger accumulated repertoires compared to the more traditional short-term assessment method. The appearance of new song types was especially prominent among birds treated with a novel song type, suggesting the process is socially mediated. None of the 'new' song types were accurate copies of the novel unfamiliar song types played back. We discuss the potential origin of these 'new' song types and the impact of repertoire plasticity on signal value for sexual selection. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mother bats use pup contact calls ('isolation calls') to find and recognize their young. In white-winged vampire bats, Diaemus youngi, adults produce social calls that are structurally similar to the pup isolation calls of many other bat species. In addition, D. youngi seem to exchange these calls in a duet-like fashion. To determine whether calls elicit precise antiphonal responses, we simultaneously recorded social calls from groups of four captive bats vocally interacting. To examine call function, we conducted isolation experiments, permuted discriminant function analyses (pDFA) of individual variation in call structure, and a habituation-discrimination playback experiment. We found that adult D. youngi call when isolated, and their social calls attract conspecifics and elicit antiphonal responses. Bats called within 500 ms of a conspecific more than expected based on a random calling model. These findings are the first evidence of antiphonal calling among adult bats. We found significant individual variation in call structure, and show that bats can discriminate individual identity using social calls alone. We hypothesize that D. youngi use these antiphonal contact calls to mediate social interactions among individuals outside the roost. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Past research has indicated that the Clark's nutcracker encodes information about landmarks into memory to return to a hidden goal during small-scale navigation tasks. However, the ability to navigate using self-motion cues has been largely unexplored in avian species, including the nutcracker. In the current study, we trained four birds to move from a position near the perimeter of a 12-sided arena into a square enclosure where a hidden goal was located. Both self-motion cues and landmarks were available to locate the goal during training. The nutcrackers were able to locate the goal accurately using only self-motion cues when landmarks near the goal were removed during testing in Experiment 1. However, the results from Experiment 2 indicated that nutcrackers weighed local landmarks more heavily than self-motion cues when both sets of cues were placed in conflict.

AB Animals are often neophobic towards novel foods, but will incorporate them into their diet after interacting with experienced conspecifics. Such social learning is likely to be particularly important for young animals, for which most foods are unfamiliar. It has been suggested that in some species adults actively promote learning about unfamiliar foods by teaching offspring, although firm evidence is lacking. I examined social influences on learning about novel foods among wild meerkats, Suricata suricatta, a species where older group members teach pups prey-handling skills. In two experiments, naive pups were significantly more likely to eat hardboiled egg, a food item not normally present in the diet, and scorpions, a common prey type, if they had interacted with experienced conspecifics. I then investigated whether helpers teach pups to eat unfamiliar prey by preferentially feeding rare items and through direct feeding, where food items are transferred mouth to mouth. Rare prey items were fed more frequently than common items, although this may reflect nutritional characteristics. Direct feeding was most commonly used by juvenile helpers, which typically contribute relatively little to cooperative activities, and was more frequent if other helpers were nearby. This suggests that direct feeding may be a means of reducing the costs of feeding by improving the efficiency of energy transfer and minimizing the risks of kleptoparasitism. I conclude that learning about novel foods is likely to occur as a by-product of provisioning by helpers. There was little evidence that helpers actively teach pups what to eat.

AB Assessment strategies are an important component in game theoretical models of contests. Strategies can be either based on one's own abilities (self-assessment) or on the relative abilities of two opponents (mutual assessment). Using statistical methodology that allows discrimination between assessment types, we examined contests in the jumping spider Phidippus clarus. In this species, aggressive interactions can be divided into 'precontact' and 'contact' phases. Precontact phases consist of bouts of visual and vibratory signalling. Contact phases follow where males physically contact each other (leg fencing). Both weight and vibratory signalling differences predicted winners, with heavier and more actively signalling males winning more contests. Vibratory behaviour predicted precontact phase duration, with higher signalling rates and larger differences between contestants leading to longer precontact interaction times. Contact phase duration was predicted most strongly by the weight of losing males relative to that of winning males, suggesting that P. clarus males use self-assessment in determining contest duration. While a self-assessment strategy was supported, our results suggest a secondary role for mutual assessment ('partial mutual assessment'). After initial contest bouts, male competitors changed their behaviour. Precontact and contact phase durations were reduced while vibratory signalling behaviour in winners was unchanged. In addition, only vibratory signalling differences predicted winners in subsequent bouts, suggesting a role of experience in determining contest outcomes. We suggest that the rules and assessment strategies that males use can change depending on experience and that assessment strategies are probably a continuum between self-assessment and mutual assessment.

AB Caterpillars that are attacked by some species of parasitoid wasps are known to survive for several days after the parasitoid larvae emerge and pupate. It has been argued that the behaviour of the parasitized larva is 'usurped' by the parasitoid and that it 'guards' the parasitoid cocoons against their own natural enemies such as hyperparasitoids (the 'usurpation hypothesis'). We tested this hypothesis in the association involving a gregarious endoparasitoid, the wasp Cotesia glomerata; caterpillars of its host, the large cabbage white butterfly Pieris brassicae; and a pupal hyperparasitoid, the wasp Lysibia nana. In laboratory experiments, we presented cocoon broods of C. glomerata to single females of L. nana in arenas for 6 h. We tested several treatments for rates of primary parasitoid survival, including variation in the position of the caterpillar and the presence or absence of an additional silk web spun by parasitized caterpillars. Parasitized P. brassicae larvae survived longer than the period necessary for C. glomerata adults to emerge. Rates of parasitoid survival were, however, unaffected by the presence of a P. brassicae larva on the cocoon brood, although significantly more parasitoids emerged when the silk web was present. Analyses of the foraging behaviour of individual L. nana females in arenas, performed using Observer software, revealed that the wasps showed a greater tendency to leave cocoons when caterpillars and silk were present. The laboratory experiments only partially support the usurpation hypothesis. In nature, usurpation of the host of the primary parasitoid may be a more effective strategy against generalist predators than against more specialized and better-adapted hyperparasitoids.

AB Division of labour is a recurrent property of social groups. Among the different models proposed to explain the origin of division of labour, response-threshold models have garnered strong theoretical and empirical support. These models postulate that task specialization can arise spontaneously from interindividual variation in thresholds for responding to task-associated stimuli. Consequently, individuals with lower thresholds for a given task are more likely to become specialists. Self-reinforcement models expand this hypothesis by proposing that the successful performance of a task lowers an individual's threshold, increasing the probability that it will perform that task again. Although an important component of many models of division of labour, self-reinforcement can be difficult to test in real-world contexts. Here, we asked whether social experience modulates the individual response thresholds of normally solitary individuals. We focused on task performance during the early stages of nest construction in forced associations of the normally solitary halictine bee Lasioglossum (Ctenonomia) NDA-1. Within each pair, a strong behavioural asymmetry arose, with one bee specializing in excavation and her nestmate specializing in guarding the nest entrance. Individual performance of excavation by each bee was compared before and after being paired with a conspecific. After experiencing a social environment, individuals substantially increased their excavation performance. However, bees excavating more frequently in groups did not excavate differentially more afterwards, as would be predicted by self-reinforcement. The social context experienced by bees seems to promote behavioural differentiation leading to task specialization and to modulate response thresholds for excavation.

AB Reciprocal interactions observed in animals may persist because individuals keep careful account of services exchanged with each group member. To test whether chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, possess the cognitive skills required for this type of contingency-based reciprocity, we gave chimpanzees the choice of cooperating with a conspecific who had helped them previously or one who had not helped them in two different experimental tasks. In the first experiment, one of the partners preferentially recruited the subjects to cooperate in a mutualistic task, while the other potential partner never chose to cooperate with the subject, but rather chose a different partner. In the second experiment, one of the partners altruistically helped the subjects to reach food, while the other partner never helped the subject, but rather took the food himself. In both experiments there was some evidence that the chimpanzees increased the amount they cooperated with or helped the partner who had been more helpful towards them compared to their baseline behaviour towards the same individual ( or in a control condition). However, in both experiments this effect was relatively weak and subjects did not preferentially favour the individual who had favoured them over the one who had not in either experiment. Although taken together, these experiments provide some support for the hypothesis that chimpanzees are capable of contingent reciprocity, they also suggest that models of immediate reciprocation and detailed accounts of recent exchanges ( e. g. Tit for Tat) may not play a large role in guiding the social decisions of chimpanzees. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Active maternal care directed towards embryos within the brood pouch has been identified in amphipod crustaceans from harsh aquatic environments. This involves 'curl' and 'stretch' components and brood flushing that alters in distinct ways in response to developmental and environmental cues. However, a cost of active brood care in crustaceans is the susceptibility to embryo loss, this being further predisposed by the structure of the amphipod brood pouch. We found embryo retrieval by females of the rock-pool amphipod Apherusa jurinei, whereby females inserted experimentally offered embryos into their brood pouches. Females early in brood development retrieved embryos to a greater degree than both nonovigerous and later stage females. In this experiment, all offered embryos were from other females, indicating a motivation to retrieve embryos that often overrides any kin recognition. In a second experiment, we found kin discrimination, with both early stage and late stage females retrieving more of their own embryos than those from other females. Recognition was not simply of embryos of similar developmental stages. There were high levels of embryo cannibalism in both experiments, but females were significantly less likely to consume their own compared to foreign embryos. We thus further show that 'lower' crustaceans such as amphipods engage in elaborate active maternal care including kin recognition and discrimination. Their maternal behaviour appears to balance the costs and benefits of embryo retrieval, minimizing fitness reductions due to embryo loss and adoption of foreign embryos.

AB Studies of kin bias in the distribution of social behaviour in group-living matrifocal species generally underline the importance of bonds among female kin. However, few studies examine either how kin bias may be affected by variation in the availability of kin or the relevance of paternal kin. In this study, we used genetic and behavioural data to analyse correlates of coalition formation, proximity, grooming and dominance relations among female white-faced capuchins over a 10-year period during which the number of adult females in the group varied from 6 to 10. Females sided with the most closely related of two opponents when joining coalitions. Both dominance rank and kinship influenced proximity and grooming patterns. In particular, when group size was small, mean relatedness high and interdyadic variation in relatedness low, rank distance was a better predictor of proximity and grooming than was kinship distance. However, when group size was large, mean relatedness lower and interdyadic variation in relatedness higher, females significantly biased their grooming and spatial proximity towards kin. Dominance rank was not so tightly associated with relatedness as in provisioned female-bonded cercopithecines; females did not follow the 'youngest sister ascendancy rule'. Full sisters, maternal half sisters and mother-daughter dyads associated at statistically indistinguishable rates, and all associated significantly more often than paternal half sisters. Paternal half sisters did not associate more often than distantly related female-female dyads (r < 0.125). These and similar results call into question the general importance of paternal kin ties in wild primates. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Polygyny is regarded as a beneficial strategy for males, whereas females mated with polygynous males (males simultaneously paired to more than one female) often suffer a reduction in pair male contributions. This study examined the costs and benefits associated with polygyny in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. In this species, males are facultatively polygynous; some males hold only one territory with one breeding female whereas other males hold multiple territories, each with its own breeding female. Polygynous males were larger than monogamous males and body-scraped less, a behaviour often associated with ectoparasite loads. Polygynous males also had larger testes (controlling for body mass) and higher circulating 11-ketotestosterone levels than monogamous males. Paradoxically, monogamous males occupied higher-quality territories with more shelter and fewer predators. Monogamous males also provided more parental care than polygynous males but the number and survival of young did not vary according to male mating behaviour. The results of our study suggest that females trade-off between male genetic quality and resources in N. pulcher. Our results imply that males holding only one territory may provide their mates with significant assets but may not be able to outcompete neighbours for additional breeding positions because of their small body size and possible higher parasite load. The lack of differences between monogamous and polygynous groups in terms of offspring survival (a measure of reproductive success) suggests that there may be few if any fitness consequences of polygynous pairing for females.

AB Duetting is a form of animal communication in which two individuals produce temporally coordinated vocal signals. Describing the individual-level patterns of behaviour that structure duets is an integral step towards understanding the adaptive function(s) of duet participation. We investigated the. ne scale timing of duet contributions in male and female black-bellied wrens, Pheugopedius fasciatoventris, by analysing recorded duets and by stimulating birds to 'duet' with recorded songs in the field. Previous research on this species revealed that most duets consist of alternating male and female phrases, and that females abide by individually distinctive 'duet codes', which link each male phrase type with a specific answer from the female's repertoire. In the present analysis, we found that the timing of male duet phrases was primarily influenced by the time that the prior female phrase began, and secondarily influenced by an internal tempo. Female phrase timing, however, was most strongly influenced by the time that the prior male song ended, and secondarily influenced by the female's internal tempo. The average answering time for both sexes was less than 0.08 s before the end of the mate's prior phrase. Coordination at the beginning of the duet appears to limit duet length; duets with large gaps or overlapping phrases were always short. We conclude that both sexes make 'on-the-spot' adjustments in timing that function to minimize gaps and overlap between duet phrases. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that well-coordinated duets benefit both partners by communicating that their shared territory will be defended by a high-quality defensive coalition.

AB We examined the combined effects of isolation and body size on ( 1) the likelihood of mating, ( 2) the activity role, ( 3) the precopulatory behaviour, ( 4) the copulation duration, ( 5) the reciprocity of sperm transfer and ( 6) the number of ( reciprocally) transmitted sperm in the hermaphroditic land snail Succinea putris. Also, we assessed the effects of isolation on the sizes of the prostate and albumen gland. In contrast to a previous study, we observed no effect of body size on mating behaviour. However, there were strong effects of isolation: isolated individuals showed increased eagerness to mate, were more likely to adopt the active role and mounted shells of partners more than nonisolated individuals. Moreover, isolated individuals transferred more sperm than nonisolated individuals. Copulation duration and reciprocity of sperm transfer were unaffected by isolation. Isolation resulted in an increase in the size of the prostate gland and a decrease in the size of the albumen gland. We suggest that the motivation to mate after a period of isolation reflects a motivation to donate sperm rather than to receive sperm and that this motivation is regulated by the size of the prostate gland.

AB During contests the outcome is ultimately determined by the difference in fighting ability or resource holding potential ( RHP) of opponents and the loser may make the decision to give up by comparing its own fighting ability to that of the eventual winner. Such ' mutual assessment', however, may not be possible in all cases and an alternative mechanism is to withdraw when the costs of remaining in the contest cross a threshold. Thus, in contests where the opponents do not impose direct costs on each other the decision to give up is based on the absolute RHP rather than the relative RHP of the loser. The possibility for ' mutual' or 'self' assessment is a feature that distinguishes between different theoretical models of contests. Here I analyse relationships between contest duration and relative and absolute measures of RHP to determine whether contests in the house cricket are settled on the basis of mutual or self assessment. Although body size may contribute to RHP, additional traits such as weapons and energetic status may also influence fighting ability. Therefore, in this study I aimed to determine which features contribute to RHP before analysis of the effects of relative and absolute RHP on contest duration. Energy and body size strongly differ between winners and losers but differences in weapon size are marginal. Analysis of contest duration supports the idea that mutual assessment is a feature of these contests but also suggests that individual thresholds of energetic cost contribute to the decision to give up.

AB In species where individuals are widely spaced instantaneous signals cannot readily form the basis of communication networks, that is several individuals within signalling range of each other. However, markings, signals that remain in the environment after the signaller has left, may fulfil this role. In this study, we have investigated the possible function of swift fox, Vulpes velox, latrines, collections of scat, urine and possibly other secretions, in a communication network context. We found that latrines had higher frequencies of occurrence inside the core (defined as the 50% kernel contour) of a pair's home-range when compared with outside the core and in areas of a pair's home-range that overlapped with neighbouring individuals when compared with those areas that did not overlap with neighbours. These were also the two areas where latrines were most likely to reoccur in the next consecutive breeding season. Furthermore, latrines in the exclusive part of a pair's home-range core and latrines in edge area overlap zones had the highest frequency of visits as determined by the rate of faecal depositions. Our interpretation of these results is that latrines possibly have a dual function. That is, they function in territory defence in the exclusive areas of a pair's core and as centres for information exchange in the outer areas of a pair's home-range that overlap with neighbouring foxes. We discuss the possible information content of latrines and the possibility of latrines forming the basis of communication networks in the swift fox.

AB Optimal time allocation to foraging behaviour may be constrained by intrinsic and extrinsic factors forcing animals to adopt compromises to meet their daily energetic needs. Our goal was to assess the influence of individual characteristics and extrinsic factors on the activity budget of marked adult female mountain goats, Oreamnos americanus. As lactation entails important energetic costs, we specifically aimed at contrasting activity budgets of lactating and nonlactating females. We determined female activity budgets using 10-min interval scan sampling between 2002 and 2005. Lactating females, females raising sons and females that were subordinate for their age spent more time foraging than nonlactating females, females raising daughters and dominant females, respectively. Although foraging is typically incompatible with scanning, increased time spent foraging was mainly performed at the expense of time spent lying rather than time spent in vigilance. Lactating females also increased time spent ruminating while lying compared with nonlactating females. All females traded lying time for increased foraging and ruminating times in early and late summer. Females spent less time foraging on warm days, and foraged more at dusk than during the rest of the day. Age and body mass did not influence female activity budgets. Our results indicate that lactating females partly compensated for the costs of lactation by trading lying for foraging time, and reorganized lying time to increase the proportion of time spent ruminating. This study emphasizes the fundamental behavioural trade-offs that female mammals must face to meet their daily energetic requirements and allows a better understanding of how these compromises vary through the lactation period.

AB Animals living in pairs often benefit from making behavioural switches synchronously. However, there is a trade-off between the need to synchronize and the need to stick to the individually different ideal time for the switch. We model this situation, assuming two mechanisms for achieving synchronization: either to be ready before the ideal individual moment, or to wait beyond it. The model identifies an optimal combination of readiness and waiting that brings the maximum benefit, in dependence on parameters including relative costs of nonsynchrony, acting too early, and acting too late. The model is examined in two variants, without or with communication between the animals about their preparedness to synchronize. For a majority of parameter values, the optimal strategy is to synchronize without communication (by just reacting to the other animal's action) and be ready before the ideal time, but not to wait. This strategy leads to premature switches in pairs compared to single animals. Communication only pays off when communicating is cheap and acting late is cheaper than acting prematurely. In this situation, communication is coupled with a pure waiting strategy and results in delayed switches. The model shows that synchronization is not symmetric in time which is a consequence of the inherent informational asymmetry of time. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Parasites can often impose a cost on their hosts by interfering with traits affected by sexual selection. We studied the effects of the bot fly, a common parasite of the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, on host social behaviour using field-based experiments. Assuming parasite-induced costs on host behaviour, we expected that males uninfested with bot fly larvae would be more aggressive than infested males, and that reproductively active females would show a preference for uninfested males over infested males. Uninfested males were not more aggressive than infested males, based on two measures of aggression (principal component scores and number of aggressive behaviours). Contrary to our expectations, our results suggested that infested males may be more aggressive than uninfested males, but this result was based on the analysis of both aggressive and submissive behaviours. In addition, females spent more time with infested males. Thus, infestation may increase body size which could alter the outcome of female choice. Additional experimentation is necessary to tease apart the effects of increased body size and infestation on female choice. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many kin groups cooperation is maintained by mutual policing and enforcement of fairness, a pattern that is predicted to change with group size. Variation in group size is most pronounced in hymenopteran societies, in which reproductive division of tabour between queens and workers exists. Workers should not reproduce because of relatedness patterns and/or productivity costs. In small colonies where workers retain high reproductive potential egg laying is controlled by worker policing in the form of aggression towards incipient egg-layers or as destruction of worker-laid eggs. Egg-layers and worker eggs can be recognized in many species by differences in their surface hydrocarbons. We investigated whether these mechanisms change in species with large colonies and low worker reproductive potential. In the ant Camponotus floridanus, worker policing is based on differences in the hydrocarbon profiles of worker- and queen-laid eggs. However, in this study workers with developed ovaries were never the focus of attacks by nestmates, which contrasts with most studies on species in which workers have high reproductive potential. The lack of aggression towards egg-laying workers fits with the absence of relevant differences in the cuticular hydrocarbon profile between egg-laying and infertile C. floridanus workers, although strong differences existed between highly fertile queens and workers. Large colonies and low worker reproductive potential were thus accompanied by a lack of physical worker policing in C. floridanus, as predicted. Furthermore, we found costs of worker reproduction and we discuss their significance for worker policing. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study ofAnimal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We studied individual variation in the antipredator response of the fishing spider, D. triton, in a variety of developmental and behavioural contexts. We examined our data with respect to two general hypotheses: (1) startled spiders should modulate their boldness according to context-specific variables (e.g. developmental stage, feeding opportunities, mating opportunities, parental investment, body condition, etc.), and/or (2) an individual spider's boldness will be consistent (i.e. positively correlated) across contexts such that boldness in any given context is well predicted by boldness in other contexts. We found some support for the former, context-specific hypothesis and strong support for the latter, 'behavioural-syndromes' hypothesis. While spiders were significantly bolder in the presence versus absence of prey, boldness did not fluctuate with developmental stage, mating opportunities, parental investment or condition in the manner predicted. Instead, boldness in adult spiders was well predicted by a syndrome of positively correlated bold behaviours across functional contexts. We suggest that animal behaviour most often reflects a combination of context-specific behavioural optimization and context-general expression of behavioural syndromes, as was seen in this experiment. We further suggest that disentangling the relative magnitude of these two general mechanisms in a wide variety of taxa, covering many behavioural-ecological contexts, will provide great insights into (1) population ecology (e.g. the success of invasive/pest species and the failure of threatened species), (2) community ecology (e.g. species coexistence, trophic dynamics), and (3) evolutionary ecology (e.g. evolution of the multivariate behavioural phenotype).

AB Nestling begging behaviour may be an honest signal of need used by parents to adjust optimally both feeding rate and within-brood food allocation. Although several studies showed that mothers and fathers can be differentially responsive to nestling begging behaviour with one parent showing a stronger tendency to feed the offspring that beg the most, little information is yet available on whether offspring beg for food at different intensities from the mother than father. In the present study, we investigated in nestling barn owls whether the intensity of vocal begging behaviour in the presence of the mother and in the presence of the father is different. A difference is expected because reproductive tasks are divided between the sexes with fathers bringing more food items to the nest than mothers. The results show that although mothers transfer their prey item to one of the offspring more rapidly than fathers once in their nestbox, nestlings begged more intensely in the presence of their mother than in the presence of their father. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence that offspring vocalize to different levels in the presence of their mother than in the presence of their father.

AB Ortolan buntings, Emberiza hortulana, have local dialects in central and southern Europe. Neighbouring males typically share the same final phrase of a song, which seems to be important for dialect recognition. We studied ortolan buntings in Norway, where a small and isolated population occurs with no local dialect in the above-mentioned sense. Norwegian males often have song types with different final phrases in their repertoire, and have larger repertoires and less song type sharing than other populations. We experimentally tested (1) whether male ortolan buntings from Norway discriminate between local and foreign or hybrid songs, and (2) what part of the song is used to discriminate between local and foreign songs. We studied the response to typical local songs (L), conspecific foreign songs from a remote population (F), and computer-created hybrid songs with a local final phrase and foreign initial phrase (F-L) and vice versa (L-F). Only local songs evoked a strong response, measured as latency to flight and approach, number of flights and closest distance from the loudspeaker. For F, F-L and L-F song playbacks, the majority of males did not respond at all, or responded significantly less than to L songs. Our results suggest that at least in this population, the final phrase of the song is not a sufficient cue for local song dialect recognition. We discuss the adaptive value of discriminating between own and foreign songs based on specific cues versus full songs in relation to dispersal and song-learning pattern in the ortolan bunting.

AB The trade-off foragers make between predation risk and feeding efficiency is readily studied in dabbling ducks, which have stereotyped feeding methods, some of which prevent predator detection while others do not. Teals forage mostly with only the bill submerged (eyes above the water surface) in winter, but use a broader foraging repertoire in summer. Given the different environments used by teals over the year, it is likely that such a shift is due to changes in diet, but it may also be caused by differences in predation risk between habitats. However, neither predation risk nor teal behaviour has been studied with consistent methods around the year or throughout any of its flyways. Covering wintering, spring-staging, breeding and moulting sites, we combined focal observations of teals and predator flyover data from seven regions ranging from southern France to northern Sweden. Although not apparent at the scale of days within sites, teals indeed relied more on shallow foraging where predation risk was higher, i.e. at wintering sites. Average foraging depth increased gradually from September to August, i.e. from wintering to breeding sites. Foraging bout length of deeply foraging teals did not decrease over the year, suggesting that it is through selection of foraging technique, rather than by the balance between foraging and interruptions, that birds adjust to predation risk. This study highlights behavioural plasticity in response to contrasting selection regimes within a flyway, in dabbling ducks as well as long-distance migrants in general.

AB There is increasing evidence of brain lateralization in frogs and toads, based on studies of their responses to various types of visual stimuli and also from their limb preferences. In a range of toad species, agonistic and predatory responses are preferentially directed by the left and right eyes, respectively. We investigated visual lateralization in the adult Australian green tree frog, a species with marked differences in ecological habitat and evolutionary history compared to the bufonids (toads). We also investigated forelimb preferences in a climbing task, using the same group of frogs. Strong and significant left-eye preferences were found for directing agonistic responses at other frogs, contrasting with a nonsignificant trend towards right-eye preferences for predatory responses. Furthermore, the right forelimb was used preferentially as the leading limb to control climbing to an upright position after the frog had been inverted in the vertical plane. In each instance, the laterality of behaviour corresponded with the lateralization of comparable behaviours in higher vertebrates, supporting the hypothesis that brain lateralization is conserved from a common lateralized ancestor.

AB We investigated the calls of male putty-nosed monkeys produced in response to playbacks of leopard, Panthera pardus, growls and crowned eagle, Stephanoaetus coronatus, shrieks. Two call types, hacks and pyows were produced and both occurred within alarm-calling sequences regardless of the predator category simulated by the playbacks. Unlike previous studies of alarm calling in guenon monkeys, we therefore could not conclude that the alarm calls of putty-nosed males are functionally referential. There were, however, striking regularities in the patterning of the calls given in response to these stimuli and different call combinations were strongly associated with each of the two predator types. While we concluded that individual calls did not qualify as vehicles of semantic content, these males produced structurally unique call sequences that provided sufficient information for receivers to select appropriate antipredator responses.

AB The prediction that the spatial dispersion of resources that are important to females should dictate female dispersion and male mating tactics has not been previously tested in harem-forming bats. We investigated the relation between the estimated spatial distribution of available roosts, female group size, male roost fidelity and the strength of social associations in two species of harem-forming fruit bats in the genus Cynopterus. We evaluated the daily movements of individuals and groups among roosts using radiotelemetry and roost censuses at two sites in northern peninsular Malaysia. We found a high correspondence between the distribution of roost sites, female group size and male behaviour, supporting the prediction that clumped resources would promote female aggregation and high roost fidelity in males. However, there were significant interspecific differences. in the strength of male-female associations, which suggested that, where roosts are abundant and similar in quality, regardless of their spatial distribution, the potential for males to monopolize mates depends on whether females move among roosts with, or independently of, males. We propose that interspecific differences in female behaviour may be related to the costs of moving between clumped versus randomly dispersed males. 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated the effects of overlap between the advertisement calls of two closely related and often sympatric species of grey treefrogs on female phonotactic behaviour and signal selectivity. The tetraploid H. versicolor and the diploid H. chrysoscelis have advertisement calls consisting of trains of stereotyped pulses that are similar in their spectral composition. All females of H. versicolor from a population sympatric with H. chrysoscelis approached a speaker broadcasting synthetic advertisement calls modelled after con-specific calls when the calls of the two species alternated from speakers with a 90 degrees angular separation with respect to the release point. Surprisingly, the same females almost exclusively approached the source of synthetic calls modelled after the heterospecific advertisement calls when these calls completely overlapped the conspecific stimuli. Female H. chrysoscelis from the same sympatric population approached the source of synthetic conspecific calls even when these calls were overlapped by the heterospecific stimuli, indicating that females in these closely related species may differ in their susceptibility to the negative consequences of call overlap. When female H. versicolor were presented with conspecific advertisement calls that were completely overlapped by those of H. chrysoscelis, many females failed to approach either signal source. Response times of females that did respond were also longer, and the direction of phonotaxis was shifted in the direction of the heterospecific signal source. These negative influences of acoustic interference were reduced or eliminated as the degree of overlap between the calls of the two species was reduced. The results demonstrate that the effects of signal overlap on female phonotactic behaviour may be complex. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Despite numerous studies of extrapair paternity in birds, little is known about the behaviours that males and females use to seek (or avoid) extrapair copulations. We used radiotelemetry to examine the extraterritorial movements of both male and female common yellowthroats, Geothlypis trichas, in relation to male ornaments, particularly the black facial mask. We found that many males (62%) and females (47%) forayed, and they primarily visited the territories of immediate neighbours (91%). Parentage analyses revealed that the majority of extrapair sires were neighbours (80%) who typically had larger facial masks than the male that they cuckolded. Females only forayed during their fertile period, and they directed most of their forays to territories of males with larger masks than their own social mate. In contrast, males directed most of their forays to territories where the female was fertile and the resident male had a smaller mask than their own. The relatively short foray distances of birds may be partly responsible for the wide distribution of extrapair fertilizations among males in the population (45% of males). If this is a general pattern among species, then the effect of extrapair mating on sexual selection is likely to be weaker than currently thought.

AB There is burgeoning interest in the costs of mating and in how this leads to sex differences in the optimal mating rate. Here, we attempt to look beyond an exclusive focus on matings to examine the fundamental conflicts that arise out of the fact that sexual reproduction involves investment in offspring by typically unrelated individuals. Conflicts between mates stem from the ever present potential for individuals to reduce their investment relative to that of their sexual partner in order to seek alternative reproductive opportunities elsewhere. All aspects of life histories, the partitioning of time and energy into growth, survival and reproduction, are inextricably caught up in, and moulded by these conflicts of interest, the most profound expression of which is the differentiation between male and female types. This differentiation creates a new set of conflicts because alleles with positive effects on fitness when expressed in one sex may have negative fitness effects in the other. This type of conflict may influence the evolution of separate juvenile and adult life stages as in metamorphosis, although a major outstanding question is why sex limitation does not evolve more rapidly. We review the impact of conflicts of interest between males and females on all aspects of life history, revealing at least as much evidence for sexual conflict over life history traits such as investment in gametes and parental care as there is for conflicts over matings.

AB In many taxonomic groups, odours provide cues to species identity, reproductive status, genetic relatedness and individual identity. These odour cues are often used to mark territories or other resources and to recognize individuals through direct or indirect olfactory investigation. Belding's ground squirrels, Spermophilus beldingi, frequently scent-mark their environment and they also investigate the scent glands of conspecifics, which suggests that odours play a modulating role in their social relationships. I conducted studies to determine what information is conveyed by various S. beldingi odours and whether this information is used by conspecifics for social recognition. Spermophilus beldingi produce a number of cues that are individually distinct, including odours from oral, dorsal, pedal and anal glands and from ears, but apparently not from urine, although it is unclear whether all of these odours are used for social recognition. This discrimination among odours of individuals does not require prior familiarity with the odour bearers. The volatile components of some odours are sufficient to permit individual discrimination, which may explain how animals appear to 'recognize' each other from a short distance. Finally, S. beldingi incorporate multiple odours into their memories of conspecifics as perception of one odour of an individual generalizes to a second odour from it, suggesting a mental representation of familiar individuals. The production of multiple unique odours may facilitate accurate discrimination of conspecifics along several social dimensions, and some of these odours also vary with relatedness. Together, these results indicate a rich olfactory milieu mediating the social lives of S. beldingi. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Female mammals may exert choice for mates directly by mating selectively. Alternatively, females can mate promiscuously, allowing sperm competition and/or cryptic female choice to operate. Primate sexual behaviour is probably a compromise between conflicting male and female interests, so it may be important to examine female mating behaviour independently from male influence to better understand female mating strategies. To explore how female behaviour and ovarian cycle phase influence the choice and number of mates in female longtailed macaques, we conducted a pair-choice test where females had complete control over access to males. Subjects were six females and four males. Females were presented with a different pair of males twice a day. Each male was in an adjacent chamber. Females could enter freely and were allowed two entries per male pair. Entry and subsequent copulation with a male was defined as a choice with mating. Females saw each male every day; the males within a pair alternated in a fixed order. We related the females' mating pattern to menstrual cycle stage and timing of ovulation, as determined from faecal progestogen profiles. Females chose and mated with males promiscuously in all periods of their menstrual cycle (prefertile, fertile and postfertile). Overall, females apportioned choices with mating and number of copulations evenly across males. In general, female preferences were not based on male dominance rank. Further investigation is needed to better understand the nature of mating preferences and the adaptive significance of promiscuity in female primates.

AB Although the functional consequences of temperature variation have been examined for a wide range of whole-animal performance traits, the implications of thermal variation for reproductive behaviour or performance are poorly known. I examined the acute effects of temperature on the mating behaviour and swimming performance of male eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, which rely on a coercive strategy to obtain matings and are routinely exposed to wide daily temperature fluctuations. Males showed reproductive behaviours across the entire test temperature range of 14-38 degrees C, representing one of the widest reproductively active temperature ranges for any ectotherm. Both the time spent in pursuit of females and the total number of mating attempts increased with temperature to a plateau that started at approximately 22-26 degrees C. However, males maintained a constant level of copulations at 18-34 degrees C, the temperature range they routinely experience in southeast Queensland. In contrast, maximum swimming performance and approach speeds during copulations were highly thermally dependent across this temperature range. Thus, acute temperature variation has important fitness implications for male G. holbrooki, but mating performance was significantly limited only at extreme temperatures.

AB Males commonly face a trade-off between investment in offspring care and time spent seeking additional breeding opportunities. Although this trade-off is central to our understanding of the evolution of male parental care, it has been largely ignored by studies of male alloparental care in cooperative societies, where male helpers could face a similar problem. We investigated whether male helpers in cooperative societies of meerkats Suricata suricatta trade off their cooperative contributions to pup feeding against extraterritorial prospecting for mating and dispersal opportunities. Not only did male helpers spend extended periods away from the group during pup care periods, but those that spent most time prospecting also contributed least to pup feeding when present in the group. Regular prospectors lost the most weight over the pup-feeding period and male testosterone levels increased in association with prospecting. As both reduced body condition and elevated testosterone have been shown to compromise the expression of offspring care, these findings provide likely explanations for the reduced pup-feeding rates of regular prospectors. Despite their lapses in contributions to cooperative activities, we found no evidence for punishment of prospectors by other group members, suggesting that helpers are able to adjust their contributions according to their own optima. These findings reveal that male helpers in cooperative species can face similar trade-offs to male parents in noncooperative species, between investment in offspring care and alternative fitness-maximizing tactics such as prospecting. We discuss the broader implications of this work for our understanding of both individual variation and sex differences in contributions to cooperative behaviour.

AB We investigated the effects of filial cannibalism, which is prevalent in teleosts that display parental care, on components of fitness in the flagfish. Currently, filial cannibalism in care-giving teleosts is thought to reflect an adaptive trade-off between current and future reproduction, in which energy or nutrients gained from consuming eggs is invested into future reproduction. Thus, we expected filial cannibalism to increase future reproductive success. We quantified the reproductive fitness consequences of filial cannibalism in the flagfish by comparing two cannibalism treatments (male access to eggs versus no male access to eggs) crossed with two feeding treatments (high and low food). Males were followed over 90 days, approximately one breeding season (i.e. the expected reproductive lifetime of flagfish), and we considered three fitness components: (1) the total number of eggs received (2) the number of spawnings and (3) the frequency of spawning. Contrary to predictions, filial cannibalism reduced male reproductive success. While there was an effect of food on components of fitness (i.e. number of eggs received, number of spawnings, frequency of spawning), there was no effect of filial cannibalism. An enhanced diet was also related to increased male weight, but filial cannibalism was not. Thus, in the flagfish, we have no evidence that energy or nutrients gained from filial cannibalism is directly translated into increased future reproductive success. We discuss our findings in relation to current and alternative theories of filial cannibalism. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study or Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB As a general rule ungulates that are sexually dimorphic in body mass live in separate groups of males and females throughout the year, except during the breeding season, a behaviour known as sexual segregation. Many hypotheses have been developed to explain sexual segregation and most have failed to demonstrate segregation in ungulates under controlled conditions. We experimentally examined a key hypothesis in a sexually dimorphic ungulate, the Soay sheep, Ovis aries, using a maze design. The social factors hypothesis states that animals of the same sex or cohort are more likely to interact with same-sex or same-age peers than with animals of different sex or age because of differences in behaviour caused by different roles in reproduction or to avoid agonistic interactions with animals of different size. Both males and females preferred the company of peers of the same sex or of their own group. The attraction towards an animal of the same sex was not driven by an aversion to animals of a different sex, as the social factors hypothesis proposes. We conclude that these preferences in aggregation patterns for animals of the same sex. can contribute to the cohesion of single-sex groups and promote segregation, although additional factors are needed to explain the patterns of sexual segregation observed in nature. We comment on these results from an evolutionary perspective. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wintering birds face a trade-off between starvation and predation risk. In Eurasian woodcocks, Scolopax rusticola, habitat use may reflect this trade-off because meadows, where most birds spend the night, are characterized by a higher risk of predation and a higher biomass of food (earthworms) than the woods, used by day. We monitored activity of 34 woodcocks fitted with tiltswitch radiotags Young birds were more active than adults, probably because they were less efficient at foraging. In general, nocturnal activity was inversely correlated with air temperature and with daylight foraging activity, suggesting some compensatory mechanism, modulated by thermoregulatory constraints. Individual activity patterns differed, and we classified woodcocks according to three main wintering strategies: 'always', 'sometimes' or 'never' visiting fields at night. The decision to fly to fields at night seemed to be taken every evening according to the amount of daylight foraging activity in woods and the air temperature. After feeding in a rich patch of food on a mild day, woodcocks did not have to risk going to meadows. Conversely, in patches of fewer food resources or at lower temperatures or both, woodcocks could not meet all their energy requirements without going to fields at night (where there was always sufficient food) and eventually, changing their diurnal sites. Therefore, the trade-off between feeding and predation risk depends on how efficiently birds find a rich patch of food in the forest and exploit it optimally during the day.

AB Contact mate guarding may increase predation risk in the presence of active, size-selective predators by increasing the apparent size or decreasing the escape ability of an individual. These same characteristics may, however, make paired individuals less vulnerable to sit-and-wait, non-size-selective predators. Because the costs and benefits associated with mate guarding are likely to depend on local ecological conditions, species or populations should vary in the duration of the guarding phase. In this study, I investigate whether precopulatory mate guarding increases an individual's predation risk for two freshwater amphipod species within the Hyalella azteca species complex that experience different predators. When larval dragonflies, Anax junius and Tramea lacerata, were used as predators in laboratory trials, single, unpaired individuals were more likely to be consumed than paired individuals. Conversely, predatory fish consumed paired females more often than single females. Therefore, the short precopulatory mate guarding duration observed in the species that co-occurs with predatory fish may be due to habitat-specific, predator-driven costs associated with precopulatory mate guarding. Furthermore, the predation cost associated with precopula was greater for females than males when predatory fish were used as predators, implying that intersexual conflict over the duration of the guarding period may be more intense for the species that co-occurs with predatory fish.

AB Blattella germanica (L.) cockroaches are gregarious during their resting period. Binary choice tests with groups of larvae indicated a strong tendency to aggregate on a single resting site. This was observed even when all sites were identical or when larvae came from either one or two strains. Previous results showed that gregarious behaviour is mainly based on recognition of cuticular hydrocarbons characterizing strain odour and that larvae prefer their own strain odour to that of another strain. Nevertheless, when groups in tests came from two different strains and had the choice between their two strain odours, they aggregated on only one of the sites. A mathematical model relying on a minimum number of functioning rules was devised to reproduce these experimental collective responses. The model is based on a fundamental parameter representing individual variation in the resting period on a given site in relation to the number of individuals on that site. Taking only this parameter into account, the model predicted that different strains are able to aggregate on the same site despite a weak interstrain interattraction parameter. Blattella germanica is thus an interesting biological model to investigate different aspects of aggregation and interindividual recognition. 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; LESIONS; SYSTEM; KEY
AB We tested the responses of Bufo marinus to prey stimuli of varying visual complexity that were moved around the toads in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction at 1.7 revolutions/min. Predatory responses directed at prey resembling an insect were frequent when the model insect moved clockwise across the visual midline into the right visual hemifield. In contrast, the toads tended to ignore such stimuli when they moved anticlockwise across the midline into the left hemifield. No such lateralization was found when a rectangular strip moved along its longest axis was presented in a similar way. The toads also directed more responses towards the latter stimulus than towards the insect prey. Hence, the results suggest that lateralized predatory responses occur for considered decisions on whether or not to respond to complex insect-like stimuli, but not for decisions on comparatively simple stimuli. We discuss similarities between the lateralized feeding responses of B. marinus and those of avian species, as support for the hypothesis that lateralized brain function in tetrapods may have arisen from a common lateralized ancestor.

AB Stabilimenta, the conspicuous, ultraviolet (UV)-reflecting, white silk structures around the hub of orb webs, are thought to increase a spider's foraging success by attracting prey (prey attraction hypothesis). No studies, however, have yet investigated the function of nonlinear and noncruciform stabilimenta and the stabilimenta of juvenile spiders. We examined whether the discoid stabilimenta spun by juvenile Argiope versicolor, an orb-spinning spider, function to attract prey. When we measured the UV reflectance of the web silks of A. versicolor juveniles, we found that the discoid stabilimentum silk, but not spiral silk or radial silk or the joint where the two types of silk met, reflected UV light. We then carried out two series of choice experiments in the laboratory to determine whether the webs with discoid stabilimenta attract more fruit flies than undecorated webs when UV+ white light (300-700 nm) is present. We also examined whether the discoid stabilimenta still attract insects when the UV section of the spectrum (300-400 nm) is eliminated (UV-). Webs with discoid stabilimenta attracted more fruit flies than the webs without stabilimenta in UV + white light. However, in UV- light, fewer fruit flies flew to the webs, even when they were decorated with discoid stabilimenta. In a field experiment, significantly more insects were intercepted by webs with discoid stabilimenta than by webs without stabilimenta. We suggest that the discoid stabilimenta of A. versicolor juveniles act as a visual signal that attracts insects, supporting the prey attraction hypothesis.

   DISTANCE; FROG
AB Female preferences for loud calls are widespread among animals that communicate acoustically, but their 'strategic' role is still controversial. According to the 'passive attraction' hypothesis, females are more likely to respond to loud calls simply because these calls are more effective at stimulating their acoustic receptors and primary neurons. The 'active choice' hypothesis, however, assumes that females use sound intensity as a cue to assess the power and location of sound sources and to respond accordingly. To test which hypothesis could best explain the preference for loud calls of female green toads, Bufo viridis, we carried out multitrial discrimination experiments, in which females were given a choice between two stimuli differing in either the power or the distance of their sources or both. In the laboratory, females could discern differences in intensity caused by differences in power or location of the acoustic sources. This ability increased in field experiments, when the speakers and receivers were further apart than in the laboratory experiments. Phonotactic behaviour did not vary significantly between females, but did within females: in their second trial, females were more likely to approach the closer speaker than in the first trial. These findings suggest that sound intensity plays a more complex role in female mate choice than that recognized by the passive attraction hypothesis. To understand female preferences and, ultimately, mate choice, attention should be focused directly on the computational processes of the female's central nervous system.

AB Fiddler crabs (Uca sp.) provide a good example of prey whose antipredator behaviour places them in a 'waiting game' contest with their predators. After visually detecting an approaching predator, fiddler crabs typically retreat into a burrow. When this occurs, a crab must decide how long to wait for the predator to depart before re-emerging and potentially exposing itself to attack. Similarly, the predator must decide how long to wait for the crab to re-emerge before departing in search of other foraging opportunities. Hugie (2003, Behavioral Ecology, 14, 807-817) recently presented an analysis of such a predator-prey waiting game. The model makes various predictions, including ones about the general shape of each player's waiting distribution (the distribution of waiting times one would expect to observe for individuals in that role). I present an empirical test of the waiting game during interactions between the black-bellied plover, Pluvialis squatarola, and the fiddler crab Uca princeps. As predicted by the model, the plovers' waiting distribution resembled a negative exponential function, whereas the waiting times of crabs were more variable and followed a positively skewed distribution. As further predicted, very little overlap occurred between the two players' waiting distributions and plovers rarely outwaited crabs. I conclude that the waiting decisions of the black-bellied plover and U. princeps support the general predictions of Hugie (2003) and result from a predator-prey waiting game.

AB Predator odours and habitat structure are thought to influence the behaviour of small mammalian prey, which use them as cues to reduce risks of predation. We tested this general hypothesis for house mice, Mus domesticus, by manipulating fox odour density via addition of fox scats and habitat via patchy mowing of vegetation, for populations in 15 X 15-m field enclosures. Using giving-up densities (GUDs), the density of food remaining when an animal quits harvesting a patch, we measured foraging behaviours in response to these treatments. Mice consistently avoided open areas, leaving GUDs two to four times greater in these areas than in densely vegetated patches. However, mouse GUDs did not change in response to the addition of fox scats, even immediately after fresh scats were added. There was no interaction between fox odour and habitat use. We then tested whether habituation to fox odours had occurred, by comparing the individual responses to scats of eight mice born into enclosures with fox scats to those of eight mice born into scat-free enclosures and five wild mice. In smaller enclosures, GUDs of trays with scats did not differ from GUDs of trays without scats for any treatment. We conclude that exposure to high levels of fox odours did not alter the foraging behaviour of mice, but that mice did reduce foraging in areas where habitat was removed, perceiving predation risk to be greater in these areas than controls. We suggest further that studies using the 'scat-at-trap' technique, which have shown avoidance of predator odours by mice and other small mammals, may overestimate the general avoidance of predator odours by free-living prey, which must forage with a constant background of predator odours.

ID BIRD SONG; ASYMMETRY; BEHAVIOR; MEMORY; CHICK; EYE
AB Previous experiments on visual feature discrimination abilities have consistently shown a right-eye system lateralization in pigeons, Columba livia, and young domestic chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, both nonpasserine species. Recently, however, it has been shown that photoreceptor distribution in the left and right retinas are asymmetrical in the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, a passerine species. Single cone receptors are significantly more abundant in the left retina, which suggests that starlings should perform visual discrimination tasks more proficiently with the left eye, in contrast to previous findings with nonpasserines. We tested this hypothesis using the technique of monocular occlusion. In the first experiment, starlings were tested on a simultaneous visual discrimination task in three conditions: binocular (both eyes), left monocular (left eye only) and right monocular (right eye only). Subjects in the binocular and left-monocular conditions achieved significantly higher performance scores on the discrimination task than birds in the right-monocular condition. A second experiment found similar results, with birds in the left-monocular condition learning the discrimination task more than twice as quickly as those in the right-monocular condition. Subsequent tests with the alternative eye for both groups indicated no interocular transfer. These findings suggest that visual discriminative abilities in starlings are asymmetrical, and that they are lateralized in the opposite eye system than has been reported for all other species tested to date.

AB In natural populations of rodents, males are more likely to engage in aggression and be infected with hantaviruses than females. Whether the relationship between hantavirus infection and aggression is due to host- or parasite-mediated mechanisms is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether hantavirus infection causes an increase in aggression in male rats and whether these behavioural changes are due to infection of the central nervous system or peripheral tissues. Male laboratory rats were infected with Seoul virus and tested for aggression in a resident-intruder paradigm 15 and 30 days postinoculation (p.i.). Males tested 30 days p.i. (i.e. during the persistent phase of infection) spent more lime engaged in aggression than either uninfected males or males tested during the acute phase of infection (i.e. 15 days p.i.). Males that engaged in aggression for a longer duration had more virus present in lung, kidney and testis than males that spent less time engaged in aggression. Infected males shed virus in saliva, faeces, and urine; virus shedding, however, was not correlated with aggression and neither wounding nor transmission of virus to intruder males occurred during behavioural tests. Infection with Seoul virus did not alter either testosterone or corticosterone concentrations. Seoul virus antigens were not detected in the brains of infected rats. These data suggest that hantavirus infection leads to elevated aggression in, infected males and may be a by-product of increased virus replication in peripheral tissues.

ID AFRICAN CLAWED FROGS; BEHAVIOR; CALL
AB This study focuses on the role of male-male vocal communication in the reproductive repertoire of the South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Six male and two female call types were recorded from native ponds in the environs of Cape Town, South Africa. These include all call types previously recorded in the laboratory as well as one previously unidentified male call: chirping. The amount of calling and the number of call types increased as the breeding season progressed. Laboratory recordings indicated that all six male call types were directed to males; three of these were directed to both sexes and three were directed exclusively to males. Both female call types were directed exclusively to males. The predominant call type, in both field and laboratory recordings, was the male advertisement call. Sexual state affected male vocal behaviour. Male pairs in which at least one male was sexually active (gonadotropin injected) produced all call types, whereas pairs of uninjected males rarely called. Some call types were strongly associated with a specific behaviour and others were not. Clasped males always growled and clasping males typically produced amplectant calls or chirps; males not engaged in clasping most frequently advertised. The amount of advertising produced by one male was profoundly affected by the presence of another male. Pairing two sexually active males resulted in suppression of advertisement calling in one; suppression was released when males were isolated after pairing. Vocal dominance was achieved even in the absence of physical contact (clasping). We suggest that X. laevis males gain a reproductive advantage by competing for advertisement privileges and by vocally suppressing neighbouring males.

AB Self-grooming is a common behaviour among many species of ungulates, as it is among several other mammalian taxonomic groups. In goats, as in rodents and small felids, self-grooming appears to reflect an underlying endogenous timing mechanism, resulting in what has been referred to as programmed grooming. We tested the prediction from the programmed grooming model that newborn and young goats, Capra hircus, would groom more frequently than similarly maintained conspecific adults. This prediction was upheld in that goat kids, from 2 weeks of age, orally groomed and scratch-groomed significantly more frequently than adult females. When the body surface-to-mass ratio of young goats, which was initially about 230% that of adults, declined to about 150%, the difference in grooming rate of the young was no longer significantly elevated over that of adults recorded at the same time of year. We also tested the predictions that oral grooming in wool sheep, Ovis aries, is inherently programmed and will occur in adults after shearing and in lambs with undeveloped fleece at levels similar to those of ancestral hair sheep and lambs. When fully fleeced adult wool sheep were shorn, they engaged in grooming in a pattern and frequency not different from that of hair sheep with a pelage representative of ancestral sheep. Wool lambs also groomed at a rate similar to that of hair lambs. Therefore, the elevated rate of programmed grooming of newborn and young ungulates appears to reflect their developmental precociousness and consequent exposure, in nature, to ectoparasites.

TI Sexual coercion in a territorial salamander: females punish socially
   polygynous male partners

AB Sexual intimidation (sensu Smuts & Smuts 1993, Advances in the Study of Behavior, 22, 1-63) occurs when members of one sex aggressively 'punish' members of the other sex that refuse to mate with them or that merely associate with other individuals of the opposite sex. We examined Clutton-Brock & Parker's (1995, Animal Behaviour, 49, 1345-1365) concept that while males of many species use punishment (intimidation) to coerce females into social or even mating monogamy, such behaviour by females towards males should be rare. However, females in some species are territorial, and aggressive, and thus they may play an active role in sexual intimidation. We tested this proposition in laboratory experiments with territorial red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, that had been found as single (nonpaired) individuals and in male-female pairs (we term members of a pair 'partners') in the forest. We manipulated paired males such that they either had associated with another female before returning to their female partners (socially polygynous) or had not (socially monogamous). In addition, we manipulated single males such that they either had associated with another female before encountering a focal female for the first time (socially polygynous) or had not (socially naive). During the autumn courtship season, females were significantly more aggressive (threat displays and biting) towards socially polygynous partners relative to those that were socially monogamous. In addition, females spent significantly less time touching socially polygynous partners relative to socially monogamous partners. However, females that met a male for the first time did not differ significantly in their behaviour towards socially polygynous and naive males. During the late spring, females displayed no behavioural differences towards either male partners or strangers. Thus, female aggression was context dependent, with increased aggression directed only towards polygynous partners and only during the autumn. We infer that females attempt to control social polygyny by partners through aggression during the courtship season but that this coercion ceases in the spring when the females are preoccupied with searching for nest sites for brooding their eggs.

AB During courtship and mating, males of some invertebrate predators risk being killed and consumed by females, who in turn can obtain a foraging benefit from feeding on males. In these invertebrates, the sex ratio at the end of the mating season is usually female biased, probably due to sexual cannibalism and other sources of male mortality. Thus, at the end of the mating season males can be a limited resource to females as both mates and prey. Because of the high risk incurred when approaching females, males should show mate choice. To date there are little data on the costs and benefits of sexual cannibalism in natural populations. For one month we followed the mating patterns of 60 late-maturing Mediterranean tarantula, Lycosa tarentula L., females in a desert grassland population. The later a female matured, the shorter was her cohabitation time with males and the lower her probability of cohabiting with a male at all, suggesting that late-maturing females may be limited in their access to males as mates. At the end of the mating season, nonsexually cannibalistic late-maturing females also had poorer body conditions than did both sexually cannibalistic late-maturing females and early-maturing females, suggesting that late-maturing females may be also limited in their access to males as food. Females had higher mating success if they were smaller or in better condition (better fed). This pattern may reflect either male choice, or the possibility that small, well-fed females have higher mating success because they are less aggressive towards males.

AB In juvenile salmon and trout, there seems to be a positive phenotypic correlation between individual aggression level and growth rate. Aggressive fish are dominant, and they obtain and defend territories, giving them access to good feeding sites. Being aggressive may increase predation risk, and may also carry costs such as increased metabolic demand, with effects on growth. To test the hypothesis that there is a trade-off between individual growth rate and aggression, we mated 12 female coho salmon with two unique males each, creating 24 full-sibling families. Growth of individually marked fish from each family was estimated in a situation where food could not be monopolized. Thereafter, individual fish were tested for mirror-elicited agonistic behaviour. We found significant variation between families in early growth rate, with a high heritability (1.04). There was also significant between-family variation in agonistic behaviour, but activity was generally low and heritability was low (0.25) and not significant. Growth rate and agonistic behaviour were negatively correlated. These results imply that aggressive behaviour has an energetic cost.

AB The level of expression of secondary sexual characters has been suggested to signal male ability to resist parasitic infestations. To test this idea, several studies have examined the link between sexual signals and immunocompetence in birds. However, most of them have used only a single aspect of immune response to evaluate immunocompetence. We investigated the relation between bill colour and immunocompetence in captive male European blackbirds, Turdus merula, during the breeding season by assessing both cell-mediated and humoral components of the immune system. The blackbird is a sexually dimorphic species with bill colour varying from yellow to orange in males. Humoral immunity was assessed by measuring both primary and secondary responses to sheep red blood cell inoculation. Cell-mediated immunity was estimated with a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity response to an injection of a mitogen (phytohaemagglutinin). No relation was found between male bill colour and the primary humoral response. However, males with orange bills showed a lower secondary humoral response but a higher cell-mediated immune response than males with yellow bills. Thus, the relation between immunocompetence and a secondary sexual trait may differ markedly depending on which component of the immune system is under consideration. We discuss our results in relation to mechanisms involved in sexual selection. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Androgenic hormones occur naturally in bird egg yolk and are known to enhance growth in canary and gull chicks. Gil et al. (1999, Science, 286, 126-128) have recently proposed that female allocation of androgens to eggs represents a form of costly maternal investment. This hypothesis predicts that females of high quality or high reproductive potential should invest more yolk androgens in their eggs than females of low quality or low reproductive potential. We tested these predictions by examining interfemale variation in allocation of the androgenic steroids testosterone and androstenedione to eggs in a wild population of European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. We collected 30 full clutches of eggs and captured 22 of the females that laid these clutches for phenotypic measurements. In agreement with the hypothesis, we found that there was significant interfemale variation in yolk androgen concentrations. Furthermore, older females deposited more androstenedione and testosterone in eggs than 1-year-old females, and females laying early or large clutches deposited more testosterone in eggs than females laying late or small clutches. However, females in good body condition did not deposit more androgens in eggs than females in poor body condition. Large-yolked eggs had a higher total yolk androgen content than small-yolked eggs, but larger eggs did not have higher concentrations of yolk androgens. The results in general support the investment hypothesis of yolk androgen allocation. However, further data are needed regarding the costs of yolk androgen allocation and the effects of yolk androgens on offspring to substantiate the assumptions of the hypothesis.

AB Male courtship songs have two functions in species recognition and intraspecific mate choice. Female preference might thus exert different types of selection pressure on male song traits. We used a combination of acoustic mate choice experiments and statistical analyses to examine how traits of the calling songs of male nightingale grasshoppers, Chorthippus biguttulus, are influenced by different sexual selection pressures. We recorded calling songs of males and tested their attractiveness to females in acoustic mate choice experiments. The attractiveness values were a good estimate of the potential male mating success. In experiments with a pair of males, females copulated significantly more often with the male that had the higher attractiveness value. To detect directional, stabilizing, disruptive or correlative selection acting on male song properties we used linear and nonlinear regressions between male song traits and female response behaviour. Three signal traits were revealed to be under directional selection: song loudness, pause to syllable ratio and the mean duration of gaps within syllables. A nonlinear regression testing for correlative selection showed that a fourth song trait, rhythm, in combination with mean gap duration was also important for female mate choice. With these traits and trait combinations we were able to explain 42% of the variance in attractiveness between males. Since we found no evidence for stabilizing selection, but ample evidence for directional selection, we conclude that selection on the traits examined is related to mate choice mainly in the context of intraspecific sexual selection and probably less so in species recognition.

ID ORGAN DISCHARGE; BEHAVIOR; COMMUNICATION; SIGNALS; ODORS; MODULATIONS
AB Maintaining a stable social organization necessitates that animals recognize their own dominance status relative to the status of other group members. The weakly electric brown ghost knifefish emits a sexually dimorphic sinusoidal electric organ discharge (EOD) for electrolocation. Dominant males discharge at the highest and females at the lowest EOD frequencies (EODFs). Each individual is most sensitive to its own EODF, which can be modulated for communication. To examine how sensitivity and social status influence an individual's response to different cues, we recorded the electrical signals emitted by 10 males and seven females in response to playbacks of sine waves mimicking a wide range of con- and heterospecific EODFs. While all individuals emit small chirps (LoCs) mostly to stimuli around their own EODF, they are more likely to emit rises (gradual nonchirp signals) to frequencies to which they are less sensitive; males similarly emit larger chirps (HiCs) to frequencies more distant from their own, especially to female mimics. Males with 'dominant' EODFs are less likely to emit rises, stimuli in the female range elicit more rises from both sexes, and females emit rises to male EOD mimics. Although low-ranking male EOD mimics elicit more LoCs from all males, males with lower-ranking EODFs chirp less at high EOD mimics than males with high-ranking EODFs chirp at low EOD mimics. We conclude that (1) although much of the variation in an individual's response is attributable to its sensitivity, individuals recognize sexual and status cues and have some internal representation of their own social status, and (2) whereas LoCs appear to function in intrasexual aggression, HiCs and rises could be used in both courtship and submissive signalling.

AB We used 7 years of live-trapping data from an Illinois population of prairie voles to examine how survival and reproductive success varied with size and composition of social groups. Specifically, we examined measures of fitness for residents of single female units, male-female pairs and communal groups. Reproductive success, measured as either the number of young that survived to 12 or 30 days of age per adult female in a group, was higher for groups of three adults than for smaller or larger groups. The ideal group composition with respect to reproductive success appeared to be one adult female and two adult males. Individuals born into groups with three adults survived longer than did those born into smaller or larger groups. There was no clear relationship, however, between group size and survival of adult members of groups. Sudden disappearance of a group, presumably to predation by weasels, was associated with relative group size such that the largest groups were more likely to disappear. Overall, our data indicate that prairie voles living in communal groups with three adult members have higher fitness than those living in smaller groups or in larger communal groups.

AB Human females show a preference for the scent of symmetrical male bodies and appearance of masculine male faces only when conception is likely. These traits are thought to be signs of male quality. We examined whether females show an enhanced visual preference for another putative sign of mate quality, facial symmetry, when conception is likely. Twenty-nine females not taking oral contraceptives (nonpill users) rated the attractiveness of male faces varying in symmetry level (low, normal, high and perfect) for a short-term sexual partner at two phases of the menstrual cycle (low and high conception risk). They also rated the attractiveness of male faces for a long-term sexual partner and female faces for general attractiveness. We also tested a control group of 27 pill users. An overall preference for symmetry was found in all participants. However, the hypothesized enhanced cyclic preference for symmetrical male faces in nonpill users was not found. Nor was there an effect of relationship context. These results may be more consistent with a direct benefit or sensory bias model for preference evolution than with an indirect genetic benefit model.

AB High investment in mating and parental effort in male birds are considered mutually exclusive, as testosterone suppresses paternal care and stimulates sexual and aggressive behaviours' Superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus, are unusual in that males concurrently engage in courtship and paternal care. Fairy-wrens live as stable socially monogamous pairs with up to four subordinate male helpers. The majority of offspring are not sired by any of the males in the group but all group males provide parental care. Throughout the period of care males visit and court neighbouring females. To examine the role of testosterone in this trade-off, I determined the effect of testosterone treatment on the males' time budget, in particular their investment in within- and extrapair sexual behaviours and paternal care. Testosterone did not affect time spent foraging and resting or the number of songs produced. However, the relative investment in sexual and parental behaviours changed, confirming Proximate control of this trade-off by testosterone. While there was a large increase in within-pair courtship, which is always rare during the nestling period, testosterone had only a small effect on the most frequent sexual behaviour, extragroup courtship displays. Testosterone failed to induce the maximum frequency of courtship flights of which male fairy-wrens are capable-, and-l argue that this is because, at prevailing testosterone levels, males are always motivated to leave their territory and social circumstances largely dictate the actual departure rate.

AB We tested the hypothesis that Eurasian beavers, Castor fiber, display the dear enemy phenomenon; that is, they respond less aggressively to intrusions by their territorial neighbours than to intrusions by nonterritorial floaters (strangers). This,ability could be advantageous in facilitating differential treatment of wandering strangers versus established neighbours. Territorial beavers were presented with scent from neighbouring and stranger adult males. Thirty-nine different active beaver families, 18 in 1998 and 21 in 1999, were presented with a two-way choice between two pairs of experimental scent mounds; mounds with castoreum from a neighbour and a stranger, and mounds with anal gland secretion from a neighbour and a stranger. Direct observations of the families during evenings showed that: (1) beavers sniffed both castoreum and anal gland secretion from a stranger significantly longer than from a neighbour, and (2) beavers responded aggressively (stood on the mound on their hind feet, pawing and/or overmarking) significantly longer to castoreum, but not to anal gland secretion, from a stranger than from a neighbour. When experimental scent mounds were allowed to remain overnight and the beavers' responses were measured the following morning, the beavers' responses were significantly stronger to both castoreum and anal gland secretion from a stranger than from a neighbour. These findings indicate that Eurasian beavers can use scent to discriminate between neighbours and strangers, thereby supporting existence of the dear enemy phenomenon in this species.

   DISTANCE; STIMULI; VISION; PIGEON
AB Using video recordings of hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, as they approached different kinds of objects, I examined how change in object distance is associated with a change from lateral to binocular viewing. The birds tended to view distant objects laterally while they preferentially viewed objects less than 20-30 cm away frontally; this was true whether they were looking at another bird or at an inanimate object. However, as well as switching between lateral and frontal viewing, the hens also swung their heads from side to side with movements so large that the same object appeared to be viewed with completely different parts of the retina, and even with different eyes, in rapid succession. When confronted with a novel object, the hens walked more slowly but continued to show large head movements. This suggests that, unlike mammals, which gaze fixedly at novel objects, hens investigate them by moving the head and looking at them with different, specialized, parts of their eyes. Many aspects of bird behaviour, such as search image formation, vigilance and visual discriminations, may be affected by the way they move the head and eyes.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID SIZE VARIATION; EGG MASS; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; MATE CHOICE;
   CONSEQUENCES; GROWTH; HOSTS
AB Nest size or nest-building activity has recently been hypothesized to be a postmating sexually selected signal in monogamous birds: females may assess a male's parental quality and willingness to invest in reproduction by his participation in nest building. Females may thus adjust their reproductive effort (i.e. clutch size) not only to their own abilities but also to those of their mates. We investigated whether female magpies, Pica pica, use nest-building activity rather than nest size to adjust their reproductive effort during replacement breeding attempts. After we removed their first clutch, high-quality pairs that built a large nest for the first clutch were more capable of building a replacement nest and females adjusted their clutch size in relation to the time it took to build the nest rather than nest size. We also found support for the hypothesized trade-off between clutch size and egg size in magpies. In replacement clutches females decreased clutch size and increased egg volume, thereby probably improving the survival probability of their offspring in less favourable conditions.

AB Numerous studies have documented that honeybee colonies can rapidly adjust the number of foragers collecting pollen in response to changes in quantities of brood, pollen and nectar in the nest. However, few studies have examined the behaviour of individual pollen foragers while in the nest between trips. Thus, little is known about how a pollen forager actually assesses its colony's needs. To understand this process better, we observed the behaviour of 319 pollen foragers while in their nests between foraging trips. We observed foragers in two types of nest environments: one with a relatively high need for pollen and one with a relatively low need for pollen. Foragers performed as many as 14 activities during two phases demarcated by the unloading of pollen loads. They inspected empty cells and cells with pollen, and performed the waggle dance at higher relative frequencies before unloading (Pless than or equal to0.0004 each act). They antennated nestmates, autogroomed and received trophallaxis at higher relative frequencies after unloading (Pless than or equal to0.0004 each act). All acts were performed both before and after unloading, but not always by each bee. Pollen foragers discriminated among cells based on cell contents in two contexts. First, they inspected cells already containing pollen more often than expected by chance. Second, their pattern of inspecting cells with different contents differed from their pattern of unloading pollen loads in those cells. Pollen foragers performed 42.3+/-4.6% (least square mean +/-SE) of preunloading inspection events on empty cells, but unloaded in them only 19.9+/-4.6% of the time. They performed 42.2+/-4.6% of preunloading inspection events on cells already containing pollen, but unloaded in them 79.4+/-4.6% of the time (P<0.0001). Our data show that pollen foragers can determine the contents of cells in the nest and suggest that the regulation of pollen collection involves direct assessment of colony need by pollen foragers.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID HERON-ISLAND; EVOLUTION; PUNISHMENT
AB How can cooperation persist if, for one partner, cheating is more profitable than cooperation in each round, while the other partner has no option to cheat? Our laboratory experiments suggest that such a situation exists between the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus and its nonpredatory client reef fish species, which actively seek cleaners to have their ectoparasites removed. Clients Ctenochaetus striatus regularly jolted in response to cleaner mouth contact, and these jolts were not linked to the removal of parasites. In addition, cleaners did not search for parasites but fed on mucus when exposed to anaesthetized clients, which could not control the cleaners' behaviour. Field data showed that clients often terminated an interaction immediately after a jolt. Client species with access to only one cleaning station, owing to their small territories or home ranges, terminated interactions mainly by chasing cleaners while clients with access to two or more cleaning stations mainly swam away. Thus, the chasing of cleaners appeared to be a form of punishment, imposing costs on the cleaner at the client's (momentary) expense. Chasing yields future benefits, as jolts were on average less frequent during interactions between cleaners and individuals that had terminated their previous interaction by aggressive chasing. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Reef fish that actively visit cleaner fish to have parasites and dead or infected tissue removed face two potential problems: they might have to wait while cleaners inspect other clients, and cleaners might feed on healthy body tissue, a behaviour that is referred to as cheating. Individuals of some 'client' species have large home ranges, which cover several cleaning stations, while others have small territories or home ranges with access to only one cleaning station. The former can thus choose between cleaners, while the latter cannot. We investigated whether clients with large home ranges change cleaning partners to outplay cleaners against each other to achieve (1) priority of access over clients with no choice at cleaning stations and (2) control over cheating by cleaners. We followed individuals of longnosed parrotfish, Hipposcarus harid, for up to 120 min in their natural environment and noted their interactions with cleaner wrasses, Labroides dimidiatus. Individuals were likely to return to the same cleaning station if the previous interaction had ended without conflict but changed cleaners for the next inspection if they had been either cheated or ignored, at least if the time between two consecutive visits was short. The overall attractiveness of a cleaning station seemed to be largely independent of service quality, which appeared to be similar at all stations. This is the first empirical evidence that the option to change partners is used as a control mechanism to stabilize cooperative behaviour. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The Mexican colonial web-building spider Metepeira incrassata is frequently attacked by predatory wasps from a number of families. Previous studies have shown that wasps often attack more than one spider during a 'run' on a colony, but capture success declines as colony size increases, and that spiders in the central core of the colony have lower risk (Rayor & Uetz 1990, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 27, 77-85; Uetz & Hieber 1994, Behavioral Ecology, 5, 326-333). We used data from direct observation of attacks and field experiments to test the hypothesis that colonial web-building spiders benefit from 'early warning' of predator approach through vibrations in the colony web. Analysis of 135 naturally occurring wasp attack 'runs' (attacks on 454 spiders) showed that the per-attack run and per-spider capture success of wasps decreased significantly with increased spider colony size. Spider defensive and evasive behaviours observed in a subset of these attacks varied with the attack sequence. Evasive responses by spiders were more frequent later in the attack, suggesting advance warning of predator approach. Experiments using a predator-simulating vibration source demonstrated that mean reaction distance of spiders increased with increasing colony size. Adult female spiders in core positions reacted at greater distances than those on the periphery, but immature spiders, whose capture risk is lower, showed no difference. Behaviour of spiders during simulated attacks was similar to observed encounters with wasps: evasive responses were more frequent and response latency was shorter in spiders attacked later in the sequence, and in many cases, spiders took evasive action prior to any contact with the stimulus. Additional experiments testing isolated cues (web contact, airborne vibration, web-borne vibration) suggest spiders respond to web-borne vibrations generated by predators and evasive behaviours of other spiders. Together, these results support the 'early warning' hypothesis of antipredator benefits for colonial web-building spiders. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many groups of fish male colour patterns reflect in the ultraviolet, but little is known about female preferences for these components of male ornaments. We studied UV-reflective colour patterns in male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, and their importance in female choice. Using photographs taken with a filter transmitting only short wavelengths, we found that 4-24% of the area of a male's colour pattern reflects in the UV. We measured female visual responses to paired males placed, alternately, behind UV-blocking and UV-transmitting Plexiglas partitions. When pairs were matched for carotenoid (red), structural (white) and UV-reflective colour patterns, females spent significantly greater amounts of time inspecting a male when he was behind the UV-transmitting partition. These results show that UV-reflective components of male colour patterns enhance their attractiveness to females. To determine whether level of predation affects female response to UV-reflective colour patterns, we tested females from two populations differing in predation pressure. Females from both populations preferred males viewed through the UV-transmitting partition. When females were presented with male pairs that differed in the area of UV reflectance but were matched for carotenoids and structural pigments, difference in the time spent with the males was positively correlated with difference in the area of UV reflectance. Our results indicate that UV-reflective colour patterns enhance male attractiveness to females and thus may be elaborated through sexual selection.

AB Self-grooming in response to the odours of an opposite-sex conspecific may reflect sexual motivation on the part of the actor. We tested the hypothesis that meadow votes, Microtus pennsylvanicus, and prairie votes, M. ochrogaster, both self-groom at different rates when exposed to the odours of their siblings as compared to those of nonsiblings. This prediction was studied under the context of social memory for siblings and the effects of isolation on memory for siblings. The hypothesis explains the self-grooming responses of meadow votes isolated from their siblings for 10 days and of prairie votes isolated from their siblings for 20 days. However, 20 days of isolation for male and female meadow votes, and 30 days of isolation for male prairie votes were sufficient to induce these animals to self-groom at a similar rate to both sibling and nonsibling odours, suggesting that after isolation these animals no longer recognized their opposite-sex siblings. Female prairie votes isolated for 30 days self-groomed more in response to the odours of male nonsiblings than to those of male siblings, suggesting that female prairie votes still recognize their male siblings after isolation. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence that, in the context of sibling recognition, self-grooming behaviour is directed at unfamiliar opposite-sex conspecifics, and that the communicative function of self-grooming (sexual motivation) is associated with social memory for siblings. Differences in the self-grooming behaviour of meadow votes and prairie votes may be associated with several aspects of their life history characteristics.

AB Sexual selection theory predicts that the relative importance of dominance between males for access to females depends on the potential to monopolize oestrous females. We examined the relationship between male dominance, mating behaviour and reproductive success in a promiscuous, nocturnal primate species, the grey mouse lemur, in captivity, to test the predictions derived for different competitive regimes between males. We also investigated the relationship between male age, relatedness between mates and reproductive success. Dominance could be established in the majority of the study groups and dominant males mated more frequently than subdominant males. Dominant males, however, fathered only half of the infants born in the study groups, although in principle the captive conditions allowed males to monopolize mates. Multiple mating was observed or deduced from the paternity data in the majority of groups. For the first time in primates we detected one definite case of multiple paternity. Younger males sired more than half of the offspring. We conclude that contest competition between males is unlikely to be the primary factor predicting the reproductive outcome whereas female choice and sperm competition are likely to be effective in this seasonal breeder.

TI Song type matching as threat: a test using interactive playback
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID TIT PARUS-MAJOR; DEAR ENEMIES; NEIGHBORS; SPARROWS; RECOGNITION
AB Neighbouring song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, in our Seattle population share song types and sometimes respond to neighbour song by type matching (replying with the same song type being sung) or repertoire matching (replying with a shared song other than the type being sung). Based on our modification of the threat hypothesis of Krebs et al. (1981, Animal Behaviour, 29, 918-923), according to which, type matching is a threat, we develop two predictions concerning type matching. (1) A bird will be more likely to escalate when type matched by his neighbour than when repertoire matched. (2) When type matched, birds who escalate will continue to sing the matched song type, while those who de-escalate will switch off the matched type or stop singing. To test these predictions we conducted an interactive playback experiment that simulated a bird in an adjoining territory issuing a song reply to a singing subject. We exposed subjects to three song playback conditions, each on a different day: a type match, a repertoire match and an unshared stranger song (to provide an estimate of each subjects maximum response for comparison with their responses to type matching). Subjects responded consistently and most aggressively to stranger song. Subjects responded more aggressively to type-matching playback than to repertoire-matching playback, supporting our first prediction. In type-matching trials, subjects did not always respond aggressively, and those who stayed on the same song type throughout the trial responded more aggressively than those who switched to a different song, supporting the second prediction.

   CHEMOSENSORY RECOGNITION; TRICHURIS-MURIS; HOUSE MICE; GENES; MOUSE
AB Previous experiments have shown that some strains of mice prefer mates with a major histocompatibilty complex (MHC) that differs from their own, and urine has been suggested as the olfactory signal used for discrimination. Similarly, it has been proposed that females use MHC-associated cues to choose female nesting partners. The objective of the present study was to clarify the role of urinary odours in recognition of MHC-similar and -dissimilar mice by testing odour preferences of female mice. We used B10 (H-2(b)) and B10.Q (H-2(q)) mice that differ only at the MHC loci. Our hypothesis that female mice would spend more time exploring the urinary odours of MHC-similar females, a mechanism thought to account for communal nesting patterns, was not supported; both strains explored MHC-similar and -dissimilar urinary odours equally. Our hypothesis that females would prefer the urinary odours of MHC-disparate males, as an indication of mate choice, was also not supported; neither B10 nor B10.Q females showed a significant preference for the MHC-dissimilar odour. Finally, we determined whether infection with the intestinal nematode, Heligmosomoides polgyrus, would alter urinary odour preferences. Our supposition that females would prefer the urinary odours of uninfected males, regardless of MHC strain, was supported; both B10 and B10.Q females demonstrated a significant preference for B10 uninfected male urine. Our results suggest that chemical communication through urine may not play as dominant a role in selection of nesting partners and mates as previously thought, but that it may be very important in conveying infection status.

   POLYANDRY; EVOLUTION; MATE; DROSOPHILA; FERTILITY; SELECTION
AB The 'trading-up' hypothesis for polyandry, which posits that females copulate with additional males as a means of improving on the quality of their first mating partner, has been proposed as a general explanation for mixed paternity in socially monogamous birds. As a corollary of this hypothesis, abnormally low reproductive output with a first partner should act as a strong stimulus for females to accept sperm from a new male. To test this prediction in a naturally polyandrous, sperm-storing, viviparous species, we restricted female Cordylochernes scorpioides pseudoscorpions to mating with a single male and then gave them the opportunity to remate with a different male after their first brood of embryos either aborted spontaneously, was experimentally removed, or was successfully carried to term. With complete brood failure presumably providing the strongest possible cue to females of a poor-quality first mate, the trading-up hypothesis would predict that females that aborted their first brood should have been significantly more sexually receptive than females that had produced a successful first brood. Instead, they were significantly less receptive. Furthermore, none of the sexually unreceptive, spontaneously aborting females produced a successful second brood, indicating that C. scorpioides females that copulate with a single male may become locked into cycles of brood failure followed by sexual unreceptivity. Our findings suggest that the negative impact of abortion on female sexual receptivity may place physiological constraints on the ability of viviparous females to use polyandry as a facultative mating strategy for improving on a bad first mate.

AB Much debate surrounds the relationship between male parental care and paternity. We quantified parental care of yearling (second year: SY) and older (after second year: ASY) male black-throated blue warblers and determined parentage with microsatellites over four breeding seasons. ASY males that had sired all young in their broods fed 7-day-old nestlings at higher rates than ASY males that sired only some of the young in their broods. This relationship was not present in yearling males. A negative relationship between level of paternity and paternal care may arise if males facultatively adjust their care in response to cues of paternity, if poor-quality males are both more likely to be cuckolded and less able to provide parental care, or if males reduce both mate guarding and parental care to pursue extrapair matings. Parental care given by ASY males was not associated with additional mating opportunities during the nestling period. Thus, pursuit of extra matings is unlikely to account for the association between paternity and parental care. ASY males in better condition had higher levels of paternity, but did not guard their mates more closely nor feed their young at higher rates. These results suggest that ASY males may be able to assess their paternity, possibly by using cues related to levels of local synchrony during their females' fertile periods, and adjust their care accordingly. Paternity obtained by SY males was not associated with local synchrony, however, suggesting that the apparent lack of a facultative response by males of this age class may be due to a lack of reliable cues to paternity.

AB Central place foraging in ants is expected to maximize colony efficiency by minimizing the lengths of established trails. Short trails reduce both the time and energy costs of delivering food back to the nest, but which is most important? To examine trail route choice in the wood ant Formica rufa, we used a series of bridges, each with two alternative routes allowing the comparison of combinations of horizontal, vertical or time-expensive detours of differing lengths or delays. The ants preferred the shortest, quickest routes in all cases, although when vertical and horizontal deviations were equal in length they preferred the former, probably because this represents a reduced risk in terms of navigation errors. When comparing a range of bridge combinations, we were able to separate the relative differences in time versus energy saving represented within a series of successive choices. Contrary to earlier evidence, savings in energy explained significantly more of the variation in ant trail preferences than savings in time. We suggest that our results can be explained by wood ants adaptively adjusting their speed when walking in the vertical plane in response to the additional potential energy costs encountered.

AB We used an open-field analogue of the eight-arm radial maze to investigate the role of memory during foraging by rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus. In experiment 1 we attempted to determine whether birds were able to differentiate between flowers of the same type that they had emptied, flowers they had seen but not visited and new flowers. They were tested with three trial types, all of which involved birds visiting four rewarded flowers in the first phase of a trial. In 'free' trials, the bird was allowed to choose four from eight flowers. In 'forced' trials there were only four flowers available in phase 1 and in 'mixed' trials the bird could choose four from six available flowers. In all trial types eight flowers (including all those in the same locations as in phase 1) were presented to the bird on its return in phase 2. The four rewarded flowers were those not visited in phase 1. In free and mixed trials, birds were better than chance at avoiding the flowers they had emptied in phase 1. In mixed trials, birds were more likely to visit the new flowers that were unique to phase 2. In experiment 2 we tested whether flower height was a floral feature remembered by birds. Birds were given forced and free trials in which the flowers in the radial maze were presented at two heights. As performance in both trial types was better than chance we suggest that hummingbirds use flower height to remember the locations of flowers.

AB In vertebrate societies where young are reared communally, nonbreeding helpers are usually closely related to young but often vary widely in their contributions to feeding them. Evolutionary explanations of helping behaviour have focused on whether differences in the level of contributions between helpers are related to variation in kinship. We investigated the contribution of helpers in meerkats, Suricata suricatta. The helpers varied widely in the number of food items they gave to pups and individual differences were related to variation in foraging success as well as to sex and age. When we controlled the influence of these variables, the level of contributions that helpers made to rearing pups was not significantly correlated with variation in kinship to the litters they were rearing.

AB Although kinship discrimination and nepotism have been extensively investigated in honeybees, Apis mellifera L., the significance of kin discrimination among worker bees is still unclear. One of the behavioural contexts in which nepotistic behaviour of worker bees has been described is the dance communication system: bees were reported to have a strong tendency to dance with their supersisters in colonies consisting of only two subfamilies. Using molecular markers, we reinvestigated this apparent case of nepotism. We found no evidence for subfamily discrimination among dancers and their followers in a colony consisting of only two subfamilies or in a colony consisting of 17 subfamilies.

AB lSeveral species of damselflies, dragonflies and butterflies are characterized by a female-limited polymorphism in which one type of female, the andromorph, looks and behaves like males whereas the other type of female, the gynomorph, looks and behaves differently. Sexual conflict has been hypothesized to play a role in the maintenance of this polymorphism in that andromorphs may have an advantage over gynomorphs by avoiding costly sexual interactions through male mimicry. We tested for costs of sexual interactions to female Ischnura ramburi damselflies by comparing the success of singly mated females maintained with no males to the success of females maintained continuously with males at a 3:1 (male to female) operational sex ratio (OSR) and a 1:1 OSR. Our findings suggest that sexual interactions affect the two morphs differently. The time spent feeding, number of eggs laid and egg-laying rate of andromorphs were lower in the 3:1 OSR treatment than in the treatment with no males. Time spent feeding and number and rate of eggs laid by gynomorphs did not differ among treatments. Sexual conflict may be occurring between males and mated andromorphs because sexual interactions are associated with net costs to mated andromorphs whereas sexual interactions with mated andromorphs are beneficial to males because there is high last-male sperm precedence. Based on this experiment, andromorphs cannot be said to have an advantage over gynomorphs by avoiding costly sexual interactions because sexual interactions were not associated with net costs to gynomorphs.

AB Several studies and reviews have suggested that the ability to discriminate between neighbours and strangers decreases as neighbour song repertoire size and song type sharing increase. We tested the recognition capabilities of territorial. male banded wrens by comparing the aggressive approach responses of focal birds to three playback treatments: shared song types sung by an adjacent neighbour (neighbour song), shared song types sung by unfamiliar birds (mimic song), and unshared song types sung by unfamiliar birds (unfamiliar song). All three treatments for each male were broadcast from the same location on the territorial boundary shared with the appropriate neighbour. As expected, focal males responded non-aggressively to the neighbour treatment and aggressively to the unfamiliar song treatment. The approach response to the mimic treatment was statistically indistinguishable from the unfamiliar treatment and significantly higher than the neighbour treatment, suggesting that most males were able to recognize unfamiliar singers even when the song types played were very similar to those of their neighbours. The relative strength of responses to the mimic varied: some males treated the mimic song with low aggression levels typical of responses to neighbour song. Repertoire sizes of focal and neighbour birds, the fraction of song types shared among neighbouring males, and the similarity of neighbour and mimic song types did not explain this variation. Therefore, within the short 3-min period of our playback experiments, some birds may have used repertoire composition as a recognition cue and confused the mimic with the neighbour.

AB Unpaired or satellite male horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus, are attracted to and often form a group around a pair (a female with an attached male) that is nesting in the high intertidal zone. These males are engaged in sperm competition. We observed nesting pairs and their associated satellites in the wild, collected and reared their eggs and used genetic markers to examine paternity. We found that the unpaired, satellite males are highly successful at fertilizing eggs; two satellites can leave the attached male with few fertilizations. Two satellites together are each as successful as one spawning with a pair. A satellite's location around the female greatly affects his success, and males compete for access to a position over the dorsal canal between the prosoma and opisthosoma of the female and under the front margin of the paired male where they are most likely to fertilize eggs. Although eggs and sperm retain their viability for some time after spawning, nearly all eggs are fertilized by the satellites that are around the nesting pair at the time of egg laying and by the attached male. A number of factors including beach current, female size and male behaviour affect the outcome of sperm competition in this externally fertilizing species.

AB Migratory birds use celestial and geomagnetic directional information to orient on their way between breeding and wintering areas. Cue-conflict experiments involving these two orientation cue systems have shown that directional information can be transferred from one system to the other by calibration. We designed experiments with four species of North American songbirds to: (1) examine whether these species calibrate orientation information from one system to the other; and (2) determine whether there are species-specific differences in calibration. Migratory orientation was recorded with two different techniques, cage tests and free-flight release rests, during autumn migration. Cage tests at dusk in the local geomagnetic field revealed species-specific differences: red-eyed vireo, Vireo olivaceus, and northern waterthrush, Seiurus noveboracensis, selected seasonally appropriate southerly directions whereas indigo bunting, Passerina cyanea, and grey catbird, Dumetella carolinensis, oriented towards the sunset direction. When tested in deflected magnetic fields, vireos and waterthrushes responded by shifting their orientation according to the deflection of the magnetic field, but buntings and catbirds failed to show any response to the treatment. In release tests, all four species showed that they had recalibrated their star compass on the basis of the magnetic field they had just experienced in the cage tests. Since release tests were done in the local geomagnetic field it seems clear that once the migratory direction is determined, most likely during the twilight period, the birds use their recalibrated star compass for orientation at departure.

ID BEES; PROFITABILITY; FORAGERS
AB Forager bees arriving at the hive after visiting a nectar source, unload the collected liquid food to recipient hivemates through mouth-to-mouth contact (trophallaxis). We analysed whether the main characteristics that define nectar in energetic terms, that is, rate of production (flow of solution), sucrose concentration and rate of sucrose production (sucrose flow) influence trophallactic behaviour. Individual bees trained to feed at a regulated-flow feeder offering sucrose solution were captured once the foraging visit was complete and placed in an acrylic arena with a recipient bee that had not been fed. The rate at which liquid was transferred during the subsequent trophallactic contact (transfer rate) was analysed as a function of the different solution flows and sucrose concentrations offered at the feeder. A relationship was found between transfer rate during trophallaxis and the flow of solution previously presented at the feeder. This relationship was Independent of sucrose concentration when above a certain threshold value (ca. 22% weight on weight). We also analysed whether the rate of sucrose deliverance of the food source (sucrose flow) influenced the rate at which the solution was transferred. No clear relationship was found between the rate of sucrose deliverance during trophallactic events (sucrose transfer rate) and the sucrose flow presented at the feeder. The possibility that trophallaxis could be a communication channel through which quantitative information on food source profitability is transmitted among hivemates is discussed.

AB The swimming behaviour of adult Daphnia largely governs their depth, which has a direct effect on both individual foraging success and predation avoidance. We treated individual swimming behaviour as a threshold character and used directional changes in average clonal depth within experimental tubes as a test for character plasticity. We compared the swimming behaviours of two cohabiting, phenotypically similar Daphnia (Daphnia galeata and Daphnia galeata-Daphnia rosea hybrid) to determine (1) whether there is inherited variation (H-2) for different traits (responses to hunger and predator cues); (2) whether changes in genetic parameters (norm of reaction and character state) across four environments could be simulated by combinations of the presence or absence of a predator cue and high or low hunger levels; and (3) whether these Daphnia would respond to directional selection, particularly in a trade-off environment thigh hunger and predator cue treatments). Responses of both D. galeata and the D. galeata- rosea hybrid to hunger and a predator cue and the trade-off environment were plastic. Daphnia galeata expressed significant genetic variation within (H-2) and between environments (heritability of plasticity): Both the character state and norm of reaction estimates of heritable variation in the hybrid were close to zero. Genetic correlations were positive and stable across six environmental pairs in Daphnia galeata. Most hybrid genetic correlations were not significant. The phenotypic distributions of both D. galeata and the hybrid were bimodal in the trade-off environment. The D. galeata distribution was partly due to between-clone variation and the hybrid distribution was almost entirely due to within-clone variation. Genetic variation expressed by D. galeata in the trade-off environment appears to depend on both clone by environment interactions and stable inherited differences. These results indicate that while plastic phenotypic responses cause a similar opportunity for selection in D. galeata and the hybrid, their responses to selection would be different in;the trade-off and in related environments.

AB When fitness decreases with increasing density in a habitat, dispersal behaviour is expected to evolve. To avoid competition between kin, dispersal behaviour based on kin recognition should be more likely to occur when the individuals in a habitat are closely related. I tested this prediction with first-instar larvae (crawlers) of the mango shield scale, Milviscutulus mangiferae. The body size of adult females, a measure of fecundity, was larger when only one female was present on a leaf than when two were present. When I placed two crawlers on a leaf, they emigrated more frequently when they were siblings than when they were not related. I discuss the implication of the results for kin recognition in thelytokous parthenogenetic animals. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examined the function of secondary sexual characters in the role-reversed, lekking behaviour of female long-tailed dance flies, Rhamphomyia longicauda Loew (Empididae), to test the hypothesis that the degree of abdominal distention is an honest female signal about the state of egg development. Female Rhamphomyia cannot hunt for prey and they receive all of their protein from males by exchanging copulations for nuptial prey gifts. Females compete for male gifts within leks that are organized for a brief period each evening before dark. Before hovering within leks, females swallow air, inflating expandable pouches on the pleural margins of the abdomen. The result is a large saucer-like abdomen which is further exaggerated by wrapping scaled pro-, meso- and metathoracic legs along its pleural margins. Male preference for an enlarged abdomen was confirmed by suspending plastic models of varying size from monofilament lines and recording which models attracted the most males. There was a positive relationship between egg development and abdominal distention in a related species; R.sociabilis (Williston), which lacks inflatable abdominal pouches. Multiple regression showed that in R. longicauda, abdominal inflation completely masks the state of egg development. We conclude that female, longicauda deceive mate-seeking males with the unreliable message that eggs are nearing maturation in order to obtain a protein meal in exchange for copulation. Males that fail to identify a female bearing mature eggs risk near-certain cuckoldry and an increased probability that the female will die before oviposition.

AB The search tactics that females might employ to find a suitable mate impose different cognitive demands on searchers and some theoretical models of search behaviour presuppose that females are able to recall encountered males and return to mate with a previously sampled individual. In this study, I exposed female field crickets, Gryllus integer, to male calls either sequentially or simultaneously from two speakers in a three-arm radial maze. Subjects that were exposed to the two calls in sequence and allowed to move to the location of each call returned, in the absence of any audible signal, to the location of the call initially encountered. Subjects allowed to walk to the location of only one of two simultaneously active speakers before playback of both calls was terminated were as likely to move, in the absence of any audible signal, to the never-active speaker as to the location of the other male call. These subjects were also more likely to search all three arms of the maze and searched for a longer time than females exposed to calls sequentially. Thus, female G. integer probably do not construct a spatial representation of the locations of potential mates from the calls of males that advertise concurrently. The results of this study suggest, however, that female G. integer are able to recall previously encountered males under some conditions and may potentially employ a search tactic that is more complicated than a simple instantaneous comparison of the qualities of males that are actively calling.

AB We describe a series of playback experiments designed to test whether free-ranging baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, recognize the calls of other group members and also associate signallers with their close genetic relatives. Pairs of unrelated females were played sequences of calls that mimicked a fight between their relatives. As controls, the same females heard sequences that involved either (1) only the more dominant female's relative or (2) neither of the females' relatives. When call sequences involved their relatives, subjects looked towards the speaker for a longer duration than when the sequences involved nonkin. When the sequences involved the other female's relative, they also looked towards that female. Subjects did not look towards one another when call sequences involved nonkin. Dominant subjects were more likely to supplant their subordinate partners following playbacks of sequences that mimicked a dispute between their relatives than following the two control trials. In contrast, both subjects were more likely to approach one another and to interact in a friendly manner following the two control trials than following the test trial. Results indicate that female baboons recognize the screams and threat grunts not only of their own close relatives but also of unrelated individuals. They also replicate previous studies in suggesting that female monkeys recognize the close associates of other individuals and adjust their interactions with others according to recent events involving individuals other than themselves.

AB The mating system of seaweed flies is characterized by scramble competition and a premating:struggle during which females vigorously attempt to remove mounted males and prevent copulation: Here we investigate factors affecting the willingness of males to mate in five species of Coelopa: C. frigida, C. nebularum, C. ursina, C. pilipes and C. vanduzeei. The data from 2000 individual observations of pairs of flies revealed no association between female size and the willingness of males to mate, suggesting that males do not exhibit mate choice for larger, more fecund females. Male willingness to mount was associated with male size in C. frigida, C. nebularum and:C;ursina, although not in C. pilipes and C. vanduzeei. There is considerable intraspecific variation in;male size in the former three species, including the presence of two almost discrete size classes within C, nebularum. We suggest that males of different sizes in these species may be adopting alternative reproductive strategies. Large males may benefit from increased longevity and their ability to withstand female rejection responses, whereas small males are more active and thus likely to encounter and mount more females. In addition small males develop faster and thus gain earlier access to females. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB We adapted a technique to explore the social transmission of spatial information in homing pigeons, Columba livia. Five demonstrator pigeons were first trained to find a food goal within an indoor arena. This arena consisted of nine lidded cups laid out within a 12 x 12 grid on the floor. The task was to find the goal cup and flip the lid to obtain the food hidden within. Once the demonstrators had reached criterion the experiment proper began. During stage 1 of the experiment, 10 target birds, which had not previously been trained to find the goal, were introduced to the spatial task either in isolation or paired with a demonstrator. We measured how long they took to complete the task, the number of squares crossed on the grid, and the number of incorrect lids flipped. In stage 2, the target birds were introduced to the arena a second time, by themselves, and we compared the performance of the birds in the two treatments. The pigeons that had been introduced to the task with a demonstrator in stage 1 walked further and made more incorrect choices when searching for the food goal in stage 2 than the pigeons that were introduced to the task alone. This indicates that pigeons learn a spatial, food-finding task more effectively when performing the task alone than when accompanied by a knowledgeable conspecific. We discuss possible reasons for this in the light of previous experiments. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We tested the hypothesis that the proximate cue for egg dumping in the lace bug Gargaphia solani Heidemann is a chemical deposited by females on eggs during or shortly after oviposition. The results of this study show that: (1) dumping frequency declines as eggs age but can be elevated to its highest levels by exposure to chemical extracts from young egg masses; and (2) visual cues are not necessary to stimulate dumping. Further data support the hypothesis that the ovipositional chemical is used by egg dumpers as a long-distance signal of an appropriate oviposition site, and is not a mechanism by which guarding females relocate their eggs if separated from them.

ID FEMALE MATE CHOICE; HIRUNDO-RUSTICA; BLACK WHEATEAR; OENANTHE LEUCURA;
   PENDULINE TITS; CLUTCH SIZE; BIRDS; PASSERINE; DISPLAY
AB Females may use male nest building to assess male parental quality, and nest size would then be a sexually selected trait. In the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, females select their partner by his tail length, a character believed to signal good genes. Both sexes participate in nest building, although male participation is negatively related to his attractiveness as reflected by tail length. We tested the hypothesis that nest building is a sexually selected trait: females paired with males of high parental quality (as shown by the male during nest building) may obtain a mate providing large amounts of parental investment, while, as has been shown previously, females mated to attractive (long-tailed) males will acquire mates with good genetic quality. Therefore, since nest building in barn swallows occurs after mating, we predicted a postmating sexual selection process by which the female invests differentially in reproduction depending on the male's nest-building effort (reflecting his willingness to invest in reproduction). The volume of material in a nest was related to the male's contribution to nest building and, in agreement with our hypothesis, in a multiple regression analysis, male tail length and nest material volume were negatively related to laying date and positively to female investment in reproduction (total number of eggs laid during the breeding season). Moreover, females paired with long-tailed males (which contribute very little to nest building), but using the same amount of nest material as females paired with short-tailed males, reduced the thickness of the nest and hence increased its capacity. Therefore, in the barn swallow two different traits appear to be sexually selected: tail length of males owing to the good genes process and nest-building ability owing to the good parent process.

AB Optimal foraging theory predicts that an individual should resort to intraspecific kleptoparasitism when this foraging strategy helps to maximize its intake rate. Thus aggressor and victim should be foraging at lower and higher rates, respectively, than the flock average (intake rate maximization). Independent of the maximization principle, moreover, an aggressor should attack when its intake rate falls below a threshold critical for survival, and select a victim foraging at an intake rate high enough to ensure survival (starvation risk minimization). We tested both hypotheses using 324 aggressive displacements from feeding sites observed in flocks of common cranes, Gills grus, foraging on cereal fields. Aggressors attacked cranes feeding at higher rates than average birds. The immediate consequences of a successful attack were an increase in intake rate for the aggressor and a decrease for the victim. The intake rate of the aggressor prior to the attack was lower than both the mean intake rate of the flock and the minimum intake rate necessary to cover basic metabolic needs. After displacing its victim, the intake rate of the aggressor was higher than before the attack and also higher than the average intake rate of the flock. The intake rate of the aggressor after the attack was not higher than the mean intake rate of the flock, however, when the time spent on the attack was included. We conclude that cranes used a kleptoparasitic strategy to recover from temporary reductions in feeding rate. This was particularly the case below the threshold of intake necessary for survival.

AB The adaptive significance of repeated withinpair copulations is not well understood. We analysed the copulatory behaviour of 16 pairs of solitary-nesting American kestrels, Falco sparverius, in southern Quebec (Canada), and the achieved reproductive success (paternity) of 21 kestrel families determined by DNA fingerprinting, in terms of four hypotheses. (1) The paternity assurance hypothesis, which suggests that males copulate frequently to avoid being cuckolded, was rejected because there were few extrapair copulation attempts (<1% of all copulations observed), withinpair copulations were not timed during the fertile period and mate attendance did not increase as the fertile period approached, (2) The immediate material benefits hypothesis, which suggests that females trade copulations for food, was refuted-because copulations-most often occurred without food transfers, especially outside the fertile period. (3) The female mate guarding of males hypothesis, which suggests that females distract their mates from other mating opportunities by copulating frequently, was rejected because extrapair copulation attempts were infrequent, male and female solicitation frequencies were similar and females did not differ in the timing or frequency of solicitations. (4) The mate assessment hypothesis,which suggests that assessment of mate quality is mediated via copulation, most closely predicted the behaviour observed since withinpair copulations were frequent outside the fertile period and at pair formation, males and females solicited similar numbers of copulations and pairs did not differ significantly in solicitation or copulation frequency. In line with this hypothesis we found that only one brood was extrapair, probably the result of mate replacement. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   CHOICE; REPEATABILITY; MODEL
AB Previous phonotaxis experiments in the tungara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus, indicated a permissiveness in female preference that allows sexually selected complex call characters to be replaced with various alternative characters. Although they prefer complex to simple calls, females as a group did not discriminate between several alternative complex characters appended to the simple conspecific call. However, these studies did not address the possibility that the apparent permissiveness in female preference occurred because of an averaging of population data. The observed patterns in female preference could result from all females finding a certain set of call variants equally attractive, or from a polymorphism in female call preference. To discriminate between these two alternatives,; consistency of mate choice was determined for three pairs of calls that elicited no phonotactic bias in population studies. Individual females did not repeatedly choose one stimulus of a pair over the other, demonstrating that the patterns of permissiveness observed in the population are paralleled by similar patterns within females. A broad preference for complex calls in the P. pustulosus species group would permit the evolution of sexually selected call variation through sensory exploitation.

ID INFORMATION; FLOCKS; CALIFORNIA
AB When two species have predators in common, animals might be able to obtain important information about predation risk from the alarm calls produced by the other species. The behavioural responses of adult yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, and golden-mantled ground squirrels, Spermophilus lateralis, to conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls were studied to determine whether interspecific call recognition occurs in sympatric species that rarely interact. In a crossed design, marmot and squirrel alarm calls were broadcast to individuals of both species, using the song of a sympatric bird as a control. Individuals of both species responded similarly to conspecific and heterospecific anti-predator calls, and distinguished both types of alarms from the bird song. These results indicate that both marmots and squirrels recognized not only their own species' anti-predator vocalizations, but also the alarm calls of another species, and that these vocalizations were discriminated from an equally loud non-threatening sound. These findings suggest that researchers ought to think broadly when considering the sources of information available to animals in their natural environment.

AB A female can usually obtain enough sperm to fertilize all her eggs from a single insemination, and copulation involves certain costs such as increased exposure to diseases and parasites. Why, then, do females of so many species routinely copulate with more than one male? A 7-year study of marked individuals provides an answer for 239 female Gunnison's prairie dogs (Sciuridae: Cynomys gunnisoni) living under natural conditions. The probability of pregnancy and parturition was 92% for females that copulated with only one or two males, but was 100% for females that copulated with at least three males. Further, litter size at weaning varied directly with the mother's number of sexual partners. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male canaries, Serinus canaria, sing a special phrase ('A') that elicits very high levels of sexual display in conspecific females. This phrase is characterized by the repetition of a complex but brief two-note syllable. We tested the sexual responsiveness of female canaries to these A phrases, extracted from eight male repertoires. Five of the phrases elicited very high levels of copulation solicitation displays in the females. We suggest that the females may use the very rapid temporal patterning of the distinct notes in these two-note syllables to assess male quality. These syllables maybe an honest indicator of a male's condition and may thus attract and arouse females. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Depending on the circumstances under which extra-pair mating occurs, theory makes opposing predictions about how reproductive synchrony should influence extra-pair paternity. This study investigated which sex initiated extra-pair mating in the yellow warbler, whether extra-pair behaviour and extra-pair paternity were related to reproductive synchrony, and whether synchrony affected the mating success of all males equally. Observations and captures of individuals making territorial intrusions indicated that males initiated extra-pair mating. Spatial patterns of male territorial intrusions and of extra-pair paternity were similar. Males' extra-pair activity was reduced when their social partner was fertile. More offspring were sired by the extra-pair male when the female nested asynchronously with that sire's social mate. Neither population-wide synchrony, nor synchrony with neighbours, however, seemed to predict the incidence of extra-pair parentage or the identity of the sire, indicating factors other than synchrony were also important. Males with more breast streaking (a plumage ornament) were more successful as extra-pair sires; and were least affected by the constraint of synchrony. Larger males were less often cuckolded, and achieved extra-pair success mainly when their partner was not fertile. Thus, male yellow warblers apparently use different mating tactics depending on their plumage and size. More generally, the results suggest how mating strategies are affected by which sex initiates extra-pair mating and by the relative contributions of within-pair and extra-pair paternity to total reproductive success.

AB Birds of many species intrude on to territories in order to obtain extra-pair copulations, and frequent within-pair copulations are thought to be a response to cuckoldry where mate guarding is not possible. Great skuas are colonial birds in which females are left alone in the breeding territory while males forage for the pair. Opportunities for cuckoldry are therefore numerous, and it could be predicted that sperm competition should be intense in this species. We tested several hypotheses that attempt to explain territorial intrusions by female great skuas. Few intrusions coincided with the main fertile period and extra-pair copulations were almost never solicited, and therefore the sperm competition hypothesis was rejected. Only 0.9% of the copulations observed (N=339) were extra-pair. Thus opportunity for cuckoldry is a very poor predictor of the intensity of sperm competition, in spite of the relevance given to this factor in the literature. Of three extra-pair copulations observed, two involved unpaired territorial males. This suggests that genetic benefits were not the aim of unfaithful females. All three were preceded by courtship feeding, while only 26% of within-pair copulations followed successful food begging. This statistically significant difference constitutes evidence for a trade of copulations for food in a monogamous bird. Evidence is presented supporting hypotheses that females intrude on to territories in order to induce males to give away some food, and to become familiarized with potential partners for future breeding seasons.

AB In the Mingan Islands, the whelk Buccinum undatum displays defensive manoeuvres to both contact and water-borne chemical cues from the predatory asteroid Leptasterias polaris. In spite of this, whelks occasionally aggregate in great numbers near L. polaris while it is ingesting a prey; they then attempt to steal food from their predator and also wait for leftovers. In this study, the response of whelks in different types of encounters with L. polaris was examined to test the hypothesis that whelks are sensitive to the magnitude of the threat their predator represents. In a field experiment, whelks consistently fled both non-feeding and feeding L. polaris (asteroids used were consuming small prey items that were unlikely to provide food for whelks). When current flow was stable, whelks fled more directly down current and more frequently displayed violent defensive behaviours, in response to non-feeding L. polaris, which presented a higher risk, than in response to feeding asteroids (lower risk; 47% versus 2%). Consequently, whelks tested with non-feeding asteroids more rapidly distanced themselves from the predators than did whelks tested with feeding asteroids. In a field survey, there were more active whelks in the vicinity of cruising (higher risk) than stationary (lower risk) L. polaris (53% versus 14%). Among those whelks that were active, defensive behaviour patterns such as shell rocking and leaping escape movements were frequently shown by whelks near cruising predators (69%), but never by whelks near stationary predators (0%). The discriminative capabilities apparent in these results are likely to be adaptive, because they enable whelks to limit the cost of escape responses while still keeping predation risk low, and also because they facilitate a close association with L. polaris from which the whelks receive feeding benefits.

AB In 1993-1995 artificial nests with attached model eggs were put into territories that were known to have been occupied by male great reed warblers, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, in previous years. Because the eggs were made of soft plasticine, predators left peckmarks in them and this enabled us to identify predators by comparing peckmarks with reference marks made by Various species. Previous field data had suggested that infanticidal behaviour existed in our study population, as nests of primary females suffered a three times higher rate of nest loss during the egg-laying period than nests of secondary and monogamous females. The presence of infanticide was supported by the experiment. Small peckmarks resembling those of a great reed warbler occurred almost exclusively in territories occupied by great reed warblers, in particular when a new female settled in the territory. The newly settled females built nests closer to depredated than non-depredated nests. That small peckmarks occurred when new females settled strongly suggests that it is secondary female great reed warblers that commit infanticide on eggs of primary females. Females of low harem rank are expected to gain from infanticidal behaviour because a low ranked female gets a higher proportion of male parental investment when the nest of the primary female fails.

AB The present study investigated two rarely measured aspects of inbreeding depression: the relationship between inbreeding and behaviour, and the possibility that inbred individuals that survive infancy may still suffer from inbreeding depression by failing to breed or failing to show appropriate mating or parental behaviours. Specifically, the relationship between (1) behaviour at pairing and reproductive success, (2) inbreeding and reproductive success and (3) inbreeding and pairing behaviour, was examined in two subspecies of the oldfield mouse, Peromyscus polionotus. Effects of parental and offspring inbreeding were separated through experimental design and analysis. Activity level during the first 25 days after pairing predicted future reproductive success: pairs that remained less active during the nocturnal (active) period were significantly less likely to breed than pairs that remained more active. Inbred females took significantly longer to produce their first litters and were less likely to produce litters than were outbred females, independently of whether females were related to their mates (i.e. whether their offspring would be inbred). Inactive pairs averaged fewer surviving pups than did active pairs. Inbreeding coefficient of female was a significant predictor of activity level in one of the two subspecies, suggesting that inbreeding may affect behaviour. Inbred adult females showed inbreeding depression in the form of lower conception rates and fewer surviving offspring, although the specific traits affected differed for the two subspecies. The implications for captive breeding programs, and likely causes of the subspecific differences, are discussed. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Infanticide by males in species with high maternal investment may be the most extreme example of a reproductive conflict of interests between males and females. The subsocial spider Stegodyphus lineatus is semelparous, and the offspring eat their mother. Male and female maturation overlap, such that late maturing males encounter females that are already guarding the single clutch. A late male may try to remove the existing egg sac, thereby forcing the female to replace the clutch and use his sperm to fertilize at least some of the eggs. Males were responsible for 33% of all the egg losses in a population of 278 females with eggs. By losing her clutch, the female loses time equivalent to the age of the lost clutch plus the time it takes to replace it. The earlier in the season a female lost a clutch and the younger the eggs were, the longer was the interval between clutch loss and clutch replacement. Females that lost their egg sacs by infanticide replaced them after a significantly longer time than females that lost their egg sacs from other causes. The time loss of 18.5 days on average corresponds to a 23% reduction in female survival probability. In addition to reduced survival, females suffered a fecundity cost: replacement clutches were smaller than the original clutches and the reduction in egg number was greater with increasing intervals between the first and second clutch. Females defended their egg sacs aggressively against males. In field tests, the outcome of fights between males and females was determined by the relative size difference of the contestants. The mating system of S. lineatus provides an example of a male mating strategy that evolved despite being very costly for the females. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many polygynous bird species, males allocate most of their parental effort to their primary females' broods. There are several hypotheses that may explain this: the relative reproductive value of the brood, the energetic demand of the brood, the genetic quality of the female and the certainty of fatherhood may all be higher for the primary females' broods. Since these parameters may covary in nature, experiments are necessary to determine their importance. Bigynous male European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, predominantly incubated the eggs and fed the nestlings of their primary females. In an experiment we altered the order in which the clutches hatched by exchanging the primary and secondary females' eggs before hatching. Even though experimental males mostly incubated their primary females' clutches, they predominantly fed the nestlings of the secondary female. Experimental males fed secondary females' nestlings significantly more than control males did. In fact, experimental males invested in their secondary females' broods to the same extent as control males invested in their primary females' broods. This result demonstrates that males use relative brood age to decide how to allocate their parental effort between their broods which has important implications for the evolution of the starling mating system.

AB Two cues (bill shape and vocalizations) that yellow warblers, Dendroica petechia, may use to recognize brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, were examined experimentally. Female yellow warblers responded more intensely to a control cowbird than one with a longer, thinner bill, which suggests that bill shape was an important cue in recognition. Responses involved close approaches, 'seet' alarm calls and sitting in the nest. Female yellow warblers distinguished between vocalizations of male and female cowbirds and those of a song sparrow, Melospiza melodia (control). They responded most intensely to female cowbird 'chatter calls' and least intensely to the sparrow song; responses to male cowbird 'perched song' were intermediate in intensity. The results suggest that female yellow warblers recognize cowbirds on the basis of bill shape and vocalizations. Furthermore, these results, coupled with previous findings, suggest that female yellow warblers distinguish between male and female cowbirds by vocalizations but not appearance.

AB Individual recognition implies that a subject has the ability to discriminate between familiar conspecifics on the basis of their idiosyncratic characteristics. In this sense it is likely to be a more complex process than other forms of social recognition which involve classification of conspecifics into broad categories such as group, sex, age, kinship and familiarity. Using a go/no-go discrimination procedure, this study showed that rats, Rattus norvegicus, are indeed able to recognize conspecifics as individuals. Once rats had learned to discriminate a pair of conspecifics, they showed positive transfer on a series of discrimination problems involving novel conspecifics as stimuli. Furthermore, on a reversal test, rats were able to retain the memory of the individual identity of conspecifics to which they were exposed for the first time for at least 24 h. Finally, using the individually distinctive odours of previously discriminated conspecifics in tests clearly demonstrated that rats perceive olfactory signatures as representations of known individuals. Taken together, these results provide evidence for true individual recognition in rats and invite further investigations to gain deeper insight into the cognitive processes used by rats to build up a representation of individual conspecifics.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article

AB Oral grooming is highly effective in removing ectoparasites in ungulates and other species. The programmed grooming model postulates that preventive oral grooming bouts are periodically activated by an internal timing mechanism (clock), with grooming rates modulated according to fitness costs and benefits. The 'body size principle' of the programmed grooming model, developed from interspecific comparisons, predicts that animals or species of smaller size, because they cannot tolerate as great a density of engorging ticks per unit of body surface area, will groom at a higher rate than those of larger size. Accordingly, within a species, young animals should groom at a higher rate than adults. The 'tick challenge principle' states that the rate of programmed grooming will be regulated as a function of tick bites such that animals will groom more frequently when tick exposure in the habitat is greater. These predictions were tested by comparing self-grooming rates of impala, Aepyceros melampus, lambs and their mothers at three study sites ranging from tick-dense to tick-sparse or tick-free. As predicted, newborn lambs from 1-5 weeks postpartum self-oral groomed at about three times the rate of their mothers, and young lambs 6-12-weeks-old self-oral groomed at least twice as frequently as maternal conspecifics; self-oral grooming rate of older (7-8-month-old) lambs was no different from that of adults. Presumably, the timing mechanism slowly changes its rate as impala mature, reflecting increased costs of self-oral grooming (attrition of the dental elements used in oral grooming and distraction from vigilance over predators) relative to declining body surface:mass ratio. Both lambs and their mothers consistently self-groomed at a higher rate at the tick-dense study site compared with the tick-sparse or tick-free sites. The results are in line with the concept that an intrinsic grooming clock is responsible for regulating body-size and tick-challenge specific grooming rates that enable impala to survive and thrive in a tick-infested environment.

ID MELANOGASTER; SELECTION; ENVIRONMENT; POPULATIONS; EVOLUTION; LINES
AB Previously, all of the major fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, chromosomes (I, II and III) have been shown to be associated with geotaxis, but the Y chromosome has not. Using two methods (back-crossing and chromosome substitution), Y chromosomes from lines that have evolved stable, extreme expressions of geotaxis were placed into different genetic and cytoplasmic backgrounds to test the resulting males for geotaxis. The results of the back-crossing do not support the interpretation of Y-chromosome effects on geotaxis. These tests do not have sufficient statistical power, however, to detect small genetic effects. In the chromosome substitution experiment, the geotaxis-line Y chromosomes were placed into high- and low-selected lines, Canton-S and Champaign wild-type backgrounds. The results of the chromosome substitution experiment provide evidence for a Y-chromosome effect on geotaxis in selected geotaxis lines, but not in wild-type stock, backgrounds. These results suggest that the Y chromosome has a small effect on geotaxis, whose detection depends on genetic and/or cytoplasmic background. The implications of these results are discussed for behaviour-genetic analysis of D. melanogaster and for issues of statistical power in detecting small genetic effects.

AB In ants permanent polygyny (the permanent presence of multiple reproducing queens) commonly arises secondarily through the adoption of daughter queens. Polygyny decreases the relatedness among nestmate workers and consequently the genetic benefits from helping close relatives. Hence, studies on nestmate recognition and queen adoption may shed light on how queen numbers are regulated as well as on causes of variation in queen number. In this study acceptance of nestmate and non-nestmate young queens in;monogyne (single queen) and polygyne colonies of the ant Formica truncorum was compared. Queen number varies in this species: in some populations colonies have a single queen (monogyne populations), whereas in others all colonies contain several functional queens (polygyne populations). Young queens introduced into the experimental colonies varied with respect to female origin (nestmate versus non-nestmate), dispersal prospects as reflected by wing status (wingless versus winged) and mating status (mated versus virgin): Monogyne and polygyne colonies differed in one fundamental way in their responses to introduced females. Workers of monogyne colonies, but not those of polygyne colonies, discriminated between nestmate and non-nestmate females. In both monogyne and polygyne colonies mated females were destroyed to a higher extent than virgin ones, largely independently of wing status. None the less, mated females may have a reasonable chance of becoming adopted in their natal colony both in monogyne and polygyne colonies. If so, the single-queen status of monogyne colonies may be retained by a high rate of female dispersal in combination with few intra-nidal mating opportunities. Polygyne colonies are characterized by both a low degree of female rejection and low levels of discrimination between nestmates and non-nestmates. Nevertheless, previous genetic and behavioural data on female dispersal suggest that the majority of new queens adopted into polygyne colonies are their own daughters.

AB Extra-pair paternity can influence mating systems by affecting the fitness costs associated with polygyny. Polygyny is disadvantageous to males when the time and energetic demands of multiple pairings decrease either a male's success at gaining extra-pair fertilizations or his ability to ensure paternity among harem members. In Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, on Kent Island, New Brunswick, Canada, multilocus DNA fingerprinting of 136 adults and young revealed substantial female infidelity: overall, 31 of 92 young (33.7%) in 15 of 24 nests (62.5%) were the product of extra-pair fertilizations. Male mating status was a strong predictor of paternity. Each of seven monogamous females produced at least one extra-pair offspring, but only six of 11 primary females (54.5%) and two of six secondary females (33.3%) were unfaithful. As a result, nearly 80% of the young in nests of polygynous males resulted from within-pair fertilizations, compared with only 40% of the young in nests of monogamous males, Kent Island Savannah sparrows are simultaneously polygynous, and the absence of paternity costs associated with polygyny is surprising. The observed pattern of paternity suggests the operation of female choice, although male control of parentage cannot be excluded. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB An experimental analysis of the movements of predator-approaching fish is presented. The experiments evaluated two competing hypotheses. (1) Predator-approaching fish play the game-theoretical strategy Tit for Tat. Alternatively, (2) the movements of predator-approaching fish superficially resemble Tit for Tat, because fish independently orient to a predator and simultaneously attempt to stay close together. Experimental subjects were mosquito fish, Gambusia affinis, approaching a green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus. Two experiments were performed. Experiment 1 replicated results of Milinski (1987) and Dugatkin (1991), showing that Gambusia come closer to a visible predator when a mirror is oriented parallel to their direction of travel. Experiment 2 attempted to separate the effects of common orientation and social cohesion in accounting for the frequency of Tit-for-Tat-like motions in pairs of predator-approaching Gambusia. Results of experiment 2 suggest that a simple additive combination of the effects of (1) social cohesion in the absence of a visible predator and (2) orientation to a visible predator in the absence of a visible companion can account for the observed frequency of Tit-for-Tat-like motions for pairs of predator-approaching Gambusia. It is concluded that predator approach in shoaling fishes is probably a simple by-product mutualism, rather than cooperation maintained by reciprocity in a Prisoner's Dilemma.

AB Recent work has demonstrated that pinyon jays, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus, can remember the locations at which they have seen conspecifics cache food. Pinyon jays are both highly dependent on cached food and live in large social groups. To examine the importance of food caching and social living for observational spatial memory, Clark's nutcrackers, Nucifraga columbiana, and Mexican jays, Aphelocoma ultramarina, were tested on the same spatial memory tasks as used with pinyon jays. Clark's nutcrackers are highly adapted for caching food and live alone or in family groups, and Mexican jays are non-specialized cachers that live in highly structured groups. In these experiments, Clark's nutcrackers performed poorly at relocating caches they had seen conspecifics create. Observer nutcrackers were significantly more accurate than expected by chance at one but not two days after cache creation. Caching nutcrackers were more accurate at recovering caches than were observers. In contrast, Mexican jay observers performed at above-chance levels on both intervals after cache creation and were as accurate during cache recovery as were caching Mexican jays. These results suggest that observational spatial memory could be common among corvids and that its degree of development may be influenced by group living.

AB Free-ranging baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, often give loud 'contact' barks when separated from other group members. Although these calls appear to function to maintain contact between widely dispersed animals, individuals apparently do not give contact barks with the intent of informing others of their location. Females are more likely to give a contact bark in the 5 min after they themselves have called than in the 5 min after another female has called. Playback experiments suggest that females primarily 'answer' their close relatives' contact barks when they themselves are separated from other females or at the end of the group progression.
